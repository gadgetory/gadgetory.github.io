review of Sony Playstation 1 now back in
the early 90s video gaming was a very
very different place back then if you
want to play a video game
more than likely you're going to go
ahead and either go ahead and grab your
Super Nintendo or your Sega Genesis
however as soon as the Sony Playstation
came around it really was a revolution
as far as just in so many different ways
and of course kicked off the extremely
successful PlayStation brand that
continues even to this day with the
PlayStation 3 so hey guys I'm waiting
you guys a four of you and tell you all
about the original PlayStation that
really kicked it all off one of the many
defining features of the original
PlayStation was that it actually did use
CDs for the games so this might not seem
like much today but if you take a look
at it even today we do use discs of
course they're either DVDs or blu-rays
in the case of the Xbox and the
PlayStation 3 but still is in this disc
format and that was a really big boost
because I mean back in the early 90s I
mean almost any game you want to play
was I'm going to be on a cartridge
similar to the Sega Genesis
now obviously you can tell there's a big
difference but one of the UH one of the
other differences was just in fact that
actually these cartridges cost quite a
bit of money to make because as you see
here you actually had the full plastic
shell it's not that where's the CD I
mean cost literally next to nothing to
add produce yeah I know before I get a
bunch of comments I do realize that the
Genesis did have was actually able to
have the Sega CD and use the CD games of
course that was a big difference you
know the the Genesis really didn't have
the power to fully utilize a CD you know
it was just basically filling you know
basically better music where's the
PlayStation one actually was able to go
ahead and use the CD format to its
fullest extent and actually you know
fill up with lots of really nice-looking
3d graphics I met a really good feature
about the PlayStation was the fact that
it actually used memory cards um so you
know again back in the day you really
didn't have memory cards or anything
like that and while actually obviously
we don't use memory cards today it's
still fortunate evolved into hard drives
which is a pretty nice feature and
actually the Xbox 360 release up until
very recently did actually have memory
cards on so the really cool thing about
the PlayStation was is that you go ahead
plug in a memory card play and save your
games and then all I have to do is just
take out the memory card go over to
maybe your friend's house or whatever
and pop it right in then that game would
remember exactly where you were which is
pretty cool deal back then take a look
around again you'll see
it was a fairly generic looking it
wasn't really all that stylish like some
consoles today but of course it didn't
look bad at all and you know still has
kind of a bit of a charm to it I'm so
taking a look at the front we do have
course have two memory card slots as
well as spots for two controllers I'm
turning it over on the sides you'll see
nothing but just a couple of really
large vents and on the original
PlayStation now I just take a look here
I'm you actually did have one port right
here which was behind this
not a whole lot utilized this port but
you know it was kind of there they
actually did remove it when they created
the ps1 there's that huh so we do have a
serial port right here as well as the
MOL the audio/video out and the power
Cape the top of it it's actually fairly
unique looking you do have to one very
large power button and I did that so
many times
of course the Open button to go ahead
and get into your CD and swap that out
and over here you do have just a pretty
simple reset something the the
PlayStation 1 had in common with current
consoles was that there were a ton of
different versions now the way you can
tell is obviously by just flipping it
over and you take a look at the model
number so for example this one is a 5501
um but the really the thing with the
original Playstations though was that it
was rarely was a big deal generally they
did make a lot of changes but almost
always these changes were pretty minor
you know they might have consisted of
you know maybe trying to block out
different kinds of mod ships which was a
pretty big issue in with the ps1 as well
as maybe you know changing out what kind
of disk drive etc etc but in general
pretty much any PlayStation show are
practically the same actually if we go
ahead and take a look here actually if
you go ahead and look down here you
actually see when when the console was
made so that's a really cool thing so
you can actually see here if you want to
know that we know maybe was made in 1995
now eight whatever you want so when
you're looking for to buy a PlayStation
is definitely paste button flip it over
take the model number doesn't so much
matter but take a look at when it was
made it's kind of interesting to know
the original PlayStation 1 was a really
really fantastic console it was one of
the most successful of all times only
really being beat out mainly by the
PlayStation 2 and it really did so many
things well I mean back in the early 90s
as a CD player of course this actually
was my first ever CD player you know it
had a lot of different features I had
really good graphics and it was really
ahead of its time and as such it did
really really tremendously well so I
really do recommend if you've never had
a Playstation one that won't go pick one
out they're dirt cheap these days
because Sony made so many millions upon
millions of them and they're really
really fun consoles to own and really
fun consoles to play however if you're
not really interested in them of course
you can go ahead and play ps1 games on
any kind of PlayStation 2 as well as any
kind of kind of PlayStation 3 so even if
you don't want to go out here and buy
one of these great consoles you can't go
ahead and get almost the exact same
experience by playing all the really
ports that are the games are cheap as
well you play all these games on any of
these really modern Playstations anyway
guys I hope you enjoyed the review
