of the mophie juice pack boost now this
is an external battery for your iphone
or your ipod and what just go through
some of the pros and cons because there
are a lot of good things with it there
are also some pretty bad things with it
so begin with let's just take a look at
the design I know it's a pretty small
device would just slide across here
you'll see it's a not too not too big
you know it's fairly thin fairly
lightweight easily you know able to go
ahead and slide into your pocket if you
can see here there's actually a ring of
soft touch plastic or maybe rubber
whatever but soft touch material all the
way around there's this you know kind of
a silver plastic it's kind of a little
cheap feeling but it's not terrible now
you do you have a few different things
here up front which I'll show you guys
that minute it's how to go ahead and
open up the 30-pin dock connector and go
ahead and close it back up on the bottom
here you do have a little ring where you
can put it on your keys perhaps although
I really couldn't can't see why you
would ever do that but I suppose this is
makes a little bit easier if you want to
carry it but again you want do do want
to be careful because this is not built
the best which i will get to in just a
second so flipping around on this side
you'll see it does have a micro USB port
this is solely used for charging the
battery itself you know it does come
with a USB cable and you know it charges
so right here you'll actually see if we
go ahead and click it on this shows the
battery indicator now basically what
this means is you know how full the
battery is there are four different LEDs
and as you're charging and everything it
will go ahead and they will flash
showing you just how bright and I mean
that helped right but how charge the
battery is one just show you guys the
top here you'll see that this is the
30-pin dock connector but there's also a
little LED light here so if we go ahead
and hold this button for just a moment
you'll see that we do have the loans a
pretty decent flashlight owner I don't
know how well you guys can see that but
it's it's not amazing or anything but
certainly good enough to go ahead and
yom get you find your way around or if
you need a real quick little flashlight
now while we're here let me go ahead and
show you one thing that I don't really
like which is pretty much the build
quality in general and that's clue sure
how you out you can hear but it's fairly
hollow mean it's lightweight but it
does not feel you know very whole hell
constructed I mean you know there's a
little bit of give when I press on it
and it just doesn't feel great and in
addition when i'll go ahead and see i'm
not so sure how well you guys can see
this but when you go ahead and pull this
in it just does not have the best action
coming out it's not too bad but i mean
if yeah i just i just really don't like
the way that that action works but it
hasn't broke yet um that's kind of a bit
of a deal breaker to be honest though
just because I mean yeah it really feels
like it's grinding it feels like it
won't be able to take too many of those
more of those before it does break so
that is definitely a pretty big downside
however there are some good things i do
want to go ahead and talk about so as
far as the battery itself goes it's
actually really quite good so connecting
it to my ipod touch here i'm going just
pull it into the shot catching it to my
ipod touch well just gave me absolutely
very very very fast charge times um you
know really to be honest like I had my
battery bout down to fifteen percent i
plug this in about Oh 30 minutes later
is up to about eighty percent so
extremely fast charging a lot faster
than what you probably will find in you
know if you just hook it up to your
computer so it's definitely a really
cool thing another thing I do like is
the portability of it you know it's it's
pretty lightweight um you know it
doesn't like I said it doesn't feel like
it could take a whole lot of abuse but
absolutely is really nice to go ahead
and just have in your pocket and you
know when you run out of battery during
the day plug it in for a few minutes and
you're good to go now there are actually
two versions of this this one is the one
with the fifteen hundred million power
battery me also get one with a thousand
million power battery the 1500 is good
for about well it's going to depend on
what ipod or iphone you have with my
ipod touch 4th generation it pretty much
bout matches the battery as close as i
can tell you know by you know like want
to run it all the way down charge it
fully up then it's pretty much this this
is going to be out of battery for iphone
you probably will get probably around
eighty percent charge which is not too
bad I'm however with a thousand milliamp
hour battery probably do quite a bit
less than that so overall I think this
is pretty cool now it is sixty dollars
and
just a little expensive for me just
based on the build quality alone now I
mean if this works just like they you
know if it works really well as far as
the build quality and the dock connector
I mean Alan so you guys heard that that
sounded terrible if it wasn't like that
I'll absolutely have no problems
recommending it even at the 60 odd price
point however as it is I really just
can't you know it's okay product it you
know it works you know as far as the
charging and time and the amount of
battery it works great however I mean
even a little flashlight that's just not
enough to go ahead and deal with the
pretty poor build quality however I do
want to go ahead and thank mophie for
going ahead and getting this to me for
review and yeah you can go ahead if you
are interested in more information check
them out in the description of this
video anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
