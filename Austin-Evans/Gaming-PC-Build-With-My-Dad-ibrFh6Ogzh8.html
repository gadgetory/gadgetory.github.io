with my dad and we're gonna build a PC
together
that's right so first up is the case
song I guess you know what a case is
right okay so open it up hey you did it
that's the wrong size so this is the
this is the build right so this is where
everything goes empty
yeah that's very empty so we're gonna
have to put everything in here right
this is like grab a power supply here
you have like hard drives and all kinds
of stuff always putting any salt drives
in so the only real rule for this is
that I can't touch anything you have to
do everything I can tell you how to do
it I can give you advice when you need
advice but you actually have to build
the computer I can't like you know help
you okay so do you know what this thing
is the same that you said power Superman
okay okay its power supply
do you know what this does the pair of
the whole computer yeah so this is
basically at the heart of the build
right so this takes the power from the
wall and it chops it up brings out onto
all these different cables and runs it
to the various parts that need it so
there's a little metal thing oh yeah
you're going to break something best so
now actually we're gonna go ahead and
set this aside for a second and get the
motherboard set up the motherboard is
basically what everything connects to
right so basically everything in this
entire build connects to the motherboard
in some way whether it's the CPU which
we've got right here's kinda like the
brains we've got the memory we've got
the drive we've got graphics like pretty
much everything attaches to the
motherboard so this is not an unboxing
yeah okay don't that's copyrighted so
it's pretty simple so basically right
now I will go ahead and just take that
push that arm down and uh yeah pull it
back so this is a core i3 4130 so since
this is gonna be your computer you do
like a ton of gaming it's very open so
since you don't do a ton of gaming we
don't anything too crazy but this is
this is a really solid like mid-range
improve gran turismo is on playstation
but i guess you go around like an
emulator or something so there's two
pieces here there's that's the heatsink
that's gonna go on top of the seat here
there you go yeah so basically all you
do is ya pull that back a little bit you
want to get make sure that's underneath
the little screw go ahead and pull the
arm back yeah and it's gonna take a lot
of force don't don't be afraid to boom
see if you install that was easy
no next is the memory this is even
easier I push it yeah basically kind of
get it seated and then press evenly on
both sides to kinda live down alright so
now we need to go ahead and put the
heatsink on the CPU right but it's not
quite that simple so typically these
have a little bit of thermal paste on
the on the bottom and you just literally
clip it in nowhere because I've reuse
this we need to add more thermal paste
you want what you want to do is you want
to put about the size of grain of rice
right square little there yeah it's not
too bad pretty sad looking grant of rice
but it'll work when you set it down you
need to be careful because when you sit
down it flattens that thermal paste
mm-hmm so when you set it down just be
gentle with it and then you want to push
each one of those pins into place no
click there yeah that's one I do it do
on this corner you want to do yeah you
want to cross tighten there you go good
job
the mother word is actually all done
though so there are six holes on this
motherboard you want to line those up
with the brass standouts that are
already included in the case now what I
would do is I would just set it down
roughly and of where it's supposed to be
don't worry about you'll push it
sideways so bring it all the way down
and then bring sideways oh wow you lined
up perfect most things in a PC build yes
you know I put all the screws Hedden
your ship all the screws in but a
missing one or two so this bicycle I
mean it's got like four screws left
you're fine I'm worried about it alright
so basically you wanna make sure the
motherboard doesn't shift as you put the
screws in actually well don't mind if
really well if you are you holding out
on me right now have you actually built
a PC before you're going way too fast
here I expected this to take like an
hour and have no idea what you're doing
like the bows almost done you just like
you know
deal so you actually don't need a
graphics card for this film you could
actually completely ignore it but you're
not really gonna have power for gaming
and I don't like I don't know how much
game you're gonna actually do but this
will allow you to do some fairly decent
gaming oh you mean gaming where you're
doing all those crazy maybe you don't
either guys what do any of those things
do okay what is it HDMI formed yeah
there you go
eg screws so that's the graphics card
installation it's really simple right
you do need the screws but you need to
you know power it up but I mean it's
it's simple right you just literally
click it in alright so the graphics
cards installed good job
alright now we'd install the SSD take
the SSD and just yeah make sure that you
have those four screw holes lined up and
I would do one on each corner and I
would only put two and it's no big deal
yeah you could even do it like that
you're not supposed to but we're cutting
corners cuz you know now that you have
the SSD installed all the main parts are
actually here so you've got your power
supply which was super easy
got your CPU your heatsink memory
motherboard graphics card everything in
here and listen forgetting something in
which I will be really embarrassed now
we were actually we're actually good
right now now the next step and the
really fun one is wiring that goes into
your SSD and it goes into the flat end
so that you see the bigger one yeah it's
not so it only goes in one way and just
slide it in
there's no click so you just have to
push it in yep that's it done the last
thing that should really need to be
connected now is to power the graphics
cards so you see that the thing right
there grab one of the leads it's a six
pen it's actually a six plus two so that
one right there this is not a great case
for cable management but the most
important thing is it doesn't have to be
pretty cuz there's no window or anything
as long as there's not like a ton of
stuff in the way of like a man's fans
right and it's not completely crazy like
you're fun so this is actually very much
done so we have the fans connected we
have the CPU power we have motherboard
power graphics card power SSD power
we've got memory installed we've pretty
much got everything good so now before
we kind of you know when you take like
the electrical ties and
at tying all the kind of stuff to get it
put together but we don't even do that
yet oh I just tuck that in let's go grab
a monitor and see if this thing actually
turns on all right the build is here
we're all done the monitor keyboard
mouse everything's set up the moment of
truth doesn't actually turn on power
buttons right there give it try good
saying oh okay
after a quick cable check let's try this
again all right color button sir let's
try this Oh what Oh Skippy they're
singing they decided to reboot oh I'd
like to hear that sound okay now in the
on screen oh yes now that you built a
computer what do you think like was it
easier harder like compared to what
you've obviously seen videos and stuff
what does it feel like to actually have
just built your first computer pretty
simple yeah somebody might you can build
it anybody all right so you guys enjoyed
this video of me and my dad building a
computer definitely be sure to subscribe
the channel
and I or we or someone will catch you in
the next one all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
