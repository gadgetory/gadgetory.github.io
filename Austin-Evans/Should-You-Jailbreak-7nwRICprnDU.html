here with a video talking about
jailbreak is it even worth it I recently
took a trip out to San Francisco for
jailbreak con 2014 where I got to catch
up with Steven DeFranco better known as
I hate snow the maker of jailbreak such
as snow breeze I actually got into
jailbreaking by like my first iPod touch
which was back in 2009 it's really hard
to define what a jailbreaking actually
is to the normal person the most easiest
explanation you can probably give
something like the ability to customize
the uncustomed I suppose
essentially when you jailbreak an iPhone
iPod or iPad you're removing Apple's
restrictions on what you can and can't
do with your device on Android for
example you can download launchers which
basically allow you to customize the
entire look and feel of your phone
straight from the Play Store on the
other hand with iOS if you really want
to tweak and customize you're
essentially going to have to jailbreak I
also have winterboard powering this
phone and it's actually using certain
axes latest named iris and it's
basically a lot of people say it's iOS 7
done right which in a way it is it's it
puts more focus on the icons and how
which actually should be with when it
comes in stock with iOS 7 so it makes
the user experience much much better
there's more to it than just changing
the look though jailbreaking can also
add new features so I like to use a
tweak called avi which basically allows
me to do many things one of the most
useful things that it does is actually
quick compose right from the
notification center where you can just
pull it down and then just start writing
to a friend of yours so one tweak that
is actually not very popular is actually
called dimmer where it allows me to dim
the display even more than what it would
with stock see right now it looks like
it's off but when you're in bed and
you're basically trying to use your
phone you don't want this thing blasting
at you while I balance between iOS and
Android these days something a lot of
you guys might not know is that in the
early days of my channel I actually
focused a lot on jailbreaking it's
definitely come a long way in the last
few years however Apple is absolutely
stepped up their game on actually trying
to crack down and make me a lot more
difficult the grip that Apple is getting
nowadays with exploits and stuff like
that they're things are getting close on
more frequently and a lot more holes and
so it makes things more difficult and
which is why the waiting period is a lot
longer sometimes and nowadays
jailbreaking iOS is like dindt than
gravity's and the Attic so face is quite
really short on iOS and is slow
they don't mind innovation that they
admire innovation in fact that's what
they go by what they do not like about
jailbreaking is the risk that comes with
it with opening up the device mainly
security wise these days there's
basically one new major jailbreak year
so because of the way that Apple does
things if you decide to update your
firmware you're pretty much out of luck
until the next jailbreak comes out I'm
really curious to know do you guys
jailbreak a root on your Android or iOS
devices I'd love to hear why or why not
as well there definitely some cool
things that you can do when you
jailbreak a root there are also some
downsides so definitely be sure to let
me know what you guys think in the
comments below
also I've got to give a big shout out to
Steven as well as Craig from jailbreak
con probably pull this video together
anyway guys thank you so much for
watching and I will catch you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
