video going over what to expect on the
new iPhone 5 now every year this new
iPhone shouldn't be any big surprise at
this point however this year has been a
little different as pretty much
everything is leaked to start with let's
go over the biggest change which is
going to be the screen
ever since 2007 Apple's had the exact
same 3.5 inch size display on all the
iPhone models however for 2012 it looks
like they're going to be upping that to
a 4 inch screen what this means is that
the screen is going to be a bit taller
so this is going to give you another row
of icons on your home screen and that's
going to have a little bit more room to
work with basically just kind of sum it
up it's gonna be the same size but just
taller don't you like that incredibly
advanced diagram the iPhone also gets an
all new design now I say all new when
it's actually kind of similar to the 4
and 4s however there are some pretty
major changes so for starters it's going
to be thinner so not by a huge amount
however I hate thinner is always better
on top of that you're also going to get
a few tweaks up front so for example the
FaceTime camera is going to be raised up
a little bit it also should be upgraded
to HD finally now probably the biggest
change is when you flip it a phone over
on its back so there's not going to be a
large bit of aluminum in the middle with
just a little bit of glass on the top
and bottom now personally I'm a little
bit on the fence on this one I think it
looks a little bit weird it doesn't look
anywhere near as clean as the another
kind of normal giant sheet of glass that
they put on the back of the phones but
on the other hand it's really easy to
break I'm sure if any of you guys have
ever owned an iPhone 4 or 4s you've got
to keep the case on there and got to be
really careful as it's a giant piece of
glass I mean that's not all that hard to
break it also looks like apples doing
away with the 30-pin cable now a lot of
people aren't happy with this change but
honestly I don't care I just don't think
it's a big of a deal I mean of course if
you have an iPod dock or you have a
bunch of 30-pin cables around it might
suck but I'm sure there's going to be an
adapter so you don't have to just throw
all your old stuff away this is gonna
give you more room on the phone to have
you know microphones and buttons and
other fun stuff there going to be
internal changes as well so for example
the processor will be upgraded so
whether they call it the a6
or the a5 X xx weight whatever they
decide to call it it definitely should
have a new processor more likely it'll
still be dual-core but it'll have a
higher clock speed and take up less
power technology's cool like that beyond
that it definitely should have LTE as
well and again this should not be a
surprise to anybody LTE is pretty much
included on every major new phone these
days
so when can you get your hands on the
new iPhone well all signs are pointing
towards September 12th as the day that
Apple announces it and more likely will
go on sale somewhere around September
21st
anyway I'm curious to know what do you
guys think about the new iPhone at first
glance I really wasn't all that excited
it just looked like another iPhone no
big deal however the more we see it
actually seems to be a pretty solid
update of course that bigger screen is a
big help the iPhone is honestly needing
a bigger screen for a while it's also
got LTE better internals a better design
it's all pretty solid but again
definitely very curious to know what you
guys think in the comments below if you
enjoyed this video definitely be sure to
leave it a thumbs up and if you're
