detailing some of my favorite tips and
tricks for both buying and selling used
video games now as some of you will know
I'm a big collector well I wouldn't say
I'm a big collector I don't have that
big of a collection but I enjoyed buying
older cool video games such as you know
for the Super Nintendo the ps1 etc etc
etc and I think I've found quite a few
decent tips especially if you're just
now getting into it as it might be
really helpful if you're just wanting to
go ahead and start your own video game
collection so I'm gonna go and break
this up into two parts first part is
going to be from cartridge based games
second part is gonna be four CD based
games most of us know most of these tips
do apply both ways but there are a few
different things that you might want to
pay attention to so anyway the first
thing is is that more than like we're
going to be buying it off eBay eBay
don't get me wrong is a great place you
can go ahead and find all kinds of great
over games that you normally would never
be able to find and usually for not that
too bad of a price however one thing is
when you're buying stuff online and
indeed this just is general advice in
general is the pay attention to what
you're actually buying so take for
example the Super Mario World cartridge
looks really good you know it's it
doesn't look like it's got a lot of
scratches on it and you know you've got
the label all that kind of good stuff
you know if I saw a picture of this on
eBay you know we look pretty good
however if this was the only picture you
got you probably would not be able to
see something like this totally cracked
up in the bottom so that's something
you're definitely going to need to keep
in mind if you're buying from eBay or
some other stores be sure they include a
lot of pictures a good description a lot
of information because really the more
information that you get in general it's
gonna be the better you're gonna get a
better product and get a better game you
know all that kind of good stuff now
let's move on to cartridge based games
with boxes now in general when you buy
something the more complete it is the
better so you can find a cartridge based
game with a box that's absolutely going
to increase the value both if you're
buying or selling now there are
different things that will kind of
influence you know how much money you'll
be able to get or have to pay so it does
take for example this space invaders
Super Nintendo cartridge so as you can
see here the box
it's decent shape obviously it's not
not terrible but there's definitely some
damage here if you take a look over here
it's kind of a little dented up and
everything uh this is not a huge deal
and the box is definitely nice to have
but the less you have it's gonna go
ahead and hurt the value so in fact if I
open this up find that this is kind of
been busted up some you will find that
the cartridge is a-ok all the way around
but the box is kind of important there
are no instruction manuals or any of the
original paperwork again the game is
intact the game is in good condition and
that should be 90% of what you're
looking at
however for that added bonus if you can
include anything else that had to do
with the game absolutely do so as it
will help the value in fact somebody go
ahead and just show you guys here this
would be a example of something that
would be a little bit better now this is
a battleship cartridge it looks about
the same however the box is in better
shape I do keep in mind a lot of these
older boxes obviously it could be 10 15
20 years old I might have some things
and scratches on it but overall if it's
in good shape no major dents or anything
and in fact if you can get it the sealed
copy that's gonna be much better but
usually steel copies of games are way
more expensive um but as you can see
here this is even better as it includes
just pull this out it includes the
original paperwork as well as the Box in
pretty decent condition so we've got the
original booklet we have instructions
um again not a necessity but it really
does help the value when there's more
there and general the more you can
include the more you can get or sell it
for it's just going to help out with the
value ok so let's move on to CD based
games now this is a little bit different
although do keep minds a lot of the
previous things that I said still
applies however there are some
differences so this is kind of an
example of something that you're not
really gonna want to look for so this is
just an Xbox game just quite for just a
bonus disc but you can see this is
definitely not the original case on fact
it's got some game exchange run from
Oklahoma
so this is definitely not the original
package and it's kind of a little bit
beat up now again I do want to stress
that the packaging isn't everything but
especially with this base games you know
you really want to take a look as you
guys can see here it looks pretty decent
but if you know if you get an old busted
up package here you're definitely gonna
wanna
sort of picture of the you know the back
of it make sure there's no major
scratches or whatever that will
definitely help you out now more than
likely you're going to find a better a
little bit better buy a package so you
can see here here's just a xbox 360 game
grid now this is pretty much what you're
gonna wanna look for that should look as
new as possible especially if it's
something you know from a new console
like the Xbox 360 or ps3 something like
that so you know you're gonna want the
cover art it's better if it's not you
know just print it out and kind of looks
a little bit bad even if you open it up
of course you're gonna want to see the
disc and again you're gonna want to see
it in good condition but you're also
gonna want to get as many of the paper
as much of the paperwork as possible
same thing applies it's really nice to
have these instruction manuals some of
the kind of cool little tidbits here you
can take a look at so that's about it
now obviously a lot of stuff only
applies to on eBay or online if you have
a local video game store that you like
to buy your stuff from you know you're
gonna have some it's gonna be a little
bit easier for you on several ways for
example if a game you get and maybe the
disc is scratched or the cartridge
doesn't work all the times you'll be
able to just swap it out for a new and
usually video game stores are pretty
good about that
I'm however on eBay and other stores
like that it is a huge hassle to try to
return sometimes they don't even let you
do it so you definitely want to go ahead
and pay attention you don't want to just
throw your money in just anybody you
want to do a little bit of research to
make sure the thing does work make sure
the person does have a good score good
feedback and of course if there's a
return policy that's going to be really
good especially if you go ahead and pay
some top dollar for some different games
anyway guys if you enjoyed this and
helped you out if you're just starting
collecting hopefully this did on be sure
to leave me a comment below letting me
know and if you guys are interested
we'll go ahead and do a separate video
all about consoles because obviously you
know some people like to call it
consoles as well so you guys interested
in another video about the console just
let me know anyway guys thanks for
