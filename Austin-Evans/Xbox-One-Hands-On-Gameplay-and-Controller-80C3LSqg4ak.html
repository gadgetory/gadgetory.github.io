here with the hands on of the Xbox one
live from e3 to start with we have the
console itself which is actually pretty
nice looking in person it's got a split
design with glossy plastic and vents
along with the blu-ray disc drive one
thing that surprised me was just how big
the console is not only compared to the
new Xbox 360 but even the ps4 is a fair
bit smaller where the Xbox has no
problems is with the controller they've
largely left it alone from the 360 with
the same basic layout which is
definitely a good thing once you start
using it you'll notice it feels a bit
lighter than the old controller and
there are new menu and view buttons
which replace the old start and select
the thumb sticks have been lightened up
a bit along with the majorly improved
d-pad something I really liked was the
redesign triggers and bumpers not only
do they feel better but there are new
impulse of vibrating motors and the
triggers which can give more feedback
the entire controller is just better
than the already excellent 360
controller which is definitely awesome
to see Kinect has also seen a redesign
and it's now bundled along with every
Xbox one from the demos it seems to be
much improved
Helder a lot of what you'll be using it
for is voice controls Microsoft is also
heavily pushing smart glass on phones
and tablets for giving you extra content
in games for example maps calling it's
important more which is a nice addition
if not all that necessary graphics wise
the Xbox one is a huge step up from the
practically ancient current gen consoles
one of the best looking games from e3 is
Ryse son of Rome from Crytek which lets
you play as a Roman general and nicely
demos the massive levels and amount of
characters that you'll start seeing in
next-gen games a nether launch title is
Dead Rising 3 which is a great-looking
open-world zombie game which again shows
tons and tons of AI on screen at once
for driving games the Xbox has Forza 5
which looks like a ton of fun and has
some incredibly detailed car models the
Xbox one is down on raw power versus the
ps4 but both are still much closer to
having a gaming PC than ever while there
are definitely issues with the Xbox such
as a complicated game sharing policy and
needing to connect online every 24 hours
it's also got some awesome games coming
out including a new Halo what do you
think of the Xbox one definitely be sure
