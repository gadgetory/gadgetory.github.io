quickly expanding and today Nvidia
jumped into the space with the new
Nvidia shield you've got to give them
credit this is one interesting looking
piece of hardware it's made of aluminum
with the subtle green LED up front and
an origami like shape everywhere else
it really doesn't look like anything
else out there no matter which way you
look at it tucked around back is a small
vent to keep the shield cool and even
though there is a fan Nvidia claims it
should be almost completely silent out
of the box it comes with 16 gigabytes of
storage but you can expand this with a
micro SD card or an external drive using
one of the USB 3 ports there is also
hdmi 2.0 onboard which is important
because the shield fully supports 4k
something that even the ps4 and Xbox one
can handle yet as the first device to
run Android TV and 4k this is mostly
useful for watching video but the entire
interface runs at full resolution and it
theoretically even supports 4k gaming
this is thanks to the Tegra x1 inside
that sports an 8 core processor and 256
core Maxwell GPU which is a cut down
version of NVIDIA GTX 980 desktop card
to put this in perspective the Tegra x1
is over twice as powerful as the Xbox
360 with six times the memory and eating
only one-fifth the power putting this
all together one of the first titles for
the shield is Crysis 3 yeah this thing
is no joke they showed an early
multiplayer demo on stage so while this
is a little way out the fact that it
runs Crysis should say a lot they also
showed off several other games including
doom 3 and Borderlands the pre-sequel
which should be available at launch
Borderlands in particular is a good
example of how the shield matches up
with consoles and other Android titles
like portal and half-life 2 are also
going to be available on top of the
native games Nvidia unveiled their grid
streaming service there will be two
monthly subscription tiers that give you
access to a game library and an option
to buy new titles like Batman Arkham
Knight and The Witcher 3 the day they
come out as with all games streaming
this is mostly based on your internet
connection to run games at 720p 30fps
you'll need between 5 and 15 megabits
per second and if you want full 1080p at
60fps you're going to need a beefy
connection in the neighborhood of 15 to
50 Meg's down if you've got decent
internet
perience is pretty impressive there's a
slight amount of lag but it's much
better than other options I've tried and
should be good enough for all but the
most twitchy of games tying everything
together is the shield game controller
it's a bit on the bulky side but it's
reasonably comfortable and supports
audio if you want to listen to your game
or media over headphones this is going
to be included with the shield when it
launches in May for $200 which is more
expensive than other Android TV options
but you are getting a lot here so what
do you guys think about the new Nvidia
shield let me know in the comments below
