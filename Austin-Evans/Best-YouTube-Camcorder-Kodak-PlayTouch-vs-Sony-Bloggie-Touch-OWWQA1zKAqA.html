between two of the best pocket
camcorders for YouTube the kodak play
touch and the Sony Bloggie touch let's
start with what you get with each
camcorder the Bloggie touch comes in a
very minimalist apple light box and only
comes with the camera a female-to-male
USB cable and a lanyard strap codec is
much more generous with the play touch
with HDMI RCA AV and microUSB cables USB
power adapter lanyard battery and a
carrying pouch taking a closer look at
each camera you'll find that there are
some pretty major differences the
Bloggie touch features a very well built
and nice-looking design and features
four or eight gigabytes of internal
storage with no SD card slot as well as
a non removable battery the front is all
brushed metal with the 37 millimeter F
2.8 autofocus lens in front of the 12
megapixel sensor a mini HDMI port on
bottom power button as well as the
shutter button on top in the tripod
mountain flip-out USB arm on the right
side of the camcorder the Play Touch has
a largely plastic construction which
just isn't a match for the sony on the
other hand it works with normal SDHC
memory cards and has a removable battery
which can be a big plus
size-wise it's nearly identical with the
kodak being just a little bit wider
overall up front you'll find the 33
millimeter
44 millimeter at 1080p F 2.8 autofocus
lens with a 5 megapixel sensor mono
microphone and an IR receiver for an
optional remote on the left side of the
camera you'll find the 2.5 millimeter AV
out and behind the flat the mini HDMI
micro USB for charging and a flip-out
USB arm for syncing the quality of the
arm didn't give me much confidence so I
stuck to using the SD card to offload
media instead up top there is a combo
microphone headphone jack in the macro
mode switch on the right side is the
power button an SD card slot with the
tripod mount on bottom the Bloggie touch
is a nice weight to it and feels like a
very premium product all the way through
from the feel the buttons to the
assuredly solid USB arm the bank
features a 288,000 dot 3-inch 16 by 9
touchscreen and record button the
display is very bright and tends to make
your video look overexposed on the
camera however once you offload it
you'll find that it looks just fine test
responsiveness is also quite good not on
the level of a high-end smartphone but
it's absolutely fine for a camera DUI
largely stays out of your way
disappearing for the most
part while filming with the exception of
the zoom slider the play touch well not
quite as nice as the Sony still isn't
half bad in build quality Department
around back is a 230,000 dot three inch
touchscreen which feels remarkably
similar to the Sony with good
responsiveness and accuracy
what isn't as nice is the fact that
while shooting video only a small
portion of the screen is actually used
which is a shame the UI takes up the
majority of the screen and while it's
laid out quite well it really makes the
nice screen become a bit of a waste
using the Bloggie touches a bad as
simple as it gets
press the on/off button and within a
couple of seconds you'll be shooting
video or stills video is recorded with
the red button below the screen and
pictures are taken with the top shutter
button the ergonomics are quite good
overall allowing you to hold it in
landscape orientation and take photos
with the excellent shutter button that
allows you to have press to focus just
like a normal camera it also sports an
orientation sensor allowing you to
rotate to portrait or landscape modes an
issue with this is that the tripod mount
for the Bloggie touches on the bottom of
the camera forced me to take ugly
vertical video unless you have a tripod
that can rotate it on the side just like
the Bloggie touch the codec is very
simple to use but has some additional
features with the quick presses the
power button the camera boots up and is
ready to go the record button below the
screen will film video or take a photo
depending on the mode with little delay
unlike the Bloggie you are meant to hold
and use the camera and portrait
orientation which works quite well and
side steps any issues with shooting
video in the wrong orientation video
quality is solid on the Bloggie touch it
features 1080p at 30 frames per second
as well as 720p at either 30 or 60
frames video and the play touch isn't as
good while it can also shoot 1080p at 30
frames per second as well as 720p in 30
or 60 the video seems to be more heavily
compressed
all right so I'm now recording using the
kodak play touch now the conditions are
really pretty good this is what I was
just filming with my Nikon I've got my
studio lights on either side of me above
me as well as behind me so plenty of
light I am using the inboard microphone
on the play touch so I'm not you know
utilizing the external microphone yeah
I'll give you guys a quick demo so I've
got to pull my Nikon close here you guys
will see we won't be able to focus
automatically but if I switch into macro
mode and pull it in nice and close you
guys will be able to see actually looks
really quite nice it's really quite nice
in macro mode probably even see if I
pull it close enough see through it but
uh hey guys go this is a quick quality
test of the codec play touch alright so
I'm not recording using the Bloggie
touch now everything is the exact same
same lighting saying you know sound
environment same all that stuff and
you'll notice a couple of major
differences the first of which is that
it is a much wider field of view so as
opposed to the codec which you guys see
it was a little bit more zoomed in this
as by default does have a wider angle
lens in addition to that if I go ahead
and pull the camera up nice and close
you should be able to say that it will
autofocus not too bad yeah and I would
say that is pretty close to the camera
that is really quite close to the camera
so anyway guys it's been a quick test of
the Sony Bloggie touch overall each
camera has its strengths with current
pricing just over $100 the play touch is
a solid choice if you're looking for a
camera that will spend most of its life
on a tripod with an external microphone
connected the Bloggie touch certainly
isn't perfect and probably isn't a good
choice if you need features like an
external mic swap a little battery SD
card slot and easy to use tripod mount
over for roughly $150 for the four
gigabyte model I find hard to recommend
anything else but the Sony Bloggie touch
