money on a gaming PC meet the boson and
see what you can do for just three
hundred dollars I've done a lot of
gaming PC builds and people are always
asking for cheaper and cheaper options
now well it's totally possible to build
yourself a computer for very cheap
however the gaming part of gaming PC is
kind of important
with the boson you're looking at a $300
PC that's not only very easy to build
but it can also handle nearly any game
you throw at it jump into BioShock
Infinite and we're looking at a totally
playable 41 frames per second on medium
at 720p move over to grid 2 and you can
notch the settings up to medium at 1080p
and still get just over 36 FPS with
League of Legends you can keep the
graphics maxed at 1080p and still see
frame rates in the 40s with occasional
dips into the 30s
minecraft also works fine as long as you
turn the render distance down a bit
popping vsync on can help smooth things
out as well finally run the boson
through the 3d mark firestrike benchmark
and you'll see it stacks up fairly well
against many of my much more expensive
builds now don't expect to crush games
at 4k with the boson however most games
are perfectly playable at 720p or even
1080p in some cases powering the build
is AMD's new Athlon 5350 APU this
features a quad-core CPU clocked at just
over 2 gigahertz hardly something to
blow you away but it's enough for most
games it also contains decent onboard
graphics which while we aren't using
them for this build
if gaming really isn't your priority you
could actually skip the dedicated
graphics card and bring the entire price
of the boson down to less than $250
speaking of the graphics card the Asus
Radeon r7 240 is what turns the boson
into an actual gaming PC with 2
gigabytes of ddr3 memory and a single
slot low power package the 240 gives
quite a bit more gaming performance to
the build Perry with our APU the r7 240
strikes a nice balance between
performance and price putting it all
together we have a gigabyte a.m. 1m s2h
motherboard like most am-1 boards you
won't find a lot of extra features
although you do have a pair of SATA 3
ports along with two USB 3.0 ports built
in one nice thing about this build is
that while the Apple on 5350 is the
APU for this platform at the moment it
should support future upgrades of even
faster APU is a little later on from
memory we're using four gigabytes of
Crucial Ballistix port memory quality at
1600 megahertz this is the fastest stuff
our build supports out of the box and
should be enough for most any game the
boson can handle like the APU though you
can feel free to upgrade this to eight
or even 16 gigabytes of RAM later on
with one terabyte of capacity the
Seagate Barracuda harddrive gives you
plenty of storage for games pictures
video and whatever else you want to keep
on your PC one of my favorite parts of
building your own computer is that you
can customize basically everything and
the hard drive is no exception so if you
like you can always add a second hard
drive to the build or even an SSD if you
like for the case we're using a roswell
FBM a1 this is a micro ATX chassis with
a front 120 millimeter fan and an 80
millimeter exhaust fan around back
you've also got the usual things like
USB and audio jacks up front along with
a built-in 450 watt power supply I
usually don't like to use power supplies
built into cases however since the
entire boson only requires just over 60
watts at load it should be just fine
all together for $300 you're getting a
killer little gaming build of course
prices change all the time so I will
have a link in the description which
goes over all the different parts of the
build also I did a full tutorial showing
you step-by-step how to put the entire
boson together from scratch so if you
guys won't see that that link will also
be in the description of this video
anyway guys I've got to give a huge
shout-out to audible for making this
video possible audible.com is a leading
