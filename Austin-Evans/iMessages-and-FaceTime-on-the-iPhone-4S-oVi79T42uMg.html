of eyeness jizz and face time running on
the iPhone 4s so to help me with this
video today we'll have my good friend
Adam also known as tech tech man TV here
on YouTube so to start with let's go
ahead and open up a FaceTime call so to
do that you need to open up your phone
application you need to come over to
contacts now of course you're going to
need the information of the person who
you want to do a FaceTime call with so
if it's on another iPhone you're going
to need the phone number or if they're
on a I pod touch they're on an iPad or a
Mac you're going to need their email
address that they use to sign up with
FaceTime with alright so this is the
demo of a FaceTime call so this is Adam
you want to say hi alright so there are
a couple of features when you're going
to FaceTime call though it's really
pretty obvious so yeah there are some
things down here on the bottom so if I
click this it is now I muted so he has
no idea what I'm saying so we can tell
all the things we want to talk about
Adam now I can't hear us okay hi you can
also in the call if you want or you can
flip to the back facing camera so you
want go ahead and demo that Adam and
with the iPhone 4s the rear-facing
camera is pretty good so there we go get
an internet sixth oak ruse and us a nice
yeah now is the autofocus work and
FaceTime hmm that's interesting but it
doesn't really matter too much it's not
like oh yeah that's a good point that's
a good point
speaking of the window you guys see
there I didn't right now if I want I can
swipe it over here
you put in any of the four corners so I
know I want to make sure it doesn't
cover up someone's face now of course
we'll go ahead and show it online we can
go ahead and flip over to the back
facing camera and you can also rotate it
so is he here there he goes and
landscape we can put it into portrait
and make sure it's actually picking it
up I'll say yo guys that's a quick demo
of FaceTime guys so now I'm setting
Austin a text message so I am sending
you a text message and I just sent it it
says it says deliver did you get the
text yes I did and I can go ahead and
reply hi
alright so I see him typing now so if
you guys can see my little
trouble is it's because I'm talking AB
setting attacks mm-hmm and which pretty
well if you can see those read receipts
and she's got it and you should see that
I that it's sent in that I actually got
it so that's about it and we also attach
an image if we want so we click on the
little camera icon here we can choose
existing and I'll just find we just find
photo library and just send him this
wallpaper of mine and here's the
wallpaper and see how long that takes to
send oops so of course it does work
pretty similarly to you know standard
messaging of all of course this is using
I messages as opposed to using texting
or anything like that but do you get did
you get it I did not get it all right
just as vanilla and got it here's the
wallpaper alright so anyway guys it's
going to be about it for our demo of
face time as well as eye messages on the
iPhone 4s so I think I'll go ahead
yourself a quick shout-out
