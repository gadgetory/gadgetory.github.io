video showing you how to jailbreak on
iOS for now guys before we began there's
a lot of disclaimers I got to give you 4
1 guys this is not out for all jailbreak
I mean for all devices and two is an up
course iOS four is not fully out yet
okay so let me roll through what you
need okay now you need either windows or
mac it is out for both and you will need
either an ipod touch 2nd generation and
guys it needs to be an mb model you
don't know how to look for that actually
show you in just a second so if you have
an mb model an original second
generation ipod touch or an iphone 3g no
no other device will work with this okay
so guys if you have all this then you
will need to be running ios4 this is
what simple guys just download it you
don't even need to be a developer just
download it and restore your device or
update it i had to restore but you guys
might have better luck updating it but
it anybody guys you need to be running
ios4 and show you guys i am running iOS
4 i'll show you how folder here so i
have the folder i can go ahead and
create a new folder so let's just pick
up something and just drop it on
something else so as you can guys can
see i have folders and it looks good to
me and actually go ahead and settings
and just show you guys just to prove
that i am running ios4 but general about
and guys as you can see here on the
bottom it says version 4.0 and also
shows that my model number is an mb okay
so guys there you go i am running iOS
for the golden master the GM whatever
you wanna call it ok guys so before you
do this though I've got it I've got let
you know this is not going to be for
everyone iOS four obviously lots of
stuff will not work as far as
jailbreaking I mean you can go ahead a
lot of the ass won't work so guys just a
little bit of a word of caution unless
you're an advanced user maybe if you're
a developer unless you've a just
absolutely have to be on the front I
really don't recommend this yet redsnow
will be updated once iOS four is fully
announced and I mean rather fully out
and of course this everyone probably
read jailbreak as soon as it happens
anyway because if you want to go ahead
and you have all the stuff everything
works you ready to go ahead and do it
it's very simple okay so guys the first
thing once you're on iOS four and you do
know that your device is ready then all
you have to do is come over to your
Windows or Mac computer ok guys so the
next step is to go ahead and download
redsnow zero point nine point five now
guys before you do this there are one
last thing I'd like to say now of course
it's not be a little bit bugging glitchy
but you cannot do this if you are
unlocked currently your iphones unlocked
because this will lose your unlock and
trust me you don't want to go through
this besides guys i recommend go ahead
and do this if this is like your
everyday device fact if you still use
your iphone 3g everyday i would
recommend this in the first place
because it will be a bit buggy and bit
glitchy my guys just you know a word of
warning you know force you to do
whatever you want so guys go ahead and
come to this page I'll have it linked in
the description and go ahead I
definitely recommend you guys read
through it I'm telling you guys pretty
much everything anyway but still guys
never hurts to you know to just get a
little bit more information so guys once
you've read it all and then you go ahead
and find the download links do you want
to get for OS 10 or for windows okay so
all you have to do is just download it
and of course I am doing this on windows
so guys now I have it on my desktop so
let's go ahead and open it up and then
open up mm-hmm so now guys it's going to
go ahead and you know just the
standardbred snow and we'll go ahead
basically all its tell you is it does
not hacktivate iPhones and so guys now
we're going to have to look for the ipsw
for our current firmware okay let's go
ahead and find it really quickly here so
just find wherever you have your i/o
ios4 like i still call it iphone OS 4
just find wherever your firmware is so
this is just happen where I have that's
not right one this is where I happen to
have it okay so guys make sure that it
is the right firmware so soon you're
done with that go ahead and let it start
processing and we just take one second
they'll ask you if you have an MC model
okay now guys if you do have an MC model
you do not want to do this so no i do
not have i have mine is an mb model okay
so we're all set okay guys so we're also
that we have redsnow it's already gotten
our four-point-oh firmware okay go ahead
and plate necks
okay so now I'll go ahead and just
download the jailbreak data of course
has you ever use redsnow this is
practically the exact same way so you
know if you've already use redsnow
before in the past like i have it should
be a piece of cake okay so guys now of
course in Wright's know you have a few
options so go ahead and just zoom in on
them here you can obviously install
cydia and guys that's what you want to
do that's the whole point I'm you have
verbose boot which basically allows you
to actually see the the text going by
instead of just staring at the apple
logo really it's pretty uh pretty
optional you can go ahead and do a
custom boot logo or custom recovery logo
I'm not going to do that today guys
that's a pretty cool feature redsnow but
you know it's not that big a deal and
now guys here are three really major
things do you want an able multitasking
enable a home screen wallpaper and
enable battery percentage guys they're
all three chicks by default and I would
you know just laid them may mean that's
the whole point that you're jailbreaking
on your ipod touch or your iphone to get
all three of these features because i
mean if you don't want them you can go
ahead and uncheck them but I'm go ahead
do that so going hit next so guys now
basically you have to make sure that the
device is off and plugged into the
computer okay so guys if it's not off
plug into the plug fit into the it into
the computer first so let's go ahead and
zoom out a little bit and as you can see
guys it is on right now so let's go
ahead and plug it into the computer so
just plug the USB cable in I could get
in here man something about plugging in
cables while I'm on camera always goes
badly it's good because I have no debt
reception looking through the camera
I've okay so guys go ahead and plug it
in any guys if itunes does pop up go
ahead and shut down it's not a big deal
so so let's go ahead and turn on so now
we just go ahead and hold it and shut it
off so guys just hold the power button
no big deal slide to power off and we're
good and of course there goes iTunes so
let's go ahead and close that out okay
so looks like guys itunes put this in a
big deal so guys you can see it's off
we're ready to begin so guys now once
the device is off and you know totally
off guys in it nothing's going on it's
not asleep it's totally off then we're
ready to roll so we just going hit next
now we're going to go ahead and hold the
power button for five seconds now hold
down the home button for about 10
seconds and guys these instructions do
go pretty fast so wait just one second
then without releasing the home button
will release the power button and keep
holding the home button for about 30
seconds so guys this might take a couple
tries sometimes it can be a little bit
hard to you know to cover because that
instructions start very quickly but go
ahead and just hold it and guys if
something does go wrong if it doesn't
work then just go ahead and hit back on
red snow and then try it again so let's
go ahead and keep holding it there we go
so guys we are done that is pretty much
it so iTunes is loading up again so we
just go ahead and close that out so guys
as you can see here my ipod as a blank
screen and it is still just waiting for
reboot so i'll go ahead and just stick
with you guys here and there we go guys
downloading jailbreak data okay guys
we're all done so it just took a minute
i mean i just i'm connected it it's
because as soon as it's done you're all
upset so guys because you can see here
we have cydia now guys city will have a
blank icon i believe all you have to do
is open it up and run it once and we'll
fix that but guys it's not a big deal so
let's go ahead and show multitasking and
stuff so i actually let's go ahead and
show changing the background so let's go
ahead and come into wallpaper so let's
go ahead and pick one so go ahead
wallpaper actually let's go ahead and
Ice Age photos this just takes the drape
for the fun of it so that looks good to
me so we want to set a lot screen home
screen both let's set both okay we're
all set so if we come out here there you
guys so guys that obviously works and if
we wanna go ahead and close it you'll
see works really nicely actually I like
kind of like that fact that the image
looks like it stays so guys let's go
ahead and show multitasking really quick
so let's go ahead and open up settings a
double tap the home button and you see
actually it's got cydia running right
now just go ahead and back out of this
let's open up music let's double tap
again and now as you see here we had
setting so we can jump
over to settings and guys obviously this
is on ipod touch 2nd generation it works
just fine so guys this is going to be a
lot of fun you know you we want to be
relying on city apps to this but of
course you know there's a lot more city
at so we do want so any of the guys
hopefully this helps you out if you have
any problems just feel free to leave in
the comments not do my best to help you
out anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
