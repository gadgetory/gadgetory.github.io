of the HTC status this is a bit of a
different phone from what we've been
taking a look at lightly of course with
all the dual cores and the 3d and the
enormous displays it's kind of fresh
take a look at something that's a little
bit more humble course it does have a
full physical keyboard and of course
it's not gonna break the bank so I've
had this only for a few days so I can't
really give you guys my for review just
yet but what I will do is give you my
first impressions some of the things
I've noticed in a couple of days of
using it so number one it's gonna be the
display another displays are going to be
a two point six inch display not a
really all that large a bit display
impacted by sitting next to something
like an iPod Touch which of course is
the same size as an iPhone but look one
kind of get a good idea of how route
really small it is on the other hand
though it does have a good pixel density
of 480 by 320 so pretty nice resolution
text everything is willing quite crisp
and clear another thing I like if I
pulling another phone here as we'll be
able to see next to a palm pixi you guys
can see that it is actually a landscape
orientation as opposed to portrait now
these are both 2.6 inch displays however
you know with the pixi I'm always you
know like holding it sideways and
digital to work too well with the
keyboard so with a phone like this I
think it works really quite nicely you
know you know you really never need to
you'll put into a different orientation
it just works now as far as the design
goes ah not really liking it a ton to be
honest I mean there are definitely some
good things I like the fact that it does
have a front-facing camera on the screen
they're having a front-facing camera on
a phone this cheap is fantastic of
course was considering this Facebook
phone it's gonna be nice to be able to
video chat and all that kind of stuff
with your friends you know a lot of the
build quality is really top-notch and
back to fire lock it here you guys will
be able to see it's made out of mostly
plastic and in fact I believe it might
be all plastic my arms ensure mmm
notoriously bad it deciding what's
plastic is what's metal but overall the
build quality is really sturdy I mean
there's not a whole lot of creaks and
groans and whatnot I mean you really
apply some pressure to it you might hear
a little bit of a crack here and there
but I totally within totally within my
tolerances of what a foam should be able
to handle now some of the other things I
like about the phone is the keyboard
it's not a great looking keyboard you
know it kind of looks a little bit
generic but it doesn't definitely work
there's a pretty nice
a bit of a raise on there they're nicely
spaced out and overall I mean I like the
keyboard quite a bit also something
that's kind of interesting is having
these directional buttons it's not
really something that you see very often
on phones these days but it's actually
kind of nice to be able to make
selections or when you're on a webpage
and said bring your thumb up and
scrolling and coming back and you know
all that kind of stuff you can just go
ahead and just tab through so that's
actually kind of nice now what I don't
like is the sending end keys now I
didn't think I would like them it's all
in the unboxing and I definitely have
decided that I don't I mean it's not
like they really get in the way and I
mean sometimes it can be nicer you're in
the middle of a call you know but I
think they would have been better served
they would just gotten rid of this and
drag the screen down and maybe made it a
little bit of a larger display now they
may have some technical reasons for
doing that or I don't know maybe people
really want to send in an keys but my
opinion not really necessary now of
course one of the biggest things about
this phone has to be the Facebook button
if I don't show you guys how that works
it's nothing particularly amazing so
let's say I'm here I want to hit that
button I want immediately launch me into
the Facebook application so I can post
to my wall whatever so I can go say I'm
filming and YouTube video so you guys
can see I'm not really totally used to
the keyboard just yet it's pretty decent
but again it's gonna take a little bit
of getting used to but it's not bad at
all actually but the Facebook button
okay excellent just hit it again
oh the Facebook button is kind of nice
if you're always on Facebook and
everything that's definitely going to be
a pretty nice addition but in general
it's not a huge deal I mean it's not
that much difference from just tapping
on the Facebook and just going into it
from there so I mean kind of nice but
certainly not any major reason why you
should buy the phone is just kind of a
nice addition now getting around to the
back of the phone coming back again you
guys will find a 5 megapixel autofocus
sensor with full LED flash no shadows
rather impress with this you know for
cheekbone tip boy that's one of the
major things that they do is I get you
it now a cheap sensor a cheap camera um
but I really found this is not the case
in fact I found that the picture quality
and I'll show you guys some of that more
in the review and get a little more
in-depth but it's very similar to the
HTC Inspire that I recently reviewed so
pretty solid pictures only 480p video
and the video is not fantastic but
overall you know for the price point I
have really no
complaints saying goes for the
performance and that I'll open this up
and beep you guys kind of a quickly
little thing here you can swipe between
your home screens and whatnot very
simply it does have enough power it
since it has have an 800 megahertz
processor has enough power to play games
like Angry Birds and whatnot I mean
because of the screen resolution even
though it's a really small display it's
kind of a small phone well it's not that
small a phone but as far as the screen
that definitely is small a lot of times
with these kind of Android phones gonna
had some weird screen resolution where
some actual work that's definitely not
the case very common screen resolution
and pretty much now I don't want to say
every single app but I would say the
majority of applications on the Android
Market do you support this so anyway
guys that's about it for my overview of
course I will be getting into a lot more
in depth such as battery life and you
name it I'll probably be getting into it
in the review so definitely stay tuned
for that I'll be posting that in the
next few days</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
