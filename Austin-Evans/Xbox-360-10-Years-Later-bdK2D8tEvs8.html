million consoles sold today marks the
10-year anniversary of the Xbox 360 but
how does it hold up the 360 did a lot of
things right not only did it introduce
features we take for granted today like
achievements digital downloads and
proper online multiplayer but it helps
move gaming into the HD era it had
impressive hardware for the time that
could output 1080p something consoles of
today haven't been able to top couple
with the addition of apps the 360 works
just as well as a modern set-top box for
watching video like YouTube and Netflix
the real draw though are the games there
are still titles coming out for the Xbox
like rise of the Tomb Raider it might
not match the Xbox one or ps4 visually
but considering it has one 16th to
memory and far less powerful graphics it
comes surprisingly close some titles
like Metal Gear run at a reduced frame
rate compared to the current gen
consoles but it's hard not to be
impressed by what's possible on Hardware
less powerful than some smart phones
there's also an enormous library of
great games from the last decade some of
these were instant classics like Red
Dead Redemption that was never available
on PC big exclusives like Halo really
helped cement the 360 as a success for
Microsoft and Call of Duty transformed
from world war ii simulator to global
juggernaut with the original modern
warfare back in 2007
Fortson Emily filled the shoes of Gran
Turismo for the Xbox but has passed it
in a lot of ways and games like
Battlefield 3 really strained the limits
of what was capable with the 360s
Hardware it's also received a ton of
updates over the years including several
new interfaces and cool features like
smart glass that lets you control the
console from a smartphone
it also features backwards compatibility
with some original Xbox games such as
Halo something the ps3 only supported
with a few early models the controllers
also nicely stood the test of time not
only does it still work well but it's
become the standard gamepad on PC the
original 360 did lack Wi-Fi and had a
slightly weird top mounted hard drive
but the current gen fixes both of these
while being smaller quieter and more
reliable it definitely wasn't perfect
though one of the biggest issues with
the original 360 was the red ring of
death which often meant a dead console
as I found out the hard way back in the
day it was also expensive running a cool
$400 back at launch with a massive 20
gig hard drive the Xbox one might be
starting to add backwards compatibility
but when you consider how cheaply you
can pick up a 360 in some of the
greatest games of all time
it's hard to argue with the xbox360 10
years later this guy is still going
strong</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
