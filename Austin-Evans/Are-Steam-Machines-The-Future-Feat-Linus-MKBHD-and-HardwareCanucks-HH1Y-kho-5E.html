here at CES I'm not looking at you and
we're all going to be talking a little
about steamos and steam machines so who
is this guy okay who's the song oh hey
guys it's me Linus no don't do that
pyrokinetics Vitra here marques Frank a
PhD so we literally just all just met up
here over the zotac booth so we decided
let's talk a little about steamos so how
many seen machines have you seen so far
like there's a there's a gigabyte one
and there's the zotac Oh steam machines
okay in terms of actual hardware yeah I
guess almost anything's a steam machine
but in terms of ones that are really
more optimal I guess I've seen the one
here I've seen the tiny little bricks
Pro over it Intel and then I was taken
into the back room at Coolermaster where
unspeakable things happened and in
addition to that in exchange I got to
see sort of an upcoming maybe design of
some kind of chassis that might make
sense for some kind of a CMOS
implementation but that's all the only
one I've seen actually running the OS is
over it Intel cool how about you if you
see any steam machines alienware is
releasing one and I'm sure that's gonna
be sort of popular along the Dell
fanboys I mean there's a Haley were so
you only only Dell fanboys clearly yeah
but it's obviously targeting being
targeted towards that the market like
what they're like the x51 I asked him
this is going to be replaced to x51 from
alien where be sure biggest also small
pad factor it's running Windows vs steam
OS and they said no no it's it's
completely different things but I think
it's going to be you know they're
they're basically the same thing running
different OS interesting all right well
we've actually been hang out the whole
time we haven't seen yet together we've
seen only this one behind us yeah so
let's talk about this one so this one is
actually have to behind this right
there's one iris pro and there's one
with nvidia graphics um or is that the
intel one is not technically a steam
machine right so tech has a lot of
different little Z boxes the one that we
were looking at right there is iris pro
graphics iris pro graphics alright so do
you think iris pro graphics is about the
sweet spot for where a steam machine
should be as far as graphics you know
obviously keeping in mind needs to be
small and fairly cheap or do you think
they may be like throwing in like a
cheap little AMD or Nvidia core might be
idea well the problem is we've actually
set up steamos on a machine and the
issue is that you can play some games on
it right now but two of the critical
features that are going to be coming
aren't there in the beta yet one of them
is the account sharing so you can
actually share your games and then the
other one is the game streaming feature
that will allow you to stream from
another PC yeah if that features
outstanding then you can probably run
steamos on like a watch it came to that
good and you could leverage the power of
something else as long as you have an
h.264 decode engine on it yeah so it'll
really depend on how well that feature
works and how low the latency is for me
to even speculate yeah I don't know I
mean we both tried the Nvidia shield
have you tried the shield yes okay so
all for us so what do you guys think if
they streaming service is kind of
similar to shield you think it's gonna
be good enough do you think needs to be
better cuz I noticed for me with the
shield it was good about within 10 15
feet of the router but like I went a
rumor so over I started getting like
drop frames every little while like what
do you think it needs to be better like
do you think technologies to advance a
bit more water on that side this time
other side of these guys alright so what
do you think well streaming I think is
uh like the shield technology there they
showcase the demo in the video press
conference where they were streaming
from France and the gameplay was laggy
I'm gonna be on it wasn't as smooth as
we come to expect but they're showcasing
that this sort of streaming across the
ocean as possible and I think that the
next thing for streaming in the living
room in the consumer home is based on
your router and expanding that signal
kind of like what ACS is doing with
their motor business stuff yeah any
thoughts yeah I mean for as long as I've
had the shield I've actually never used
the gaming streaming from my PC so and
if I were to talk about shield will be
all about the games that are already
playable on it but I get comments all
the time about people who are trying
this kind of stuff and saying you know
my internet connection I don't know if
it's good
I don't know if I'm going to be able to
enjoy the experience fully so I think
one that's once that's good enough it's
going to be really important for love
you cool yeah I know I what do you like
yeah it depends on how it goes like I
said like with the shield I haven't had
the best experience so I've got like an
AC router in the whole deal but that
being said I think the steam OS like you
can run that pretty much or anything
like you could technically do it on a
Windows box or pretty much anything I
feel like the real value of steam OS is
actually being able to run games on the
box I mean streaming is kind of nice but
so as far as the game support so there's
something about there's about like 10%
of Steam titles are actually are ready
for valve or I'm sorry ready for now
ready for links right now like what do
you think is like the support because I
know I was trying when the steam the
first steam of West's release I tried a
couple games bling left4dead as well as
Metro last light and I was really not
impressed with the performance or the
optimization that much like do you think
that games have a long way to go or do
you think that once these come out will
be pretty much rate a plug and play and
that's exactly the trick isn't it
because if the streaming works just
great then who cares because you can
have a Windows box sitting somewhere
else in your house in a closet for all
you care and that'll handle all the
gaming horsepower as it is I think my
Steam library has around 45 supported
games on steamos most of them are ones
it's like indie games and stuff like
that but I'm just going to sort of take
a moment here and go ok I'm going to be
in completely the opposite camp out of
all of you and game stream is absolutely
amazing
our issues you do need the hardware for
it I actually have a $300 ubiquity AC
access point waiting for me when I get
back now from what I heard from Wendell
a text into kit he's saying that if you
want a truly wired grade obviously no
wireless is ever wired great but if you
want more like a wired grade wireless
experience there's either the ubiquity
or there's like $1,000 plus Linksys AC
access point and that's what you're
pretty much looking at so I'm going to
be evaluating it from that standpoint
because I had a strong dual band router
and I couldn't get more than 5 feet away
from it then I went to an Asus strong
dual band end router and all of a sudden
I could get to my bedroom and I'm
playing Super Meat Boy on Sheol all
streaming not natively on Android and
the fact that I'm like up you know 1 and
a half through one and a half world
using shield should be at all you need
to know about how all the latency is the
fact that you can do anything in that
game with shield on game stream should
be all you need to know now with steamos
I don't think that the latency of your
internet connection the latency of your
wireless connection is relevant at all
because there are plenty of options for
getting a wired connection to your steam
box in which case we're talking about
Layton sees of less than one millisecond
over the network and given that you can
stream 720p and even 1080p over ten
hundred Ethernet using an on-the-go
dongle on the back of shield doing it
over gigabit on a PC seems completely
trivial so if you have very little
latency if the bandwidth is enough then
I don't see it being an obstacle at all
it should be outstanding but it's going
to depend on the technology I know
NVIDIA has actually probably done more
work on the software than they have on
the hardware oh yeah when it comes to
game stream if you guys have tried
limelight it's a terrible experience the
leg is very tangible whereas game stream
works incredibly well and limelight
claims to be using the same h.264 decode
engine that's built into either Qualcomm
Snapdragon chip more into the nvidia
tegra chips okay that's my take on it
so streaming okay so let's just take a
step back from the streaming doh do you
think that people are going to buy steam
OS steam machines to stream on like do
you think that that's going to be the
number one thing because I feel like
there's there's other ways you could
stream like I just don't think that
that's like the killer app I feel like
the killer app has got to be a cheap
small form-factor PC that's actually in
your living room or whatever I don't see
a lot of people who are going to buy a
steam machine and also going to have a
2000 our system in their other room like
do you think that's really going to be a
really big thing or I think steam OS is
going to be for nerds at the beginning I
think that they're probably just gonna
already own a PC so we're not talking
about a purchasing decision that goes am
I going to buy one am I gonna buy two
pcs or am I gonna buy one we're gonna be
talking about I have a PC I'm gonna add
this okay and I think that because of
the limited support for Linux titles the
fact that performance isn't great back
that's gonna have to be the killer app
okay what do you guys think well I think
for the steam machine I think the
biggest thing aside from getting
supported more games for the steam OS
would be the form factor a lot of people
you know you're looking for a lot
smaller form factor yeah
compact everything
and that's going to be the the major
sort of your purchasing decision one
thing would be based on that now just
who can make the smallest thing most
powerful thing I guess with iris we're
seeing it's delivering actually pretty
acceptable performance even though it's
720p
you can tone down the settings a little
bit to get you know you're looking at 40
perhaps so 60 and FPS and value at four
yeah that's the gigabyte bricks Pro yeah
so Marcus what would actually it take
you because I know you're not quite a
massive gamer will it take you to buy a
steam machine I was going to say on top
of all that key word would be cheap yeah
rice price for performance when people
are looking at you know adding something
to what they already have like I said
people already have a computer the
decision to make that extra purchase is
going to depend entirely on how
affordable they can get this stuff to be
yeah so that's what I would add to that
as it has to have to be really cheap
that is exactly it because that's why
that's what will make steamos makes
sense streaming from crap you already
own as opposed to buying a two thousand
dollar gaming box that sits under your
TV where you using once in a while so
got you hit the nail on the head all
right so I think we've got it so if you
guys want to know more from these guys
so where can I find juicer um well
there's like a cave and I live in it
sometimes I come out of the cave and the
