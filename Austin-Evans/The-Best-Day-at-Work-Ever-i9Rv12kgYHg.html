here in Austin Texas at Circuit of the
Americas for one reason I'm about to go
faster than I've ever gone in my life
well I mean a car at least and I'm doing
that thanks to Audi who not only were
able to sponsor our video but also let
me drive the r8 on the track the Audi
driving experience starts by putting you
behind the wheel of the car that I Drive
every single day the Audi rs3 the day
begins with this simple slalom and lane
change exercise and ends with a braking
zone you know like the license tests in
Gran Turismo that I always missed the
braking zone end next up I got some seat
time with the autocross course in the TT
RS now I'll admit even though it's the
same 400 horsepower turbo 5 cylinder
with all-wheel-drive as well as the
7-speed dual-clutch it feels a lot more
lively I got the car sideways almost
every single lap especially in the wet
area which is just a giant test of
patience so after a little bit of time
in both the rs3 as well as the TT RS it
is time for a full track session on the
main circuit of the americas track in
the r8 so this is going to be the full
RA plus we've got the 600 plus
horsepower v10 7-speed dual-clutch
transmission huge tires and a whole lot
of track to use it on so it is an
incredibly hot day here in Austin right
now the temperature reading is 102
degrees Fahrenheit but the cars are
actually holding up pretty well and that
dual clutch I mean it just feels so
responsible I grab a paddle and I
immediately there and with that v10
right behind us we're short shifting a
little bit because I don't want to
overheat it I may have overheated
transmission earlier in the day
listen to that putter miles-an-hour
once end
1:20
125-130 and hard on the brakes hard of
the brakes so the speed is serious in
such a car like this and we're
definitely a lot more in na so circle
America is is an f1 track so they do
other types of racing here and the Audi
experience actually does take advantage
of this track for events like this but
this is really designed first and
foremost as an f1 track and you can tell
it's why it's fast it's very technical
there's certain sections where if you
get it a little bit off
you can totally mess up the next couple
of corners but the r8 it's forgiving I
mean I don't have a ton of track
experience but I feel really comfortable
pushing the limits of at least what I
can do definitely out what the car isn't
capable of all right full throttle let's
do it let's do it
dude that ships are instant you hit a
pallet you're a merely going and I love
being able to really haul down on these
ceramic brakes I mean we've been going
it's a hot day and they have not faded
one bit which makes sense right I mean
that's why you buy incredibly expensive
ceramic brakes on your very very pricey
audi r8
pulling on the straight will thought
let's go I'm like legitimately convinced
mid-engine I've never really fully
experienced what a mid-engine car feels
like especially on a track but I get it
now like that balance just being able to
place the car exactly where you wanted
this car this car is something else I
mean first of all look at it it is
absolutely beautiful with the
performance on the track man I'm in love
I'm in love
v10 mid-engine all-wheel drive sign me
up today was absolutely awesome I can't
think audience response during the video
but for letting me have the opportunity
to drive the RA the TT RS in the rs3 you
guys ever get the opportunity to do a
driving school like this absolutely go
for it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
