is uh what 3 years no no something it
does so it's really quick for for a
console cycle however I think it's clear
that we you did not particularly perform
as well as it might have I think
compared to the we at least yeah I think
the naming was bad and maybe that the
tablet interface making it mandatory
wasn't the best thing I think a lot of
people just didn't understand it right
like a lot of people I still think even
today don't realize the Wii U is not
just some like add-on for the week but
no I actually think it's interesting
about the rumor as far as that there
would be to be much more powerful the
cutting-edge hardware oh yeah you needs
that like PC yeah this is I think bare
minimum it needs to be as fast as the
ps4 and Xbox one and and ideally it
really needs to be more powerful right
ok yeah so those those already helped
write the Wii U is roughly maybe a
little bit more powerful 360 and ps3
which is cool but immediately the new
consoles came out and kind of made it
almost obsolete as far as like being
able to play the same game consoles how
long did it take you to perfect the hey
guys it's Austin uh so I shouldn't
always say hey guys I think you've
always said it oh I said I don't know
let's do here are you look to your first
video on the first video right now hey
guys I said that April 28 2009 you know
over six years ago opinions on phone
ship gate chip gate John I heard about
this one
all this nerd talk aside what this means
is that not all iPhone successes are
created equal
oh dear you make me watch one of your
videos so for those of you who aren't
aware ship gate chip gate is basically
there are two versions of the chips
inside the iPhone 6s one built by TSMC
and one built by Samsung now
theoretically they should be identical
however they're totally different
companies making these chips and as
close as they want to make them they're
just not going to be the same it's not a
huge deal right I think it definitely
does make a difference and even if it's
only a to 30% difference that's still
noticeable right especially if you do a
lot of gaming it will be higher than
that I actually did do a video on it
several other people have done videos on
as well
guys to check out some of those but Tod
Archie is a thing it is not a huge deal
but I also think it is something to
consider what was the last picture you
took with your phone nice actually let's
do this right now go through our phones
pick up a very large picture yes here's
mine Ellie hates you go home yes that's
actually I wrote that's a home I don't
even try to explain it it just it just
happened sometimes she's gonna take a
picture of the flower and I do what are
your expectations for the galaxy s7 did
you drive this six yeah okay so it's a
phone I really like the galaxy s I think
it's a solid phone I think that they
mean going to the glass and level design
was a huge advantage they cleaned up the
software I mean that's a really solid
phone I think the biggest problem for me
was very much yes it's just wood
straight not laughing get a full day um
so I think for me to fanboy if they get
better battery life
I like the screen I think they should
stick with the edge I think the edge is
awesome they're just a good one they
need to continue to copy off of Apple so
just keep it up Samsung qwj the comments
man I know I yeah what was your first
computer my first computer was given to
me when I worked at Best Buy in 1996 it
was a 486 Packard Bell it was a yeah I
bought it from the other sales guy for
100 bucks now I got my monitor so many
use place and it was like it was my baby
and that's and I had I don't know it was
a well a copy server or one of those and
then muff and I had you know email yes
I'm old guys hey guys my question is
what are you recommendations for a non
expensive first vlogging cam the iPhone
6s plus actually it's the one of the bet
I'm being silly with this video with the
iPhone so but like I had to do the canon
g7x which is you know if you want to
have a solo camera it's really good but
once this came out with the exception of
not having wide-angle right if the
quality is so good I just I just I get I
thought that camera is just no need
actually I totally agree I don't
necessarily
think it has to be an iPhone silly yeah
any of these new yeah any of these new
rules right here but such as all he's
like remotely new smartphone I think is
absolutely the way to go even like a
smartphones like three or four years old
would be a better camera than what I
started with so I think if you have any
kind of remotely decent smartphone get
it and then if you want to shoot maybe
something a little bit more high-end
just get like a little tripod now right
you can get one for like 15 oh hello
right here yeah so you could just drop
your phone in this and you got like a
little bit of a tripod so you don't
always have like hold the camera this is
great something like this plus a
smartphone is all you need to get
started in fact it's all you to like run
a pretty decent can't really yeah
alright so thanks for being the video
absolutely watch I got one more video
you can go over to Lamar's channel where
we played Yoshi's woolly world which is
actually a lot of fun really well so as
always you guys can hit us up on twitter
