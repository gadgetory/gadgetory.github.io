showing you some of the things that are
on my iPod Touch 4th generation and I've
had actually a surprising amount of
requests people wanted to know you know
what's on my apps where somebody tweets
all that kind of stuff so the waiting
you guys a brief overview of what all I
have on my iPod Touch on so let's go
ahead just jump straight on into it so
of course that kinds of some of the
self-explanatory apps music app store
photos FaceTime you all the kinds of
generic ones that you know I'd like to
get to fairly often so wouldn't wouldn't
jump into this folder and I'll show you
a couple of my my favorite apps but kind
of action apps Battlefield Bad Company 2
now I've actually reviewed pretty much
all these not tap type revenge and not
Angry Birds I've reviewed all the rest
you wide and check out my channel if
you're interested in individual reviews
but just keep it keep it safe to say
that these are pretty much my favorite
apps Angry Birds is of course always fun
Mirror's Edge is surprisingly a lot of
fun I like that a lot
I've been playing a lot of Need for
Speed hot pursuit if you guys haven't I
should check that one out that's
probably my current favorite app right
now I've been playing that a ton really
fun app so of course real racing Tron
Legacy again I don't want to go through
all these you can check out the full
reviews I don't like an open up my next
folder and this is just more games that
I like maybe I my absolute favorites but
still the ones I like to play a lot um
cut the rope
I'm sure a lot of you guys cut the rope
pretty fun laughs I keep Epic Citadel on
here not just because it's fun but just
because I like to occasionally to show
off to a friend or somebody you know
some of the graphics because I get
people saying although iPod Touches
gaming you're a little blah and I kept
excited I'll show you that and that
usually shuts them up pretty quick and
Big Mo I thought should really play it
that too much but I do like to keep it
on here
I'm as you can see I do have gout Khan
and gallant lads now actually these are
a couple of my favorite apps of all time
I got these above I got both of these a
long time ago gal calling guys have you
never heard of it is a frickin just I
just love it so much it's a really cool
space 3d kind of actually I don't even
know how to explain it it's uh you need
to have to look it up it's a really cool
tool app and if you guys have never
played gout con I definitely recommend
take a look at it
um I have a boy fixed pigs just I'm sure
most of you guys know one of my favorite
game
again I have a lot of favorite kings but
this one is really really unique and
interesting I've done I've done reviews
and so and it's been in several of my
you know top videos so check that out um
I do have the Intellivision emulator
from the App Store again really cool app
right there scoops mini Gore driver
another cut the rope a holiday gift so a
lot of these are pretty self-explanatory
but those are pretty much the main games
I like to keep google I go ahead and
jump into utilities again these are
pretty much self-explanatory nothing too
exciting
Game Center I've got Amazon app which I
usually really don't use anymore but I
keep it on here wallpapers HD now that's
actually something I get questions a lot
about like where do I get my backgrounds
that is where I get it in this app
called wallpapers HD wind chicka it's
got the little yellow and black icon
definitely check that out in the app
store if you're interested in an app
that has a lot of really cool wallpapers
i'm abducts to go which is really cool
if you need to go ahead and you know do
a lot of document editing like for
example sometimes I write scripts of
videos and that or you know for whatever
documents you need that works really
excellently Genius can is really great
for actually going ahead if you have
receipts or stuff like that you can go
ahead and take a picture with your
camera and use genie scan to really
narrow it down make it into a proper
document very very nice offer many it'll
use that I keep it on here Skype
likewise I don't get on skype on my ipod
too often however it is kind of nice to
have sometimes I'll have the Google
mobile app which is pretty nice for
voice search not don't use it too much
but I kind of keep it on there
same with i sh sh it i don't really use
it but actually i made a video on i
haven't gotten around to removing it but
it's still on there and it is a pretty
handy app and i have a QR code reader
which is always handy to you know to
read just various QR codes throughout
the day i don't really show you this
this is just etc this is just all the
pre-built applications for your ipod or
iphone with the exception of VLC which i
just put in there because i need to the
space so pretty standard there that's
pretty much it now I do have the youtube
web app that's not the actual YouTube
application that's the web app I much
prefer that you guys go ahead just check
it out by going to youtube.com and then
just adding it as
a shortcut on your desktop all right
test hop on your springboard so go ahead
just run through the rest calendar
obviously I'll let the Weather Channel
there are better weather apps in the App
Store I know but it's just simple and
you know it's kind of glitchy I just
kind of fur it iBooks which is the
produce all of that but I definitely
recommend you guys download that as well
as iMovie which I really really like
iMovie is really pretty impressive
the iPod Touch 4th generation it's not
quite as good just because the camera is
not amazing but I definitely used it a
fair few times so I'm out and about see
something really cool
of course if I ever see something you
know I might want to put on my channel I
movies great I can go ahead and edit it
and do it really quickly so let's go
ahead just finish this up we do I have
sky fire which is a pretty good app
unless you watch some flash video it has
a few little features I mostly just keep
it around for the odd flash video that I
would like to watch don't use them too
often and that has the new a gap which
actually just download last night just
because I'm planning on buying a
computer soon and yeah so new egg is
pretty cool for that and we're go ahead
