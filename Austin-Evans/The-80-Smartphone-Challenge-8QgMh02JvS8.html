checked out a 150 dollar smartphone but
what happens when you bring that budget
down to $80 show that to MetroPCS for
sponsoring this video
this is the Alcatel a 30 Perce typically
for $1 you really shouldn't expect much
out of a smartphone but at least on
paper this looks decent take a look
inside the box and the first thing we
see is two free months of Amazon music
unlimited so they're actually a couple
of different Amazon tie-ins with this
phone specifically actually does have a
lexis support if you guys want the code
it's all yours so we were definitely
well into the budget into the spectrum
here but it actually doesn't feel too
bad in the hand so yes it is a little
bit on the larger side with a five and a
half inch screen and yes it is made out
of plastic but it feels reasonably
sturdy it does have this kind of
interesting textured finish pop off the
back and the first thing you'll see is a
giant please do not remove this battery
under any circumstances warning but
above that now I do have a micro SD card
slot but also where we put our semmen
hardware wise this has pretty much
everything you would expect so now you
have a headphone jack but you also do
have a micro USB port would have been
nice to see USB see but it doesn't
really matter at this price point and
you also do have the volume rocker as
well as the slightly textured power
button this guy is rocking a 5.5 inch
720p IPS display so just like with the
Moto e 4 plus it's nice to have a big
display and the resolution even looks a
little bit low really isn't too bad for
a budget device so it does get
reasonably bright however a couple areas
where you can notice the budget price
come through is with color reproduction
in the actual feel of the display it
just doesn't feel quite as premium as
something higher-end with Gorilla Glass
4 video I feel like the bigger display
actually is a really nice feature and
while the audio isn't amazing it's a lot
better than a lot of other budget phones
just because it does have a single front
firing speaker it's not stereo but it
definitely does sound a lot better than
something coming out the bottom or the
back of the phone it also does have that
support for Amazon Alexa so if you
double tap the power button who is
Austin evidence
it also doesn't have the fingerprint
sensor which is especially nice to see
on such a budget device so it works just
as you expect put your finger on it it
will immediately unlock the phone and
get you straight into it spec wise it's
pretty standard so we have a quad-core
MediaTek 67 38 processor 2 gigabytes of
RAM as well as 32 gigs of storage that
is expandable with that micro SD card
slot so what might not be a huge value
add having 32 gigs of storage on an
$80.00 phone is actually kind of nice
it's not like you know you can pay $600
for a 16 gig phone somewhere else or
anything inside it has a 3000 milliamp
hour battery that's about the same size
as a lot of flagships but because of the
power sipping internals this should
easily be able to last a day and of
course since it's running on metro pcs
you can get up to 2 lines for $75 a
month of unlimited data without gimmicks
like speed caps
so far the 830 seems like a completely
decent budget Android phone but I want
to put it through a few challenges
asking for a friend
can it gain you definitely have to keep
in mind that this is a budget smartphone
but let's throw a few games I didn't see
what happened first off we have Super
Mario run this is not exactly an
incredibly graphically demanding game
and to be fair it's not these smoothest
framerate I've ever seen so that we are
dropping a couple frames here and there
but it's totally playable next we've got
mortal kombat x huh this actually works
pretty well yeah it's not gonna go blow
away like a console or something but
this looks totally fine last but not
least we have Real Racing 3 so
performance isn't amazing but again this
is an $80 phone that's essentially able
to run most of the graphically demanding
games that are available on Android are
you able to vlog this would be like if I
was a vlogger and it's 110 degrees
outside
I would just complain a lot for about
five minutes or so and then maybe move
on to something else can you livestream
so my first question is this is an $8
smartphone can you guys tell the
difference on Instagram live not bad not
bad looks good looks good for 80 bucks
yeah I totally think so can you take a
fast photo as if you see a celebrity you
never know when you find a wild kimball
ito in the wild ready and boom got it
not a very good picture but I got it
fast it's not perfect if you have a
little bit more budget to work with I
really do like the Moto e for plus but
for $80 the Alcatel a 30 is definitely
worth a look so what do you guys think
about the phone let me know in the
comments below and I will catch you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
