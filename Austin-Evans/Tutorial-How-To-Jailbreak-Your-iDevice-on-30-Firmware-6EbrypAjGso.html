I'm real excited to announce it the 3.0
jailbreak is out for the iPhone 3G
iPhone 1st generation and both the iPod
Touch first and second-generation I do
note this is not with the iPhone 3GS the
dev teams to work on that but it is out
for all the devices probably most of you
guys will have one of these so this
should get you set up yeah this is gonna
be a little simple video I want to get
you guys out this jailbreak and give you
a tutorial step by step add to it so
let's get this one started
okay so the first thing you want to do
is I will have in the description over
here you go ahead and go in the
description now we'll have the link to
the iphone dev team blog they will have
and then there you can get the link to
the torrent to get read snow which is de
new it's just a new way to jailbreak
okay so go ahead download that it
shouldn't take you long
it is a torrent I'm sure you guys most
you guys have torrent readers or I want
blank but yeah so basically once you get
it download onto desktop go ahead and
open it up and it will be a zip file so
you guys go ahead just you know all I
gotta do is unzip it and it's for simple
just unzip it once this finally loads
and yeah also this is a very simple so
uh jailbreak here guys should be home at
all basically I want you is once you
unzip it go ahead and open it up and go
into let's no just application and by
the way I'm sorry I forgot to mention
this is for both this is both for
Windows and Mac the jailbreak the
jailbreak well it's not actually working
I mean the individual file you will have
to download different for when doesn't
matter but yeah okay now next what you
need to do is find your uh 3.0 from work
I've got right here I had a video
showing you guys had to it I'll have
more lengths for it if you guys are
already running 3.0 it's no problem just
fine the front work it's not you're not
doing 3.0 you will have to go ahead and
get get 3.0 on your device and then do
it I'm all have links for all of the
front waters in the description anyway
so what you do is just hit browse here
and you just go in here real quick such
firmware no big deal give it a second to
process the firmware which would just
take a minute now at this point you guys
will will actually probably you should
have done it well you my iPod is hooked
up right now you want to go ahead and
get before you open up red snow I mean
you could go ahead and do it now
but you want to go ahead and have it
logged in just you know make sure nobody
tries to jailbreak without you know
having firmware anyway so we'll say that
the software is identified go ahead and
hit next okay now next it will go ahead
and download all of your data that will
be needed to jailbreak you see it's you
know pretty standard stuff you know I'm
really uh I'm really really impressed
with how the dev team got this out so
fast um it's very cool I mean 3.0 is not
been helped along anyway so basically
slick with options basically it's
installed city or not obviously that's
the whole point so just you know don't
mess with anything hit next
basically what you do is you need to
have turn turn it off and plug it in
basically it's very simple all you got
to do is just turn it off you're not
you're not putting into any different
modes whatever basically you need to
make sure it's plugged in and turn off
all you have to just hold the power
button or the sleep/wake button what are
you gonna call it slide to power off and
give it a second that's what I'm doing
right now so you should hang with me for
just a second basically it's very simple
now that my device is off now I will say
make sure that you already had it make
sure that your device is plugged in and
then go ahead and shut off now once it's
off and plugged in do make sure it's not
you know there's not it's not the screen
is not on and a little loading it's
absolutely off you look at the screen
and everything okay so go ahead hit next
and basically you need to do DFU mode
whoops okay basically you would go ahead
and I'm gonna have to do this without
you know guys I gotta okay I'm gonna sit
down the microphone right now and go
ahead and do this so one second you
basically will need to put it on to DFU
mode okay guys sorry about that
yeah I actually had a pretty big problem
here when I hit it and I hit to go ahead
and continue it loaded may it look like
you run fine until hit said waiting for
reboot and then it froze and I've spent
the past couple hours trying to fix it I
read download the program everything I
wanted up what happened to do was
basically just go ahead and shut
the shutdown go ahead and I reboot my
computer and it seemed to work okay then
so uh I won't expect that out but guys
you might want go ahead and reboot your
computers before you use red snow just
heads up but anyway after I I tried a
couple of things that really wasn't Duke
I just hanging but all I did was I went
ahead and rebooted my computer and it
worked no problem so you guys might
wanna go ahead and try that anyway so
once it got it done
seriously it's been maybe five minutes
since I decided to redo it and it's it
ran no problem now basically it does is
you know it looks like this I'm looking
at my device right now and it's
basically just just like on basically
just jailbreaking it so even though it
says done what if you do not click this
don't click finish your closed water
what look at your device wait for what
it'll have a it'll have a progress bar
on the bottom basically just wait for it
to finish out so I'll go ahead and
probably another couple minutes we'll go
ahead and cut it here and I'll write
back we really are done it don't took
just a couple minutes now go ahead and
just finish this and close it and we're
done basically the it's your jailbroken
no problem
Sidious should be on here everything is
no problem and yeah it's very simple to
it yeah if you guys had that problem go
ahead let me know I wasn't expecting
that I haven't heard of anybody else
having that problem but yeah sorry about
that I guess I definitely recommend
going ahead and restarting your computer
um probably go ahead and download or
find your firmware make sure you have it
on your desktop go ahead download bread
snow and go ahead and restart your
computer like that I haven't seen
anybody else with the problem so you
might be ok but I mean that's that's
what it did for me so yeah anyway that's
just put it in I will definitely have
lots more videos showing all the cool
stuff you've got on 3.0 jailbroken hey
