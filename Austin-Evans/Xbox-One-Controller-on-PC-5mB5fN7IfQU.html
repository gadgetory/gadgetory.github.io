here with the tutorial showing you how
to get the Xbox one controller working
on your PC while up until now there
hasn't been any official support for the
Xbox one controller on Windows Microsoft
just released a driver to make it happen
well any Xbox one controller will work
the only downside is that you have to
keep it wired now this isn't a big deal
in my opinion however you won't be able
to use a wireless adapter like you were
able to do with the 360 controller just
grab a micro USB cable and plug it into
the controller and your PC soon windows
will automatically include the drivers
built-in but for now head over to major
Nelson's blog which I'll have linked in
the description and download the drivers
for either 32 or 64-bit windows I tested
on Windows 8.1 and had no problems
however some people are seeing issues on
Windows 7
and especially on Vista which I guess
makes sense considering that I don't
believe Vista is supported just yet
since these just came out windows gave
me a smart screen warning when I went to
install but this driver comes straight
from Microsoft so if you see this just
ignore it and continue from here it's as
simple as just clicking through the
Installer and that's it no restart
required if you jump into device manager
you'll see that the new controller is
recognized just that quickly the way
things work is that the Xbox one
controller pretends that's actually a
360 controller that means that any game
that uses the 360 controller as an
option should work just fine here jump
into watchdog's and the game immediately
recognizes the Xbox one gamepad there's
literally no setup everything just works
since the button layout is basically the
same as on the 360 changes like the
better d-pad and bigger triggers are a
nice improvement I tried a few other
games with no problems left 4 dead 2
being the only title that was just a
little off even here though it's not a
big deal as it just needs a quick
adjustment of the controller sensitivity
and things are solid I really like the
Xbox one controller and I'm impressed
with how seamlessly it works on the PC
if a game worked with a 360 controller
it'll work here so what do you guys
think are you planning on picking up an
Xbox one controller for your PC let me
know in the comments below anyway guys
thank you so much for watching and I
will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
