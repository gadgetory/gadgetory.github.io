going to be going over the new iOS 5.0
point one as well as the jailbreak for
the iphone 4s and ipad 2 earlier this
week iOS 5.0 point 1 was released to
developers this is not a large update it
largely consists of some bug fixes from
iOS 5 as well as some of the major bugs
as far as battery life with the iphone
4s and other devices on iOS 5 since it
is a small release don't look for any
major new features however if you're
interested in getting those bug fixes
and new battery life improvements
definitely look for five point 0 point
one to hit in the coming weeks redsnow
for iOS 5 will already handle a five
point a point one so as soon as it comes
out you have no worries you will be able
to jailbreak it without a problem if you
haven't noticed this year has been
pretty scarce as far as major new
jailbreak we have had the new iPad 2 as
well as the iphone for us however with
the exception of jailbreakme we haven't
really had any major breakthroughs as
far as the jailbreaking of these two
devices all that is about to change as
there are going to be to jail breaks
that are currently being developed for
both the ipad 2 as well as the iphone 4s
there are two new developments first of
all muscle nerd the leader of the iphone
dev team has released screenshots as
well as video of the iphone 4s as well
as the ipad 2 being jailbroken on top of
that the entire chronic dev team is also
working towards their own iPad 2 /
iphone 4s jailbreak now as far as this
one goes we don't have any ETA saying
goes with the muscle no jailbreak
however if you were interested in
jailbreaking your iphone 4s for ipad 2
definitely look for a jailbreak to hit
in the coming weeks and as always if
you're looking for the most up-to-date
information definitely be sure to take a
look at the annotations on the top left
of the screen they will be able to link
to any of the new videos so for example
when either these jailbreak for iOS 5.1
comes out I will have an annotation you
can check it out and see what exactly is
going on with the latest jailbreak this
week is the week is widget task widget
task brings your multitasking bar into
Notification Center on iOS 5 devices
allowing you to easily get to your open
apps music controls and setting your
volume along with sbsettings this is one
of my favorite Notification Center
tweaks so if you're interested to search
widget task in cydia that's about it for
this week's episode of state of
jailbreak if you found this video
helpful definitely sure to leave it a
like rating and if you're interested in
more stay of jailbreak or just jailbreak
