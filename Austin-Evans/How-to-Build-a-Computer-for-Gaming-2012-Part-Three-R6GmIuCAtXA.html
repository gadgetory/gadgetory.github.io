with part three of my computer build
tutorial the last two videos have gone
over how to install everything in the
case but now it's time to hook it all up
and finish the computer time for the
really fun part wiring i'm actually
lying while hiring is no fun at all
however as long as you think a bit about
how everything connect it's really not
all that bad first step is to grab the
pair of SATA cables that came with the
motherboard plug both of these into the
connectors on the bottom right of the
board grab one and run it up to your
hard drive as you can see they're
notched so they can only go in one way
simply press it until it clicks now do
the same with the other cable for the
DVD drive now you should see some cables
attached to the case grab the one
labeled HDA which is your front panel
audio there is a single pin knock down
so you can only plug it in one way on
this motherboard it's an awkward spot
between the graphics card and the audio
connectors however with a bit of work it
will fit you'll also see your front
panel USB this works the same way except
that thankfully this is much easier to
install just plug it into the USB
connector on the bottom of the board and
you're good you'll also see a small
bundle of umbilical cables for the power
button and LEDs these need to be plugged
into the front panel connectors beside
the SATA ports if you look closely
you'll be able to see that where each
cable goes is marked on this tiny pin
out however if you look at your
motherboard manual you'll see it
recreated a bit better the most
important thing is to note the positive
and negative sides
it's obviously plugging them in wrong
won't work I won't go over each and
every cable but once you get going it
isn't that hard once you're done it
should look a little something like this
now the neatest thing in the world but
it works move over to the heatsink and
unwind the power cable this is a four
pin connector with a pair of notches to
make sure you plug it in correctly find
the CPU fan connector on your
motherboard and plug it in covering up
the camera with your arm is totally
optional of course let's continue
connecting fans the Antec 300 has a pair
of fans and both of them have the same
type of connector except as a three pin
you'll find another system fan header on
the bottom left of this motherboard to
hook up the exhaust
unfortunately this motherboard doesn't
have another connector so we're going to
have to come back for the third fan now
come down to the power supply unwrap the
cables and pull them out of the case
before we get into connecting everything
let's go over what cables do what the
biggest connector is your 20 pin
motherboard power cable this is what
powers everything on the motherboard and
it also uses an additional
for pain connector you'll also find a
six pin cable this is generally for
power and graphics cards and depending
on the power supply will sometimes have
an additional two pins for higher
powered cards moving on you'll see these
larger connectors which are known as
molex we really won't be using these in
our build however they can be useful for
using with adapters which we will be
doing you'll also see a pair of four pin
connectors these are for CPU power and
also connect to the motherboard lastly
we have these long fly cables which are
SATA power
this is what we'll be using to power our
hard drive and optical drive I know this
is a lot to go over but it's really
pretty simple the first thing is to plug
in the 20+4 pin motherboard power
connector it's best to route this behind
the motherboard tray but the cable is a
bit short on this power supply so just
push it all the way back once the main
cable is connected plug in the
additional four pin connector now you'll
need to power the graphics card the
Radeon 7770 only needs a single six pin
connector so president until it clicks
for the hard drive and DVD drive you'll
need to grab a pair of SATA power cables
and plug in the hard drive on bottom and
then the DVD up top again depending on
the power supply in case it's usually
best to run these behind the tray and
then back out to make sure everything is
as neat as possible but here we just
need to stretch everything to fit since
the power supply is unraveled we can now
connect the last fan I had a three pin
two molex adapter lying around which
will work perfect just connect the male
and female molex ends together and then
connect the fan to the 3-pin connector
and you're good to go last but not least
we've got to connect the CPU power which
are the pair of for Payne connectors
this motherboard only uses one so
located up at the top left of the board
and click it into place amazingly enough
we're almost there all our parts are
installed and everything is wired up it
looks like a minor computer explosion
now but we'll clean up our wiring a
minute
grab the large AC power connector and
plug the power supply into the wall then
grab a monitor and keyboard and connect
everything together now the scariest
part of the entire build seeing if it
actually works
hit the power button and give it a go if
it boots give yourself a high-five you
did it if not don't worry too much
usually it doesn't work first trying go
back and double check all of your
connections and make sure the power
supply is switched on once it does turn
on and get into the BIOS take a look at
the build or all the fans running how
about on the graphics card check the
power supply as well if all is good
there go into the BIOS and take a look
around
it should detect your CPU and installed
memory and your hard drive and DVD drive
should show up as well if everything
looks good you're almost there we're not
quite done yet though the inside is
still a bit of a mess cable management
is an important part of the build to
make future upgrades easier improving
air flow as well as just making the
build look better I won't show every
step along the way but the basic idea is
to group cables as neatly as possible
and use electrical ties to hold them
together I didn't do a great job here
but considering how short the power
supply cables are it's good enough and a
major improvement
now put the side panels back on screw
them in with your thumb screws and
you're all done congratulations you've
built a gaming computer if you guys
enjoyed this tutorial and found it
helpful I'd really appreciate if you
could leave a thumbs up if you want to
check out this exact build I'll have a
link on-screen now and also be doing a
giveaway of this PC soon so be sure to
subscribe to the channel so you don't
miss it or any of my other computer
build videos hopefully you enjoyed this
tutorial and since you made all the way
to the end thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
