so as I'm sure a lot you guys saw like
on Twitter and everything yesterday
morning I was asleep I was up in my I
was on the third floor and heard some
people yelling and so I kind of woke up
I had stayed up late working on that
browser test video the other day so
sleeping it on my off day but I heard
some yelling outside and I looked out my
window and I saw a bunch of smoke and so
I actually that had happened a couple
months ago I saw some smoke coming off
the roof and you end up just being the
chimney but when that happened I kind of
got you know really nervous about like
smoke and fire and all that kind of
stuff but um I saw that I grabbed like
my phone grabbed like clothes or just
put my clothes on right I was in bed I
ran outside and I saw tons of black
smoke coming off from downstairs so I I
pretty much had to go for it I mean I
grabbed a little safe which I'd like
some of my important like paperwork and
stuff I grabbed I had my phone I grabbed
my keys I grabbed a little like that
safe as well as I grabbed a MacBook I
didn't grab cameras computers none of
that I was pretty much whatever I could
carry so I ran downstairs
you know dumped it off in front of my
garage went around front and the fire
was huge I mean just in the couple
minutes since it had started pretty much
the whole front of the building was lit
up it was all just wood but yeah but
most importantly made sure everybody got
out so everybody in the building I was
just by I was by myself because it's
just my apartment but everyone else in
the building got out safe not a couple
dogs didn't but all the people were able
to get out you know we were able to say
evening a couple cars because the
garages were kind of looking like
they're gonna light it on fire but
obviously I got out with my cars you can
see what is a rough day huh so today
I've actually been kind of I don't even
know what I've been doing today but I
came over here everything even though
everything basically burned down I
decided you know at least it's worth a
shot good you know to go see if there's
anything left but uh let's go take a
look alright so this is the stairs going
up and up too much
so here it's pretty well been bulldozed
already as you can see but I think
what's cool is this is my this is the
back porch and this tree got half burnt
but the other half okay
kind of crazy when you think about it
but it really stopped I mean you see
this wood was fine but the wint because
the wind was blowing that way
see here that looks like a stove that
was part of my dryer the thing is I was
on the third floor so all three floors
kind of collapsed down in the
everything's been bulldozed
it's kind of hard everything's kind of
mixed up here part of a door my big part
of it look at this tree this tree Wow
pretty cool okay crazy you think that
all the stuff there's 12 people or 12
apartments here it's all just a pile now
mm-hmm just it's just weird rubble
rubble rubble rubble but clearly this
Bladerunner DVD survived no something
tells me I might not be able to at that
out hey man Blade Runner I don't wish
the bulldozer hadn't come through he
kind of messed everything up because I
know yesterday right after everything he
collapsed I saw some of my stuff I saw
like a PC case and I saw my like my
tanning room table is on top but uh
everything kind of got flattened here
you see they kind of got rid of half of
it also there's one bit of steel in the
entire building they shoulda stayed up
but uh I'm afraid everything's kind of
buried and ain't there all right I think
I finally found something so this is a
side panel for a case uh-huh
see here what was it one or two one I'm
gonna tell her that was okay that's it's
something cuz I just dug this iPad out
and if you can see it actually works it
was still on after I can see the screen
kind of
now you can see the icons there the
original iPad it still works screens
kind of stuffing him you see yeah you
see it's totally saying it was still on
that's that's pretty cool actually
all right so it looks like I've found
another PC Intel sure what this one was
clearly not a whole lot left of it oh
that's the that's the half 912 yeah
that's it
the half 912 yeah because it's got the
water cooling yep so this is actually my
very first computer
well the rapers should here I built
anyway not bad actually still kind of
here okay found something else um some
motherboard uh-huh okay well there okay
yeah this is a little laptop yeah cuz
there's the the heatsink some USB ports
SD card yeah whatever is left of a
laptop yeah yeah there yeah
I guess the fan would've been right no
I'm not really hard walking down there's
tons of nails I've already sliced my
hand open which of course I'm super pro
just gets all warped and twisted and
it's all the same color and it's kind of
hard to tell what's what
alright so we found a computer it's
actually kind of sort of decent you see
there's stuff inside of there's a hard
drive but uh it's Thai tow students like
50 pounds to the small stuff and here's
a TV yeah it's pretty much just the
metal though and there's nothing left of
that thing so uh yeah here's a hot fire
I mean you just totally just everything
just disappeared
alright so I thank my clothes
dry by now I found an iPod the iPod
fourth generation you can see the camera
they're funny everything else burned
away but I mean it's just the metal part
and pretty much it's perfect like he
sees dirty but like all the the plastic
in the glass all that stuff's gone but
uh kind of see me together you see the
iPod logo right there
so at least this is durable town what
was left of a Harry Potter and the
Goblet of Fire so first of all I think
actually looks pretty cool but you can
kind of see pages here and thumb through
them but it's mostly readable I mean I
think it actually looks cooler than I
did before I can't get with one hand but
uh see you read it pretty well it's
something it's hard to believe this was
a three-story building
it's just finished a pile now in fact is
even more because
they bulldoze about half of it over here
so see like past that mean thing right
there there's pretty much nothing it's
pretty much been cleared so that's it
the entire building is like in half of
this this lot it's crazy
clear away the old
all right well I didn't find that much
but I did find my original PC which is
awesome and I found that iPad that iPads
crazy it wasn't actually my as one of my
neighbors so I gave it back but that the
fact that it was still on is still
working mostly awesome
anyway I will be back obviously I don't
have any of my camera gear computers or
any of that kind of stuff so it'll take
a while to replace I gotta find a new
place to live first of all it's kinda
hard to you know be a hobo on the street
but now I'm actually I'm staying with
family so it's all good but uh I would
back but thank you guys so much for all
the the love I mean I to you guys would
broke my Twitter yesterday because I was
doing stuff all day long talking with
the fire department and I finally was
able to check my phone you guys
literally had broken the Twitter app
like I could not actually scroll through
all the tweets like I had to actually go
get my laptop just to be able to see all
the just the the the tweets that you
guys said it was amazing but anyway
yeah I'm gonna go in start rebuilding
but uh I will get you guys soon thanks
