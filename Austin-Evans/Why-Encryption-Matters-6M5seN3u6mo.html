recently but why does it matter
recently Apple wrote an open letter to
the US government explaining why forcing
companies to insert a backdoor could be
a bad idea
today most devices utilize some form of
encryption to protect your info and
they've been getting better and better
many new Android phones for example can
require a password before they even turn
on which is a lifesaver if your phone
falls into the wrong hands you can think
of encryption as a lock for your digital
life as soon as you lock your device
everything will stay nice and secure
thanks to encryption unless you happen
to have the key this key can take a few
forms from simple four-digit pen a more
elaborate password or even your
fingerprint just like the difference
between an old-school key and high-tech
retina scanner though your choice of
password matters if you have a
four-digit pen of one two three four it
would be able to be cracked almost
instantly where a longer phrase like hey
guys this is Austin would essentially
never be able to be brute forced this is
because passwords get exponentially more
difficult to break the more complex they
are with a four-digit number there are
only 10,000 possible combinations where
a phrase like hey guys this is Austin
has 766 septillion different
possibilities that's a number with 24
zeros behind it so good luck guessing
unless you happen to watch my videos on
the iPhone there's one more safeguard a
self-destruct button with the erase data
option enabled after 10 failed passcode
attempts the phone will throw away the
encryption key and reset making your
information essentially impossible to
recover it's important to remember this
isn't foolproof it only applies today
that's on your phone as soon as you
upload something to an online account
you don't own the key anymore
most companies like Google and Microsoft
have good track records of keeping your
info safe but if they don't control the
key to your data it doesn't matter there
are multiple laws in the works that
would force companies to leave in a back
door to unlock phones in certain
situations this could be a good thing
but it's the equivalent of leaving your
back door open you never know who might
take advantage with so much relies in
the digital world strong encryption is
incredibly important to have any sense
of security the next time someone asks
why encryption matters show them this
agree or disagree at least understand
why it's important</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
