everything we know about the iPhone 5
the first thing is going to be the
design and the design on the new iPhone
5 most likely will be redesigned
somewhat so from what we've heard it's
going to be a little bit of a mix
between the iPhone 4 and the iPhone 3GS
now I don't expect that will be made out
of plastic but it will get a little bit
more shape as opposed to the iPhone 4
which is very blocky now that also may
have a little bit of a tapered shape so
it may be a little bit thicker on the
top as far as and as opposed to on the
bottom I'm not sure about that but I
definitely do know that it will be a
little bit thinner and it should have a
little bit more of a tapered design
overall as far as up front on the screen
I do believe that will have a larger
display now we've heard talk all about
from everything from just the same size
3.5 inch display all the way up
something much larger is like an Evo 4G
display which of course is gonna be 4.3
inches now personally in my opinion I'm
gonna guess to be between 3.7 and 4
inches I don't think it's going to be
enormous something it's gonna be a 4.3
or 4.5 inch display but I do think it'll
be a pretty substantial bump over the
current iPhone 4 that we have today
internally I expect that we will have
very similar specs to the current iPad 2
so that means is a dual-core 1 gigahertz
processor of course known as the Apple
a5 this is really quite fast in the iPad
2 and I don't see any reason why they
wouldn't put it in the iPhone 5 also it
expect a fairly decent bump in RAM but
wouldn't be surprised if we do see 768
megabytes or perhaps even a full
gigabyte of RAM very very obviously it
is going to be running iOS 5 when it is
launched as far as the camera goes there
has been a split so some people say it's
going to keep the exact same 5 megapixel
camera from the current iPhone 4 which
is certainly not half bad
but a lot of other people myself
included believe that it will have a
brand new 8 megapixel camera so what
this new 8 megapixel camera could do is
of course dramatically increase the
picture and video quality like I said
the iPhone 14 was actually really quite
good however there are some new cameras
that have been coming out for example in
the nokia n8 as well as the Samsung
Galaxy S 2 that have really started to
surpass the iPhone 4 camera so I do
think that there is some room then to
improve the quality perhaps even add
1080p video to the mix as far as the
release date goes it does appear to be
coming very soon so according to the
Guardian Apple has already shipped out
all of the iPhone 5s to their various
carriers around the world for testing
now if you're not familiar with how this
works of course a carrier before they
begin selling the phone they do need to
test it make sure everything works
properly
so based on this and of course in
conjunction with all the other rumors
and speculation we've heard I would
definitely pin the iPhone 5 release
somewhere between the middle of
September and the beginning of October
anyway guys that's about it for my
pre-release overview of the iPhone 5 if
you enjoyed the video definitely be sure
to leave a like rating down below and of
