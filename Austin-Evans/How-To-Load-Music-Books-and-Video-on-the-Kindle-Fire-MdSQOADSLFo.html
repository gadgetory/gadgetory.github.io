tutorial showing you how to install
pictures video music and documents from
your computer over to your Amazon Kindle
Fire now this method will work the exact
same way if you have a Mac or Windows
computer and all you'll need is your
computer your Kindle Fire and a microUSB
cable now this does not come with the
Kindle Fire however it's pretty common
more likely you will have one sitting
around somewhere so all you need to do
is go ahead and connect it and your
Kindle Fire will say you can now
transfer files from the computer to
Kindle so as far as the Kindle goes
we're all done with that and we can come
over to the computer so no matter what
if you have Windows or Mac you will see
the Kindle pop up you might have to look
under my computer or devices but you
will see a large amount of folders now
we can't ignore these for the moment we
need to go ahead and collect what we
want to bring over to the Kindle so for
example if you want to bring over music
you will want to go ahead and find your
iTunes folder if you're bringing it over
from iTunes or wherever you have all of
your data so just taking for example
iTunes go ahead and go over to iTunes
media come in to music and then of
course you can just select whatever
songs documents etc etcetera that you
want now for right for just this
purposes of this video I've gotten a
little bit of everything about a PDF
file got an mp3 got a word doc a 720p
mp4 video file as well as a 14 megapixel
megapixel JPEG so just a little bit of
everything to go ahead and give you guys
a demo of how this works so all you need
to do is go ahead and open up the Kindle
again again it should just be under your
computer if it didn't pop up
automatically let's go just bring a few
things over so the first thing is the
music so we go ahead and copy that and
then you should see a music folder here
simply open it up and drag it / copy and
paste it and go ahead and just copy that
over very simple and again for documents
we can go ahead and grab the PDF as well
as the docx file drag it and drop it in
take just a second to copy and we've got
that done and just continuing on just so
you guys get paid just of it we also
have pictures drag the picture in should
only take a second and finally grab our
720p high definition video drag it and
drop it in and we're going to be good to
go there once you're done moving all
your data over to the Kindle simply
click disconnect and then you can simply
disconnect the USB cable now once we
have all this done we have a few
different things to get to our documents
music etc so of course for music we can
just open it up you'll see here that
song
Dover is here and we can really play it
we also do have our pictures and video
which is going to be in the gallery
application so for pictures we can click
on that once it loads up properly anyway
here area so there is our picture we can
take a look at that we also do have our
video suite back over here and tap on
that and of course there we go we had
the full 720p video running on the
Kindle so you guys it's been about it
for my tutorial showing you how to bring
over documents video music etc etc over
to your Kindle Fire very very simple
very easy to do and hopefully this
tutorial helped you out anyway guys if
