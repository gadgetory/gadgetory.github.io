to have my this application of you which
gonna go over my top five favorite apps
of all time
I'll also be sure to watch out for I've
got my gal Khan promo code giveaway
still going on it'll still be going on
for a few days so you guys if you
haven't gotten in on that go do it now
link be in the sidebar I've also got
I've got a new case yesterday which I'm
still not sure I may or may not review
it but wait for that I might obviously
what I can do
also I've just installed Ubuntu Linux on
my computer and I gotta say I'm
impressed so look out for some videos
talking about that later too okay let's
get this one started
okay so we'll start listening out with
my fifth top application ever which is
going to be called Pandora now I'm sure
most of you guys know it have it and all
about it but for those who don't I'll
give a brief explanation pandora is
basically internet radio which is a kind
of like normal radio you kind of think
of it like that
but the thing is it strains entirely off
the internet and it's not set up like
normal where you know you might on the
normal on radio whatever you go flip to
a different station for this it's
totally customizable you go first what
you do is you search an artist to when
you very first start you search an
artist that you want let's say you like
Led Zeppelin okay so you search Led
Zeppelin let's say and then as channel
which will be about Led Zeppelin will
come up okay
now it'll play some Led Zeppelin might
play some Black Sabbath's some police
whatever the who it doesn't matter but
and if you like it you know you can keep
like that but you can totally customize
it you can go in and you can go in and
add other artists that you like so it'll
be a big nicer variety so you have a
bunch of different artists which will
bounce down you and then you can also go
down to individual songs you can you go
okay I like this song and I like this
song and the way that works is that once
you're playing it you will have a small
thumbs up and thumbs down icon when you
hit the thumbs up the Pandora will
remember that you like that particular
song and it will try to play more songs
that are similar to it okay
now when you hit the thumbs down icon
what that does is it basically just the
song starts playing it will go to the
next song
if Pandora will never play that song on
that particular station again it'll try
to try to not play songs like that and I
will say thumbs down it does you you
will occasionally use that just because
when you sum just song that just doesn't
seem to fit you don't like whatever
thumbs down it you don't have to worry
about it ever again and of course if you
do want it only works on the sync one
station and you can make as many
stations as you want so you know I mean
if it plays a good song you might like
but not compared to the other music
you're listening to right then
thumbs down it don't worry about it
Pandora throw one big downside well
there's two downsides and they're not
big the to downsize to Pandora in my
opinion are for one you can only play
you can only skip six songs what it is
there's a small skip button that if you
don't like the whatever song you know
it's not thumbs up it does the same
thing but you can't you can't do it like
that basically that you're listening to
a song whatever and you say oh I don't
want like this one listen to this you
hit next well then it'll skip it but
you'd only do that six times per hour
per station it's sound like small deal
and sometimes it is I mean you obviously
won't you all just be skipping through
but the way it work around for that is
you all you have to do is just create
another station because it only you know
the six count only chance on the one
station no big deal the last thing is
the fact that when you want to listen to
certain music you can create stations
for about the artists or about a
specific song the thing is you there's
no guarantee whatsoever that you
actually hear the song you're wanting
and there's no way really to get it so
that's a slight downside but overall
Pandora is really tight it's really cool
honestly definitely if you had not
checked this out go get it right now and
you will not be disappointed okay
so my number four application of all
time is going to be Sentinel now I will
not get into it here because I already
have a full review on it which I will
have a link to but basically a sentinel
is just an awesome awesome game it is
back down it was $2.00 back down to
$1.00 for a limited time so again guys
check it out at the very least it's a
really awesome app it's my number four
and I just love it my third all-time
favorite application it's going to be
called I mob online again this is
another one a really big most of you
guys will know what I'm talking who I'm
talking about here but basically I mob
is just a really awesome online game
where basically you are you're a mob
member and you as you you do missions to
make money to get experience
you level up with you different stats
whether it's attack defense whether it's
a stamina to attack more people health
to you know obviously to take out more
damage or energy to do more missions
it's really customizable gain and it's
one it's it's easily one of my very
favorites I have literally since came
out three four months ago I've played it
at least I mean open it up a couple
times a day every day the whole time and
yeah it's so much fun because you as you
continue you can fight people as much as
you want um there's also marking so if
you have a rival that you might not be
able to take down you mark him and then
basically you'll put a bounty on his
head and other people will attack him
and attack them until he's dead and you
get the bounty and obviously when you
die all it just takes a while to get
your health back up then there are all
kinds of weapons and it's really cool
because you have mob members as well and
the way mob members work is when you get
them all member through the forum or
through codes or however you get the
however you get them basically they are
they work for you even though it
technically that they can have all kinds
of other people but basically whether it
was each person that you have can carry
one one main weapon one defensive weapon
in one vehicle and basically it's your
job to buy all the different things and
as you go on and level up you'll get
better weapons everything basically like
if you have a team of members well then
you should have 80 guns 80 shields 80
cars and it just in there totally it's
just totally fairies um there are also
respect points that you can buy respect
points are basically like you level when
you get those you can level up with them
and get MoMA members get money and those
are really cool and from time to time
they're free but generally they're you
get a dollar three dollars five
depending on how many you want now I
will say this although they are handy
you absolutely do not have to buy it I
mob as a free game and you if you want I
have never paid him any to play I mob
and I'm just I'm doing pretty decent
right now so don't don't think that just
because you can't those if you want an
edge you want to spend a couple dollars
that's totally fine that's up to you if
you don't want to that's no problem I
mob it's gone a long long ways from when
it first came out and it was buggin
glitchy and if you have not at least
tried it played it for a little while
you have not done that yet I would say I
recommend go check it out I'm obvious
just a really cool app my number two app
of all time is gal con the full version
I've already reviewed and giveaway I'm
sorry I've got a giveaway for two gal
con promo codes and I also have a link
for that if you go check out the review
and if you have not it gotten into the
giveaway go do it now because it is my
number to happen it's awesome my number
one application my opinion of all time
is going to be called app sniper now if
you don't have apps nipe or at least
something there are a couple of things
similar to them but add snipers the real
deal if you don't have at least
something similar to it there it's
absent I per is basically the premise is
it will give you a list of all the new
applications to come out and they'll
also give you a list of all the on sale
applications okay
now I'll say this the dollar price of
this you will pay that off so fast it's
it's just it's just unreal every time
there's a sale you will see it if you
have an app like I recently I've sniped
which that's what you do ice night which
it'll basically just tell you when when
they go on sale anything I snag Crowell
several months ago was probably four or
five months ago
it was $5 it was a $5 application I
liked the idea of it but I did not want
to spend $5 basically so I sniped it and
it's been sniped for the past four or
five months then guess was just the
other day and went down to $0.99 absent
I per said hey crawls down to 99 cents
I went is linked me straight to it went
bought it in 10 seconds and it was done
if I had not had AB sniper I would never
noticed and that's just an i I mean
literally I don't buy apps off that
store so much just because there's no
way to find them
I go AB sniper I find them and then AB
sniper will link me to the app in the
App Store I'll buy it and take care of
it I won't go
- in-depth on it it's pretty simple
there's some nice tips and tricks and I
may do an in-depth application review on
it at a later date if you guys want me
to but uh there's a light version of app
sniper never tried it I don't know so I
can't really give you any advice there
but there's definitely a reason why a
sniper is my all-time favorite
application be sure to check out xergiok
