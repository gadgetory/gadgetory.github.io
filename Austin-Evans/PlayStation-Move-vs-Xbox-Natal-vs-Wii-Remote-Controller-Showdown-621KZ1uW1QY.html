and today I'm here with the video on the
latest controllers for Sony Microsoft
and Nintendo now of course in 2006 when
the Wii was launched it came with the
Wii Remote and Nunchuk then really
revolutionized the whole controllers you
know motion controls that was that was a
big deal well today we have two new
contenders we have the Microsoft Xbox
Natal which really looks really
promising as well as yesterday
Sony announced a PlayStation Move which
is similar to the Wii in the Wii Remote
but it also adds some elements from the
mid slalom so stay tuned I'm going to
sort the whole thing out and get you
guys informed on what's what so anyway
let's get this one started
okay so let's begin with the PlayStation
Move which is the latest controller that
has come out and it actually just came
out yesterday so sum it up it's
basically very similar to a Wii Remote
and that it has two things you have the
main Move controller and then you also
have a secondary order they call it a
sub controller and using these in
conjunction with each other will allow
you to you know they both have motion
sensors and all the kinds of stuff very
similar to like the Wii so you know you
can do like this and everything but
there's it's a lot more advanced now if
you look at the main Move controller it
has a ball on the top and what this ball
is is that it has some LEDs inside it
which can make it change any color now
the way the Move controller works is
that it is in addition to a camera that
is put on top of your TV or somewhere
where you can straight in front of you
wherever that you're playing so the
camera picks up not only your body
movement but it washes that ball on the
end of the controller so as you move it
not only is it tracking you with these
sensors inside the controller is also
the camera is following your but your
body movements as well as the LED on the
top
of the controller so that it has kind of
a fail-safe where no matter what you're
doing it has two points of data to pull
in so it's going to be really accurate
plus one really cool thing is that the
PlayStation controller it lights in
different colors as well so let's say
I'm playing it right now okay well
obviously I'm wearing a register I've
got a white background okay well what is
wanting to do is going to change into a
color that it is not inside the camera
so right now there's no green around me
for example so it's going to turn green
likewise it can turn pink orange it can
turn into almost any color it's pretty
really just very very cool in addition
it sounds like a lot of games will be
able to change the color as you move and
stuff so from inside the game let's say
you know you know your sword fighting or
something well it my turn flash red when
you you know hit hit or something the
possibilities are really really
impressive so that's the PlayStation
Move controller it is scheduled to be on
sale by the end of the year likely by
the holiday season and pricing hasn't
been announced yet for most of it but I
plan on bundling it with the ps3 they
plan on selling the controller
separately and that but they do say that
for $99 they will sell you the camera
and both the main Move controller and
the sub controller so $400 a little bit
expensive but for what you're getting it
very well could be really solid okay so
the next controller has got to be the
Xbox 360 for the Natal now the Natal is
a totally different way than both the
Wii and move now the way than the toe
works is that there's no control
whatsoever you don't hold anything
nothing everything is done via a camera
and I like on the PlayStation I suppose
you just mount it on your TV whatever
whatever you're going to be pointing at
for the game and the way this works is
that the Xbox entirely is very very very
clever software that allows you to it
recognizes your hands basically it makes
a wireframe animation of your body
inside the Xbox so it can tell when you
do just about everything now this is a
really cool idea I think
because you know they've even showed
demos of like you know you can take your
own objects so let's say I'm playing a
skateboard game well I can take my own
skateboard my real skateboard pick it up
put it in front of camera it will scan
it then it will start following that so
I could be moving the skateboard though
standing on it though I mean the
possibilities really are endless now
that's all we don't know a ton about it
we've seen a lot of demos and the really
cool thing about this is it really is I
mean like I said is limitless I mean the
way they can actually scan objects let's
say I want to play like a first-person
shooter so all I'm gonna do is let's say
I have like a BB gun or you know some
maybe might even the game might come
bundled with the own fake gun so I can
actually it would stand the gun and it
starts following it so I can actually
start you know doing like this just like
maybe like Annunaki game only this is
going to be a lot more precise because
I'm actually can you know walk forward
or lean or however it's going to work
and again there's a lot of you know
really interesting and cool ways they
can do it one of the demos was like like
balls were like flying towards you so
you get go like that and I catch them it
is really really cool whereas you know
the Wii and most likely the PlayStation
they're gonna be kind of cool because
you'll be holding controllers you know
like that and you can follow you but
then at all I think is going to be a lot
different just because you're actually
physically you know doing everything
it's not you're pressing buttons you're
actually you know hit like like make
virtual buttons you know and your
imagination go get that hit that I mean
there's really a ton of really cool
stuff that can happen within that's all
now as with a Playstation we don't know
exactly when it will be released
although it should be probably like I
said holiday season of this year no word
on pricing yet although they did say
that it will be it will work with all
existing Xbox 360s as well as they will
likely sell it either in a bundle with a
normal Xbox 360
they might rework the Xbox have it
installed inside it we don't know yeah
but in any case Natal is really really
promising and
we haven't played it yet but it really
does look good okay so the last is
obviously going to be the Wii Remote in
the nunchuck now obviously this came out
in 2006 with the launch of the weed so
we're pretty familiar with this but I'll
go ahead and run you guys to it anyway
and show you how it compares so first
you have just the standard Wii Remote
this is pretty cool it does use two
double-a batteries where as the
playstation is going to have her
chargeable but it has a lot of buttons
no but it fits your hand really nicely
it has a sensor on the front as well as
a port right here where you can plug in
the nunchuck and you can also plug in a
special accessory called the Motion Plus
which is slots right in and it gives a
third element of dimension to the motion
sensing so this by itself is actually
not that accurate it's pretty decent for
you know bowling or something but
without you know the motion plus you
know you have trouble you know actually
doing one to one pickup so with the
motion plus it really does enhance it a
lot and it is very very similar to the
PlayStation Move especially with the sub
controller because they're very similar
in the fact that but they both have you
know on this on this sub controller or
the nunchuck you know they have a an
analog stick and buttons or anything and
they also both have they both have wrist
straps which of course no one uses
unless they're UTV or something ok guys
so that's pretty much it you know I'm
pretty excited about all three of these
you know the Wii it might not be the
most high-tech but it's still fun and
you know it's hard to argue with you
know having almost 4 years of games and
everything I mean that's a huge head
start
the Natal it's amazing really I mean I
love the idea as long as it works right
no not using any controllers at all or
using items around your house as a
controller the PlayStation really is in
the middle I think it uses the camera
and some of the motion sensing and
everything of the Natal but it also uses
a controller set very similar to the Wii
so it's kind of like
mix between the two and little to be
honest I don't think that you go wrong
with any of the three but we have a lot
of fun that's all if it works right
you're going to be amazing and the
PlayStation has a pretty cool niche I'm
not sure how successful it's going to be
but it does look like it's got a lot of
problem ok guys so what do you think are
you really interested in the tall or
maybe are you going to be all set up to
start using the PlayStation Move early
just all okay with your Wii Remote we
should believe in the comments also be
sure to subscribe to the channel where I
will always be keep you up to date with
tech news reviews the whole deal so
anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
