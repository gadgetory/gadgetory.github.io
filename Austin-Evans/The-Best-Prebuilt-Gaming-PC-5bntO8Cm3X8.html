coarser 1 Pro a $3,000 gaming PC but is
it worth it
big show that's of course they are
presenting that side a little bit early
so the Corsair 1 launched a few months
ago however this is the new pro model
with a gtx 980ti so it's not a huge box
what we're getting here is a very
powerful gaming PC and that is actually
really small ok so one of the things you
should know about the Corsair 1 is that
it is water-cooled which is part of the
reason why they're able to get so much
hardware and such a uniquely shaped
chest the footprint of the one is
actually smaller than a lot of gaming
consoles what you're trading off here is
it's just a very tall system but I think
for a lot of pcs that's really not going
to be an issue it also is pretty much
entirely made of metal so heavy before
we get too far into it let's see what
else we have in the box which doesn't
seem like anything at all yep a power
cable it should give you a lot of great
accessories with your brand new 3000 all
ganging PC but wait hang on hand I'm
sorry I was wrong there is a dual band
Wi-Fi antenna so you know it's all an
accessory pack so I am really curious to
see what's inside the Corsair one from
the front you don't have a whole lot is
basically just a power button as well as
the USB port an HDMI presumably to make
the TR set up easier what's interesting
is both on the left and right side you
can see this thing has massive radiators
I gotta say I actually like the look of
this a lot of course Corsair has made
more than their fair share of RGB stuff
but with this we're getting something
that's a little bit more understated on
top you have a fairly large metal grate
with what I assume is a 200 millimeter
fan there's also this button which when
I press it the whole top panel actually
comes off so it's still cabled in here
of course I get a new PC and I'm
literally taking it apart immediately
inside you'll find me 500 watt small
form-factor power supply as well as the
rear of the graphics card so it's
interesting is it actually has all the
HDMI display ports cables coming out of
it because obviously no one's plugging
stuff in to the top of the system move
around back and then I do have the power
lead but also all the video outputs that
are being routed from the top of the
case and also click it has a fairly
standard looking motherboard here which
is also where you plug in the Wi-Fi
antenna as a $3,000 gaming PC you would
hope
has pretty small specs and it most
certainly does not disappoint and one of
the nice things about the one Pro that
is actually really easy to work on so
press one button to pull off the fan as
well as the shroud take out two screws
you have access to the full system
inside it has an Intel Core i7 7700 K
and what's nice about this thing is that
is going to be fully water coolers own
dedicated radiator you can also get a
look at the MIT X motherboard as well as
these 32 gigabytes of memory that's
installed now I really do appreciate
just how easy it is to actually work on
this it's also walking a 480 gigabytes
nvme SSD as well as a 2 terabyte hard
drive take two more screws off the top
and we get access to the graphics card
so of course here is going all out here
so this is the gtx 980ti
and again it's also going to have a
custom water cooler on it now what's
interesting about the design here is
that there's going to be a thin 240
millimeter radiator on either side of
the system so essentially it's doing is
it's using this 200 millimeter fan on
the top to pull air up and in through
the system and exhaust without the top
kind of like the Mac Pro I'm going to
give Corsair big props this is a very
thoughtfully designed system but of
course the big question is can it
actually gain spoiler alert with a gtx
1080i and a core i7 to start with gaming
we have GTA 5 now here running on the LG
ultrawide monitor at 38 40 by 1600 with
basically all the settings cranked up
the 1080i has no problem running this at
anywhere between 80 to 100 frames per
second which of course should be no
surprise considering that this is like a
$750 graphics card now of course I want
is generally pretty quiet you can hear
that spinning up a little bit right now
under full load but considering this is
a very small form-factor water-cooled PC
it's not bad
moving on we have dirt 4 so Codemasters
always does a good job with their PC
games and this is no exception here
running at full resolution and pretty
much all the things totally cranked up
where anywhere between 50 to 60 frames
per second I've got to say with that
1080i and this huge nice display this is
a really cool experience
so ashes of the singularity you might
not be the most popular game in the
world but it's one of my favorite games
to benchmark new systems so another does
it take advantage of DirectX 12 but it's
really nice and here with basically
everything cranked to high settings the
full resolution really anywhere between
50 to 60 frames per second I know a game
that can definitely take advantage of
the Corsair 1 Pro
this Deus Ex mankind divided now running
onto ultra wide we're getting anywhere
between 60 to 70 frames per second on
high settings MEDLINE does this game
look great on the display but more
importantly it really does go to show
just how nice a game can look once you
have some serious 1080i power so is it
worth it it's $3,000 this definitely is
not a cheap system if you wanted to
build a similar spec yourself you'll be
able to save about $600 however what
you're giving up here is not only the
small form factor case but almost more
importantly all the water cooling that
makes it all work it's going to be
difficult to build a small form factor
system with this level of power almost
regardless of price and you also do get
a two-year warranty as well as the
simplicity of being able to pull it out
of the box and be good to go
there are also models of the Corsair one
that are a bit cheaper in torre√≥n years
overkill so if you're looking for a
small form factor system like this I'm
going to say it's a lot better than I
expected so what do you guys think about
the Corsair one pro let me know in the
comments below and I will catch you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
