i'm here with news on the latest iphone
OS 3.1 point to update as well as a very
promising new jailbreaking program known
as black rain let's get this one started
Apple has just released the OS 3.1 point
to update for the iphone and ipod touch
which contains a number of bug fixes
such as the issue that causes your
iphone to not wake up aka coma mode a
problem that kills the cell services
occasionally and a bug that causes
crashes during video streaming while
these fixes are quite important as with
all updates and especially in light of
the recent jailbreaking troubles do not
update if you are or plan to be
jailbroken Apple is now digitally
signing each update which makes
jailbreaking especially difficult
currently both the pwnage tool and
redsnow cannot jailbreak 3.1 point2 and
there is no estimated release time frame
on either these programs to be running
just be sure to ignore the update
prompts iTunes gives you this certainly
doesn't mean the end of all jailbreaking
as we know it as it's far more likely
that along with the bug fixes Apple
closed one or more of the holes that the
dev team was leveraging still though for
the sake of your jailbreak do not update
res dough and pwnage tool will all
likely be updated with a new way of
hacking the iphone and ipod touch soon
so sit tight in the meantime and you
most likely won't have to wait even that
long as the new program is unaffected by
the fixes noted iphone hacker george
hotz also known as jihad is in the late
stages of creating an all-in-one program
allow you to jailbreak any device
including the ipod touch 3rd generation
which is the only devices yet to been
jailbroken the program is going to be
called Black Rain and a release is most
likely coming perhaps as soon as in a
day regardless I will definitely be
watching out for black reign once it
comes out and we'll be posting full
tutorials on its use is confirmed to
work on 3.1 point2 as well which is
obviously a huge plus in the meantime
watch the official black reign site
which will be updated with that program
once it is live</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
