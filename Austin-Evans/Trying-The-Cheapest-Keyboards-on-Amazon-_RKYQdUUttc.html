the cheapest keyboards on Amazon but the
question is are they actually any good
so we take a look at a lot of expensive
things on the channel but what I was
really curious about is whether it
actually makes sense to go extremely
extremely cheap and what better way to
start then with well a bunch of
keyboards of varying degrees of quality
but all of which are actually really
affordable to start out with we have the
verbatim slimline chorded keyboard so
when we purchase this it was only five
dollars and 21 cents on Amazon but now
it's available with a mouse for ten
dollars and 21 cents so you know quality
Millie do we have adjustable tote legs a
stylish and slim design as well as
advanced tactile keys something I look
for in all of my five dollar keyboards
but importantly it supports Windows XP
2000 Vista seven and eight so you know
if you need a suite Windows XP keyboard
they've got you covered there are tons
of dedicated gaming keyboards things
like mechanical stuff but I think really
the question I want to answer with this
video is do you really need to spend 30
40 50 60 or even $100 plus on a keyboard
I mean of course you don't have to but
what's the real difference you're
getting British something like this
which is only going to cost you about $5
well you get better packaging on the
other ones that's for sure I mean I'll
give them this this is about as slim as
the keyboard gets it's definitely the
one of the most lightweight keyboards
I've ever used shout out to the not a
Windows key that's on the bottom here
it's not at that windows it's the square
key you know the square key at first
glance the layout seems to be fine we
have basically all the keys we would
expect including a slightly
weird-looking Enter key in a smaller
back space we also interestingly have
power sleep and wake does that extra
work oh it works wait can I wake up wake
up wake up I don't think anyone's going
to think that this is a gaming keyboard
but it doesn't feel too bad some of the
things I really noticed is that it is a
little bit on the spring your side and
that's definitely because this is very
much a rubber dome style keyboard but no
make it live with it is it going to last
a long time
probably not can you use it for a little
while and actually be completely
confident at gaming and a little bit of
typing and basic use absolutely next up
we have the
basics wired keyboard at a whopping
$13.22 now it's something like 36
hundred reviews
it seems do you want the motor popular
keyboards on Amazon full stop what
they've done here is it's a little bit
more of a slimmer design so it does have
a sort of built-in rest as opposed to
the other one which did have the feet
it's also got a lot of glossy glossy
black plastic oh boy alright so yeah
that velocity-- black plastic as you can
probably see with three seconds of usage
it's going to get a little a little
finger printing a little dirty but I
guess you can look past that when you're
spending 13 bucks on a keyboard the
layout thankfully is a lot nicer we have
a full-size backspace key the enter key
it's all as you would expect we can have
a few things like media keys which is a
nice little addition on such a cheap
keyboard oh we can get a little shortcut
to the calculator I guess that's useful
and most importantly of all we have an
actual Windows key not a weird square
I'm sure the licensing cost was
tremendous on such a cheap keyboard I
can tell this immediately has a better
fuel now it is definitely still membrane
keyboard it's not going to be anywhere
near as nice and something like a
mechanical keyboard to type on but it's
a lot less mushy than the verbatim and I
really do appreciate that it does have a
standard layout we even have the media
control keys you know I will say almost
immediately that while I do prefer this
for typing
I actually don't quite like the feel for
gaming it just feels like there's like
maybe a little bit more latency or a
little bit of like input lag it just
feels a little different and a big part
of that actually could be the fact that
the key switches aren't quite as
responsive that's a little weird next up
we have a Bluetooth keyboard or more
specifically the cheapest Bluetooth
keyboard with Amazon Prime that we could
find
so at $15 this will it's a lot smaller
I'll say that it's a whole lot smaller
ways this is actually a full size
keyboard okay well that looks exactly
like an Apple keyboard it's really weird
at how light it is though uh oh you have
a battery I do we know we need a that
double a you think oh wait they're
triple A's I lied
yeah those are one of the advantages of
going with the Bluetooth keyboard is it
does support multiple devices including
Mac's as well as iOS devices which
especially evident when you look at the
keyboard layout which is just realized
is the Mac layout with the command and
the option and the control so we do have
a Windows key and windows mode if we
switch over to it if I can figure how to
do that due to a slight oversight and
that the PC we're testing with doesn't
that bluetooth we're gonna use my phone
oh boy
I love being prepared for videos like
this anyway it looks so let's give this
a try so thankfully it is full-size one
thing I do immediately notice though is
that it's kind of flimsy I mean if you
look I can barely bend it and there's a
lot of flexing it shouldn't be a big
deal unless you're a very aggressive
type err are their aggressive typers if
you think oh yeah look at that if you're
really pressed down the whole thing
flexes it should be okay though but no I
just connected why it's okay so maybe
super cheap Bluetooth keyboards not to
move
you know actually we'll say the keyboard
doesn't feel too bad actually know what
it feels like it kind of feels like the
original version of this Apple keyboard
which is like what 80 bucks or something
it's not quite as nice to be fair it's
all made of plastic but it doesn't feel
bad at all
I love that I can change the brightness
what's well face you gotta cool for 15
bucks this isn't too bad I mean yes you
should plan ahead and make sure your
computer supports Bluetooth but even if
you are singing it to something like
your iPad or iPhone or something this
really is surprisingly decent for
fifteen dollars I'm kind of impressed
last but not least we have the re RK 100
plus the cheapest RGB keyboard on Amazon
which we picked up for about fifteen
dollars however right now especially
available for ten dollars and 73 cents
so yeah this is actually the cheapest
keyboard here technically as of this
very second this is another one of the
options that we chose not only just
because it was the cheapest but also has
a fairly decent amount of reviews it's
got four hundred ninety two on Amazon
right now and that looks like a much
more beefy keyboard even though it's
still incredibly lightweight plug this
guy in and holy RGV Batman that is
actually kind of a cool look now unlike
most RGB keyboards that do have a much
more comprehensive set of software to
kind of like you to customize the zones
with this guy we can either turn
or turnoff which conveniently replaces
our right windows key but regardless we
have RGB so let's get this guy try
alright yeah this is actually a lot
better than that Amazon keyboard one of
the things that immediately noticed is
that where that one felt a little bit
sticky the keys actually pop up a lot
quicker here and I'm sure if you open it
up it's still going to be a membrane
keyboard but between that and the RGB
I've got to say this is actually totally
a decent looking keyboard no no the key
caps themselves aren't RGB and it is of
course all made of plastic but I kind of
like the look of sort of illuminating
the backside with the RGB as opposed to
doing the individual keys it's not
customisable but it looks legitimately
different than pretty much any other
gaming keyboard out there something I
immediately notice is that there's a
nice little bit of texture on the keys
themselves it doesn't make a big
difference but it does give you a little
bit more grip with your fingers it's not
something huge or anything that sort of
blows me away but it is a nice little
bit of an addition importantly it feels
good for gaming it is not as good as a
mechanical keyboard for example but
realistically unless you're actually
really skilled unlike me you're probably
not gonna notice a huge difference I
know I'm not any better with this then I
mechanical keyboard or vice versa trio
yeah there you go well that was worth it
so should you buy the cheapest keyboard
on Amazon it's actually not a totally
crazy idea now the tree is definitely my
favorite
I like the RGB for gaming it has a good
feel and it's got a decent layout and
realistically if you're spending less
than say 30 40 dollars this really
should be the keyboard you pick up I am
very very impressed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
