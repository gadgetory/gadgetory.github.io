promises big changes but is it worth the
upgrade after Windows a Microsoft had a
big task ahead of them they need a
single OS that works well on everything
from a desktop to tablet and its mission
accomplished mostly the first thing
you'll notice is the return of the Start
menu instead of having an entirely
separate interface when you hit the
Windows key now it's a smaller menu that
still includes the Universal search and
the useful Live Tiles one of the biggest
things that jumps out to me is just how
fast it is start to type the name of an
app and it immediately pops up but you
can also do a search online just as
easily a big reason for this is the
addition of Cortana like on Windows
Phone and soon to be on iOS and Android
Cortana works out a lot like Google now
you can search using voice and the
results are pretty impressive they can't
quite match the natural language
searches of Google but it's totally
usable being able to set reminders and
keep track of your flights and calendar
is nice on your phone and it's just as
useful on your PC Windows 10 has also
gotten a fresh coat of paint it's a
clean look without going all-in on Metro
which looks nice on a phone or tablet
but could be awkward on a PC Microsoft
really did give the desktop some love
this time around
snap has been one of my favorite
features since Windows 7 and it now
gives you the option of automatically
adding other windows to the side of the
screen we've also got tasks view which
gives you multiple desktops this has
been one of the most useful features on
Mac for a long time now and while it can
be a little awkward to switch between
desktops it's an awesome addition to
Windows 10
maybe the built-in apps have also been
updated the Windows Store has apps games
music and video all in one place unlike
before you'll be able to use apps as a
normal window instead of being forced to
go fullscreen which makes a lot more
sense
Microsoft is also finally retired
internet explorer in favor of the edge
browser is rocking a new much nicer
design and like most of Windows 10 it's
really fast you can still use Internet
Explorer if you need it but the days of
immediately installing a new browser
might just be over another big area
Microsoft focused on is gaming DirectX
12 is the backbone that gives developers
much lower level access to the hardware
which can result in nearly four times
the draw calls don't expect your games
to perform four times better on Windows
10 but for new games going forward this
should make a big difference to
performance speaking of a game that
hasn't always had the best performance
a Windows 10 edition of Minecraft based
on Pocket Edition it doesn't have the
same support for mods and all the
features of the full version just yet it
runs smoothly even on lower end hardware
and it's free if you already own the PC
version of Minecraft you can also enable
game DVR to record gameplay without
needing dedicated screen capture
software and it works surprisingly well
another addition is the new Xbox app
this allows you to access your friends
download new games and stream from the
Xbox one you can test to see what your
connection will support but as long as
both the Xbox and PC are on the same
network you should be good it's an
impressive setup plug in an Xbox one
controller to your computer and it's
basically like you're right in front of
an Xbox image quality is slightly
compressed but it's totally usable and
there's minimal lag even when streaming
over Wi-Fi there's a lot right with
Windows 10 and if you're on Windows 7 or
8 you can get a free upgrade
assuming you're up-to-date you should
see a notification where you can
register to get your free update a few
people have had problems getting it but
for the most part it seems to be a
fairly smooth rollout so far anyway I've
run into a few weird bugs mostly to do
with graphic glitches and even with
updated drivers metal computers are
going to be ready for DirectX 12 there
are also a few options you'll probably
want to turn off including disabling the
default advertising ID turning off Wi-Fi
cents which automatically shares your
network password with your contacts and
disabling peer-to-peer sharing of
updates to other computers online
Windows 8 was ambitious and ultimately a
failure but thankfully Windows 10 is a
much better OS it might not be a bad
idea to hold off a few months for the
minor bugs to get worked out but Windows
10 is absolutely worth the upgrade</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
