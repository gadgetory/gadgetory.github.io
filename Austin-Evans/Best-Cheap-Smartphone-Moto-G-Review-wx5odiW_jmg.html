here with a review of the Moto G now for
as little as $100 off contract this was
like an insane deal on paper but has it
actually stack up at first glance it
looks almost identical to the excellent
Moto X that are reviewed a few months
ago it doesn't feature Moto maker
however you can customize the phone with
different colored back plates oddly the
phone has a removable back but you can't
get at the battery or add an SD card
just the micro sim the back is covered
in a soft touch plastic which is alright
but it picks up fingerprints and doesn't
feel too impressive the speaker on the
other hand is really not bad the audio
isn't amazing but volume is plenty loud
for normal use unlike a lot of large
screen phones the Moto G is a very
manageable size making it not all that
much larger than the iPhone but with a
much bigger 4.5 inch screen speaking of
the display is one of the real surprises
of the phone usually when you're on a
budget the screen is the first thing to
be cut but here we've got a full 1280 by
720 resolution IPS panel viewing angles
are decent and colors are totally
respectable which means you really won't
see much of a difference between the
Moto G and even the most high-end of
smartphones another pleasant surprise is
performance inside you're looking at a
1.2 gigahertz quad-core Snapdragon 400
Adreno 305 graphics and one can go bite
of RAM compared with other phones on the
CPU site with Geekbench 3 will open your
performance that matches up with what
you'd expect from a high-end handset
from last year for graphics chip expense
shows the audrina 305 inside does a good
job giving similar performance to the
iPhone 5c using the Moto G as my main
phone lately I haven't hit a single
major snag for the most part games run
just fine including heavier titles like
Riptide GP I did notice a slightly lower
frame rate sometimes in Osmos HD but
it's not bad sure occasionally an
animation will drop a few frames and
with only one gigabyte of RAM
multitasking is a bit slower but overall
the Moto G handles Android very very
well impressively for a budget device
you get near stock Android 4.4 KitKat
the latest version available which is
specifically designed to run well on
phones like the Moto G better still you
can get an unlocked Google Play edition
of the Moto G running pure
stock Android with guaranteed updates
probably the biggest indicator of the
budget price is the camera it's just not
really all that great it's sporting a 5
megapixel sensor and it's passable for
the most part although in low-light
especially it absolutely falls apart
video is basically the same story so
here we're capped at only 720p and the
quality's alright but again really
nothing all that impressive
unfortunately the Moto G also lacks LTE
which depending on where you live can be
no problem at all or a major issue
considering the price I'm willing to
give it a pass but it is a
disappointment on the other hand battery
life is nothing short of excellent
thanks to that power sipping processor
the Moto G does a very respectable job
of getting through even a full heavy day
of use with no problem and if you're a
little bit more moderate you could
probably get through two days on a
charge with the Moto G if you're looking
for a budget phone the Moto G is the
best choice period for something that
costs less than a third the price of a
full high-end flagship you get almost
the exact same experience here with the
only major downsides being there's no
LTE and the camera is only decent but
what do you guys think would you pick up
a moto G as your next phone let me know
in the comments below anyway if you
enjoyed this video and you want to see
more like this absolutely be sure to
subscribe to the channel so you're
always kept up to date with the latest
and greatest anyway guys I will catch
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
