comparison between two of the major PC
gaming scenes now on one hand we have
steam and steam as I'm sure if any of
you ever play PC games will know about
steam it's a great way to get all kinds
of games for print cheap and it's an
overall really great thing on the other
hand there's this brand new thing called
on live now on live works a little bit
differently it actually instead of happy
running the games on your computer it
merely strains them over the internet
you know both that the pros and cons so
I'll go ahead and compare them and kind
of give you guys my thoughts and my
opinions on them both so it became with
let's go ahead and take a look at steam
now if you ever play PC games more than
likely you've at least made a steam
account you played at least a little bit
and there's definitely a really great
reason for that steam is really
excellent
now actually this is one of the perfect
things they've actually are having a
holiday sale right now and the games are
very very cheap I mean you can see here
like for example there's modern warfare
the original for like $15 Assassin's
Creed Just Cause 2 there are a lot of
really really cheap games which is one
of the major things I like about Steam
is that it's not going to be like you
know it's continuously you know $60 or
whatever you know the most expensive
games are they have some really really
good deals and of course they have an
excellent selection of games so on top
of that there's actually quite a few
other things so well then take a look
you can see here here's all the top
sellers and everything like that but and
that's a cool thing about this is that
they actually have packs which this is a
perfect thing going to show you this
pack so that you guys should go ahead
and purchase a lot of games at once so
you can see here you can get all the 2k
games so Bioshock Borderlands all kinds
of these games you can get them in packs
so actually this is a really good you
can see you get all of these games I
don't I'm gonna try count all of these
and you can see here it's $400 of games
for 80 bucks so there are tons and tons
of really great deals on Steam now a
couple of really good things about the
steam is that it automatically updates
all your games so no big deal you know
it's always been running in the
background so anytime there's an update
to any of your games a lot of matically
download and install it no problem in
addition you have to go ahead and add
friends and play together too which is
very very cool so overall I really like
Steam if you have a decent computer then
really in my opinion this is a
best way to go you have a decent Windows
computer rather if you have a Mac there
are a few games that are pretty good
however for the most part most games are
only gonna run on Windows so really if
you have a nice computer and you want to
go ahead and get into some pretty
hardcore gaming steam is gonna be an
excellent way to do it now let's go
ahead take a look at on live online is a
very different kind of thing compared to
Steam as it is an entirely different
experience allows you to play pretty
much any game you want no matter what
hardware you're running now basically
what this means is that it's really more
can dependent on your internet
connection then you know what your specs
of your computer are because all of the
games are run on a server somewhere else
where wherever they have their servers
and basically it has you know they have
a massive amount of computers that run
the games and merely stream it to your
computer now what this means is that you
can occasionally have some laggy
gameplay now I absolutely will attest to
that but it all really depends on your
internet connection and you know how
decent it is and all that kind of stuff
also it's going to show you guys a
couple of the cool things so you guys go
ahead and actually purchase games
through online I'm as you can see here
is a very cool interface here so we can
go ahead the games are generally pretty
reasonable I would like to see you know
generally they don't but they aren't
quite as cheap as on steams sometimes it
kind of depends of course but you can go
ahead here first definitely I will say
this there is definitely a much much
narrower selection than what you might
find on Steam there well I'll go ahead
just show you guys all the games right
here there are not that many games on
here however there are a decent amount
for example Assassin's Creed Batman
Arkham Asylum
dirt 2 although you can actually
purchase dirt - right now I'm just cause
to grow quite a few of them that you
know they're gonna be you know it's
gonna be enough to keep you busy for a
little while but definitely if you're
looking for a lot of the cool games such
as you know Call of Duty battlefield
Lockeford any of those games you're
definitely gonna need to go ahead and
take a look over at Steam so let me back
out here but now I'll go ahead and show
you guys some gameplay in just a second
but there are a couple other things that
I do want to show you so the arena is
something pretty cool it basically
allows you to go ahead and take a look
at anybody playing all these games so
that as you can see here these are all
different games
and people are actually playing them
right now so if I want go ahead and take
a look at for example here we go
somebody's playing wheelman and like I
said guys these are all live games
playing right now so we want to go ahead
and take watch them I played Just Cause
2 and go ahead and click on that and
this is somebody right now live playing
Just Cause 2 and it's very very cool
another section should give you a pretty
decent idea of what the performance of
the games are in general a lot of times
I actually do look a little bit better
than what you might find on for example
you know the Xbox or Playstation 3
however it's kind of a little bit hazy
and of course on YouTube you know the
quality's not gonna be quite perfect but
a lot of times the video looks a little
bit hazy a little bit out of focus it's
not the biggest deal in the world
however you know it's mentally not
you're not gonna get quite the
experience if you were going to be
playing a game on Steam so overall
online is a great way to go if you have
a lower power computer so basically the
only real hardware specs that as far as
I can see is that it needs to be able to
play roughly 720p video that's the major
thing if your computer is capable of
doing that much motions even netbooks
are these days and of course this is
going to be great for a Mac as well as
obviously there aren't that many games
available on the Mac so for if you if
your computer's capable of that that's
going to be great
and now the other major thing is your
internet connection you definitely need
a pretty beefy internet connection you
know they recommend probably two three
four or five megabits down most of you
guys probably will have an internet
connection like that but the good thing
is on live you can go ahead and download
it and play it you know go ahead and
play free trials and all that kind of
stuff and kind of get used to it
personally where I live I have a little
bit of lag it's usable but it's not
amazing but of course depending on your
connection you could run really quite
nicely now another really cool thing
about online is that there's actually a
console I'm sure if some of you guys
have been seeing the ads and they've
been trying to get the word out for $100
you can go ahead by the online console
which is pretty much the exact same
thing and just comes with controller and
you should get up to TV but it works the
same way same game same everything and
so the experience shouldn't be any
different so basically what I recommend
is you guys will go ahead and download
and run online for free try free trial
or to kind of see how it works and then
you go ahead make a decision from there
either way though both consoles
both you know platforms do have their
very pros and cons everything so that's
like recommend go ahead and try them
both out and see what works best for you
personally I think I'm going to go ahead
and be sticking to steam for now maybe
once OnLive develops a little bit
matures and get some better you know
looks a little bit better you know has
less bandwidth restrictions all it's not
stuff I think I might go ahead and play
it more but for now I'm going to
probably end and stick with steam so any
like guys that's it and just want to go
ahead and give you guys this comparison
if I just kind of tell you a little bit
about the pros and cons of each anyway
guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
