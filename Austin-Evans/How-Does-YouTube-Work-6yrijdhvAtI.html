YouTube but what does it take for you to
be watching this video right now for
most people computers in the internet
just work
however the journey that this video has
to take to make it to you is nothing
short of incredible
it all starts out on this little memory
card inside is a tiny computer the
process is the footage that lives on the
SD cards memory from here the video is
transferred over to the computer where
the editing begins this is where the
video starts to take shape the clips are
put together and things like music are
added and colors tweaked once the video
is done it's time for compression the
tens of thousands of individual frames
that make up the video are broken into
pieces to shrink the files small enough
to be easily washed later at this point
the video is done but it still has a
long way to go before you're able to
watch it to make it onto the Internet
your computer chops the video into even
smaller pieces called packets these are
transmitted wirelessly via radio waves
which typically take the form of a Wi-Fi
or cellular network from here the video
travels to a modem which sends the data
along into the massive series of data
centers that make up the internet
something as simple as uploading a video
to YouTube can travel thousands of miles
and hit many servers before it finally
arrives at YouTube from here the video
is unpacked and then encoded into a
variety of quality settings ranging from
144p all the way up to 1080p and beyond
when you click on the video this process
goes in Reverse
youtube chops the file back up and sends
it to the internet your modem and router
and then wirelessly to you in a matter
of milliseconds then your device pieces
the video back together and unpacks all
those frames into the video that you're
watching right now that's how this video
traveled from my apartment to you
wherever you are in the world if you
enjoyed this video feel free to share it
and you can make the entire journey
happen one more time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
