what to expect with the Xbox infinity
now the next generation is only a few
months away and considering that Sony
already got the jump on Microsoft by
announcing the PlayStation 4 early let's
take a look to see exactly what to
expect with the next Xbox for starters
there very well may be more than one
brand new Xbox so a lot of the members
are saying that there will be an Xbox
video which will be more appletv than
Xbox 360 the main focus of this
obviously would be to play video for
example Netflix and Hulu however it
would have access to certain casual
games so don't expect to play full Xbox
infinity games on it but a lot of the
downloadable titles would most likely
work on the Xbox video considering how
many people use an Xbox 360 just to
stream Netflix I think this could be a
very good idea especially considering
the price which would likely be around
100 to 150 dollars in the size which of
course will be much smaller than the
full size console there may also be a
tablet called the Xbox surface now this
would really be focused at gaming with a
7-inch display and either some kind of
physical controls built into the tablet
or the very least the ability to use an
actual Xbox controller to control games
on the tablet the Xbox surface should be
pretty powerful with something like an
NVIDIA Tegra 4 on board the graphics
would actually not be all that far off
but something like an Xbox 360 of today
now as far as the games go I'd expect
them to be all download just like with
the Xbox video I expect that there will
be some kind of games that you can just
download that should work on the Xbox
video the Xbox surface as well as your
Xbox infinity and of course we've got to
toggle out the actual console itself the
Xbox infinity now funnily enough this
actually should be really similar as far
as internals go to the PlayStation 4 so
expect to see the same eight core AMD
Jaguar processor as well as some pretty
decent graphics now they may be slightly
down compared to the PlayStation 4
however I wouldn't expect it to be a
huge deal I actually really think that
they're going to be very very even this
generation you'll still be playing your
games on discs however they will be
blu-rays as opposed to DVDs like last
time and of course expect to be able to
buy most if not all actual Xbox games on
the online store as opposed to buying
them on discs so you have both options
available there should also be a brand
new version of Kinect so of course this
was hugely popular for the 360 so I
expect Microsoft to make some
improvements with it for the Infinity so
better cameras better motion tracking
more people on the screen all that kind
of stuff and also the part I'm excited
about is that should finally actually
work with
tracking so if you guys saw when they're
actually first announcing connect they
shared this kid he put a skateboard in
front of the Kinect it scanned it and
then allowed it to use it in the game
now that never really panned out however
if they make it happen with Kinect two
I'm going to be pretty happy because
that looks really cool come on there
have been rumors that connect to will
actually be built inside the next Xbox
now I'm a little skeptical about that as
if it is built inside you'll have to be
very careful where you place your
console obviously it needs to be able to
see with cameras so you really can't
shove it behind anything or get it out
of the way well we'll see about that
regardless so definitely expect to see a
lot more games be able to use Kinect and
hopefully use it better than what we've
seen so far I'm interested to know what
do you guys think about the next
generation of Xbox do you think the
Infinity is going to be great and
awesome or you say screw Microsoft and
go with the PlayStation 4 definitely be
sure to let me know what you think in
the comments below if you're interested
in more I did a full video going over
the top 5 features of the PlayStation 4
if you enjoyed definitely be sure to
leave this video a thumbs up and if
you're interested in more videos like
this be sure to subscribe anyway guys I
will catch you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
