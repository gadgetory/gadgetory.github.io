notice that there are several ports on
the bottom of the console Mosley's
really never used for anything all that
exciting however this one was with it
you can use the Gameboy player so this
is the Gameboy player now as you guys
probably have guessed by now this is an
accessory or rather an add-on for the
original GameCube that allows you to
play Game Boy Game Boy Color and Game
Boy Advance games on your TV so it's a
pretty cool deal and there's actually
some really interesting things about
this before we get anything to you guys
a quick little tour obviously this is
meant to be set underneath the Gamecube
I'll show you guys how to do that in a
second but up front you see just the
little Gameboy logo and there's a slot
for link cable where you get just like
original Game Boy Advance you could plug
in link cable in fact this works exactly
like a Game Boy dance so you know if I
had another Game Boy Advance I could
plug it in here and trade or do whatever
else I want to do with the link cable of
course I can take my games and just slot
them right in to eject them there's a
little button right here so she can put
put some out there but one cool thing
about this that a lot of accessories and
whatnot don't do is the fact that this
is the identical set up to the Game Boy
Advance
so accessories and things such as the
e-reader will fit in here perfectly so
as you see here lines up allows it to
plug in properly one thing about this
though is that this is actually
basically a Game Boy Advance inside of
here so this is obviously there's no
screen but instead of relying on
software emulation which is well it's
less than perfect this actually has the
pretty much the entire guts of a Game
Boy pants inside here so on course and
by extension it also has the guts of a
Game Boy and Game Boy Color so you can
play all the games or anything it's
going to wear on pretty much identical
and all will be on your TV using the
Gamecube now install the Gamecube is
really simple you just need to remove
this store and then just take the Game
Boy player line it up it's not too
difficult and just simply press it down
now there are a couple of little thumb
screws that you can tighten down here
she'll do really quickly and then you
have the Gameboy player on the Gamecube
now by itself the Game Boy player really
won't do anything it needs the Game Boy
player disc which comes with it this
disc is you know just as you would
imagine it's just a startup disk it
allows it to run all the software
everything and this is important if
you're looking to pick one up and make
sure it comes with the disk
otherwise the Gameboy player is pretty
much useless and a lot of people lost
these because they never really came in
anything
didn't have like a normal box or
anything like that so tons and tons of
people lost these so there are a lot
more Gameboy players and discs gameplay
on the Gameboy player works really quite
nicely now since it is not software
emulated like I said it actually has the
original guts it's going to run almost
identically - it would have the way it
would work on a normal game boy pants
it means nice clear really nice-looking
visuals in fact of course the Game Boy
Advance was really quite similar to the
Super Nintendo so those graphics look
just about the same on a TV now there
are a couple of options when using the
Gameboy player on your TV and of course
there is a option to slightly reduce the
size of the image so for some TVs it
looks a little bit distorted a little
bit unclear when you pull it up to these
full resolutions so there's a normal
mode which gives it about 8% of your
screen and does sharpen it up on quite a
few TVs so anyway guys that's it for my
review of the Game Boy player overall so
really solid accessory and if you're a
fan of Game Boy games there's no reason
for you not to pick these up I mean
these days these Game Boy players are so
cheap indeed game cubes in general are
so super super cheap so you can probably
pick the whole bundle up as long as you
make sure that you do get the disc again
I can't stress how many people have lost
the discs it's absolutely insane I mean
actually my local video game store they
sell the Game Boy players for just a few
bucks but the discs are like 20 so yeah
you definitely have to pay attention to
that make sure you get the discs but if
you're in you know really a fan of the
old game boys this is absolutely great
way to play all your games using the
Nintendo GameCube controller</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
