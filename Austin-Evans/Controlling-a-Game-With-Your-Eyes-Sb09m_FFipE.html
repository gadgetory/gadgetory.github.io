using controllers can you play a game
using your eyes the msi gt72 Dominator
is about as high-end of the gaming
laptop gets it only takes one look to
see this thing means business with a
full sized steelseries keyboard and
fully customizable RGB backlighting that
even extends to the trackpad it might
not pass is a thin and light but it's
absolutely packed with tons of ports
including the new Thunderbolt 3 a
blu-ray burner and solid speakers with a
built-in subwoofer while a 17 inch 1080p
display isn't anything too impressive
these days it's outfitted with Nvidia
g-sync to keep games looking nice and
smooth inside it's rocking a core i7 32
gigabytes of ddr4 memory along with a
gtx 980m which is absolutely no slouch
the big selling point though is what
lives below the display this is a Toby
IX which integrates several sensors that
can track your eyes with a surprising
amount of precision run through a quick
calibration by looking at various points
on screen and you're up and running this
also works with Windows hello for facial
recognition to unlock your PC it's a
small feature but it's something that's
useful and accurate so this is the demo
mode that allows you to actually learn
it whoa what that's really cool I'm
literally not touching anything
subdued up-down wah gray this actually
really works
let's try assassin's Creed rogue so the
thing is there's actually not a ton of
games that are supported by this but
this is one of their main ones oh wow
that works not touch anything so first
thing I'm noticing the sensitivity is
really weird it is actually legitimately
weird to not have to use the mouse at
all like I've only been playing for a
minute I almost don't even really think
about anymore like I just looked to
where I want to go and I just do it but
the accuracy is something a little a
little worried about but I think arm is
gonna be the best game to test with that
so it works differently as a
first-person shooter because it only
looks allows me to look a little bit
left and right in Assassin's Creed I was
able to look and actually move around
the game here it's much more about I can
just look around but I still have to
target everything with the mouse which
is probably the better idea yeah you
know as natural as Assassin's Creed felt
this seems weird
I don't know I'm noticing especially
here there's a lot of like you have to
really focus you have to really pay
attention like my eyes are almost kind
of getting a little strained right now I
mean it's cool to be able to look left
and right but something like Virtual
Reality where it's actually tracking my
head it's not real
relying on my eyes it feels a lot more
natural because it's like my eyes almost
want to compensate like if I'm looking
at something in the distance the game's
trying to like move the screen over but
then my eyes kind of want to fight it
and look back so it's like there's a
disconnect there that's not very
comfortable pick them all over the place
with this because like there's little
moments where I think are cool then I
look off to like stop paying attention
for a split second it's all over the
place that said though there's potential
here I think that it could be cool I
don't know if it's something that the
censors are need to be more precise to
be able to like track your eyes better
maybe games need to be better supported
it doesn't seem like ARMA is a game that
has a ton of support it's kind of like a
plug and play sort of thing there's
absolutely potential with this
especially appear with Virtual Reality
it could be awesome as of right now
though it's a cool feature that's not
fully baked</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
