move to 4k back in 1979 Mattel launched
the Intellivision one of the most
colorful game consoles yet it was able
to play games at a whopping resolution
of 159 by 192 I mean you could fit over
217 television screens on a single 4k TV
while normal high-definition TVs and
monitors have been around for a while
now Ultra HD aka 4k has typically been
pretty pricey just over a year ago my 4k
monitor that I use to edit videos on
cost $3500 today though you can pick up
a full 50 inch vizio Ultra HD TV for
less than $1000 if you take a look at a
YouTube video like this it's 1080p or
Full HD now this is the resolution
you'll find on most computer monitors as
well as TVs this is just fine however
when you move to 4k you're getting a lot
more detail enough to fit for 1080p
screens
but the question is what can you do an
Ultra HD if you have a powerful gaming
PC like the positron you can play games
in Ultra HD the new NVIDIA GTX 970 and
980 graphics cards are outfitted with an
hdmi 2.0 port which you can use with the
Vizio P series to play PC games in 4k at
60 Hertz so it might seem weird to be
using a 50-inch TV as a computer monitor
but it works surprisingly well so on
addition to be able to play games you
can also watch 4k video and there's a
ton of screen real estate so instead of
having to have multiple displays you
just have all your tabs all your Austin
Evans videos in one place pretty handy
jump into a game like Metro last light
Redux and the move to 4k is a big one
even on medium settings the extra
resolution makes a big difference and
it's even more noticeable and watchdogs
with ultra textures there's just a ton
of detail everywhere which is a far cry
from the console version which can't
even reach an ATP much less 4k there's
also surprisingly solid game mode
included that brings latency down to
some of the lowest levels I've ever seen
on a TV it might not seem like a big
deal but this alone makes the P series
totally usable for even the most fast
paced games out there while the positron
has no problems gaming in Ultra HD you
can still get some of the benefits of
gaming in 4k without an awesome gaming
PC the P series TVs have a spatula
scaling engine to upscale HD content to
4k which helps to make normal game
and consoles like the Xbox one and ps4
look even better there's also a smooth
motion mode which comes to make content
like sports look much smoother for less
than a thousand dollars the Vizio P
series means the 4k gaming on a big
screen actually makes sense of course
you're also getting a TV this future
proofed for watching 4k content like
Netflix right in the TV and all kinds of
fun nerdy stuff like AC Wireless the
dual-core CPU and h.265 decoding so what
do you guys think is it time to make the
move to Ultra HD definitely be sure to
let me know in the comments below and
big thanks to vizio for making this
video possible hey guys thank you so
much for watching and I will catch you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
