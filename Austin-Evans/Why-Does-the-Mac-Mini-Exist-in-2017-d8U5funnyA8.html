releasing a lot of major new products
lately but something they haven't
touched is the Mac Mini which has not
seen an update in three years why does
this still exist in 2017 I will say the
Mac Mini comes in a tiny box so today's
small form-factor pcs really aren't
anything all that special
but the Mac Mini was kind of ahead of
its time alright I will say one thing
even though yes there are a lot of
problems with the Mac Mini that I will
get into the actual sort of unibody
aluminum design still feels pretty nice
you don't exactly get a lot in the box
though pretty much all we get is a
little bit of paperwork with some papal
stickers and a power cable it might
sound weird to say considering that this
design originally came out in 2010 but
I've actually never held the Mac Mini
and I'm kind of impressed so like I said
it's an all aluminum unibody design and
you actually a fair few ports on the
back not only is there an SD card reader
but there are also four USB 3.0 ports as
well as even a couple of Thunderbolt 2
ports now this is a far cry from current
Apple devices which have some would say
fewer ports earlier models of the Mac
Mini were actually fairly upgradable so
in the bottom you could actually screw
off this sort of plastic piece to get at
stuff like the hard drive in the RAM but
we're in this a little bit more
difficult and to make things worse the
memory is actually soldered and that is
a far cry from when marques built the
ultimate Mac Mini back in 2012 where he
loaded up with a ton of memory as well
as an SSD they first list though this
actually doesn't look like a bad way of
getting yourself a cheap Mac so this is
the base Mac Mini which runs $500 and
that's exactly half the price of the
next cheapest model the MacBook Air
however take a closer look and the Mac
Mini might not quite be such a great
value performance might just be the most
outdated part of this system as 2014
specs will only take you so far this is
the base model Mac Mini with a core i5
4260 you four gigabytes of RAM and a 500
gigabyte mechanical hard drive to put
things in perspective Intel is just
launching their eighth generation of
core processors whereas the Mac Mini is
using a fourth-generation Haswell chip
even when you spend the extra $500 to go
to the higher-end model with the core i7
you're still limited to a dual-core
processor which is bizarre they actually
used to ship quad core versions of the
Mac Mini take for example the leaked
benchmarks for the iPhone
10 that is showing a score of around
4000 on single-threaded and about 10,000
on multi-threaded way way faster than
this Mac Mini is you're also stuck with
a 500 gigabyte hard drive now yes you
can spec up the Mac Mini with not only a
fusion drive but as well as pure SSD
options but that raises the price
significantly so to be fair the Mac Mini
is powerful enough to handle stuff like
HD video as well as web browsing but the
issue is with only 4 gigabytes of RAM
and you can't upgrade it you're going to
run into some serious usability issues
on Mac OS so take for example the HP
pavilion wave this is a much more modern
system you're getting more memory and
almost more importantly it's going to
cost you about $130 less than the Mac
Mini it just doesn't make sense
one of the reasons I can't see someone
being interested in the cheap Mac are
for the Mac exclusive apps such as Final
Cut Pro 10 which is what we use to edit
all of our videos wow that's actually a
WoW so give us some context on this this
is a triple stream 4k video being played
back and edited in real time on the Mac
Mini in fact it's actually the intro to
this video right now so yes this is not
maybe the most demanding thing ever we
haven't done stuff like color correction
which would definitely slow things down
but as far as me I'll do a sort of basic
cut this is three streams of 4k video
playing back and real-time on the Mac
Mini the only thing that's not totally
stuck here and one of the reasons why
it's not stuttering is we are editing
off of a USB based SSD but that's what
we do for all of our edits anyway
although I think this says more about
how solid Final Cut is optimized and
less so about how powerful the Mac Mini
is there are better alternatives if you
do want to cheap mac though starting
with building yourself a hackintosh now
yes building a hackintosh from scratch
is going to be more complicated than
pulling a Mac Mini out of the box what
you're going to get is much much better
hardware for the same price if not even
less even used options can make a lot of
sense
so a few minutes of searching on eBay
found multiple batman a's there may be
only a generation or so behind but could
be found for as little as $200 look most
of the time if there's at least someone
who I can say that a product will make
sense for when it comes to the Mac Mini
it just
isn't a good idea to buy one of these in
2017 there are just simply better
options out there now before we get out
of here I want to give a shout out to a
few really good friends of mine over at
Vsauce
so know this is not a sponsored spot but
they've been working on the Curiosity
box for over a year now and I honestly
feel like it is getting really really
good this is a quarterly subscription
box that comes with all kinds of cool
science stuff including this incredibly
attractive vsauce beanie this box even
comes with a voyager one t-shirt and a
portion of the proceeds go to benefit
alzheimer's research so if you guys like
vsauce and you want some cool science
stuff to show up every few months
check out curiosity box calm and as
always thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
