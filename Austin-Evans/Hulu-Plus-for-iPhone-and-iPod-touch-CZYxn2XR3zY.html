different apps on another things out
right now guys I do know that iPhone and
iPod Touch is a app is out right now but
you also be able to once you have Hulu
Plus you'll be able to watch a lot more
so currently like take for example
Parenthood okay so guys currently that
show is a new as a new earth show you
can only watch just a few episodes so it
may be the four most recent or something
like that so guys with Hulu Plus you can
go ahead and watch full seasons of any
recent TV show and for select TV shows
such as like Saturday Night Live and
especially some older TV shows you can
go ahead and watch several episodes you
can really watch a lot of the older
stuff so it's really cool but guys
that's enough about what Hulu Plus is
let's go ahead and show you what it's
like so guys if you would like to sign
up for Hulu Plus you go ahead and go to
hulu.com slash plus I have the link in
the description I'm find out a little
bit more information about it and you
can go ahead and sign up there are not
currently letting you hook up but you
can go ahead and get on a waiting list
to test it out so yeah so anyway guys
all that aside if you want to go

grab your iPhone or iPod Touch and go
ahead and download the Hulu Plus app so
guys this is a really cool app of course
it works on the iPad as well and you can
go ahead and take a look at a few shows
and kind of get a feel for how Hulu is
going to work so guys and go ahead
you'll start in a free gallon which is
what you can watch right now and it's
not a very good selection I mean you can
see here it's a good it's a decent um
maybe like one episode of like a lot of
their big shows so you can see quite a
few I'm sure you guys read through here
quite a few of the shows that you know
you like to watch on Hulu but you can't
watch a ton but let me just kind of show
you let's go ahead and just pick this
one so go ahead and go in here so it
will kind of tell the rating will tell
us the season episode aired a rating all
that kind of stuff I'm guys most shows
will so right there Hulu it will show
Hulu Plus icon which means that you do
need to have a who the plus subscription
plan um but this one doesn't you go
ahead we can go ahead and watch it right
now I won't report you to copyright but
guys video looks really crisp but it's
really clear um you know there's pretty
much just like watching it on the site
you know there's no real problems you
can go ahead it'll come back so you know
if I want to watch 10 minutes of this
episodes and you know put it down close
my ipod come back and just hit the plus
button again and jump right to it so
it's really quite cool I'm so guys we'll
go ahead briefly show you guys what else
you can find here you can go ahead and
go featured these are all whoo plus so
you do need to the subscription of
course but you can go ahead and you know
just like everything else get a full
list of all the great shows you can find
on Hulu such as 24 awesome show you go
into the popular ones which again this
is just like on site you can search so
as you can see here I searched here it's
Naruto will just play MIT to finish the
only place you can watch that nowadays
and then you go into more and then this
is basically where you know you can
check all your stuff but again pretty
much anything like let's say I click on
it it will say that I need to go ahead
and get a Hulu Plus subscription unlocks
cool guys go ahead to show you
edit you can go ahead and configure your
icons so let's say for example when you
actually do have this subscription plan
you probably want the free gallery so
you can go ahead swipe that off a place
of working out something else so anyway
guys that's it for my full review
and kind of give you guys a little bit
more information about Hulu Plus um guys
of course like I said this is only for
if you live in the United States but if
you do guys I highly recommend just
download the app try it out it's really
nice you can go ahead and watch all your
favorite shows even over 3G it works
really nicely and you know I'm really
looking forward to this I definitely
plan on getting the new plus
subscription plan because I definitely
that's my main way where I watch TV is
on whoo so this is great news for me
maybe I guys doesn't recommend check it
out it is free the app itself is free in
the App Store and of course you can
watch a few episodes to kind of get a
feel for how it's going to work anyway
