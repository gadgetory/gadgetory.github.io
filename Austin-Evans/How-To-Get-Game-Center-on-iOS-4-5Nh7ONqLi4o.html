pretty frequently is how do you get game
center like right there on iOS for guys
it's a very simple process you not to
jailbreak you want to do anything and
there's really no downside to getting it
of course guys game centers not fully
functioning um if you don't know what
game center is it is pretty much very
similar to like Xbox Live for you know
the iPhone except it's obviously free
you can go ahead and play games with
friends do a lot of really cool things
really gives a really great social
aspect to the iPhone and iPod Touch so
guys like I said there's not a ton to do
if you do have games in right now but
there's not a whole lot downside to not
having it so guys I'd say go ahead and
do it if you're interested now go ahead
and show you guys it's a very simple
process on how to get it okay guys so to
get game center it's very very simple
now you will need to go ahead and
restore your device to the iOS 4 gold
master I'm so guys if you don't know
what this is basically this was the the
final beta I suppose of iOS 4 guys this
is practically identical to the standard
iOS 4 that you might already be running
right now guys I've been running it for
a couple weeks now hadn't really run
into any new bugs or issues so guys
really I wouldn't worry about it of
course not always you know you got to be
careful but really it's not a big deal
to me um so guys I can't actually go
ahead and give you guys the link to the
firmware but it's really simple just you
know Google iOS for GM and you should be
able to find it no problem just go ahead
you will need to go ahead and download
it for either your iPod Touch 2nd
generation it doesn't matter what kind
3rd generation or the iPhone 3G or 3GS
you can't obviously iOS 4 is not out for
the original iPod Touch or iPhone and
there's no gold master for the iPhone 4
there guys if you have one of those 4
devices which I'm sure most of you do
then you all you're all set so go ahead
download the firmware and I'll show you
guys how to install it's very simple so
go ahead and open up iTunes then just go
ahead and plug your iPod Touch or iPhone
in and let it sink be sure it's you know
it's fully backed up because we will go
ahead and restore it now guys you might
be able to do this with check for update
but I really really doubt it go ahead
and just stick with restore it's not a
big deal
so guys to do this it's very simple once
your iPod or iPhone has been totally
backed up you just need to restore the
so if you've ever jailbroken this is
probably gonna be really familiar to you
all you need to do is on a Mac and you
press option and then click restore on
the on Windows you do shift and restore
so I'm go ahead and do that right now
and there we go guys so then it will go
ahead and pop up a menu and then all we
have to do is scroll down find our iOS
for firmware hit open
now obviously I'm running that right now
so I'll go ahead and do it but guys it
should just give it of course just give
it a few minutes let it run through then
at the end it will go ahead and ask you
do you want to restore the backup
go ahead restore from the same backup
that you just hooked up and then it will
should be identical to the way it was
only with of course just the Game Center
now if your jailbroken you will have to
read jailbreak of course so you know
you'll have to weigh it out but if
you're not go ahead and just do this
it's not a big deal so nice you had Game
Center on your iPhone or iPod touch just
go ahead and just show you guys a little
bit about what it's like so go ahead and
we can just go ahead and launch it and
it'll give just a second to load and
there we go so guys as you can see it
will go ahead and you know tell you you
can go ahead and pick out your name on
the first time you launch it it will
give what will prompt you to go ahead
and sign in with your Apple account
which is the same that you know you when
you punch in to go
you know download an app for example but
yeah so guys as you can see here we can
go ahead and pick up friends and right
now you know you can go ahead if you
know somebody who does have Game Center
also on iOS 4 for example guys you go
ahead
Adney up if you like if you know if you
know someone who you know is already on
iOS 4 and you want to play games with
them go ahead add them as a friend right
now yeah obviously to come over here you
had the friend quests but guys like I
said there is not a ton to do with games
in right now a lot of this is really
waiting for developers to actually go
ahead and start preparing their apps ok
guys that's really simple thing on how
to get game Center on iOS 4 I said
there's a bunch of times guys there's
not a huge reason probably the main
reason you would do this is just to go
ahead and request your name I know a lot
of people have already had the name
stolen so I mean you know if that's what
you're really interested in go ahead and
get it and you can kind of get a little
sneak peek of it until you know it's
actually out so guys it will probably be
released on you know perhaps I would say
September would be the latest that would
be released perhaps like
you know the next ipod touch and all the
new iPods come out hopefully it'll come
out soon or hopefully maybe knowing the
next maybe I like the next update but
until the guys go ahead go ahead grab
game soon you'll be all set to go anyway
