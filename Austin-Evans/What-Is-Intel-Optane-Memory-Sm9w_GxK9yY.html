of important things to consider when
buying a new computer but I've got a
question for you what's the most
important one when it comes to
responsiveness is it having an awesome
processor ton of memory maybe a huge
screen or is it your lowly hard drive
actually yeah that is exactly what it is
so the standard hard drive that you'll
find and a lot of computers today is a
bottleneck and almost every single thing
that you do Oh me not every single thing
but you know loading programs or booting
windows or I don't know loading up
pictures of Ken these are all things
that are much much slower on a
mechanical hard drive and that my
friends is where Intel obtained memory
comes in we're awesome enough to sponsor
this video so we can answer a very
simple question what exactly is obtain
memory take this dell inspiron i have
here on the surface it looks pretty
similar to a lot of other laptops but
thanks to improvements in processing
power specifically with the 8th gen core
processors you can do a lot more work a
lot more efficiently than you used to be
able to do on a system like this and yet
grandpa hard drive is keeping this down
I'm gonna say grandpa hard drive here I
like it if you've got a big budget by
all means go for a full SSD it'll
definitely give you the speed but the
issue is cost and if you need anything
more than say a couple hundred gigs of
space things get pricey very very
quickly especially when you're spending
less than $1000 on a system it can be
really tempting to go for flashy options
like more RAM but the thing is it won't
really make a big difference in
day-to-day use for most people sure if
you're one of those people who have a
hundred tabs open and Chrome all the
time then you probably do need more RAM
and maybe to reevaluate your life
decisions but the best way to think
about RAM versus our hard drive is like
this how many more RAM will allow you to
have more things open at once but having
a faster Drive will mean that all those
things will load much more quickly
that's where obtain memory comes in now
the important thing to know is that this
is not a replacement for a hard drive
it's an addition to it so the way the
octane memory works is that when you're
using your computer normally there's an
algorithm that runs in the background
that's constantly analyzing which files
you're pulling from the hard drive the
ones that you're pulling most such as
windows or your programs or whatever the
case is will then be cached to the
optimal which will massively speed
things up without hurting your capacity
there are a few things to understand
about how all this works and the first
thing is the actual octane module itself
one of the key
is capacity so with the standard SSD
you're usually getting at least 256 gigs
of space however an octane module only
needs to be 16 or 32 gigabyte depending
on which one you pick up and that is
because it's sharing the space with your
standard hard drive which can be a
terabyte or 2 terabytes or 14 terabytes
in the case of our ultimate gaming PC
this means a few things first of all it
dramatically cuts down on the price per
gigabyte which is a big deal regardless
of whether you're building an
over-the-top gaming PC or buying a thin
and light laptop secondly it means that
you still have the mechanical hard drive
and all the capacity that goes with it
it really is the best of both worlds you
have the capacity of a large hard drive
but with the responsiveness and speed of
an SSD know it's been a perfect right
out of the box
octane memory does need a little bit of
time to process and analyze all the
different programs apps and files that
you use on a regular basis but the idea
is that octane is going to make your
computer faster over time as it's more
and more well optimized versus well
basically every other computer ever
which gets slower and slower with the
inevitable march of time inevitable
March inevitable march of time this all
sounds great in theory but how does it
actually work to demo I have a couple
devices starting with by far the most
common method of using octane memory a
laptop such as this HP Pavilion x360
this is a well rounded system with a
core i7 12 gigs of RAM dedicated AMD
graphics and a one terabyte hard drive
that is backed up by a 16 gigabyte
octane module it works exactly like any
other Windows system want to load up
Chrome BAM it's there how about jumping
into a quick game of pub G it's a lot
faster than a traditional mechanical
hard drive on the other hand we have a
full-on gaming PC which has a whopping
14 terabyte hard drive which is
accelerated with Intel obtained MIG this
is a very extreme way of using obtain
but the point stands we've already done
a full video in this PC which you guys
can check out but the way it works is
that we're using a 32 gigabyte intel
obtained module paired with our huge
Steam library to get some seriously fast
speeds even though we have 14 terabytes
of storage the best part is you don't
have to do anything different as far as
Windows is concerned I have a one
terabyte hard drive inside my HP however
what's going on in the background is
that octane memory is speeding up
everything without me having to do a
thing now of course this isn't for
everyone if you're buying a high-end
workstation for example you probably
have the budget for a huge SSD for a lot
of people though this is a really nice
middle ground between a super high-end
system and a budget option with a
glittery slow hard drive whether you
want to build a new game PC or buy that
new laptop if I can communicate anything
this video it's this if you're getting a
new system don't rely on just mechanical
hard drive there are just better options
out there including Intel obtain memory</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
