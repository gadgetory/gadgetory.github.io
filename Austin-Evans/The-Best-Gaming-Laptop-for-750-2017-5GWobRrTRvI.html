a look at a $400 gaming laptop but this
time we're going to see what happens
when you take it up a notch this is the
Lenovo Y 700 it's a full taste gaming
laptop which for 750 dollars have a lot
going for it so the first thing I see is
that actually looks like it has like
that's a carbon fiber finish I mean that
is definitely plastic but it actually
looks pretty nice so here we have the
power table some paperwork when I assume
is the power adapter which is actually
pretty big open this guy up and not only
do we have the 14 inch display but we
also have what's actually really
well-built there's very little keyboard
flex it's a backlit keyboard it's all
metal around the palm rest this feels
like a pretty premium laptop purports
it's pretty straightforward we have a
power adapter a single USB port as well
as headphone and microphone and then on
this side we have two more USB 3 HDMI
and Ethernet this is definitely a gaming
laptop but I'm glad little Lenovo went a
little more subtle with the styling for
the most part is just a black laptop
with a few red accents sure maybe like
the speaker's look a little bit gamer II
but for the most part once you close it
up it's actually a fairly under stage
looking laptop compared with the
Inspiron 15 did we did a video on a few
months ago DeLillo is a lot smaller
which I like especially we're going to
be taking this to something like school
it's going to be a little more portable
so it also really does look a lot more
understated well this is not a bad
looking laptop the whole spider-man
aesthetic is not going to be for
everyone one of the big advantages is
with the display so this guy is rocking
a 14 inch 1080p IPS panel which looks a
lot better than the 10 panel on the Dell
so it looks good as is but right now you
can actually get this exact same model
with a 4k display on Amazon for the same
price now sure it won't be able to game
at 4k but for normal use that is going
to look really really nice at 14 inches
hey guys lost in the galaxy note 7 was
one of the hottest phones of last year
terrible puns aside the speakers are
pretty solid here but actually
front-facing and from the looks of them
they're actually reasonably big they
don't get super loud but no complaint
what is pretty good as the keyboard so
like I said earlier it is going to be
backlit which is nice and the treble is
pretty decent Lenovo does a good job of
keyboards
usually now the tripod isn't quite so
amazing so it's totally usable but it
doesn't use the windows precision
drivers which means that it's fine but
for pretty much anything more than a
quick little bit of use you're going to
want to mount inside this guy's powered
by a quad core i7 6700 HQ 16 gigabytes
of ddr4 memory as well as radeon r7 and
375 graphics it specs up pretty well
compared to the dell and while it is a
skylake processor compared to kb lake on
this guy it's going to be an i7 versus
an i5 which I would definitely prefer is
twice as much memory it also has a 256
gigabyte SSD on top of a one terabyte
hard drive this guy only has the SSD the
main thing you're giving up here is that
1050 Ti on the Dell now the Radeon
graphics should be pretty decent here
and it is $100 cheaper so let's see how
it performs first up we have v go other
than by no means the new game but it
still runs pretty well on the lenovo
we're getting somewhere between 60 to 80
frames per second and this is what
everything cranked up on high settings
1080p as I get shot in the face next to
a shadow of mordor if this is a little
bit of a newer game and importantly it
looks a lot nicer than csgo now the
issue here is that we do have to turn
the settings down just a little bit so
right now we're running in 900 PM medium
and we're getting anywhere between 30 to
40 frames per second it is playable but
it's not the greatest experience in the
world I think that's kind of a trend
with the lenovo it can definitely handle
gaming no doubt but for a lot of newer
titles you are going to have to turn
things down to around medium or so one
game the white 700 can definitely handle
overwatch so again here on 1080p at
medium settings where anywhere between
40 or 50 frames per second it's a pretty
good experience but one of the nice
things about the lenovo is they can
handle more than just games taking that
same gameplay footage that we just
recorded and bringing inside Adobe
Premiere you can see it's also not a bad
editing PC so it's stuff like a core i7
and 16 gigs of RAM inside premiere it
actually runs pretty well and we
experience only 1080p footage but we are
playing it at full resolution and even
stuff like describing to the timeline is
nice and smooth but lenovo white 700
definitely isn't a perfect gaming laptop
but there's a lot to like here the
screen is great the specs are pretty
solid the only real issue here the
graphics could just be better but for
the price there's not a lot to complain
about so as always I'll have a link to
check
I am the description I'm curious would
you want to pick up the white 700 let me
know in the comments below and I will
catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
