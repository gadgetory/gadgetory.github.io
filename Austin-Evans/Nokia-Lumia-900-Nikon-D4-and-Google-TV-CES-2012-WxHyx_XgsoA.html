here in Las Vegas Nevada about to be
covering the 2012 International CES the
show doesn't officially start until
Tuesday however I'm gonna be getting
some coverage starting this afternoon
probably so before we get into all that
I'll go ahead and go over some
last-minute things about what we can
expect to see as well as what's already
been announced Google always has a big
presence at the show and I expect this
year's gonna be no different now of
course last year we had Android on
literally everything we had phones
tablets just everywhere you look you saw
Android and I expect there's gonna be
pretty similar this year so the story of
this year I imagine will be quad-core
processors both phones and tablets I'm
looking forward to seeing what kind of
processing power and on top of that
we're also going to see Ice Cream
Sandwich if we see a phone that launches
that does not have Ice Cream Sandwich
not good we should also see some cool
new Google TVs this year now while
Google TV was at the show last year
there are a few Google TVs basically
been a kind of maybe not failure but it
has not done very well at all in the
past years so over it looks like Google
is refocusing they've got the software
side and much better now and they're
gonna be launching a lot of new Google
TVs from several manufacturers so I'll
definitely be sure to take a look at
that moving on we also are going to be
seeing some stuff from Microsoft
I know Microsoft didn't have a whole lot
the show last year not a lot of exciting
incredible stuff but this year I imagine
that they're really going to be focusing
on Windows Phone 7 now of course Nokia
that's gonna be the first major show for
Nokia in quite a while and of course
they're going to have some new windows
phones for us so number one thing that
we've heard is the new look is the Nokia
Lumia 900 also possibly known as the ACE
or something lots of code names but
regardless it should be very similar to
the Lumia 800 which launched a couple
months ago in Europe and some other
countries but it should be a little bit
bigger every screen more like 4.3 inches
and it should have 4G LTE support for
AT&amp;amp;T so definitely looking forward to
take a look at that one now for
something for all you camera geeks out
there and Nikon is officially announced
the d4 this is going to be the successor
to the d3 s I gotta say it looks really
sweet so of course it's still built like
an absolute tank you can have about a
million buttons everywhere which is what
you want you have dials and joysticks
and what-have-you can have it all over
the place it also does have a crazy is
over up to over 200,000 so with this
thing you're only gonna be able to see
in the dark is gonna be absolutely
insane now as far as the price it's
gonna be expensive it is the top line
it's gonna run you about six thousand
dollars
counting all the nikon lenses that
you're definitely gonna want to pick up
so probably not a camera that me or you
were gonna buy however definitely an
awesome camera now I'll be looking
forward to taking a look at it anyway
guys it's gonna be about it my coverage
will be officially starting tonight and
we'll be running through the rest of
this week so expect lots and lots of
videos on literally all the cool stuff
the tablets the phones the cameras the
TVs you name it there's something cool
I'll pull my camera out I will record it
and I'll definitely be uploading lots of
content for you guys so if you haven't
done so already be sure to hit that
subscribe button up above you'll be
notified whenever I post a new video and

coverage I will be covering pretty much
