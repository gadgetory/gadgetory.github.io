computers you've probably heard about
AMD's rising but what's all the hype
about so Andy invited us out to San
Francisco where we got to learn a ton
about the brand new rising 7 processors
now these are high in we're talking
about prices between 330 and $500
however they have very high-end
performance to match all rise in seven
processors have eight cores with
hyper-threading you can overclock them
and they don't even have integrated
graphics they really are completely
targeted toward the high-end desktop
market whether you're gaming editing
whatever so I'm curious about is what
they're actually like to use so the
first thing I want to check out is the
demo showcase so Andy has a lot of
different rising systems here including
a couple maybe quite some of the big
advantages that Rison has are more cores
they're just about as fast as a neutral
plan on the intel side so for example at
about the same price on this side they
have an r7 1700 on this side there's an
i7 7700 K and the big difference here is
that while this is a fork or hyper
footed system this is an 8 core hyper
fighting system so in theory we should
be able to see a pretty big difference
so Rison looks like it's going to be a
bit faster so right now we're averaging
about 63 frames per second here where's
on the i7 Savelle 58 this is a good
example so the rise in ship even though
it does have 8 cores it's running at
about like 3.1 3.2 gigahertz whereas the
i7 is running about 4.3 right now but
more cores are definitely going to help
with a task like this like here we go so
it's finishing up and it took almost
exactly one minute whereas over here
minute 10 seconds so not a huge
difference but I think this is a good
example of why more cores could
definitely be helpful when it comes to
video editing streaming that kind of
stuff this chip on the right causes less
than this chip on the list
really
yes well you were in the same
presentation I was sorry I'll be on the
side what if you guys can yet well what
a pretty standard looking cooler it's
definitely big cards oh so this is
pretty much to the full like 2017 and II
set up so I does it have the new rice
and sleep you but also a really cool
graphics card okay I should play on
right now based on the slides that I
assume is probably one of them two
totally normal GPUs but I have no idea
but um it runs battlefront I feel like I
need to leave here before so many other
neons
like absolutely looking at this so it's
interesting here is that well these are
both eight core CPUs the rising ships
are going to be significantly less
expensive this guy runs I think about
like a thousand dollars or so whereas
even the high end rise in the eighteen
hundred eggs that's still only going to
be five hundred dollars and if you don't
need that extra clock speed you get an
eight core chip for 330 bucks the amount
of course you need does depend on what
you're doing
so for gaming I still do think that for
course is still probably going to be
enough eight cores is not going to
magically make your game run twice as
fast however if you are doing things
like editing screaming that kind of
stuff and the extra power can come in
handy especially in consider that's
about the same price you're just getting
more kinda seems like a no-brainer of
course we will find out when I actually
get my hands on not send a bench at the
AMD demo room Rison seven will be
available for pre-order starting today
and will be on sale March first so you
get three different options
there's risin 7 1700 which will cost you
330 there's 1700 X which will cost you
400 and there's 1800 X which will cost
you 500 now even though there's a big
price difference they're all eight cords
are all essentially the same the biggest
difference is the clock speed and how
high you can overclock on top of Verizon
seven which is exciting on the high end
if the leaks and rumors are to be
believed then there might be some lower
end options coming soon so definitely be
sure to let me know what you guys think
about rising in the comments below and
stay tuned there may be a couple PC
builds coming soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
