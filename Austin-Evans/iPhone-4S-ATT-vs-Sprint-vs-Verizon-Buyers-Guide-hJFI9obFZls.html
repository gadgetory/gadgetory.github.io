buyer's guide well certainly isn't the
biggest update in the world I'm sure a
lot of you guys will be picking up the
for us when it's out so let's go ahead
and go over a few of the things that you
need to know before you pick one up the
first thing is that even though the
forest is a world phone it still will be
locked to the carrier of your choice in
the United States this means Verizon
Sprint and AT&amp;amp;T even though this is
going to be the exact same iPhone that
works on all of these networks if you
buy one for example from Verizon it's
going to be lost so you can't just go
grab an AT&amp;amp;T SIM card put it in and
expect it to change carriers so let's go
over some of the major pros and cons
with each carrier Verizon in the United
States has an excellent 3G network
coverage is in my opinion probably the
best out of all of the carriers and
overall it's going to be really solid on
the other hand though it's not going to
be the fastest network around so you do
have some trade-offs there while Sprint
can't compete with Verizon's network
coverage it does have a couple of tricks
of its own for starters it does have an
unlimited data plan now unlike AT&amp;amp;T and
Verizon which not only have you know two
and four byte plans but on top of that
they sometimes will throttle you even if
you do have one of the old unlimited
plans sprint this is not the case you
can download as much data as you want
no throttling and there's no
restrictions on top of that Sprint does
tend to be a fair bit cheaper than
either 18-2 your Verizon so if that's an
important thing for you if you really
want to use a lot of data you want to
save some money Sprint is going to be a
good option although do keep in mind
that in general the coverage is just not
going to be as good as on AT&amp;amp;T or
Verizon the AT&amp;amp;T 4s has one major
advantage and that is it does have HSPA+
what this means is that the iPhone 4s on
AT&amp;amp;T is technically a 4G phone now I use
the quotation marks because it's not
really quite up to par with for example
the Verizon LTE network which is
blisteringly fast however if you do
choose to buy an iPhone for us on AT&amp;amp;T
it will be about as fast as there are
other 4G phones such as the Atrix 4G as
well as the inspire 4G not really
Verizon speeds but it should be faster
than either on Sprint or Verizon if
you're not interested in signing a
two-year contract there is another
option and that would be to pick up an
unlocked iPhone 4s
since this is going to lack a carriers
subsidy of course the unlocked version
is going to be much more expensive and
as opposed to if you had signed a
contract if the 4s is priced the same
way as the current iPhone
for is and you can expect an unlocked
version to run you anywhere from 650 to
850 dollars depending on what kind of
stores you have on your phone on top of
this the unlock 4s will be a bit delayed
compared to it's on contract
counterparts where you can now pre-order
the iPhone 4s on of course AT&amp;amp;T Sprint
or Verizon starting October 7th the
unlocked variety will not be able to be
pre-ordered and most likely will only go
on sale on the 14 moving on from this
you do have the choice of either black
or white
so unlike the one the iPhone 4 launched
where you can only pick it in black and
it took months and months months for the
white variety to come out now the iPhone
4s will be launching in both black and
white there's no price difference or any
really major differences besides just
the color so of course that's going to
be entirely up to you personally I kind
of like white final thing that you
should keep in mind we're picking up an
iPhone 4s is what capacity do you want
it in so the iPhone 4s will be available
in 16 32 and 64 gigabyte capacities
pricing will run you $200 for the 16
gigabyte $300 for the 32 gigabyte and
$400 for the 64 gigabyte iPhone 4s
three orders for the iPhone 4s will go
live this Friday which is of course
October 7th
now if past events are anything to go
off of I would definitely be sure to get
on it as soon as possible if you want to
be able to get on the release day if I
having to go and wait in line in the
store if you're not interested in
pre-order and you can wait until October
14th which is when the iPhone for us
officially goes on sale now as always
there will probably be lines in various
places they haven't told exactly what
stores will be carrying the iPhone 4s on
launch however more likely it will be
all the usual suspects anyway guys it's
gonna be about it for my iPhone 4s
buyer's guide you found this video
helpful definitely be sure to leave it a
thumbs up and if you have other friends
who might be interested in picking up
the 4s be sure to share it around with
them now I have a question for you guys
if you're going to be picking up before
us which one are you going to get which
carrier which color which model all that
kind of good stuff personally I'm
thinking about picking up a 16 gigabyte
white iPhone 4s on Sprint haven't
totally made about my mind to still have
a day or so to figure it out but yeah
that's definitely what I am leaning
towards anyway guys if you're interested
in more coverage of the iPhone 4s
definitely be sure to subscribe to the
channel I will be doing lots and lots of
