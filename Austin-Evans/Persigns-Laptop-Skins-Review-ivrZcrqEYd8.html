to look something a little bit like this
maybe a lot of fingerprints it's going
to be a lot of you know and grime and
stuff in general it's just not going to
look super clean and super nice
now I'll obviously the best step is to
just clean it up every day and of course
that's not a big deal if you have a
laptop especially with like a matte
finish like this cr-48
you guys can see here really really just
attracts the fingerprints really well
now like I said there are a couple
different ways that you can fix this
however one thing I'm going to be
showing you today is pur signs now pur
signs are basically gigantic vinyl skins
you put on your laptop it will allow you
to just you know not have to worry about
that too much the nice vinyl skin and of
course it's going to have a little
design on it too now once you purchase
pur signs and just open it up here comes
in a pretty big envelope looking deal
here and if we just reach in here we'll
be able to pull out these skin itself so
we can just kind of set that off to the
side as you guys can see here here's our
skin enough you guys been here but it's
vinyl
I believe it's it's 3m control tack I've
got no idea but it definitely does feel
like very high quality sturdy stuff as
you can see here I have the cr-48 which
is this is just a little bit big so
depending on your laptop sighs we might
you have to just trim it down a little
bit with any luck you won't have to cut
the skin whatsoever for it to fit on
your laptop however if you're like me
you're gonna have a little bit of an odd
sized laptop so just a little bit of
surgery is required now to do this it's
pretty simple just find yourself a
pencil or a pen or whatever you like and
just set your laptop face down on the
skin now what we're going to do is we're
just going to trace out a line just kind
of give us a general measurement and
we'll just cut it out
now before we apply it there's one thing
we do want to do that's going to go
ahead and just put this aside is we need
to clean off the surface of our computer
now pretty obvious there's a lot of
different ways you can do that I
recommend just a very very very slightly
damp cloth okay so I got it pretty well
cleaned off you don't worry about being
perfect or anything but as long as you
can get the majority of it off of course
don't touch it after you've cleaned it
it should be good to go so now we just
have to grab our skin and just find an
edge and just kind of pick add a little
bit you should be able to separate the
skin from the backing
so all you do is just apply it maybe
about that much and then try to fold it
over and apply it right about like that
on your notebook there we go we're
looking pretty good so if we just pull
it all the way across set that piece of
paper aside we actually are just a
little bit off here but again not a big
deal you can just take it off a little
bit and just readjust it as you like
okay so we're all done you guys can see
here it's pretty easy to install
especially if you have the right size
laptop I'm like you have something weird
like I do and where you can just you
know you don't have to cut or anything
you just apply it on there and it looks
really nice again you can see that vinyl
finish looks really really nice so
anyway what I'm going to do now is use
this skin for the next little while kind
of test it out see how it's durability
and all that kind of stuff goes I'll be
right back with my full review okay so
let me now I've been using the purse on
skin on my cr-48 for a little over a
week and a half now and I'm about ready
to give you guys my full review overall
I've got to say I'm pretty impressed
with it now pretty much the majority of
it since it as a skin one of the most
important things is it needs to keep
your device protected and that's mostly
what I've been doing is doing you know
like scratches you know I'm trying to
scratch it up try to you know peel off
the edges of the skin obviously not
really peeling it off but you know just
seeing with general day-to-day where I
put it
inside and pulled it out of a bag like
30 times just to kind of test and see
how well it holds up and overall I've
gotta say I'm really impressed
the 3m materials absolutely rock solid
actually I can pull it up here for you
guys and hopefully you'll be able to see
there's nothing on there and I guess
that I've been using this pretty hard
pretty harshly hopefully you guys
wouldn't be putting that to the kind of
stuff that I was and I had any issues
whatsoever still looks really really
nice on now I did notice one slight
problem and I think this is more my
fault than anything but you guys can see
here the edges where I cut it kind of
started to pull up just a little bit now
like I said that's more of my fault than
it is the skin because not most of the
time you will be able to pick up a skin
that is the right size for your laptop
you won't have to do cut it out like I
did but one thing I can say is if you
decide to cut out if you have to cut out
rather cut just a tiny bit smaller than
what you might think
that way it will fit correctly on the
edge because wait the way I did it went
over by just a tiny little amount and
because of that it's kind of starting
not really to peel but it just looks a
little bit bad you can see that it's not
as smooth as it is on the other three
sides begin not a big deal at all now
let me get into a little bit about the
prices and the sizes and all that kind
of good stuff so for this one it is 1699
and this is a twelve inch by ten inch it
should fit most netbooks this is a 12
inch compel a pop so I'd say about
twelve inches or so although I
definitely recommend it check either
measure it yourself or go look up the
specs before you buy one you want to get
one a little too small or of course a
little bit too big it's no big deal but
just you know take a look at what
exactly is you're going to need so this
is the twelve by twelve inch by ten inch
like I said it's going to run you 1699
and you can get a wide variety of
patterns for it which they all have nice
definitely recommend guys you can go
check it out there's a lot of really
cool ones on there now there also is a
larger size it's a 15 by 12 which should
fit most mainstream laptops and that one
is $17.99 so it's only dollar more so
not a huge deal I mean lastly there is a
custom laptop skin so also you have a
really big laptop or something that's
you know got a wider screen whatever you
can go ahead and pick out your custom
laptop skin and that run that will run
you $18.99 so no matter what size laptop
you have you should be able to be
covered using pur signs I like to give a
big thanks to the folks over at pur
signs from Ellie hooking up with this
