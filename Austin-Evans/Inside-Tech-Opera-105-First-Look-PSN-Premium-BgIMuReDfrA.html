inside tech today we will be taking a
first look at the very promising opera
10.5 will also take an in-depth look at
what Sony is up to for the ps3 PSN
premium let's get this one started the
opera 10.5 pre-alpha was recently
released and I have had a few days to
play with it form an opinion it's good
really good a minor bump from 10 to 10.5
doesn't look like much on paper but
actually using the browser is a
different story this is honestly the
only time I've ever been tempted to
switch to opera as 10.5 is one of the
best browser packages around right now
among the changes version 10 is a much
cleaner sleeker interface that is
strikingly similar to Chrome which is my
opinion the current benchmark for clean
browser interfaces the tabs are now
integrated into the top of the browser
removing the top options panel and
status bar and hiding them neatly in a
red opera drop-down menu which looks
much sleeker and frees up quite a bit of
valuable screen real estate windows 7
integration is a big part of the upgrade
as well as it now incorporates arrow
glass throughout the top tab bar as well
as to have preview support meaning that
individual tab show up the windows of
the taskbar as well as jump less support
the aesthetic improvements are enough to
warrant the 10.5 Monica but the changes
are more than skin deep as opera 10.5
now uses a new JavaScript engine known
as Kraken opera claims that it's seven
times faster than the engine and offer
10 and I can believe the end speed is
easily apparently simple day-to-day web
browser where offer used to trail behind
the pack in city it now runs with the
best of it my main browser is not chrome
form and after running some informal
speed tests between the two it's plain
that they are very close speed lines
running benchmarks backs this up they
seem neck-and-neck through most incensed
by der offered 10.5 narrowly edged out
chrome for which has a lot considering
the chrome run circles around operatin
using Mozilla's Dromio JavaScript testes
opera also HTM chrome although again by
a fairly small margin using Celtic canes
JavaScript benchmark chrome 1 by a
decent amount 242 to 199 lastly using
the v8 benchmark which I will note was
compiled by google chrome one by a fair
margin as well there might not be a
clear winner but that's not a problem
offers 10.5 no matter how you test it is
leaps and bounds ahead of its
predecessor between the addition of a
clever private browsing mode that allows
you to run private tabs next to standard
ones the excellent new interface and the
rossby that is enough to bring it up to
par with the fastest browser available
one thing stands out my mind this
shouldn't be called opera 10.5 this
should be offered 20 for all the
enhancer that they had made you can
download and try out opera 10.5 for
yourself right now if you're curious the
link will be in the description do note
that it's a pre-alpha release
that's quite prone to crashes and
glitches for example widgets don't seem
to work very well right now but nothing
is broken on me yet so it can't be that
bad opera really is looking fantastic
and I won't be surprised a bit if this
latest released when a good share of new
users hey guys jacob from the jailbreak
nation welcome with the game is corner
now recently there has been armed rumors
which could or could not be totally fake
that have been servicing lately about a
PSN premium service similar to that of
xbox live for those of you that don't
know PSN stands for PlayStation Network
it's totally free online option that
comes with the ps3 there's basically the
same as xbox live the xbox 360's variant
accept that life is a hefty price tag on
it so basically the rumors say that
supposedly sony has been conducting
surveys about what people want to see in
a PSN premium service now we all know
that Sony's terrible at keeping their
secrets just look at the PSP go at e3
but somewhere somehow the results to
these surveys got out on it there is a
list of features that could or could not
appear on a subscription service for PSN
some of these features are actually
really really cool their stuff like
access to beta games full title trial
where the first hour for a game is free
member only in-game content and online
music and movie service and cross game
voice chat the list goes on and on now I
must say as a ps3 owner some of these
things are real
needed cross game voice chat would be
amazing the xbox 360 has it why doesnt
the ps3 access to games and beta testing
would also be an incredibly neat feature
and so on a music so if you want to for
most of all the features listed in the
survey you can check them out in a more
info section next to this video on the
right or if you're watching this on
Duncan 3303 annal it should be below
according to the survey for a yearly
subscription is said to range from 20 to
60 dollars or month to month one for
about six to nine but the main question
thats only I've been asking is well
people buy it will people jump at the
option of a ps3 premium service my
answer as a ps3 owner i say yes i will
definitely go out and buy this the
features outlined just seemed too good
to turn down if the rumors do seem to
come true and soon reveals it I'm sure
will be a huge success as good as the
current services and before I end my
segment guys I'd just like to say merry
Christmas to you all and a happy new
year I'll see you in the next episode
peace and that's it for this episode of
