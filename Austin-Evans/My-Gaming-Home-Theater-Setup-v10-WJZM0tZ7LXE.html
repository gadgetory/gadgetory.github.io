new gaming and home theater setup the
start of the show was absolutely the
Samsung curved s UHD TV and I've got to
give a big shout out to Samsung for
sponsoring this video it's 65 inches
this really fills up the setup but
there's more to it than just a look with
a fork a quantum dot panel it's hard to
argue with the picture quality the
colors on point and it gets surprisingly
bright even in a relatively well-lit
room it holds up a lot of it is thanks
to the HDR 1000 tag to really maximize
dynamic range paired with the quantum
dot display you're getting solid color
accuracy as the TV in 2016 it of course
has Smart TV features and while I
usually end up just ignoring these tizen
on the 9 Series is actually pretty quick
something cool is that you've also got
PlayStation now built-in para Dual Shock
full with the TV and you're ready to
play as with all cloud gaming setups
this is reliant on having a decent
internet connection but I was pleasantly
surprised at how usable was even over
Wi-Fi you can rent games individually or
subscribe to play the entire catalog and
there's a decent selection of some of
the best games on the PlayStation 3 it's
a nice addition to the TV and you've got
the option of using game play streaming
as well gaming on it is solid as you'd
expect and with a coax input I was even
able to go old-school with an N
television to get some retro gaming in
on a 65 inch TV the remote is simple and
plain too with voice commands that
actually work and there are cool little
features like the TV automatically
recognizing what's connected to the
inputs I also set up my gaming PC which
for now is the Hadron it outputs a clean
4k signal to the TV which works for
video but also gaming especially when
it's paired with an Xbox controller it
works well as a fork a couch gaming
setup speaking of my main gaming
consoles actually the Xbox one it might
not be perfect but there are quite a few
Xbox exclusives I enjoy such as the
fortress series for audio I use the
Samsung J 450 sound bar now they just
pack a serious punch for being so tiny
but it also has a wireless subwoofer
which I've got off to the side and the
entire audio setup turns on and off
automatically along with streaming audio
wirelessly it might be a small thing but
when it comes to all of this tech at a
single setup cable management is a
serious task to help everything pop a
little I've got an awesome LED strip run
behind the TV not like in the color be
change but it just does a lot to make
everything look cool making sure
everything stays running nice and
smoothly is the google onhub router I
live in an apartment with a ton of Wi-Fi
networks and the onhub does a killer job
of cutting through the noise to keep a
consistent signal going I've also got
most of my console collection out on
display I haven't worked out a way to
get all of these
consoles connected at once mostly out of
fear for the enormous cable job but it's
easy enough to hook up something when I
want to play probably my favorite
console ever is the lime-green gameboy
color and I actually did an unboxing of
this one brand new a little while back
but nothing brings back memories faster
than some pokemon red I also have a few
unopened consoles around mostly from
picking them up outdated as they were on
clearance like this PSP and PlayStation
TV along with a couple DS models I've
also got the fallout 4 pip-boy edition
out on display I'm usually not one for
collector's editions but they absolutely
sucker me in on this one I've still got
a lot more work to do here but sometimes
I'm just happy to take a step back and
enjoy the setup as a whole so what do
you guys think let me know in the
comments below especially if you have
any suggestions for future upgrades this
is only version 1.0</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
