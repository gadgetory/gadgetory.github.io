here with asked me so this is a series
that I started doing a couple years ago
and then kind of stopped but I'm
bringing it back and the idea is really
simple I reached out on Twitter Facebook
and Google+ and I asked everyone hey ask
me a question I might answer in a video
so yeah I already know but it will be a
common question so why is your channel
duncan 3 through 303 if your name is
Austin so yeah this is definitely the
most common question I get all the time
basically to put it really simply when I
was about 10 11 or so my friend and I
first started getting on the Internet as
I'm sure a lot of you guys know
especially back then very few people
actually use the real name so it was
always like some kind of alias certain
you know well you always came up with
some kind of cool internet name and so
Duncan was mine and I used it for awhile
and it slowly after time started turning
into Duncan 3 3 3 o 3 cents you know the
name Duncan happened to be taken in a
few places on the internet and so yeah
it's pretty much how it all started when
I created my youtube channel back in
2007 I had absolutely no idea that I was
actually gonna make videos it was just
some way for me to you know subscribe to
people like videos comment all that kind
of stuff but when I did start making
videos back in 2009 I already had a
channel so I'm like okay I'll throw him
up there really didn't think anything of
it and after I posted a few videos and I
had like 50 subscribers I was like wait
a minute
I really should you know change the name
come up with something better I'm like
well I have 50 subscribers I mean I had
clearly never even get any more than
that I'm not going to throw all these
away yeah not really a great decision
what camera and lens do you use as far
as the camera goes I use a Nikon d600
this is what I've pretty much film all
of my videos with as well as a 24 to 120
millimeter f/4 lens which is a fantastic
piece of glass so this is my baby I
absolutely love this camera works really
really well and I love it a lot I might
also use a Sennheiser wireless mic and
my hand is glowing that's cool and I
also use a lilliput monitor so when I'm
filming I can say hey guys and you'll
actually see if I'm in shot and focus
all that kind of fun stuff what do you
do with all the computers you build and
test this is a great question because I
don't think a lot of people know I
actually do build all the computers and
I do test them all before I recommend
them so the way I do it to avoid having
to spend like $5,000 on computer parts
every month is I will say buy whatever
parts on
efore a specific build I'll put it
together test it make sure everything is
good and then when I'm done I will take
all the parts back apart and then just
keep them for future builds so instead
of having 50 computer sitting around
that I don't really need and just
collecting dust instead I would just
take the parts you know back apart and
then when I'm doing a new build I will
say okay I can use this power supply I
can use this motherboard whatever and
then I will build the next build and
when I'm done with it I'll tear it down
and that's pretty much how I do it what
performance improvements do you think we
will see with the next-gen consoles and
how do the parts stack up to a high end
PC since this is the Internet of course
there's tons and tons of misinformation
about how powerful the ps4 as well as
the next Xbox will be now of course we
don't have all the information on the
Xbox but what from what I'm hearing it
will be slightly less powerful than the
PlayStation 4 but regardless these are
both going to be about mid-range pcs so
at least on the PlayStation 4 side which
we do have some specs for it will be
roughly equivalent to something like a
Radeon 7850 as far as on the graphics
side and it does have of course an 8
core processor now there are eight
fairly weak cores but considering that
there are eight of them you know all
stack together they should be pretty
powerful now one of the most important
things especially with the PlayStation 4
is that it has 8 gigabytes of gddr5
memory now this is very fast memory and
it will be serving both the graphics
side as well as the CPU side so all the
tech jargon aside with 8 gigabytes of
memory available this should I should be
really impressive for lots of very very
high resolution textures for big open
maps and missions and levels because
there's so much memory to work with
there's a lot of really cool things that
developers can do so just purely
speaking from a spec standpoint I would
say the PlayStation 4 is probably
roughly equivalent to a 6 to $750 gaming
PC however there are definitely other
things just besides the pure specs they
could absolutely make it quite a bit
more powerful than you would expect what
is your current everyday cell phone for
a while I was using the note 2 however I
recently just switched back over to the
Galaxy s3 so the main reason I did this
was because I wanted to try out the s3
and kind of remember how it was and kind
of get back used to it because the s4 as
well as the HTC One are coming out soon
so want to have a little bit of a
benchmark to see how good or bad of an
upgrade either those phones might be can
you do a video editing PC build I might
be working on something like that so
there you guys go of course if you have
any questions deaf
be sure to drop them in the comments
below and who knows you might just be in
the next episode of ask me if you're
interested in more feel free to check
out my last video where we went over a
$750 gaming PC bill if you enjoyed
definitely be sure to leave this video a
thumbs up and if you're interested in
more like this be sure to subscribe
anyway guys I will catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
