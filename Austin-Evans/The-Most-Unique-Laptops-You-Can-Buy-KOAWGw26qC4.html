at normal-looking laptops all day long
but when Intel reached out and want to
sponsor a video on some slightly more
unique designs well it didn't take long
for me to say yes first up we have the
HP Pavilion x360 and this might look
like a normal laptop but in fact it's
going to be a full twin one you can tell
it's a two-in-one because well we can do
pretty much anything you want including
sending it all the way backward so it's
cool about this is that you can really
use it as sort of the best of both
worlds so we want to use it as a
standard looking laptop I can set it
here I've got my touch pad I've got my
keyboard I've got the touchscreen but we
also do have the additional modes of the
two and one allows so say you're on a
plane and you don't want to have a giant
15-inch laptop in your little tray table
well you can flip it around like this
and get tent mode to say watch some
Netflix or some super cool YouTube
videos and of course you're also going
to have the flexibility of just flipping
around like this if you want to like a
presentation or again watch some video
and of course there's going to be a wide
range of - ones available most of what
you're actually going to be smaller than
this pavilion so especially if some of
them that are in the 11 to 13 inch range
feel much better especially on the
tablet side but what you're getting here
is something that can do everything and
one of the most important parts with
this HP it does it without compromising
on performance inside you're going to be
getting an eighth generation Core i7
8550 you now with these new Intel chips
what you're getting is an upgrade from
dual core 2 quad core processors and
that is a big deal on something that's
going to be fairly thin and light
essentially what it means is you're
going to be getting the most performance
possible out of such a thin like form
factor and specifically with this
pavilion you're also going to be getting
the dedicated Radeon graphics you're
going to be getting Intel octane tech
there's really a lot to like with a form
factor like this especially considering
that is not even the weirdest laptop
they were going to take a look at in
fact it's downright practical normal not
even slightly weird if portability is
really what you're after though you
might want to take a look at this Villa
Lenovo yoga book very possibly the
smallest the legit laptop that I've ever
actually taken a look at now this isn't
actually a brand new product it
originally came out in 2016 and back
then I did do a video on the Android
version of this however I now have a
Windows version I've got to say this is
well it's unusual at first glance you're
getting a tiny 10.1 inch laptop but
because it's got that signature Lenovo
hinge you also are going to be getting a
full two-in-one the advantage here
really is in portability this is so thin
and so light this easy to just toss it
in a bag and forget about it
because it is going to be so small
actually makes a pretty decent little
tablet especially considering the
keyboard well a little bit different so
this is what Lenovo calls their halo
keyboard and as you might have imagined
this actually doesn't have any physical
press so essentially you can imagine it
as a giant touchpad so it feels like
typing on tablet and it's maybe not the
greatest experience but it does allow
some really cool functionality you can
use the include stylus with the
touchscreen like most other laptops but
what's interesting about this is if you
go to the keyboard and you press the
little pen button that's going to
disable all keyboard presses except for
what you're going to be getting from the
stylus essentially what this is going to
turn it into is something very similar
to a Wacom tablet you use this to nollie
navigate windows more importantly it's
going to be available and stuff like
OneNote to actually allow you to sketch
without sort of blocking the whole
screen while you do it look this isn't
going to be the most practical
two-in-one in the world not only is it
not going to be incredibly powerful it
is using an Intel Atom chip as opposed
to a core and on top of that the ports
are going to be pretty minimal it even
uses micro USB for charging and you only
get a micro HDMI out as well as a
headphone jack but especially
considering how much the prices come
down if you're looking for something
that's going to be just a little bit
different vehicle book definitely
qualifies next we have something that is
quite possibly one of the most unique
laptops that you'll ever find this is
the brand-new GPD pocket 2 as you can
see well doesn't get much smaller than
this with a 7-inch display yeah this is
going to be tiny
no there are definitely going to be
sacrifices with something like this the
keyboard in particular even though it's
actually going to be a lot better than
the original pocket it's still going to
be very small and the layout is going to
be a little bit unusual but again
consider lookup tiny this thing is it's
legitimately pocketable and this is
going to be a full Windows PC now inside
this guy you're going to find a full
Intel Core m3 processor no no it's not
going to be some crazy powerhouse but
what you're getting here is actually a
pretty surprising level performance and
something that's going to be so thin and
small you know it's not going to be a
full gaming PC but considering how tiny
it is so I should go to be more than
powerful enough for well pretty much
anything that I would ever do with it
except video editing I guess but I don't
think whoa dude we actually configurated
on this oh we should have thought about
that earlier this actually would totally
be able to video edit so it does only
have 4 gigs of RAM which is not going to
be a ton but with a full core processor
inside it actually might not be that
and when the cool things about it is in
addition to the nice aluminum design
you've got to stall it amount of ports
so you got to full-size USB a ports as
well as a USB see and a micro SD the GPD
pocket 2 is definitely not going to be
for everyone so this is really going to
be for someone who wants something
that's going to be super pocketable
legitimately actually pocketable but
it's still going to give you the full
Windows PC experience so if you want to
do a little bit of web browsing you need
some specific windows apps you just want
do a little bit of tiny gaming on the go
bunk it's actually not bad at all next
we've got the big guy the Microsoft
Surface book - then this takes a lot of
what made some of the other systems cool
and just adds the whole tablet aspects
there are a ton of different ways that
you can use the surface book and the
first is the most obvious of which is
going to be using it as a tablet so it's
not every day that you get to try a
15-inch core i7 powered tablet but wants
you to detach it from the keyboard dock
that's pretty much what you're getting
here this is going to house almost all
the internals of the laptop including
its own battery the core i7 8650 you the
memory the SSD pretty much the only
things you're going to be losing here
are going to be some of the ports
however as soon as you drop it onto the
dock you're going to be getting all of
that back and then some if I can line it
up correctly so once you drop it on not
only are you of course going to be
getting the keyboard the trackpad as
well as a fair few USB ports SD cards
that kind of stuff this is also going to
contain a much larger battery and a
dedicated NVIDIA GTX 1060 GPU a lot of
this is thanks to the hinge there's a
little bit of unusual design so as I
close it it almost looks like a vertebra
and one of the only real issues here is
that it actually does leave the laptop
slightly exposed to stuff like dust and
whatnot but it allows this whole form
factor to actually work and when you use
it as a laptop the fundamentals are
absolutely there you're getting a super
high-resolution 15 inch display with
Windows hello support the keyboards
backlit it feels great the touch pads
they're really you're not going to be
giving up anything besides a fair bit of
money when you pick up the surface book
there's also going to be a 30 inch
variety if you want something that's
going to be a little bit smaller but
who's really cool it's just how much
engineering has gone into making
something like this work no no it's not
going to be completely perfect again I
wish it would actually close just a
little bit more but if you've got a
price tag if you've got a budget if you
want to get something that's going to
give you a ton of power and a ton of
flexibility it's hard to go wrong with
the surface book too
what gets me excited is just
how many different designs there are out
there now don't get me wrong you might
want to use a standards laptop and that
might be best for you but as far as I'm
concerned the weirder the cooler the
more interesting the better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
