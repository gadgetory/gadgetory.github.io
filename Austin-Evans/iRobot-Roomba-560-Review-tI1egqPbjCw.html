of the iRobot Roomba 560 the room of 560
is a fully automatic robot vacuum
cleaner it does a very respectable pick
not perfect job let me give you a tool
okay so taking a closer look at the room
but you'll find that it does have a
button right here which this was go
ahead and you can pull out the dustbin
and you change the filter all that kind
of stuff and it just slides right in and
out now you have a couple of buttons on
the device itself you have the schedule
button as well as where you can set the
clock or you can do the day the hour in
a minute and then over here you can do
the spotclean you just do the standard
claim which what you'll usually do you
can click this button to have it
returned to the dock and coming right
into the front of the robot you'll see
that that's had a little sensor here
which kind of helps it navigate find the
dock and find the virtual walls in his
entire front piece is pressure activated
so when it runs into a wall
go ahead and depress a little bit should
cause any damage and they'll go ahead
and just turn around and get back on its
way now we're the major part of it is of
course is going to be on the bot back
bottom water lock on it
so one of the biggest questions I have
gotten is how to do when you hit a
corner for example because obviously
since it was round Genelia hill to the
square corner well that's where this
brush comes in I basically this brush go
ahead and spin thanks go ahead and pull
some of the debris whatever it would be
in the corner or it can be picked up I
bend this work very well you know I mean
wasn't perfect but it worked just fine
to me and didn't really have any
problems with it and a couple of other
things I really would like to mention is
that the design that overall is very
very well done
that's totally sealed so you don't need
to worry I know with some of the
previous rumors you actually have to
worry about dust you know causing
problems water but not the case
whatsoever so up front you'll see there
is a little wheel when you go ahead and
it spins around to help it navigate and
then you do have two fairly large drive
wheels I should do have some nice
suspension so you know if you're driving
over you know whatever it is this will
be able to get do pretty well shouldn't
get loaded all that stuck and of course
here is the you know the major part of
it where the vacuum is where I'll
actually go ahead and suck up all the
dirt and debris the Roomba comes with a
dump that charges it while it's not
amused so all you need to do is plug it
into an outlet and place the dock in an
area
where the Roomba can get in and out to
turn on the Roomba all you need to do is
click the center button and let the
Roomba do the rest
once underway the Roomba is surprisingly
thorough it will often bump into
furniture and then stop and change
corpse however it is very gentle and
shouldn't cause any damage one thing you
should keep in mind is that your floor
needs to be as clear as possible of
obstacles such as cushions Cheers
and chords well in general this isn't a
major problem as usually it just slows
down the Roomba clarium surge protectors
and cables is certainly the most
important thing as you may expect from
such a compact package the Roomba is not
quite as good as a normal upright vacuum
however it does do a respectable job it
can often take quite a while to finish
vacuuming but since you don't need to do
any of the work it wasn't a big deal to
me one thing to note is that there are
several Roomba models made specifically
to deal with pet hair so if you have
several animals especially if they shed
you probably want to look into one of
them I didn't have much trouble however
the Roomba is going to do a good job if
you have a smaller house or apartment
but if you live somewhere larger it
likely won't be able to finish in a
single go the battery is rarely a
problem as when it is low the Roomba
automatically stops what it's doing and
tries to head home to the dock keyword
try this more than once
after watching it slowly make circle
after confused circle trying in vain to
find the dog I gave in and just brought
it back myself what might be a problem
is the relatively small dustbin which
can fill up fairly quickly if you're in
need of a major claim again as long as
you run it regularly it shouldn't be an
issue one feature I wasn't totally sold
on or the virtual walls the 560 combo 2
and in theory they allow the room but to
know when a room is complete and move on
to the next however in practice this
didn't work very well for me sometimes
is not able to see the sensors but when
it does it seems to work decently
meaning to place the sensors around your
house and finding a place where they
aren't in the way and yet still can be
seen by the Roomba is a bit of a hassle
however you can set the room but to
start a vacuuming on a schedule however
I usually prefer to keep an eye on it
it's amusing to watch as it drives slow
steady circles around the floor all the
while bumping into things and
immediately turning around and getting
back on track a few times it appeared to
be stuck between the corner of the room
and a chair as the chair legs confused
it however it eventually found its way
out and got back to work
overall I really enjoyed my time with
the Roomba being a major geek I love the
idea of having a robot do work for me
from that perspective the iRobot Roomba
560 did a stellar job it did admirably
cleaning it's quite entertaining to
watch and he's designed very well I
personally didn't mind even with the odd
problem or oddity as it kind of added to
charm however that's the main reason why
I cannot recommend this to everyone
while the Roomba does have quite a good
job it's not quite as easy as just hook
it up and forget about it you'll need to
clean the filter and empty the bin quite
often and occasionally go rescue it
value proposition is also a bit of a
tricky subject as well currently on
Amazon the Roomba 560 goes for about 300
dollars and while that seems very
reasonable to me considering what you
get of course an ordinary vacuum will be
much cheaper and generally do a better
job if you're fine with your current
vacuum then the Roomba isn't one to be a
revolution or a must-have gadget for me
in a lot of other people though I think
the iRobot Roomba 560 is a great way to
get yourself onboard the robot train to
lazytown I mean it's a good vacuum</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
