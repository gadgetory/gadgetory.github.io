the iPhone success let's find out I
gathered a few of the highest end phones
out right now
the oneplus 2 Moto X 2015 galaxy s6 edge
along with the last gen iphone 6 apple
claims the 6s is 70 to 90% faster this
time around and taking a look at the
specs now it doesn't have twice as much
memory at two gigabytes but it's also
seeing a pretty decent bump in clock
speed first up is Geekbench 3 this is
mostly a test of the processor and a
high score here shows how fast the
phones are for normal use with only 2
cores the 6s can't match the sheer power
of the 8 core Galaxy s6 but it does
easily win the single core test to put
things in perspective the 6s has
essentially the same CPU performance as
the base 12 inch macbook this is one
fast phone next we have GFX bench which
is all about the graphics performance
that includes things like how smoothly
the phone runs and how it handles
intense gaming
factoring in screen resolution it's
clear the 6s is packing a serious GPU
even running the test off-screen at
1080p for an apples-to-apples comparison
the iPhone is still able to pull out the
wind moving on we've got the Google
octane test this relies on a fast
processor and a well optimized web
browser
Safari on iOS has always been well
optimized which definitely gives the
iPhones a leg up here but even so it's
hard to argue with both the 6 and 6s in
this one putting both the graphics and
processing power together we've got 3d
mark the normal ice storm extreme test
is actually not demanding enough to
properly tax these phones at 1080p but
by running the off-screen unlimited test
the 6s pulls out the win over the
oneplus 2 and galaxy s6 and especially
embarrasses the last gen sex it should
be no surprise that the new iPhone is
faster but there's no real competition
here the 6s is hands down the most
powerful phone you can buy to date now
whether it can stand up to the mighty
first gen iPhone though is a question
for another video so stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
