today I'm here with a video on the HP
Slate now we've been listening and
hearing a lot about HP slate in the past
few months but recently a lot of new
information has come forward including
basically full specs and a lot of really
good information so I'm go ahead and run
you guys through everything we know and
just be honest the HP slate is looking
really really solid so anyway let's get
this one started
okay guys so to begin with let's just go
ahead and give you guys a brief overview
of what the HP Slate is all about now a
few months back they showed off the HP
Slate which is very much going to be a
competitor to the iPad the Jinju and
quite a few other of the recent tablets
that have been coming out no the main
thing that says the HP Slate apart from
the rest is the fact that it runs full
Windows 7 home premium now this is a big
deal I think because it allows you to
have full control over all that
occasions you run of course you can run
I mean like Photoshop video editors
obviously flash you can run any browser
it's a really really cool thing and of
course the HP Slate it's not going to be
perfect because of Windows 7 because on
the downside it's not a OS that's made
for your fingers make you know for a
mouse and keyboard but they're going
there it's not going to be stock of
Windows 7 there they're going to put a
little bit of a skin over I suppose to
help it be more finger friendly but
recently a bunch of specs and a lot of
more informations come out over so I'm
go ahead and run you guys through some
of what we know and what it looks really
good so excuse me I've got my computer
here I'm going to read out some of the
specs it's going to have an 8.9 inch
display which is a bit smaller than the
nine point seven inch display on the
iPad
it's also going to be a bit small
resolution 1024 by 600 compared to 1024
by 768 you know it's not that big a deal
person I actually kind of like the fact
that it has a smaller screen just
because the iPad seems like it's going
to be a pretty decent size but I think
it's going to be a lot better to have a
smaller tablet that's not going to be
you know really large and everything
seems to say that HP's like is going to
be a good bit smaller than the iPad so
continuing on the processor is going to
be a 1.6 gigahertz Intel Atom processor
this is pretty good because while the
iPad has a decent processor it's a 1
gigahertz PA semi processor which is
basically just an upgraded version of
the iPhone processor this really is
going to unlock a lot more it's going to
bring it more front light you know the
power of an iPhone more like the power
of like a netbook that's a big deal now
there's a lot of other things such as
graphic support they don't actually say
for sure what kind of graphics say it
has but weighs soon is probably going to
be like just like a processor like the
Broadcom HD processor because they
basically just say that it has support
for graphics up to 1080p
that's pretty impressive the iPads it
says on the thing it says 720 we might
be able to get it might be able to get
hacked with 1080 we don't really know
but right out of the box it looks like
the HP's lights definitely going to have
a very large finish when it comes to
graphics and video playback and speaking
of graphics of course you know the iPad
can run iPhone games and iPad games made
specifically for it but one really cool
thing I think is going to appeal to a
good amount of people for HP Slate is
the fact that they can run obviously
computer games now it does not have a CD
or DVD drive so you're going to have to
download them but it should assuming
that you know it's not like hurt in some
way which I don't see why wouldn't it
should be able to run some lower end
games like a netbook could run for
example world of warcraft would probably
be able to be played on it as well as a
vast majority
you know any games I would say more than
2 maybe 3 years old should be able to be
run on the HP sled no problem
now of course how these games are going
to run without a keyboard it's gonna be
kind of hard to tell another important
feature of the HP Slate is the fact that
it has an SD card reader now this is
this is an important feature I think
because it allows you instead of you
know with the iPad you definitely buy a
16 gigabyte model later on down the road
you know oh wait I wanted to get a
bigger one
well you're right look you basically
have to buy another iPad is you need
more room well look this way you could
buy the lower end HP Slate and then as
you say hey I think I need a little bit
more room just by a twenty thirty dollar
SD card put it in there you're good to
go
and it supports SD to SDXC cards which
is up to 128 gigabytes of memory
although 128 year my car would probably
cost more than HP slate itself but it's
good that you can go ahead and do that
another really nice feature is the fact
that the price looks to be competitive
with the iPad now if you don't know
already the iPad has 16 that cluded we
don't know the 3G but this is just for
Wi-Fi only the iPad is for 16 gigabytes
it is $4.99 for 32 gigabytes it's $5.99
and for 64 gigabytes is $6.99
well the HP Slate is a little bit
different it's the base model is comes
with 32 gigabytes of storage and it's
going to be five hundred and forty nine
dollars now that is $50 more expensive
than the base iPad but if you compare if
you wanted to get a 32 gigabyte model of
the iPad you're actually saving keep
developers that HP slate there's kind of
a mix where the money really makes sense
is if you want a 64 gigabyte HP Slate is
that only runs you $600 whereas it's
$700 on them for an iPad so that's just
kind of something to consider
now one not quite so a nice feature
about the HP Slate is its battery life
now everyone who is really really liked
the iPad battery life the Apple says
about 10 hours and quite a few people
get more like 12 13 hours
that's really really great battery life
well with HP Slate really not quite so
much even though technically on paper it
has a bigger battery size it's got all
the components everything take up a lot
more power and as such they say that
it's going to have about five hours of
battery life now I don't think that's
going to be a deal-breaker or anything
five hours was still a decent amount of
battery life especially for something
that's a little bit more than a half an
inch then but the fact that it's cut I
mean practically less than half of the
battery life of the iPad is something
that kind of hurts definitely the last
picture I've got to go over is the fact
that it has two cameras we already knew
this but now we have a little bit more
detail so it does have two cameras it
has one on the front just a VGA webcam
very small it's going to be excellent
for video chats I mean seriously I think
this is going to be a huge deal I think
it's going to be great extra have your
slate and actually be looking at it and
you actually be available to a video
chat
especially had like a 3d model where you
can be video chatting anywhere it also
has a 3 megapixel camera on the back of
the device which is actually going to be
well I'm not so sure how useful it's
going to be I don't imagine you know you
see something cool like you know your
cell phone yet you can take a picture
real quick I don't think I want pull out
your tablet and take a picture but hey I
mean it's included it's a pretty decent
feature guys so that's all we know about
the HP Slate so far to be honest I
really really like it I love the idea
that it's going to run full Windows 7 so
I can use you know like Google Chrome
and not really have to worry about Apple
really you know restricting it I mean
you know iPad once it's jailbroken is
going to be great but you know the HP
Slate is going to come you know full of
customizable right out of the box and in
addition they're going to have it's not
really clear on how good it's going to
be but they're going to have a full UI
on top of it whether it might be just
you know an app launcher or what but
hopefully it should go in a ways into
improving the HP Slate and actually
allowing you to be really finger
friendly now that said the price is
going to be kind of a mixed bag you know
if you just look at the the memory which
is well where
that makes a lot of money you can see
that it's $50 more expensive but you're
also getting a 32 gigabyte which is the
same as the $50 more expensive version
of the iPad so it's kind of going to be
a bit of a wash I think but if you're
just looking for especially like a 64
gigabyte it's really hard to you know
ignore the iPad just because I mean it's
going to be a lot more expensive and
you're not going to have SD cards which
could expand it farther so I don't know
I just don't think that the memory is
going to be a huge deal I think if
you're gonna buy this you're gonna buy
these because of what they do not how
much they could store but it's
definitely a pretty important factor
anyway guys what do you think about
these are you interested in the iPad
it's just an HP Slate maybe both maybe
neither definitely leave me in the
comments I'm really interested to know
what you guys are thinking personally I
really like the HP Slate and I also like
the iPad I don't know I'm just gonna
have to wait and see before the HP Slate
comes out but right now I think I'm
probably a little bit more on the HP
slate side of the fence but thank you
who knows anyway guys thanks for
