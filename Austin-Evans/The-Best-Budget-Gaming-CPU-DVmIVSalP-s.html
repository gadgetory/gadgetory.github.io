to be doing a budget gaming PC build
what CPU should you go for for the last
year the AMD Athlon series has been the
best way to go for a lot of gaming
builds and with the new Athlon 860 K
it's now sporting AMD's updated
steamroller CPU cores on the other hand
Intel recently released the pentium g
2358 better known as the anniversary
edition with an unlocked cord to allow
for some serious overclocking on the
other hand the Athlon 860 K sports four
cores and a higher 3.7 gigahertz clock
speed but it's also $20 more expensive
while the pentium is a dual-core
processor at 3.2 gigahertz it's also
based on the same Haswell architecture
as the higher-end core i5s and i7s on
paper it doesn't look like much of a
fight is the Athlon is sporting two more
cores and it's called 500 megahertz
higher however the specs don't tell the
entire story in this case while the
Athlon series has been shipping with
unlocked processors for a while now that
work with even cheaper motherboards like
the excellent msi a 78m e 35 intel is
typically kept overclocking limited to
their higher-end processors and
motherboards with the pentium
anniversary though a few companies like
a soos have enabled overclocking on
their more budget offerings like the be
85 mg 2.0 you will need to update the
BIOS out of the box but after you do
you'll be able to dive into the settings
and change things like clock speed and
voltage both CPUs are decent out of the
box however to really get the most out
of them you really do need to overclock
I did all my testing with a cooler
master hyper 212 Evo easily one of my
favorite CPU coolers with it I was able
to bump the 860 K to 4.4 gigahertz and
the Pentium anniversary to a massive 4.7
gigahertz price wise when you put the
212 Evo along with the CPUs and
motherboards you're going to be looking
at $185 regardless if you go for the
Pentium or the Athlon to make sure the
CPUs aren't being bottlenecked by the
graphics card I tested with Anna soos
Radeon r9 285 a solid mid-range card the
first test is Cinebench which is a good
starting point to get an idea of the
actual performance of each CPU for
single toy performance the Hassell cores
inside the pentium are a massive help as
it easily outpaces the Athlon even
without overclocking use all the cores
though and things get a lot more even a
lot of us also work with video whether
it's for streaming or editing I took a
10-minute 4k video and ran it through
handbrake to
bring it down to 1080p here the four
cores of the Athlon have a chance to
shine falling behind the Pentium at
stock but essentially tying when
overclocked the 3dmark firestrike test
is a good way of saying how well each
CPU can handle some intense gaming as
far as strike tends to be heavily
graphics palem for the most part you
won't see a huge difference here but the
Pentium does pull out a small but
noticeable lead BioShock Infinite was
one of my favorite games of 2013 with
excellent graphics even on lower end
hardware run it at 1080p on ultra and
again Intel pulls out the wind this time
with even the stock Pentium beating the
overclocked Athlon when it comes to PC
racing games grit has always been one of
the best and grid Autosport doesn't
disappoint this is a game that really
likes a fast CPU and it shows here as
the Pentium is significantly faster
clearing a cool 40 percent performance
increase when overclocked Metro last
light did a terrific job of delivering a
great stealth first-person shooting
experience and the new read X version
takes it up a notch
Metro really likes a powerful quad-core
processor and it shows the app on nearly
catches up at stock despite its major
single-threaded disadvantage overclocked
things however and the Pentium is still
able to pull out the win the Athlon is
still a great CPU but this new pentium
Anniversary Edition is an absolute
monster so what do you guys think would
you use the Pentium in your next build
let me know in the comments below anyway
I've got to give a big shout-out to
little bits for making this video
possible
little bits is an easy and fun way of
making your own electronic creations
whether you just want to learn how
electronics work or want to build
something cool like a doorbell that
texts you you can do it with little bits
it's crazy easy to get started with
there's no need to solder or code is
everything is magnetic you'll find
modules ranging from basics like an LED
all the way to a mini computer running
Linux that can work on Wi-Fi or you
could you know create a real masterpiece
if you want to attempt to match my amygz
creation head over to little bits comm
where you'll get $20 off your first kit
with the promo code Austin and that also
includes free shipping in the US again
that's little bits comm and promo code
Austin to get yourself $20 off so
definitely go check it out and help
support the channel anyway guys thank
you so much for watching and I will
catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
