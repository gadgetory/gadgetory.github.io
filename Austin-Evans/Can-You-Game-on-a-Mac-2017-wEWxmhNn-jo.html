going to find out can you actually game
on a Mac so to find out I have two of
the most recent Mac's in front of me so
this is the baseline 13-inch model so it
has a dual core Core i5 processor 8
gigabytes of memory and integrate iris
graphics where I also have a 15 inch
maxed out model with the core i7 quad
core 16 gigabytes of memory and the
dedicated radio on pro 460 graphics
obviously no one should go out and buy a
Mac as a gaming PC they just don't make
sense however what I'm curious about is
if you already do have a Mac for
whatever reason
can you play games on them at all what's
kind of cool is that over half of my
Steam library actually will work on Mac
OS no problem now a couple of things
actually have changed on the gaming side
of Mac in the last couple years most
notably metal so this is very similar to
a lower level API such as DirectX 12 on
the PC or something like Vulcan and
essentially it should allow us to get
better performance by abstracting all
the stuff in the middle and like the
game gives close to the hardware as
possible to start with I want to try f1
2016 which does take advantage of metal
on the Mac now I'm going to start using
the 30 inch MacBook Pro as I feel like
this is pretty similar to the Mac's that
most people are using so it looks like
this works pretty well I don't have a
way of testing the exact frame rates but
to my eye it looks nice and smooth no
like 20 frames or anything dropping too
badly so right now I'm using the
PlayStation 4 controller which
interestingly enough actually works just
straight out of the box you literally
just pair it via bluetooth and that's it
well no you can't go flat out everywhere
no no no no no no no okay
so maybe you actually can't go flat out
everywhere I will say the graphics are
not the greatest so we're running at
1280 by 800 but I mean I would say this
looks roughly equivalent to something
like an Xbox 360 game so it's hard to
know exactly how much of a difference
metal makes since I should can't turn it
off but considering I'm running on
integrated graphics this doesn't look
bad at all next up we have Minecraft and
because of our wonderful dongle life I
have to use an adapter but besides that
we should get to go so max framerate 60
if you think yep
maximum fancy it's pretty much all
turned up I guess easy
I mean after running Minecraft on the
Raspberry Pi I'm really not surprised
that anything can run Minecraft but I
think the nice thing is is that we're
really not losing
anything with the MacBook Pro yeah maybe
you can do stuff like shaders and
whatnot on PC but to be fair a lot of
mods in fact I think most of them
actually should be just completely fine
to run on Mac doo-doo-doo
doo-doo-doo-doo
I was just having fun and then kin
started zooming the camera and pointing
at my face I feel like that's mate in
the video niche kids just go this is
another game that I know will run on Mac
what I'm curious about is what happens
if we actually try to crank up the
resolution and setting all right it
works but it's traveling dropping some
frames to be fit we actually are playing
at 2560 by 1600 um it's decent but let's
see if we can crank the settings down a
little bit
oh that's way better so creating the
resolution down to 1280 by 800 print
immediately fixes all the problems there
is a little bit of screen carrying
though which is interesting almost
immediate I could tell this is usable
definitely playable but it's not as nice
as it would be on machine running
Windows so next we have rocket League
again this is another game that natively
does support the DualShock 4 so it
thinks that we can run it 900p with
pretty much everything cranked up so
let's give it friend looks like we
actually had to print us the full rocket
league experience here graphic wise on
high it looks pretty nice we've got
stuff like the rain and the particle
effects and uh needs to get oh how did
that happen I am doing seing some
framerate drops it's maybe not the
smoothest in the world but we definitely
do have a lot of room to crank the
graphics down if we need to next I want
to see how a more powerful Mac handles
games so we have the 15 inch pro so the
first time I want to try is dark RAF -
now exactly a brand new game but it does
have support from metal so right now
we're running at 650 by 1050 with
everything set to high and again it
seems to be running nice and smooth
which is important for a game like
Starcraft so the first thing is actually
throwing me off a lot is actually the
keyboard the command option control
function keys are not remotely in the
same spot as they are in Windows so like
all my muscle memory is just completely
shot right now for example my Escape key
is a software key which seems like it
would be a big problem especially where
game I'm actually kind of like canceling
command sometimes but it actually kind
of works can the MacBook successfully
help me win a game against an easy AI or
I get the hard AI
yes the answer is I can actually kind of
play this nation have shadow of Mordor
a couple years old this has been one of
my favorite games to benchmark pcs for
quite a while and what I remember the
port to Mac and Linux is actually pretty
decent I realize you do really like
shadow of Mordor it kind of feels a
little bit like playing like some of the
Batman games that's kind of a bit of
like a hack and slash like God of War or
something but one thing you actually
should really be careful of especially
with these kind of more high-end games
is to make sure that you have a Mac
that's going to be compatible lighter
stuff like csgo should run on basically
anything but a lot of these games
specifically do need a dedicated
graphics card or quad core processor or
something so don't just expect that you
can just pick up any game and it's going
to work you know am I going to be like
40 guys right now by myself on a macbook
pretty proud of that now of course you
could run Windows on a Mac via boot camp
which will open up pretty much all the
games in the universe but that doesn't
get around the fact that you should not
buy a Mac for gaming so over if you
already have one and you want to play a
few games it's totally usable so what do
you guys think about gaming on a Mac in
2017 let me know in the comments below
and I will catch you in the next 11</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
