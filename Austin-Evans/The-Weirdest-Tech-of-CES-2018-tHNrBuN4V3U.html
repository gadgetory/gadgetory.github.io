very simple to find the weirdest tech of
CES 2018 and I should be pretty easy
there's a lot of weird stuff here so the
reason both is incredibly loud and
incredibly busy for one reason they have
the unbelievably impressive giant
keyboard
it sounds very solid I'm not entirely
sure why this exists though why does
this exist because why not it's out here
doing this man razors out here guys
doing things people aren't you're gonna
hear first razor does stuff because they
can so you might be familiar with this
little-known product called the iPhone
10 no well out of the box it's going to
be waterproof up to about six feet
catalyst was like oh no not good enough
so not only do they have a case for the
iPhone 10 which is going to be
waterproof up to 33 feet but there are
even cases for the air pods so you don't
go take those underwater you can do that
you can take the iPad underwater which
is my personal favorite so it's only
going to be for a few feet deep but I
mean an iPad underwater sounds cool this
is something you definitely don't see
every day
so this is a fully transparent keyboard
smell these are going to be flexible for
the ideas is that you guys you can
connect it via bluetooth so hey guys
it's a little hard to type with but it's
actually kind of a cool idea and one of
the best parts is that when you hit the
button will actually retract it inside
this is still a concept right now so
there's actually no release date but the
idea of having a keyboard that can roll
up in your pocket is kind of cool
isn't it what would be nice if it was
just a little bit bigger he's sitting
down right now can I go say hi is that
okay that thing I can do I know we came
back I know you're out having lunch
could we please can we please take a
look
thank you dr. Fuji this means a lot to
see just what car everyone over nicely
you see we did the medium for you it's
broke nice this is check out my fat that
you see it
it's real just why we keep your
motivation keeping your health
keeping your sex your body looks
immediate change there's a medical line
that's quite the statement yeah gets
quantity can argue with health fitness
oh boy oh wow wow this is I'm feeling
things they did not think I was gonna
feel I feel so sexy right now
okay so after getting the full dr. Fuji
experience I've got to say the CES it's
looking pretty good I've never felt
healthier and never felt sexier it's a
yes there is wild and crazy tech all
around but one of the most exciting
things I've seen is right behind me
so I was over here yesterday and
something about this laptop definitely
jumped out to me and that was the
dot-com button on the keyboard so can
you tell me anything about this this is
the only fold IT product
okay revolutionary tech at CES a.com
button built into the keyboard it's hard
to go wrong all I know right now is Kim
pulled the camera out and said hey
follow s so my hopes are high what is
that what is that these actually look
really cool hey guys Austin and CES 2010
I finally found some style I mean maybe
I don't really know this is style right
so this is an actual battery belt okay
can you give me like the 30-second pitch
I'm what this isn't why I should want it
this is patented wearable technology for
belts and straps we do belt straps we or
you know first draft belt anything that
has a strap or a belt a medium all right
let me let me give it a try here let me
give it a try so I'm about to try on the
battery belts this is a really big belt
so the actual battery is from here to
here it looks like or interesting so
we've got a USB as well as a micro USB
we're three quarters charged okay little
large I'll admit but basically the idea
here is that I could just plug my phone
into my belt and to be able to charge it
so I can walk around being incredibly
stylish while charging my phone so I'm
just gonna walk around for the rest of
CES with my slightly too large belt on
or maybe not it might just give it back
to him cuz it's not mine I've seen a lot
of weird stuff this day this week this
year my life
is up there that face it doesn't make it
any better they're singing in a really
really creepy way
I need to go home</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
