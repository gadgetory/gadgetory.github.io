wyndcomm right now they're giving away
an Xbox one and all you have to do to
enter is to review the Santa's merry
band app on your iPad or computer go to
app when calm now and enter for your
chance to win hey guys this is Austin
and today Muniz an unboxing of the new
Xbox one as the first new Xbox in over
eight years the one has a lot to live up
to what I have here is the day one
edition which was available to people
who pre-ordered
however it's basically the same as the
standard console on the side of the box
you'll see what it comes with however
let's just take a look for ourselves cut
the two seals on the box and you'll be
able to pop it open where you'll
immediately see the new Kinect Microsoft
is spend a lot of time improving it this
generation and it does match nicely with
the Xbox one but alongside the
PlayStation 4 camera it's clear the
Kinect is huge it even has a fan to keep
it cool continuing on into the unboxing
you'll see the accessories starting with
the redesigned headset for Xbox Live
which seems a little higher quality than
the last version plug it into the
controller and you'll see big buttons to
mute and change the volume and speaking
of let's take a look at that new Xbox
one controller the day one edition
features a silk screen logo but other
than that is the same excellent
controller as you'll find with every
Xbox one for the most part it's an
evolution from the 360 controller but
it's been improved across the board with
tighter sticks triggers and a better
feel in the hand unfortunately it still
uses double-a batteries which are
included but there is a rechargeable
battery option available continuing on
you'll find an HDMI cable which is a
nice addition and the still enormous
external power supply considering the
smaller ps4 has this built in it's a bit
disappointing although understandable
after the red ring of death issues with
the 360 you also get the set-up guide a
14 day xbox live trial a code to unlock
a day one achievement and an Xbox
sticker but enough of the boring stuff
time to get at the Xbox one itself tear
the protective foam away and bam you've
got the latest Xbox and all its plasticy
plasticky goodness oh yeah the first
thing you'll notice is that it's pretty
big and heavy closer to a small PC than
a big gaming console as far as looks go
it's similar to the ps4 with a half
matte and half lossy finish but there's
no denying it's a bit on the safe side
half of the top is a giant vent for the
heat
as well which should keep this nice and
cool on the front you'll see the
capacitive Xbox logo which doubles as
the power button and on the left is the
new combo blu-ray and DVD drive along
with the eject button hiding on the left
side is a USB 3.0 port and the sync
button to hook up your controllers
around back you'll find the power cable
HDMI out optical audio HDMI n to use
with your cable box two more USB 3.0
ports for a total of three the connect
port an IR blaster Ethernet and finally
a Kensington lock a lot of ports but hey
I'm not complaining so there we go the
new Microsoft Xbox one so what do you

gaming PC definitely be sure to let me
