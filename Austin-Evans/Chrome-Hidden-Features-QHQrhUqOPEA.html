the video showing you how to enable
hidden features in Google Chrome so
ordinarily you have the normal settings
page so you can go through change your
homepage your search engine that kind of
thing however if you know you're looking
for there's some really powerful tools
that you can unlock using Google Chrome
so the first is about flags and now this
goes for any of the things I'm about to
show you to get at them all you need to
do is type in about : flags or D
whatever the name is I'll have all of
them show up as I showed you the
different pages so the first one like I
said is about flags and what this is is
a whole range of different kind of
experimental features that have not been
announced or released for your general
Chrome users however if you know what
you're looking for you can enable them
and give them a shot a little early so
as you guys can see here there are an
absolute ton of these that do come in
Google Chrome now some of them are
really not helpful some of them are kind
of you know niche and stuff but some of
them are actually really cool so take
for example this you can enable syncing
open tabs so of course ordinarily with
your Google account you can sync through
all your different computers and chrome
installations you know what you know
your bookmarks are password is that kind
of thing
over with this enabled you can enable
your sync your open tabs so you know if
you have they'll say one of my videos up
on your computer right now and you have
another computer running Chrome
somewhere else you can have the tabs
synced so you don't have to go reopen a
bunch of tabs whatever you're looking at
so that's really some cool stuff
something goes this is my personal
favorite is click to play so ordinarily
you either have to run all plugins so
flash Java Silverlight you name it or
you can just have to have none of them
running but with this you can on any
website you choose you can have them not
automatically load so if you want to
look at something you can click to play
but otherwise it doesn't automatically
load you know take-up bandwidth and you
know slow your computer down all that
kind of stuff so there's some really
cool stuff here you guys are interested
definitely recommend taking a look
however I do want to say that it is
experimental for reason so expect you
may have some crashes and whatnot if you
do have any problems you should just be
able to disable whatever add-on you did
and be good to go now the next one is
going to be about memory now this is a
little bit more geeky but if you guys
bear with me here I'll tell you a little
bit about it what this is is it's kind
of like a task manager showing you what
is taking up RAM where how all that kind
of good stuff so as you guys can see
overall Google Chrome is taking up about
250 megabytes are ran right now which
isn't too bad but let's say your
computer is really slowing down or you
having some problems or you know
something's not quite right and if you
think it's something to do with Chrome
or whatever you can just open up about
memory and you'll be able to take a look
and see what's the problem so you can
see here that all these different
processes so for example these tabs
these pages extensions whatnot if you
can see maybe like one extensions taken
up like a gigabyte of RAM or you know
some things really add the ordinary you
can kind of give you a good idea of how
to diagnose it and close the program or
whatever the offender is you can take
care of it the next thing is about
plugins now this is another one that is
not always helpful but in certain
circumstances this can really be a
lifesaver so what this does is it gives
you a little list of all the plugins
that are installed in running Google
Chrome so for one this can take a look
if you see there's anything like a
program whatever has installed something
that you don't want so I've actually
found on a couple of occasions that they
were plugin that I did not even know
existed and you know had wanted to have
no part of so if you want you see
something you don't like you can disable
it or if you're having problems with
something you can take a look so if you
come over here and click details it give
you a little bit more information and
one good eye you know kind of demo of
this would be flash so ordinarily you
have actually two versions of flash
running on your computer with Google
Chrome so you have the normal one which
is automatically installed if you have
any other browsers so Safari Firefox you
name it that's what all of the other
browsers use but Google Chrome has its
own version of Flash which comes
pre-installed and sometimes if you're
having flash problems disabling one of
these can actually help because there
some kind of conflict and whatnot so you
know you can easily disable that or just
so you know what version you're on all
that kind of stuff so about plugins
another really helpful little thing now
moving on here we have the task manager
so it's going to be about tasks and this
one it's very similar to about memory
what you can do is you can see how much
memory each little you know tab and
plug-in and whatnot see how much CPU
Network something I find kind of funny
is it shows that with frames per second
on the page so about flags is running
about 25 frames per second right now
which is you know very very intense
stuff button let's say you wanna get rid
of something so we want to get rid of
this tab and click in process if you
come over to that tab they'll say up
crashed and you can get rid of it that
way not really all that useful but
sometimes it might be a little helpful
now
coming over here we also do have about
about so as the name implies this is
just a list of all the different about
pages and now I hope pretty much went
over most of the major ones however
there are definitely some others you
guys might want to check out for
yourselves and if you want the full list
and you can take a look at whatever you
like feel free to head up about about in
chrome anyway guys it's going to be
about it from my list of you know kind
of hidden features in google chrome now
of course there are definitely other you
know hidden features and other browsers
and I will be taking a look at Firefox
and perhaps some other browsers later
but hopefully you guys found this kind
of helpful learn some new features about
google chrome anyway guys if you enjoyed

it a thumbs up and if you're interested
