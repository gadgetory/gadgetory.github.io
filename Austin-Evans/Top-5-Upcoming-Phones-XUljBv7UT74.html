see top five upcoming phones as I'm sure
a lot of you know it seems like there's
a new awesome phone that comes out every
month these days so to help you guys out
I've decided to come up with a list of
my top 5 upcoming phones for this year
now definitely do keep all these things
with the graham salt some of these have
not been announced yet and some of them
won't be coming out till later on this
year but without any further ado let's
take a look at the top 5 upcoming phones
at number 5 we have the Motorola and
Google X phone so there's been all kinds
of crazy rumors that most of them are
definitely not going to happen but some
of the ones that do seem to be pretty
legitimate is that it will have a 4.7
inch display along with something like
about a 10 to 12 megapixel camera the X
phone should also be powerful so inside
expect to see a quad-core Snapdragon
processor which not only will be very
fast in general but will likely be one
of these fastest phones ever once it's
announced pair it up with this which is
a definitely good combination is a huge
battery so this shouldn't be a big
surprise Motorola's I should be doing
really well with battery life in their
phones lately because they're really
cramming huge batteries into very thin
phones as this is partially a Google
phone definitely expect to see it
running a version of Android most likely
5.0 codenamed key lime pie so as far as
when we're going to see the X phone most
likely we'll see you around Google i/o
which would be in the next two to three
months and number four we have the
Samsung Galaxy Note 3 now the last note
was definitely a big phone in several
ways and I absolutely expect that to
continue with the note 3 now I will
mention that this one's probably going
to be a little farther off than the rest
of the phones on this list looking at
probably around the September to October
launch however you can absolutely expect
a large screen on this one most likely
around five point nine to six point
three inches with a screen that big a
lot of the rumors are saying that the
note 3 will have a flexible display now
no you won't be able to take your note 3
and just bend it in half whenever you
want however what this will help with is
four drops so typically if you have a
normal phone it's a very rigid piece of
glass if it drops the glass breaks and
that's pretty much it however if the
glass is just a little bit of
flexibility to it instead of just
shattering and just drink totally
useless instead they might just bend a
little bit and you'll be just fine
and of course since it's a note expect
some really high in specs so internally
we're looking at most likely an 8 core
processor and as far as the design goes
it's likely going to be very similar to
the Galaxy s4 only just scaled up a lot
coming in at number three is the Apple
iPhone 5s and just like the iPhone 4s
was an upgrade from the four
I would expect the iPhone 5s to be an
upgrade from the five now of course we
will see some improvements I'll get into
those in just a second but for the most
part it's going to look very similar to
the current iPhone 5 that we have today
the number one thing I'm excited about
is iOS 7 which would be the very first
major overhaul of iOS since back in 2007
of course there's been lots of features
have been added in the meantime however
for the most part iOS looks just like it
did five six years ago however with this
version definitely space a little bit of
a different style probably gonna be a
little more flat or a little bit more
minimalistic which definitely gets two
thumbs up for me as far as the rest of
the space go this will most likely be
the first iPhone powered by a quad-core
processor probably knows the Apple a7 on
top of that should see an improvement to
the camera so the current iPhone 5 has
an 8 megapixel shooter however with the
iPhone 5s expect to see this bump to
either 12 or 13 megapixels at number two
we have the Samsung Galaxy s4 now this
one has already been announced in fact
I've already got myself some hands-on
time with it and you guys can check that
video out if you want but the gist of it
is this is a complete overhaul of the
current Samsung Galaxy s3 onboard you'll
find a 5-inch display with the
resolution 1920 by 1080 so to give you
some context there that is the exact
same amount of pixels that's on a
high-definition TV pretty impressive for
a phone Samsung has also added some
pretty cool features so you can take
your hand and hover it over the phone
without actually touching it to scroll
up and down through different web pages
and on top of that it also has dual
camera which allows you to take video
with both the front and rear facing
cameras at the same time and overlay
them so for example if you were filming
something you can also see your face in
the exact same video the galaxy s4 will
be powered by Android 4.2 which is a
latest version of Android as when I'm
filming this video and on top of that it
also has a 13 megapixel camera as well
as a pretty beefy battery coming in at
number 1 fittingly enough is the HTC One
now this is one of the best design
phones we've seen in a long time the
build quality is absolutely rock-solid
and the materials are almost all
aluminium which makes it look and feel
very premium on top of that it's got
some cool little details for example it
has dual front-facing speakers as well
as an IR blaster built-in which means
that you can take your phone and
actually use it as a TV remote the one
is also rocking some pretty beastly
specs so inside you'll find a quad-core
Snapdragon 600 processor which is about
as good as it gets right now as well as
a 4.7 inch 1080p display now HTC is
always been a really
with the screens on their phone and the
one is absolutely no exception this is
by far one the best phone displays that
you will find out right now it's also
got a four ultra pixel camera now my
friend mkbhd did a fantastic video going
over what exactly an ultra pixel is so
definitely be sure to go check that out
but that just if it is this allows it to
get much better low-light performance
while still getting you all the detail
that you'd normally expect with a
typical camera now that you've seen my
top 5 definitely be sure to let me know
in the comments below which phone you're
most excited about for this year if
you're interested more feel free to
check out my top 5 failed video game
consoles but if you enjoyed definitely
be sure to leave this video a thumbs up
