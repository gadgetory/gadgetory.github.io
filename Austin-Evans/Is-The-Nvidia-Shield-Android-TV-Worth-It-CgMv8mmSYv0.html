new Nvidia shield crack open the box and
inside you'll find the shield itself
along with the decent mount of
accessories
you've got the controller which comes
with every shield and HDMI 2.0 ready
cable micro USB for charging the
controller power adapter for the shield
and a bit of paperwork to get you up and
running the start of the show is
definitely the shield it's a lot closer
to an Apple TV than an Xbox in size and
with the optional stand it should fit
nicely with an entertainment system
powering everything is the new Tegra x1
with eight cores three gigabytes of RAM
and what's essentially a smaller version
of a full gtx 960 pu this is some
serious power for a set-top box and the
shield takes advantage with full 4k
support not only can it run Android TV
in 4k it has smooth 60 frames per second
but this also means you have easy access
to 4k video on YouTube you know like the
video you're watching right now but of
course also other 4k content from
Netflix with other services coming soon
considering how quickly 4k TVs have come
down in price this is a big win for
NVIDIA nothing else in this category can
handle 4k right now even including
consoles like the ps4 and Xbox one
speaking of consoles the shield has some
gaming cred as well there's a decent
selection of native titles including
classics like half-life 2 while playing
half-life takes some getting used to
with the controller this is basically
the full experience
there's also doom 3 BFG edition which I
spent the most time playing it holds up
nicely on the shield with a solid
framerate and some PC like options the
Talos principle takes this even farther
with full control over the graphics
which makes the nerdy me happy it's
paired with vaguely portal like puzzle
solving gameplay that's a lot of fun
especially because the original portal
is also on the shield many of these
games have been ported to Android TV by
Nvidia but you've also got normal titles
like Leo's fortune which the shield
handles easily there are quite a few
more games on the way - such as
Borderlands and Crysis 3 the only
problem is that the 16 gigabytes of
built-in storage gets filled up fairly
quickly
there is a 500 gigabyte pro model for
$100 more but it's easy to add a microSD
card or even a normal USB hard drive
when you need to expand the storage on
top of the native games there's also
Nvidia's grid streaming this is still
invade at the moment but it allows you
to stream PC titles over the Internet it
works reasonably well although
connecting over AC wireless or even
better
internet will help cut down on latency
if you have a PC with an NVIDIA GTX 650
or better you can use game stream to
play games from your PC on shield it
works really well there's almost no lag
when both the PC and shield are on the
same Wi-Fi network all of this gaming is
done on the shield controller it's on
the bigger side that it's comfortable to
hold with a nice weight you've got a
micro USB for charging along with the
headphone jack and a few capacitive
touch buttons for navigating Android TV
there's also a built-in microphone which
is really helpful for searching
half-life 2 google cast is also included
which allows the shield to replace a
chromecast for apps that don't support
Android TV letting you control media
from your iOS or Android phone
there's also built-in streaming to
twitch straight from the shield along
with the ability to record your gameplay
without needing a capture card when
Nvidia asked me to check out the shield
I wasn't sure what to expect but after
spending some time with it I've got to
say I'm impressed at $200 it has a lot
going for it gaming is solid with more
tiles on the way and the ability to
handle 4k is a big win so what do you
guys think about the shield let me know
in the comments below and if you enjoy
and want to see more videos like this
definitely be sure to subscribe to the
channel anyway guys thank you so much
for watching and I will catch you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
