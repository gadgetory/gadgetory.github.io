and I decided we could do a normal
iPhone 6 galaxy a5 speed test but come
on everyone's seen the benchmarks
introducing all the boring stuff so we
figure let's make a little more
interesting so the start we're going to
do a camera test so how are we gonna do
it I got the galaxy s5 in my pants
you've got the iPhone 6 in my pants so
we're gonna see if we take it out the
quickest take a picture of that tree the
tree that tree that tree headstone and
whoever can take the fixture quickest
wins all right let's do it okay 3 2 1
kick it out oh it takes forever done
done I win got it got it
iPhone 6 and boy so that was super
scientific clearly edgy yeah I mean you
guys learning a lot so next we're going
to go even farther and do some slow
motion video tests so the Galaxy s5 has
slow motion capabilities so does the
iPhone 6 so we're gonna run around like
idiots and see which camera is best all
right galaxy s5 let's do it
you
yeah that's a thing you do yeah just as
a celebration the celebration yeah okay
those like that's good that's good
that's actually pretty good
so all right close Thanks I don't know
if I could top that though hope we'll
find out Oh bring it in nailed it
you
oh you almost like landing oh no
crashing burn all right it doesn't look
cleaner there that's a little cleaner
yeah I think we'll have to wait to
actually see it like on a computer but
uh I think iPhone 6 gets has a tentative
win by the wind that was nice jump he
definitely went on the jump leave me a
rating down below yeah eight out of ten
eight and a half okay eight and a half
all right so where you go a little bit
extreme this time so you know we could
just load an app or whatever but there's
no fun in that there's no challenge
we're gonna test the GPUs of these
phones GPUs hard core benchmarking with
Angry Birds we're gonna open up the app
and see who can beat the first little
facets again the phone's completely
necessary to see who's better at Angry
Birds three two one go
come on man there we go
seriously really that's looks loke boom
done I never get to play well so
actually that was actually legitimate
speaking pairs guys you actually showed
something real if you want play Angry
Birds iPhone 6 is actually a little
faster all right no you got you get it
there you go you win and spirit next up
we have voice so Suri Cruise was Google
now actually save in contest I way
prefer Google now we're gonna see how
fast they are so you ready yep let's go
go ahead open it up how tall is the
Empire State Building
and yeah pulled it out it's a sheep
really close close but look there's a
lot more information here like I'm just
getting a little bit yeah yeah here but
yeah you've got like the full search
you've got like directions the whole
deal so I think as far as like voice
stuff goes cool now pretty clear winner
okay so we've done a lot of real-world
stuff but be honest
doesn't really matter I mean don't
really calls texts for pieces their
camera no never so what we're gonna do
is the important stuff right now
benchmarks
you
all right so hopefully you guys have fun
with this incredibly incredibly detailed
and scientific very scientific is the
keyword anyway I gotta give a big shout
out to John for helping me with this you
know obviously you know we've got to
have the the real comparison can't just
be me sitting in my bedroom like
benchmarking phones all day I totally
didn't do that yesterday by the way it
wasn't we thought maybe you guys would
enjoy something different that was a
benchmark song bike ticket tomorrow
which is awesome I think you guys
probably know it because it's like the
greatest benchmark song ever all so big
shout out to gender behind the camera
your average consumer for holding it
down in the camera side in the iPhone 6
house in the iPhone 6 house so you guys
should definitely check out both of
their channels as well as the playlist
in the description where we go over all
of our iPhone 6 coverage and yet guys
anything else anyways guys I will catch
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
