best SmartWatch to find out I gathered
the second gen moto 360 Samsung gear s2
and Apple watch even though they look
similar each takes a different approach
Samsung was one of the first to tackle
smartwatches with the original Galaxy
gear but with the gear s2 they basically
started from scratch with a bright fully
round OLED display it looks more like a
traditional watch than most and black
it's pretty stealth looking although
there is a classic option which comes
with a classier leather band in
different housing the normal s2 comes
with a pair of rubber bands which are
fine but it feels a bit on the cheaper
side one of my favorite features is the
bezel the touch screen works but most
things are much faster to do just by
rotating the bezel there are also home
and back buttons along the side which
all adds up to make one of the easiest
to use smartwatches out there on the
other end of the spectrum is the Apple
watch this is the stainless steel
version but it's essentially the same as
the spork you're looking at a much more
traditional rectangular display the OLED
screen is just as good as the gear s2
with the blacks and solid colors but
while options and menus work better
without a round screen it just doesn't
look at school like all smartwatches the
touch screen works with such a small
display it can be a bit awkward which is
where forced touch comes in unlike the
others which often rely on long pressing
the Apple watch can pull up extra
options by pressing harder on the screen
and it works well there's also the
digital crown which is how I interact
with the watch 90% of the time I
slightly prefer the rotating bezel on
the gear s2 but the Apple watch is one
solidly designed SmartWatch come over to
the Moto 360 and there's no plastic or
rubber to be found instead there's a
solid metal chassis and a real leather
band which gives a nice premium feel the
only thing that slightly holds it back
is that it feels oddly light for such a
beefy watch like the first moto 360
we've got a round display which looks
good but there is a small window on the
bottom where the sensors look I don't
really mind in normal use I quickly
forget about it and this lunar bezel is
nice where the 360 really loses out as
in usability you're limited to the touch
screen and a single button it's fine but
having a quicker option to navigate the
software like on the Apple watch and
gear s2 would be a welcome addition when
it comes to picking a SmartWatch one of
the biggest deciding factors is what
phones they work with it shouldn't be
huge surprise that the Apple watch only
works on the iPhone and the gear s2
works on Samsung phones but it also
supports some other Android
with a few exceptions I did have some
issues getting it to work with my note 5
as a need a firmware update that wasn't
out yet but it worked out in the end the
real winner for compatibility is the
Moto 360 not only does it work on
Android but it also supports iOS as well
Android wear has made big improvements
in the last year but it does feel a bit
unpolished as if it's too heavy to run
smoothly on a watch while the second gen
360 is faster than before you'll still
get some slowness from time to time in
comparison the gear s2 feels lightning
fast the animations are quick and it's
easy to fly through the interface with
next to no slowdowns the Apple watch is
fast as well but it can take a while to
open some things especially when it
comes to more hardcore apps smartwatches
are most useful for notifications in my
opinion but all support third-party apps
I'm not sure how many people want to
read CNN on the wrist but the option is
there being able to navigate especially
with walking directions is nice but most
of the utility is very similar on all
three watches things like voice search
work well although this is where Android
wear on the 360 does best but asking
Siri a quick question also works just
fine unlike a normal watch you're pretty
much going to have to get used to
charging a smart watch every night it's
not the end of the world but it's one
more device you'll have to remember to
plug in every night
most of the decision really comes down
to what phone you use the Moto 360 is
the safest choice with the ability to
customize the design and Moto maker you
can really make it your own if you use
an iPhone the Apple watch has the best
integration and the design is the most
premium here it's a bit more pricey but
you do get what you pay for the biggest
surprise is actually the gear s2 while
the hardware is a bit on the cheaper
side the screen is great
the bezel works well and it's seriously
fast if Samsung brings support for the
iPhone the gear s2 is going to be hard
to beat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
