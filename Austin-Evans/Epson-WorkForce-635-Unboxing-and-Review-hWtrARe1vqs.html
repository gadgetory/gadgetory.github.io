of the epson workforce 635 all-in-one
printer so before I get into the review
go ahead and do a quick unboxing and
show you guys what all is included in
the box ok so inside the box you do get
the workforce printer itself which does
look pretty good but of course I will
get into that in the full review I'm but
you also do get quite a few nice
accessories cables etc so you do have a
standard telephone cable go ahead and
hook it up you have the standard you
know power cable so you can do quite and
plug it in you also do get all the ink
cartridges that you need there all go
ahead and separately sealed so you have
the tri-colored as well as the black so
that it's nice of course I do include in
cartridges so you're ready to get up and
running immediately and then here we do
have the CD which I'm sure has the
drivers maybe a little bit of software
and we do have an instruction manual in
here and lastly we do have some paper
samples so that I shouldn't go ahead
give some paper samples go ahead and
test out how the printer works ok so
I've used the work for 635 for a while
now and really the main thing that
strikes me about it is that it is very
very fast so everything from the
printing which is really quite speedy to
the scanning which is really impressive
as far as how fast you can scan copy
documents but indeed just the boot up
times as well as the general menu system
everything is really catered to really
get things done as quickly as possible
which I definitely do very much
appreciate now as far as the printing
goes it's really quite fast so the speed
is roughly going to be about 15 pages
per minute when you're just printing out
standard black and white documents if
when you get into color especially when
you get into full color pictures it does
take considerably longer than that
however a normal day they use I had no
issues whatsoever the workforce
definitely just did theirs printed stuff
out very very quickly I mean I was over
on my laptop I go click something to
print by the time I walk over to the
printer usually it was pretty much
almost done already now this is
specially held up for winter copying so
actually well I mentioned I'll go ahead
and just tell you guys how it does it it
actually does have two features as far
as how the copying goes so the normal
way would just be to go ahead and lift
it up and you can force can place your
documents pictures whatever you want
onto the scanner and you can go ahead
and just scan them copy them do whatever
you like
however an additional features that you
can also go ahead and just set a list of
documents up on top through the
automatic document feeder so the way
this works is really simple like I do
they just take how many ever pieces of
paper that you need to be copied scan
fax whatever and you just set it right
there
and then as soon as you do that you go
ahead and have it copy or scan or
whatever you're needing to do no go
ahead and feed through all the documents
scan them and then do whatever you need
to do which is definitely a really nice
feature you don't have to actually
individually do each document before you
need to fax something or scan it as I
mentioned before the copying speeds is
very very impressive I mean it copies
almost as fast as it can print which is
definitely a nice feature especially
coming from my last all-in-one it was
very very slow we're also does have a
fax machine it works just fine just as
you would expect a fax machine to work
and then this does scan your documents
and the quality is overall really quite
impressive and that's a great feature of
about this all-in-one is the fact that
it does have Wi-Fi built in so this is
really great my previous all-in-one did
not have Wi-Fi so really after using
this for a few days I'm totally sold it
is really really nice to be able to go
ahead and print from all over around the
house you know you have your laptop
especially if you do have a laptop you
know you don't have to worry about going
and finding your printer plugging it in
all that kind of stuff you can go ahead
and just print whatever you need from
anywhere in the house which is
definitely something I appreciate it a
lot
it also does have an Eaton that port as
well along with a standard modem so you
can go ahead of course and you plug it
in for faxes and if you don't have a
wireless network you can't go ahead and
just hook it up through either net
addition it also does have a USB port
although it does not come with the cable
you probably won't really need to use
the USB port considering it does have
both Ethernet and Wi-Fi however it is
definitely a nice thing they do include
that it also does support several
different memory cards so you can pay
and go ahead and plug in your SD your
SDHC your memory card as well as your
compact flash cards straight into the
printer now I found this to be actually
a fairly useful feature you can go ahead
and take photos straight from your
memory card and print them and view them
through your printer as well as you can
go ahead and do it the other way around
and scan different images and documents
onto the memory card which is definitely
a really nice feature I thought overall
I was very impressed with the epson
workforce 635 now of course that's not
was perfect I did have some issues with
the printer drivers and the printer
software as far as online Windows 7
computer you know I just some flakiness
sometimes the prints weren't going
through sometimes it didn't decide to
connect however there was recently an
update that went ahead and installed and
that did seem to fix most of it so if
you go ahead and install it straight
from the CD definitely go ahead and
check for updates Adele the printer
software is available for the Mac as
well as Windows so you can go ahead and
install it for your operating system in
all I have no real issues in
recommending this as a very very solid
all-in-one and of course does do
everything that you would expect and
it's actually at a not too bad price
point as well generally it's I'm going
to be running you about 200 although
some places you can get for a little bit
less so it definitely does pay to shop
around I didn't like to give a big
