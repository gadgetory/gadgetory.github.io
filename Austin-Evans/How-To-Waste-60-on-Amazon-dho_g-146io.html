back with another tech under video this
time taking a look at tech under $60
over the catches as always I have no
idea what I'm looking at thanks to good
old savage Kenny the clips k6i reference
headphones oh wait what is this a
lightning audio amp a $60 amp coach
typically makes pretty good any air
monitors that shouldn't be a huge
surprise you're paying $60 for a
headphone amp for such as like the
iPhone 7 so give these a try first I'm
going to use the standard lightning
adapter that comes with the iPhone 7 and
see how these headphones sounds usually
I'm actually not a big fan of these any
air style of headphones typically it's
actually kind of hard to get a
comfortable fit for me but let's give
these guys a try
they're good they sound really good for
the most part the only thing is they're
just a little bit of a lack of bass and
of course that's a subjective thing I
think some people prefer something
that's a little bit more of a clearer
sound with less bass but for me I like
if there's just a little bit more punch
to the sounds but of course the
headphones are not alone in a vacuum now
I get to try this $60 lightning adapter
so it looks pretty much similar to the
one that comes with the iPhone although
you can see there's definitely a lot
more going on here with having not only
an amp but also dedicate DAC this this
might be interesting I don't know I'm
not so sold that's going to be that
great that's not cool so you can
actually use this little keychain thing
there might be a little bit of a
difference I feel it might be just a bit
more separation but I don't know about
this one
I don't know so essentially the app will
actually allow you to get a little more
amplification and it does sound better
it's mostly just a little bit louder but
with that extra volume I can hear a
little more clarity so listen to the
same headphones hooked up to the LGV 30
which has an amazing quad DAC inside
it's actually a fairly similar sound
I feel like this adapter will kind of
punch up the music just a little bit
which personally I actually kind of like
what is it worth 60 bucks
ah I'm not so sure pebble time wait this
is $60 so if you guys are not familiar
pebble actually went out of business
which makes it a little weird that
they're still selling them so for me I
actually really do enjoy using a
SmartWatch mostly for things like
notifications which keeps me from
keeping my phone out of my pocket all
the time but let's see how this pebble
time stack so I will say even though yes
this is like $50 the hardware still
feels kind of cheap like I would not
want to rock this rubber band every day
once you sit up the pebble time you'll
see it's actually a pretty much
functioning SmartWatch so not only can
we go and control our music here so we
can start playing it from the phone in
my pocket but you can also go through
get your notifications alarms one of the
main reasons to use a pebble though is
the battery life so while most
smartwatches measure it in hours this
guy can last days on a single charge and
oh yes it's not going to be the most
functional thing and going forward who
knows how well this is actually going to
be supported but for 50 bucks not bad
alright what is our fourth products a
mysterious cardboard box oh okay a USB
pet rock important open box carefully do
not remove rock before reading
instructions
literally a rock with a hole cut into it
and a USB cable Ken how much did this
cost you're laughing too much how much
does this cost $40 the hole in it
there's a USB cable you know just when
you think that Ken's doing a great job
he's busting out these cool tech items
left and right and then you get a USB
pet rock all right let's just plug this
thing in get it over with I'm like half
expecting this to be full of malware or
something will happen when we plug our
pit rock in absolutely nothing
absolutely nothing happens at least we
can make sure that our USB pet rock
feels like he's part of the 21st century
and connected to all the other devices
in our lives uh yeah
what is this a fifty millimeter 1.8 lens
Oh Oh actually something that's not
terrible after the rock I was expecting
garbage town $50 all right Wow this is
uh this is identical looking to the
canon fifty one point eight so if you
guys have ever really gotten into dslr's
you'll know that usually the first lens
you get is a 50ml lens now that does it
give you a kind of interesting look but
it's also really cheap
however 50 bucks is uh that's pretty
cheap this is like laughably lightweight
but if we pop it on our camera here see
what we've got that noise
okay okay let's let's do this let's do
this it's actually not that bad looking
see here's take a picture of our super
cool pet rock dude this is actually
pretty decent so now they can version
the one that they're knocking off here
is usually around a hundred dollars or
so so to get what looks to be pretty
similar for fifty bucks is not bad at
all what you're looking at right now is
actually a camera using a much more
expensive 50 millimeter lens so if we
put the $50 option on
this is what things look like now I
can't really tell from all the way over
here but it probably isn't that far off
Ken what do you think pretty good all
right so that mean we get to save you a
bunch of money on lenses now we've
officially got a pet rock in this video
and now we've downgrade our camera
equipment
what else could you ask for before we
get to the final product of the video
you guys may remember that a few weeks
ago we did a video on the lg ultra white
festival who are awesome enough to
sponsor this video after going through
all the applicants the top three
finalists are Zachary from hammers and
circuits Taylor Reed and last but not
least physics Phil the finalists are
going to join Linus and I at his studio
in Vancouver where they're going to get
to build their ultimate dream setup stay
tuned because Linus and I are going to
be doing videos from the event but you
guys actually still have a chance to win
a monitor the first Quest is to fill in
the blanks guessing the LG ultra wide
key features and the second one is
simply to guess who is the final winner
so be sure to check out those links in
the description and now let us see what
is the final item of the video the
smartphone control paper airplane
conversion kits convert your paper
airplane into a smartphone controlled
flying machine I think this would be
pretty cool I actually used to really
enjoy building paper airplanes when I
was a kid although I haven't done it in
like a while this is a good idea this is
pretty legit how how much was this 35
look at this Ken coming in with the
budget options so once you download the
app I can immediately see that this was
designed by nerds now that do we have
these signal strengths but we have fuel
we have the actual control which I'm
actually not going to do because we need
to build our paper airplane I know my
paper airplanes I can make my own I said
there with way more confidence than I
really should oh this is really bad this
is actually not a great paper airplane
this is like not even close to being
even
okay the apps a little bit aggressive
let's try to go up all right full power
oh alright okay okay so what did we
learn today we learned that when the
paper airplane comes with specific
instructions on how to build the plane
you should probably listen to these so
what do you guys think about Kent's
picks for this video let us know in the
comments below and as always the links
to all the stuff will be in the
description of the video anyway guys
thank you so much for watching and I
will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
