here to find out how a 1 pound laptop
compares to a 20 pound laptop so with
our tiny laptops we have the GPD pocket
now you may have recently seen that we
did a video on this guy and this is one
of the world's smallest laptops however
thanks to our good buddy Lamarr Wilson
we have something that's just a little
bit bigger all right so this is the Acer
predator 21 X this thing is a beast the
box the whole thing was like 75 pounds
this whole laptop literally this is the
box for laptop it's a cool Pelican case
also can we just give a shout out to how
ridiculous this looks right now tiny big
big we find tiny but kind of buff
I'm not compensating what are you
talking about this is this is what I do
this I just every day I'm just like one
well and see when you raise that to high
that's why your muscle busted right
there for real though this is 20 pounds
that is ridiculously head and this is
one pound that's like it can you do this
no you don't want me to do that I went
to a lab not work.you so with the GPD
pocket we're rocking a 7-inch display
versus a curved 21 inch display on the
predator but what's interesting is
they're actually almost the same screen
resolution this is 2560 by the way but
this is 1920 by 1200 so this seven inch
laptop actually is a taller vertical
screen than this guy as far as
resolution goes alright so to win this
obviously it scaled down it's meant for
something that's gonna be a little bit
more portable right we're going to take
this guy gurney throw in a pocket or a
purse or something it's going to be much
more and then I guess I'm going to say
info Friday nights when I wear my purse
where's this guy I mean come on it comes
in a Pelican case you're not going to
take this anywhere right like it almost
kind of begs the question and of course
I don't wanna spoil the entire video
right now but like who buys this when
you can you buy a desktop but it does
give you some portability somebody loves
a really big lap all right second
thought what you have problem with you
the size of your laptop right now so
inside the predator 21 X we have a quad
4 overclocked Core i7 processor 64
gigabytes of memory a pair of 512 gig as
a C's a one terabyte hard drive and to
top it all off to full GT X 1080
graphics cards what do you have in there
um I have a memory - I have 8 8 gigs of
ram ok ok
don't processor that it runs so it has
excellent graphical of car
180 that's an ad car these are both
Windows 10 computers by the way these
are both laptops they're essentially the
same thing if you squint really hard
okay this one crisis okay so this times
very much of a chiclet type keyboard so
you can type in it now what about your
keyboard okay so this obviously is where
a bigger laptop really shines right yes
so now I do we have a full-size keyboard
here and one of the cool things is if
you don't want the trackpad and actually
take it out a little bit right over to a
number pad where I like about this
though is it has a full mechanical
keyboard with cherry switches it really
does feel exactly like what you would
get with a normal sort of like
mechanical keyboard for a desktop you're
really losing anything besides a mouse
obviously but you're really premature
getting the same sort of experience that
you would get with the desktop so at
least my power cable is this size I just
plug it right in and plug it in plug it
in one export only that's fair you got
over there the pressure has um well it's
a revolutionary design of two sorry
power supply to full power supplies with
two cables going into the laptop because
you know when we got GTX 280s
we're going to make sure that we have
all of the power okay you win oh yeah
okay you just respect I get the
portability so as a big giant expensive
and very very large laptop this guy is a
bit of a gaming PC but we should keep
things fair because this might not have
quite the same power of the quad-core i7
with GTX anyway so what are you thinking
let's do csgo let's do a game that will
work on both yeah go on this no way the
problem with the pocket is that there's
no touchpad there's no trackpad which
normally is not a big deal because you
can use the touchscreen okay with this
you have to use a little nub unless you
have a mouse try to walk around try to
do anything with that I don't want to go
any closer cause I got it okay this is
this is really horrible oh okay you know
what what happened was the mouse Aloha
and repair you can pull them out into
either of these so that's not really
totally fair to make fun of okay
differences this guy's basically the
size of Mouse whereas you would even
notice a mouse in your bag that this guy
it did work and I was actually gaming
yeah I was surprised that it was going
to load
up see yourself now my turn
I've got a saw 137 for interesting right
now today's look at your purpose
you're a pro okay you know but hey you
dyed it glorious 25 60 bucks in ID if
you know what what more can you ever ask
for out of life
so with a laptop this big not only they
have four speakers but it also has two
subwoofers obviously excuse me yeah two
subs in the laptop so overkill what this
whole thing is overkill right look
that's the point right
no one buys a laptop with two giant
power supplies for something practical
to take with you every day right
this is overkill in every possible way
and that's what makes it cool so would
you rather have the 20 pound $9,000
laptop or the $500 one-pound laptop got
it goes in my $1,000 won as long as I
get it for free grand brother can't
afford that
that's very the spear actually do kind
of like how small this is but let us
know which one you guys would pick in
the comments and if you want more on the
predator Lamar and I did a great
embossing over on his channel where you
can see the giant Pelican case and all
the craziness goes along with it
so that's we'll be sure to go check that
out and we will catch you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
