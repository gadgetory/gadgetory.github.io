promising to shake up the smartphone
games but LG might just have something
to say about that big shout out to LG
for hooking us up with the g6 a little
bit early now they are not sponsoring
this video but I am curious to see how
it stacks well take a look inside the
box and we have the g6 you know the
galaxy si is getting all the hype for
having essentially no bezel on a giant
screen you take a look at this it's not
actually that far off there's not a lot
of the blocks we have the power adapter
as well as a USB cable and this is in
comparison to the galaxy s 8 which comes
with a really nice pair of AKG
headphones in the box when you look at
the g6 next to the galaxy s 8 plus and
the iPhone 7 plus you'll see that well
this just sticks out the idea of having
much thinner bezels just gives you more
screen in the same footprint
well the g6 does have thin bezel it
can't quite touch the s8 this is a
little bit more of a blocky phone so
it's got a completely flat display
compared to the s8 which has curved
glass both front and back if you look
closely you'll see if the g6 has a
slightly more pronounced gen but
generally speaking they do look fairly
similar they both do have the slight
curves around the edges of the display
and with so much screen with so little
bezel it does feel like a new generation
of smart phone this isn't a perfect
comparison the galaxy s 8 plus is a
little bit bigger than the g6 but if you
have a standard SI it's going to be
about the same size but what really
separates both of these phones from
other devices is the aspect ratio so the
g6 has a 28 80 by 1440p IPS display
where the galaxy s 8 and s 8 plus bumps
it up to 20 960 by 1440 what that means
these are much taller screens than what
you're probably used to so if you open a
normal app such as YouTube all this
means this you get a little bit of extra
vertical real estate but if you're
watching something like video what that
means is that you end up getting black
bars on either side of the video now
this is not exactly a huge deal I think
that the extra screen real estate in 95%
of your apps is worth the trade-off but
it does mean that video is not going to
fully eat up the screen it should be no
surprise these are two of the best
smartphone displays out right now so the
LG G 6 has a couple cool features like
it supports HDR 10 as well as Dolby
vision so as HDR video becomes more and
more popular the G 6 is ready to handle
it yes it might not be a huge upgrade
over the last generation but then it's
still a terrific looking AMOLED display
so the contrast is absolutely on point
it's nicely set rate and it gets really
bright so
under the box it actually runs at a
slightly lower 12:20 by 1080 resolution
now there's nothing necessarily wrong
with that it still it's reasonably sharp
and they're doing it I presume to save
battery but when you bought a super
high-resolution great looking display on
a smartphone you kind of want to you
know run it at full resolution slide
shifts in 2017 build quality isn't an
issue with either phone but I do prefer
the design of the galaxy f8 what's cool
here is that because it has glass on
front and back and they both have the
same taper is a very seamless sort of
design especially with the very thin
frame that goes around the edges it
really does feel great in the hand now
it's not perfect it would be nice this
had better speakers instead of one small
one on the bottom and the fingerprint
sensor on back is not quite ideal but
taken as a whole this is an absolutely
killer design I love it in comparison
the g6 just feels a little bit more
old-school so with the flat sort of
edges around the side it just doesn't
feel as thin in the hand and it's not
exactly a bad phone don't get me wrong
does have a nice glass in front in fact
if I had not touched the s8 this would
be great but in comparison it just
doesn't quite hold up but there are some
things I do prefer on the g6 and
probably the biggest one is the power
button not only does the double is the
fingerprint sensor which puts it in a
much better location on the galaxy s 8
but it just feels like a clever use of
space sort of combining your fingerprint
sensor which already has to be there
anyway with a physical button to turn on
and off the phone one area where they
are the same is with the ip68 water
resistance so no you shouldn't go
swimming with either of these phones but
if you like for flight shipping 2017
there is no reason not to have at least
some sort of water resistance it's just
nice to know that when you spend this
much money on a phone a little bit of a
splash is not going to kill it both
films are also running Android 7.0
nougat with their own skins now I prefer
what Samsung has done a little bit more
this time around it's a little bit of a
cleaner interface and while they have
included things like bixby which I'm
just not going to use because Google
assistant exists but for the most part
both phones are completely fine you can
live with either skin and of course you
know launch a sort of thing one of the
biggest differences between the two
phones are specs so the LG G 6 has the
older Snapdragon 820 one the Galaxy s8
has the brand new Snapdragon 835 so I'm
curious to see how they perform
that's actually pretty close so one of
the big advantages of the s8 is that
it's an octa-core processor instead of
quad core on the g6 which means that it
definitely does win on a multi-threaded
side but on the single side inside is
actually not a huge difference however
because it's the 835 and it's based on
newer process and theory that should
help battery light cameras might
actually be the biggest difference
between these two phones so the Galaxy
s8 has the same 12 megapixel camera from
the s7 with just a few software tweaks
the LG G 6 has dual 13 megapixel camera
so it's cool about this dual camera on
the g6
is that while it was available on the g5
there was a huge difference in quality
between the two cameras wears on the g6
yes the standard camera is a little bit
higher quality it looks a little bit
nicer but it's not a huge difference and
if we part of that is that both cameras
have the same 13 megapixel sensor behind
them now we jump over to the Galaxy S a
it is not a bad camera by any means you
can get some really killer shots the big
downside though is it just is a huge
upgrade over the s7 so Samsung is doing
some additional image processing so
essentially just like the pixel they're
constantly taking stills and using the
best bits of each one to combine it into
a final image and it does look really
nice I do think the S eights a little
bit more of a natural image it's not
quite so sharp and that bigger sensor
actually does give you just a little bit
of depth of field one of the big
advantages of the galaxy estate though
is that new 8 megapixel front-facing
camera not only is this fairly wide but
it also looks really nice especially in
video and this is what the G 6
front-facing camera looks like it's not
bad but it does not even come close the
se yeah even for stills the g 6 it's
fine
but I think the sa does went out so this
is what video looks like on the LG G 6
so it looks a little bit over sharp to
my eye but it is still shooting in 4k
however one of the cool things is you
can seamlessly switch between the two
cameras this is what the wide-angle
looks like and then we can jump right
back into the standing on the other hand
the galaxy s 8 video looks pretty
impressive it's not only a saturation
nice but because it does have the bigger
sensor we do get some depth of field
here also stabilization seems to be
reasonable and C it maybe trips up just
a little bit when you make a big move
but it is hard to argue with this camera
I mean sure it's not a huge upgrade over
the s7 and the g 6 camera especially
having the wide-angle both cameras look
great especially for still when you look
at the whole package
I think it's gonna be really tough to
beat this s8
and that kind of tells the story I'm
afraid the g6 is a good phone and if the
s8 didn't exist it'll be a great phone
the problem is this just does so many
things so well that's going to be hard
to argue with so what do you guys think
about the g6 and the Galaxy s8
let me know in the comments below and I
will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
