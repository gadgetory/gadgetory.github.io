from CES 2013 with the brand-new Sony
Xperia Z and this is the new flagship
phone from Sony it's got some really
cool specs so let's take a look so the
first thing you notice with this is a
full five inch 1080p screen so we've
seen this a couple other phones like the
HTC Droid DNA they're gonna say it looks
really nice now one thing is the viewing
Eagles are a little bit weird so you'll
have to kind of take a look at it of
course this is one of the early phone so
it's not a big deal it's also got a
really good camera so 13 megapixels as
well as it's got HDR video so of course
with 1080p but HDR is what it's like
basically takes multiple exposures and
kind of helps kind of to get all that
like the highlights and the lowlights
kind of to make sure that everything
looks nice he's got that in video which
is really cool
so it's powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon
s4 pro processor 1.5 gigahertz quad-core
pretty much the best that we've got
right now the phone itself is pretty
lightweight it's only 7.9 me let me
understand I'm gonna say in the hand
it's got a really nice feel now one of
the big things about this is that it is
water resistant so not waterproof so
don't go swimming with it but it's got
all the ports covered and one of the big
things is the ports have a nice covers
on them
so you can pull them off really easily
they're not flimsy or cheap or anything
and it still really looks like a nice
high-end premium device the phone itself
is running Android 4.1 jelly bean and
this is an all new skin from Sony so it
actually doesn't have an official name
or anything like that but it looks very
nice it's very clean and the phone is
very very fast so you guys can see here
compared to a samsung galaxy note 2 it
keeps up no problem at all
thanks to that Qualcomm Snapdragon
processor it's got lots and lots of
power and it's very smooth as well so
it's got on-screen Android capacitive
buttons so there's no not capacitive
buttons it's got on-screen Android keys
so there's no capacitive buttons or
anything like that so even though it has
a 5-inch screen it's not a really really
big phone anyway guys it's been about it
for these sony xperia z we don't have a
price released it or anything like that
it's definitely becoming in quarter 1
2013 and so yeah pretty good stuff if
you guys are interested in more CES 2013
coverage be sure to hit that like button
and subscribe I'll be doing lots more
videos all kinds of phones cameras on
all that kind of stuff for the next few
weeks anyway guys I will catch you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
