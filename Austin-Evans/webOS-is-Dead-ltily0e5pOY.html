today just about a few minutes ago HP
announced that they are going to be
killing off webOS I know this one really
came out of the blue of course HP did
buy palm the makers of webOS about a
year a little bit more than a year or so
ago and earlier this year they had a big
press conference they announced the HP
veer which I previously review pretty
nice little phone they announced the HP
TouchPad which of course this came out
didn't have the best sales in the world
but overall it was a really pretty solid
tablet and of course they had the HP 3:3
which just went up for pre-order however
out of the blue it seems that HP is just
going to be killing off webOS in fact
I'll read you guys the press statement
right here HP reported that it plans to
announce that it will discontinue
operations for webOS devices
specifically the touchpad and webOS
phones
HP will continue to explore options to
optimize the value of webOS software
going forward reading in between the
lines that basically means that webOS is
going to be no more so of course I'm
sure that they will start winding down
the production or in fact they may are
already stopped production of all the
webOS phones and the tablets whether
what we'll see about all the touch pads
and all the phones that are out
especially with the pre 3 that it was
just coming out what they're going to do
with it remains to be seen but
definitely not good news as far as webOS
it may live on them they may try to
license it but it's just it's just a
weird I mean they were talking about
webOS I mean just a few months ago how
it was coming back they were gonna put
it on all pcs printers they're gonna
just expand webOS like crazy but really
it's just seems like they're just gonna
just ax it off anyway guys really
curious to know what do you think I
don't do I don't do videos that end on a
sad note very often but I have to admit
I'm actually a little bit upset with
this I really liked webOS and I was
really looking forward to seeing what HP
did and to see them just cut it out like
this just middle of nowhere I think of
all the palm employees who've worked so
long and they're just kind of just exit
leaves a really bad taste dry mouth but
really curious to know guys what do you
think I'm sure you guys are gonna have a
lot of opinions just like I do so I look
forward to talking with you guys in the
comments</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
