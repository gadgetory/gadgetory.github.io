is an American tech YouTube video
producer hey guys this is Austin and
today I'm here with a little bit of a
test so this is the Amazon echo it's
actually surprising the sound thing I've
never really covered on my channel
before so when Amazon reach down asked
to sponsor video on the brand new voice
shopping feature
I was totally down alright so check this
out I can order something with the Alexa
purely with my voice
Alexa order a hammock the top search
result for hammock is best choice
products hand quilted fabric with pillow
double size spreader bar it's sixty four
dollars and seventy cents total should I
order it yes okay
order placed that was fast and most
importantly I now have a hammock in my
life I like the idea of being able to
order stuff with your voice that is
really cool it's not exactly difficult
to order from a computer but as long as
you're a Prime member with one-click
payment enable you can voice job
especially for something small like a
hammock it might not be the most common
thing but for example Alexa order toilet
paper amazon's choice for toilet paper
is angel soft bath tissue that's cool i
think that's the perfect example of how
you can shop just literally walking
around go oh we forgot that we're out of
laundry detergent whatever ask Alexa to
order it simple as that so they're just
rolling this out to Alexa but they have
a couple of interesting deals that you
can only get with your voice so for
example you can get $10 off your first
eligible voice order over $20 May
between now and prime Day on July 12 so
I've got an idea I'm going to use it
like set to order a few different items
and I'm going to entirely trust the
options that it gives me
Alexa order an Amazon tap order me
headphones order a video game order a
disco ball this video is going to be
ridiculous there's gonna be a way of
stumping it though like there's got to
be something like crazy
Alexa order a TV the top search result
for 42 inch TV is say PSEG 43 543 inch
1080p LED TV should I order it yes
okay please I just ordered a TV that's
it all right so I guess um Alexis I just
ordered me a bunch of stuff to do a
video on so I will see you guys tomorrow
and I think it's about time to do a
video what's inside mystery box number
one
we have the Amazon top so this is
essentially the little brother to the
full sized echo oh wow who's actually
really tiny Alexa where's my stuff
five shipments for Austin's order have
already been delivered for shipment
should be delivered by tomorrow so just
in case you do end up ordering something
that you weren't quite sure on the good
thing is Anna's on offers free refunds
send it back it's no big deal
Oh Alexa play some disco music
that was uncalled for I apologize next
up we have Panasonic hje 12 headphones
not bad
they've got a lot of bass maybe a little
too much bass but there's $7 so this is
actually one of the prime deals so when
Amazon asked me to do this video they
said hey let's order you a couple extra
things just kind of have fun within the
video and the cuisinart griddler is a
how do we do this for maximum griddling
okay so I might not be advanced enough
to greville yet I mean I've got to say I
actually wasn't fully expecting the TV
thing to work
sorry guys thank you so much for
watching my video on the brand new voice
shopping I've got to say at the end of
the day I have a hammock I didn't have a
hammock at the beginning of the day so
you guys should definitely go check out
all the cool stuff amazon has for prime
date you know if you excuse me I'm gonna
go enjoy my new hammock</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
