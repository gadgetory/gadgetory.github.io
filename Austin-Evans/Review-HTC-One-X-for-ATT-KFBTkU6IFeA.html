the review of the HTC One X for AT&amp;amp;T
with a massive screen LTE and Android
4.0 with sense for this is easily the
new flagship for HTC but is it actually
any good let's start with the hardware
the first thing that jumps out at you is
the gorgeous 4.7 inch Super LCD display
with a resolution of 1280 by 720 I can
safely say this is one of the best
mobile displays I've ever used
right up there with the Retina display
on the iPad 3 colors are much better
than normal LCD panels and the viewing
angles are top-notch perfect isn't a
word I ever use in my reviews but the
screen on the One X is very very close
the rest of the design on the One X is
also quite good up top you'll see the
speaker grille with hidden notification
LEDs the front-facing camera which I'll
take a look at a bit later along with
the nearly hidden proximity and light
sensors below you'll see the capacitive
back home and multitasking buttons which
light up in dark areas and work just
fine
unlike most high-end smartphones the One
X is made entirely out of polycarbonate
aka plastic generally I'm a fan of glass
and metal and smartphones but I've got
to say the One X is really impressive
bill quality's top notch is it's all a
single piece and the plastic feels very
good in a hand this also makes the phone
very lightweight even considering the
much larger display in the nearly
identical thickness the One X is still
10 grams lighter than the iPhone 4s
this makes pocketing the phone
absolutely no problem at all as far as
ports go there isn't a lot to speak of
on the left side you'll find micro USB
which is in a slightly awkward position
and on the right is the slightly narrow
volume rocker up top is the similarly
thin sleep/wake button the slot for your
micro sim and a 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack on the rear is the 8 megapixel
camera with LED flash five small
contacts for accessories and the speaker
with Beats Audio branding the speaker
works fine but it's pretty unremarkable
with headphones plugged in the 1x
automatically turns on Beats Audio
although you can turn it off if you want
overall it's nothing spectacular bass is
slightly boosted and the range is too
compressed a bit where I was really
impressed was with the Beats Audio off
he drove a pair of audio technica ath
and 50s much better than my iPhone 4s
making it easily one of the best phones
I've ever tested as far as audio quality
goes moving on to software as of this
review the 1x sports Android 4.0.3 also
known as
sandwich with the HTC since foreskin
generally I'm not a big fan of skins but
since four is probably the best one I've
used yet for example the LOX ring uses a
ring that you can drag up to unlock or
drag an app into to immediately launch
it ICS definitely isn't very far below
the surface so if you're familiar with
Android the One X should be very easy to
get used to
performance is rock solid for an Android
phone with the Snapdragon s4 able to
power the UI without any major lag
unfortunately as with every Android
device I've ever used the overall
experience isn't quite as smooth as iOS
or even Windows Phone with a single core
processor there always seems to be the
slice delay between giving an input and
the phone responding but it's not really
a major issue and it's something you
forget about after a while there's also
a core mount accessory available for the
One X pair with the car application it
gives you easy access to music GPS and
calls in a very large and car friendly
UI one place the One X does it very well
is with the camera it sports an 8
megapixel rear facing camera with an
impressive f/2 aperture and 1080p video
recording image quality is impressive
for a smartphone and right up there with
the best from Apple and Nokia although
in lower light I did notice that it
tended to over saturate with that wide
aperture you can actually get some
decent depth of field alright so I'm not
recording using the HTC One X so these
guys can see here the video quality is
not half bad at all so right now the
phone is on a tripod and the only light
in the room is just from the window
right in front of me how are you going
to add some more light right here and
right here right here that definitely
makes a big difference on top of that if
we want to go ahead all of the audio on
the one it does not have bad want to go
ahead and cut do some external audio you
definitely tell her that makes the
overall video quality much better and
finally but definitely not least we can
go ahead and do a little bit of color
correction to make sure the video is the
absolute best that it can be just as
impressive as the camera itself as the
software you're able to fire off images
with almost no delay and if you hold the
shutter button the camera will fire off
shots as long as you hold it and then
give you the option to only save the one
that deems best or all of them you can
also shoot stills and video at the same
time with manual controls over
everything you need the front-facing
camera is a 1.3 megapixel shooter and
it's fairly decent as far as
front-facing cameras go he does shoot
720p video which you probably won't want
to use it for much more beyond video
chatting or a quick vlog as far as the
specs go
the one X on a tee is rocking a Qualcomm
Snapdragon s4 system on a chip this
means you'll have to crate cores clocked
at 1.5 gigahertz Adreno 2 to 5 graphics
and one gigabyte of ram while on paper
is down compared to the international
version which is powered by a quad-core
NVIDIA Tegra 3 processor in reality you
won't have any issues with normal usage
in gaming the reason for the dual-core
CPU is that this version of the One X
comes with LTE for AT&amp;amp;T if you live in
an area where AT&amp;amp;T has rolled out their
LTE network you can crack up to 10
megabits per second in both download and
upload speaking of cellular performance
overall it was impressed
DTM T tends to have issues in my area
but generally the one I scrapped a
signal well and provide a decent call
quality another benefit of the
Snapdragon is excellent battery life I
was easily able to get through a day of
moderate use with the One X with
frequent 3G and Wi-Fi usage with a few
calls and extend I can sum up the HTC
One X and five words
this thing is a boss the screen is
superb design is right up there with the
very best performances top notch and
it's future proofed with both LTE and
NFC the list price is $200 with a
two-year contract over Amazon is
offering the exact same deal for $150
right now overall it's very simple if
you're interested in an Android phone on
AT&amp;amp;T the One X is the answer if you're
interested in more feel free to check
