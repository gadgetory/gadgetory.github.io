episode 2 of tech I like and know I
didn't just forget to take my head from
self before the shoot today I'm going to
be talking about the audio technica ath
em 50s and for the price these things
are absolutely killer especially when
you compare them to some more expensive
headphones beats so let's go ahead and
take a look when you get the 8 th in 50s
you get a couple of things in the box of
course included is the headphones
themselves and you also do get a
carrying pouch which is a little bit
useful and you also do get an adapter if
you have some higher-end audio equipment
taking a closer look at the headphones
you'll find that they're built pretty
well now they are mostly made out of
plastic however it's not look that bad
they feel free to stir D and definitely
should be able to hold up some pretty
decent wear and tear now up top you'll
find the pad headband it's got a nice
amount of padding sometimes it can get a
little bit uncomfortable when you're
listening to it for long periods of time
but for the most part looks nice it does
have the gigantic Audio Technica logo up
top these are over your headphones and
of course one of the most important
attributes is the fact that they've got
to be comfortable you know if you get
something that's totally sealed up
around your ears if they're like the
padding is not right or something they
can get really uncomfortable really fast
however just like the headband and
everything else it works pretty well
maybe not the most comfortable
headphones I've ever had in my entire
life but they work really nicely and
again over extended listening periods
you're not gonna have a whole lot of
issues of course your ears might get a
little warm and you know it's not gonna
be quite perfect but overall you're not
really gonna have any problems the in
fifties come with a fairly long
high-quality cable now what I like is
about half of it or so is coiled so of
course if you want to stick it in your
pocket wherever you don't have to have a
15 foot long cable or whatever but on
the other hand you can still stretch it
out and you can go almost all the way
around the room without really having to
run into any major issues of course
these are some high-end headphones and
you're not really gonna want to pick
them up if they don't have good audio
quality
however the in fifties definitely do not
disappoint in this category so the bass
is nice and while talking about bass I
just want to kind of throw another
shout-out to Beats because I know a lot
of people do compare these to the beats
now the beats definitely do have a lot
more bass however I didn't really
consider that a good thing now bass is
definitely a very important part you
know you want headphones that are well
rounded you want good bass but you also
want other attributes and a lot of beats
they just overwhelm there's just lots
and lots and lots of bass and everything
else is very toned down it just kind of
sounds a little bit muddy heavily with
the m50 everything is nicely balanced
there is some good bass it's not gonna
go blow your ears off that's because
there's a lot
of other different parts of your music
so the lows the mids the highs
everything sounds really nice I mean the
highs are even probably my favorite part
I mean it almost sounds like there are
tweeters just inside the cups they're
really really nice don't get me wrong
these are not the best headphones in the
world you know for example some of the
better headphones I've listened to
include the a hi-fi man HD 400s those
pretty much beat these on all categories
however those are 400 bucks these are
150 so you know they're in a totally
different price range and of course you
know you're gonna be paying that much
more you're gonna get better quality but
overall for the money for the price for
all that kind of good stuff the audio
technica ath em 50's do not disappoint
of course these aren't quite perfect so
one of the cons I found was that the 3.5
millimeter audio jack doesn't always
work with everything
now while the in fifties themselves
don't really require a ton of power so
you should be able to empower them from
you know an mp3 player computer image
anything with a 3.5 millimeter audio
jack but where the problem lies is just
being able to plug it in so with my
iPhone 4s and pretty much any case I
tried on it it was not able to actually
get a good connection and that's because
it is a very flat jack so when you try
to plug it in if there's any kind of lip
or anything that kind of not doesn't
allow it to get a full solid connection
then you won't be able to plug them in
it just won't work so pretty much any
time I wanted to listen to music on my
iPhone I had to take the case off which
wasn't a deal-breaker but it was a
little bit annoying it definitely
something I wanted to mention to you
guys
overall if you're looking to pick up
some headphones and 150 to $200 price
range I highly recommend the audio
technica ath em 50s they have some
awesome audio quality good build quality
and overall they're a really good
package on quick sidenote
I wanted to give you guys a big big
thank you for the support I received on
the last video the response was pretty
much overwhelmingly positive and for
that I really appreciate it guys so if
you enjoy these videos let me be sure to
leave them a thumbs up favorite share
all that kinda great stuff and of course
I do also want to mention that I'm going
to be doing these weekly now so every
Saturday you will see a new episode of
tech I like or of course I'll go over
phones headphones cameras you name it
any kind of cool tech I like so yeah
guys I'll catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
