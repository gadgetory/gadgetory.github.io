simple goal to find the cheapest
brand-new computer that I could find on
Amazon and well this is what I've got
and big shout out to LastPass respond
suring today's video this is the gue
leaked GPC when tell mini PC now as you
can see it's a pretty mini so the main
idea here is that for $100 this is going
to be a fully functional computer so
it's not going to be a bare-bones you
don't need to install windows everything
should come all ready to go oh here we
go we've got the technical
specifications the quad core intel atom
z3580
as I was saying this guy is about as
small as it gets so what we're getting
here is a full fledged desktop computer
you're gonna be getting USB ports HDMI
really really Radley plastic but it
actually does come in this nice aluminum
chassis we get a HDMI cable wow that's
actually really nice you also get what
looks like to be the power adapter so
the nice things about this guy is that
even though it is included in the box it
just runs off of a standard 5 volt micro
USB so in theory you could run this off
of something like a battery bank or even
like a normal phone charger hardware
wise there's really not a lot to the
gulick mini PC so it does have that
aluminum build but if you come around
back what you're going to find is a
full-size USB 3.0 port a USB 2.0 port
the micro USB for power HDMI out as well
as a headphone jack and a micro SD card
slot and that micro SD card is going to
be important because there's only 32
gigs of storage you're definitely gonna
want to expand that I will say one thing
it immediately recognizes that I'm using
a 120 Hertz monitor and it's actually
using the full refresh rate that's kind
of cool oh god what that crash fit so
one quick monitor swap later we have a
fully working PC all those weird issues
actually had nothing to do with the
computer and once we get in here I mean
everything seems to be working fine and
one of the big issues though is that
we're running a full Windows 10 PC with
only 2 gigs of RAM so say you want to do
something simple like watch some YouTube
well if you come over to the channel and
try to load up a page you're going to
see that things slow down quite a bit
most of that is because we only have two
gigs of RAM the Atom processor is not
helping however once you I should get it
to load if you're a little bit patient
it does totally work well so our videos
on trending that's gonna cool
we might not have speakers but you can't
see that 1080p video especially on
YouTube does playback just fine now
what's cool is is that even though this
is going to be a lower end PC you're
actually getting a GPU that is
theoretically capable of pushing a 4k
display although that's probably not the
greatest idea you know I actually think
that there's a lot that we can do with
this PC but before we do that I want to
give a huge shout out to LastPass for
sponsoring this video
it's almost like it's a perfect sort of
fit when you get a brand-new PC and you
want to have all your passwords and all
your logins in one place funny how that
happened not like we planned it or
anything
I personally been using LastPass for
over five years now at this point and
what you're getting here is something
that's going to allow you to get all of
your passwords all under one secure
umbrella so say for example that you use
the same password and lots of sites
which of course no one would ever do who
watches the channel right
what LastPass allows you to do is create
a completely random generated password
for each and every site that you visit
so even if say one site gets hacked that
doesn't mean that someone can get into
all of your other logins now what's cool
is is that LastPass keeps all this super
secure underneath a master password and
what's nice about that is that there are
multiple ways of getting in to it you
can add two-factor authentication it
actually is a really secure way of doing
things the best part is that you can get
LastPass for free now they do have a $2
month premium plan which is what I've
been on for a while but regardless you
should be using a password manager and I
legitimately use LastPass every single
day you guys might check it out the link
is in the description and huge shoot
shout out to LastPass for sponsoring
this video
no sure how do you a mini PC is fine and
great what's the fun if you don't
actually take advantage of how small it
is everyone knows that a cheap PC is not
going to be the most powerful thing in
the world but this is where things get a
little bit more exciting this is the G
chic on lap 1102 H portable monitor but
there are lots of portable monitors out
there and most of the time they're
pretty decent what makes this a little
bit different is it has its own
dedicated battery built-in so with
pretty much just a single HDMI cable we
can get a fully portable set up see
where I'm going
with this so first of all we have the
actual display itself so we're looking
at an 11.6 inch
working at an 11 point 6 inch 1920 by
1080 panel plenty bright enough and
especially plenty sharp enough to be
able to handle our Gulick mini-pc
so with our g chic monitor up and
running this is our questionably useful
setup so first of all we have the googly
key see now connected to that is our
Samsung t3 SSD which is going to have
all of our Steam games on it it's being
powered by this me power bank we also
have the monitor which normally would be
running on its own power except that it
was not charged so we have it connected
to another battery bank and with all of
this we have only one spare USB port and
I'm trying to get game set up so I'm
having to hot-swap Mouse's and keyboards
and controllers to try to get something
to work because we really plan things
out solidly there are definitely some
cool things about this setup though the
G chic monitor is really nice-looking so
you're getting that full 1080 resolution
and then these are going to be a matte
display but you know in theory when you
remember to charge it it is going to be
a really nice portable setup even have
some things on the backside to be able
to hook up something like a compute
stick so you can have a fully portable
little setup but none of that matters if
I can't play csgo in a park because
that's the whole premise for this video
please please tell me this is actually
going to let me load it so we're into
the menu I cranked all the settings down
and it looks like we're actually loading
it actually should work in theory I've
done a lot of testing with csgo usually
when we have like a really low end
system that's sort of the first game I
go to actually see if it will work and
well I've never done it on an atom ship
that should in theory be able to run
it's gonna be on low settings and not a
great framerate
initializing game data I don't think
I've ever seen csgo take 5 minutes to
load but that's fine who cares how long
it takes to load just matters can we
actually play the game or not
exe is stopped working right before the
load finished oh I feel that right here
so what do we learn we learned that the
goo leak is a pretty decent PC as long
as you don't ever try to play a game on
it so curious what do you guys
think about the $100 gu Lika mini-pc I'm
sure you will have lots of very
insightful comments about this entire
video definitely be sure to let me know
in the comments below and of course
definitely be sure to go check out
LastPass at the link in the description
guys thank you so much for watching I'm
going to go cry myself to sleep over not
being able to play a game right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
