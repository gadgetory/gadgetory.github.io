Hey guys this is Austin. Is a $100 tablet
worth it?
Packing a quad core processor, seven inch
IPS display and full Windows 8.1, the HP Stream
7 looks like a serious competitor coming in
at just under $100. Jump over to the Android
side and you’ve got the Asus MeMo Pad 7.
Internally it’s very similar but it comes
in a sleeker design and is running Android
4.4 Kit Kat. While Android on tablets is nothing
new being able to run full Windows 8.1 on
a $100 tablet is a big deal, not even counting
the included one year Office 365 subscription
which is nearly worth the entire cost of the
tablet on its’ own. What’s most impressive
is just how well everything runs, resolution
and specs aren’t too far off from a lot
of laptops so doing things like browsing the
web is downright snappy. There are quite a
few decent apps in the Windows Store but you
can also download normal programs like Chrome
and VLC. The biggest bottleneck is the single
gigabyte of RAM which while it’s fine for
most Windows 8 apps can be a real problem
when you’re using the normal desktop. Having
the option to use that desktop is a big plus
for me but at the end of the day this is still
a PC with all the pros and cons that come
along with that. The MeMo Pad gives you a
much more traditional tablet experience with
Android Kit Kat. Asus has their Zen UI skin
on it but thankfully it’s not intrusive,
you’re getting a close to stock experience
which is impressively smooth. It slows down
a bit when multitasking but in normal use
the Atom is more than fast enough to keep
up. Android has quickly become a great option
for smaller tablets like this and you’ll
find a wide variety of apps including Netflix,
YouTube and Kindle. While both tablets are
about the same thickness the MeMo Pad feels
much nicer in the hand with a tapered edge.
It reminds me a lot of the Nexus 7 in design
which is a good thing, it’s usable in one
hand without being too heavy or slippery.
It does take a bit to get used to the power
button being below the volume rocker but it’s
not a big deal. On the other hand the Stream
7 can’t quite measure up. It’s not really
much thicker but it’s squared off and quite
a bit heavier making it a bit more awkward
in the hand. Unlike the color options of the
MeMo Pad the Stream is made out of a fairly
cheap feeling black plastic. Turn both tablets
on however and things are much closer. They
both sport seven inch screens with resolutions
of 1280 by 800 which is more than good enough
at this price point. You can use either completely
happily but the display on the Stream is the
real surprise. While there’s some backlight
bleed the colors are vibrant and the viewing
angles are solid. The MeMo Pad might not quite
match up but Asus includes an app called Splendid
to really fine tune the colors on the panel
which is an awesome inclusion. One area where
there’s no competition is in speaker quality.
The Stream has a single speaker which is not
only quiet but very tinny.
On the other hand the MeMo Pad sounds perfectly
fine, miles better than the Stream. While
the display on the Stream is nicer the hardware
of the MeMo Pad really does feel like a step
above anything you would expect to find at
this price point. Inside both tablets are
rocking a quad core Intel Atom paired with
1GB of RAM and in Geekbench they match up
nicely with the Nexus 7 and aren’t too far
behind the HP Stream 13 laptop. In the graphics
department it’s the same story, these are
about as fast as it gets for a seven inch
tablet not even considering price. The Stream
comes with 32GB of storage compared to sixteen
on the MeMo Pad however Windows eats up a
lot of that with only 15GB of free space out
of the box. Both sport MicroSD card slots
to expand the storage however it’s hidden
behind the back cover on the Stream which
is incredibly frustrating to try to pry off.
The biggest area where the budget prices are
noticeable is in the memory. While 1GB of
RAM is fine for Android it’s really doesn’t
quite cut it for Windows. You’ll run into
occasional slowdowns and crashing especially
with desktop applications that really aren’t
meant to run on such little RAM on the Stream.
It’s definitely not a dealbreaker but for
games like Minecraft it becomes a real bottleneck…well
that and the lack of a keyboard or mouse.
The MeMo Pad is easier to work with for gaming
as basically any Android game should work
fine. You don’t quite have the same flexibility
as on the Stream but it’s more than good
enough for some casual gaming. While having
full Windows on a $100 tablet is awesome I
would spend a little bit of extra money to
get the MeMo Pad, it’s just a better tablet
overall. So what do you guys think, would
you ever pick up a $100 tablet? Definitely
be sure to let me know in the comments below!
Anyway guys thank you so much for watching
and I will catch you in the next one.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
