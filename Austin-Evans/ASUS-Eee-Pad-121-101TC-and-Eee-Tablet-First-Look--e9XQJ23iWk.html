announcing three big new products
there's going to be two new tablets the
epad 121 and the epad 101 TC these both
looked to be pretty cool tablets it was
also going to be the asus eee tablet
we're just going to be more like an
e-reader but it's going to really
feature a lot of notes taking capability
we're going to start with probably my
favorite one which is the epad 1 121 I
know this is a 12.1 inch tablet as you
might guess from the name and it really
seems to be pretty solid it has a core
two duo ultra low voltage processor
which that's a pretty big step up from
you know the standard atom processors
and stuff we've been seeing it also has
windows7 a 10 hour battery life and
there's a couple other really cool
things about it for example it has a
webcam which is looking to be a pretty
nice feature on tablets these days it
also does have at least one they weren't
sure but there might be more added but
there will be at least one USB port when
it launches and then you know there's a
couple other cool things about it I mean
it does seem to be running stock windows
7 but to be honest guys they showed off
a basically it was a mock-up it was not
working at all and and that was you have
to be expected because it isn't expected
to be launched until early next year
probably in the first quarter guys it
does look pretty cool on that she should
a really cool thing is a keyboard dock
basically you just take the tablet you
set it on and guys it looks I mean
exactly like a normal laptop you know is
you've got a touchpad you got a keyboard
and you know the tablet part folds down
but then when you want to just pick up
the tablet and off you go so it looks
pretty cool ok guys the next eat tablet
will be taking a look at is the 101 TC
fantastic game I know now this one we
don't know a whole lot about it is going
to be a 10-inch tablet as opposed to the
12 inch of the 121 I mean also is going
to be running Windows Embedded compact 7
um so guys this is a very it's Elmo's a
little bit like Android if you take a
look at it new you actually have
different pages and stuff and but it's a
very very custom UI and it actually
looks quite nice now guys they showed
this one
off this one actually was working but
was not working very well which is to be
expected of a product that won't be
coming out for a long time now but still
this one looks pretty decent um to be
honest with getting a core two duo
windows seven all kind of stuff and the
121 I think that would probably the one
I'm looking forward to but you know what
take a look at them like I said both of
them should be coming out in the first
quarter of 2011 next year and price
ranges they said would be three I 9499
on guys I mean especially the 121 if you
can get that for 499 that would be
really impressive i mean core 2 duo is a
pretty powerful chip for your tablet so
i really think that would be pretty cool
ok guys so now we changed gears a little
bit and go to the e tablet which isn't a
tablet go figure um it is basically it's
like a touchscreen ereader it's pretty
cool basically what it's about is that
it's about it has an 8 inch screen and
so it's obviously going to be a lot
bigger than you know a normal kindle or
something but basically it's going to go
ahead and have a future features such as
a camera and stuff but you know you go
ahead and read your books the main thing
they want you to do with it though is
actually to write notes and apparently
I've spent a lot of time on the specs
arts got an 8 inch TFT LCD display which
of course is not being now it's got a
note-taking stylus to go ahead and you
know take notes supposed to be really
accurate a microSD slot it's got also
got a 2 megapixel camera and a 10 hour
battery life so guys it's not like I
said it's not going to be you know like
an he ain't display where last year
forever almost but you know you're going
to have a screen that refreshes very
very fast you know eeing has a problem
where you know you you know you go to
like the next page and takes a second or
whatever well they said this will take
less than a tenth of a second so you
know it's pretty good I know this one
why you should be coming out in
September and the price range of course
to have figured out yet I said the price
range will be between I 199 and 299
dollars so guys that that's pretty good
especially if they could get closer
towards that 199 spot spot that would be
really cool as you get a camera you can
go ahead and look p pretty accurate as
far as taking notes which would be kind
of nice
and that eight inch screen is doesn't
going to be pretty cool okay guys that's
everything ASIS um you know we've got
the e tablet which is of course an
e-reader which it looks pretty good
especially they get it for cheap and
then we've got the two tablets which of
course won't be coming out for a while
but the 101 looks pretty cool um and
that social hundred percent sure about
it it looks pretty good but the 121
looks was kind of my favorite I mean if
we get it for 4 99 with a core two duo
running full windows seven especially if
they yeah the keyboard dock is not
expensive that would be a really cool
thing I mean that would be if you got
the keyboard dock for even even it's
like 100 hundred fifty dollars that
would still be cheaper than buying a
normal you know Windows 7 computer and
of course it's a tablet to you can just
disconnected so I think that'd be pretty
cool I'm new Agatha Japan to keep an eye
out for this but it looks pretty
promising</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
