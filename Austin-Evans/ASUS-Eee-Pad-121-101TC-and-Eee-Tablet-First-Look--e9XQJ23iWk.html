announcing three big new products
there's going to be two new tablets the
e pad 121 and the e pad 101 TC these
both look to be pretty cool tablets it
was also going to be the Asus Eee tablet
we're just going to be more of like an
e-reader but it's going to have really
feature a lot of note-taking capability
we're gonna start with probably my
favorite one which is the e pad 1 121
under this is a 12.1 inch tablet as you
might have guessed from the name and it
really seems to be pretty solid it has a
core 2 duo ultra-low voltage processor
which that's a pretty big step up from
you know the standard ad and processors
and stuff we've been seeing it also has
Windows 7 a 10 hour battery life and
there's a couple other really cool
things about it for example it has a
webcam which is looking to be a pretty
nice test feature on tablets these days
it also does have at least one they
weren't sure but there might be more at
it but there'll be at least one USB port
when it launches and then you know
there's a couple other cool things about
it I mean it does seem to be running
stock Windows 7 but to be honest guys
they showed off a basically it was a
mock-up it was not working at all and
and that was you have to be expected
because it isn't expected to be launched
until early next year probably in the
first quarter
guys it does look pretty cool on that
should a really cool thing is a keyboard
dock basically you just take the tablet
and you set it on and guys it looks I
mean
exactly like a normal laptop you know
you've got a touchpad you got a keyboard
and you know the tablet part folds down
but then when you want to you just pick
up the tablet and off you go so it looks
pretty cool ok guys the next a tablet
we'll be taking a look at is the 101 TC
fantastic name I know now this one we
don't know a whole lot about it is going
to be a 10-inch tablet as opposed to the
12 inch of the 121 I mean also is going
to be running Windows Embedded compact 7
so guys this is a very its elements a
little bit like Android if you take a
look at it new you actually have
different pages and stuff and but it's a
very very custom UI and it actually
looks quite nice now guys they showed
this one
this one actually was working but was
not working very well which is to be
expected of a product won't be coming
out for a long time now but still this
one looks pretty decent to be honest
with getting a Core 2 Duo Windows 7 all
kind of stuff and the 121 I think that
would probably the one I'm looking
forward to but you know what to take a
look at them like I said both of them
should be coming out in the first
quarter of 2011 next year and price
ranges they said would be 399 $4.99 Oh
guys I mean especially the 121 you can
get that for $4.99 that would be really
impressive I mean Core 2 Duo is a pretty
powerful chip for tablets so I really
think that would be pretty cool ok guys
so now we changed gears a little bit and
go to the e tablet which isn't a tablet
go figure it is basically it's like a
touchscreen ereader it's pretty cool
basically what it's about is that it's
about it has an 8 inch screen and so
it's obviously going to be a lot bigger
than you know a normal Kindle or
something but basically it's going to go
ahead and have a huge feature such as a
camera and stuff but you know you go
ahead and read your books
the main thing they want you to do with
it though is actually to write notes and
apparently I've spent a lot of time on
the specs arcs got an 8 inch TFT LCD
display which of course does not be Inc
now it's got a note-taking stylus to go
ahead and you know take notes supposed
to be really accurate a micro SD slot
it's got also got a 2 megapixel camera
and a ten-hour battery life so guys it's
not like I said it's not going to be you
know like an he ain't display where it
lasts you know forever almost but you
know you're gonna have a screen that
refreshes very very fast
you know eing has a problem where you
know you you know you go to like the
next page and it takes a second or
whatever well they said this will take
less than a tenth of a second so you
know it's pretty good I know this one
why should be coming out in September
and the price range is of course to have
figured out yet I said the price range
will be between not 199 and 299 dollars
so guys that that's pretty good
especially if they could get closer
towards that $1.99 barter spot that
would be really cool because you get a
camera you can go ahead and look P
pretty accurate as far as taking notes
which would be kind of nice
and that eight inch screens doesn't
gonna be pretty cool okay guys that's
everything ASIS you know we've got the e
tablet which is of course an e-reader
which it looks pretty good especially I
get it for cheap and then we've got the
two tablets which of course won't be
coming out for a while but the 101 looks
pretty cool um and that social hundred
percent sure about it it looks pretty
good but the 121 look was kind of my
favorite I mean if we get it for $4.99
with a Core 2 Duo
running full Windows 7 especially you
know they yeah if the keyboard dock
isn't that expensive that would be a
really cool thing I mean that would be
if you got the keyboard dock for even
even it's like 100 150 dollars that
would still be cheaper than buying and
normal you know Windows 7 computer and
then of course it's a tablet too you can
just disconnected so I think that'd be
pretty cool I'm knew you guys would have
to keep an eye out for this but it looks
pretty promising</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
