going to be doing the first in a series
of videos on windows 7 and I've just had
it for roughly a week and a half or so I
have to release candidate I've been
using it a lot I've really been liking
it really like I want to see much much
better than vista so i'm making this
video i'm going to start doing videos of
the different features today i'm going
to be showing the taskbar and it's lots
and lots of improvements so yeah let's
get this one started
okay guys so let's get this one started
now this video looks as going to be
about the taskbar the taskbar in Windows
7 is undergone its biggest change
probably since windows 95 came out um
it's lost the you no longer see like a
little a little favicon and then you see
the text like Google Chrome or whatever
now it's icons similar to the mac doc
but it definitely it's not a total
ripoff it's it's it's it's somewhere in
the middle and I actually I really like
it so basically what it is is that you
see the only program I have running is
camstudio so you see it's kind of lit up
now you can add as many icons as you
want down here actually I just go ahead
and show you guys let's do solitaire so
let's just go ahead and all you have to
do is find a program anything you want
and hit right right click it and hit pin
to taskbar so you just there you go now
you see that's there now if I want to
open it simply click it give it a moment
to load and there we go and now it's
real simple I want just kill it off and
I always have that link there and if I
have one run a program that I don't have
links to down here it's just a simple
order pad let's do that so now you see
the little icon will appear you know you
can type whatever you want and then you
can just close it down and that's that
so there's a lot of different things now
go ahead and show you guys say open up
let's open up a couple windows paint and
I will note that a lot of the programs
you saw a word pad minute ago all these
programs really have been improved a lot
like you can do cool things and paints
now no not totally useless anyway so
let's just add a couple things to show
you guys that's not that so then let's
minimize it now if I won't say if you
want to open a window for like down here
now obviously if I click it right now
you know I just hoping that but if I
want to open a new paint I do is just
right click it and hit paint so now I
have two windows of paint open ok so I'm
going to minimize them both now the cool
thing is if you can look down here you
see I don't know if Washington High
Definition you might be
see there's the two little uh there's
two little lines there so if i hover
over that means that two windows up so
so you hover over it and then basically
i can hover over this one and make this
one up here that want to pick it's a
very cool feature and also if i want i
can kill off a window now this the only
paint what do I have left click it and
it's up very very cool stuff close that
down now um there's a lot of things but
i'm really liking the taskbar um i'll
show you guys more than just a second
but it really seems to work very well
I'm you can add lots I've just been
using Windows 7 for a short while I
haven't actually got most of my programs
although will note I haven't had any
problems any program f'd want to run
they run train on vistas run fine on
windows 7 I haven't had I've have the
microphone I've hooked up I have my USB
mouse which I was surprised I was doing
that USB mouse before the window 7 was
even install which I was impressed me a
lot my printer iPods everything is work
totally fine I'm really impressed anyway
so i will say that there's a lot more
potential the taskbar it's good as it is
but there's a lot more potential i
definitely think if you look at some
windows apps such as like internet
explorer um it definitely has an
advantage um whereas if I plus I open up
Chrome or any other like normal web
browser I opened up it's just going to
be show my windows it doesn't show
individual tabs so you know that's okay
i mean if you had generally you just
have one window when you use them as
tabs whereas when does explorer internet
explorer right and explore actually
shows your individual tabs and as like
like you saw those paint windows so you
would see like six or seven tabs or how
many ever times you have in the windows
you can open them up likewise like you
can go to your bookmarks and instantly
do it that's not enough really from
eight has changed in an explorer um but
i really hope that just really makes got
me thinking you could do a lot like like
hover over this like once 107 gates
going hover over this chrome and maybe
like a little min you can pop up and
show my bookmarks or all kinds of things
like that now I personally have no idea
if there I can actually do that or
anything like that but seeing that
windows internet explorer has stuff
similar I mean you know anyway so let's
just go ahead and move over to the right
side so first actually let me show you
the farthing the show desktop option if
you have vista it's going to be kind of
similar but it's got a little bit of an
update so let's just open up a ton of
windows here just kind of move them
around just open up like i say 3 and
then you should move them all in
different places so like right there now
obviously you know you when you're on
the computer you use lots of windows so
if you want hover over the show desktop
and they all turn nicely transparent
definitely a pretty cool feature you
know to be honest I don't really use it
that much but it's nice to have and you
don't have to click anything you just
have to hover over it no problem so it's
just quite kill all these windows okay
so let's get over to here okay so you
know you see all you see the icons
showing like your battery life and your
Wi-Fi signal and your battery and all
that kind of stuff but 107 has done a
good job of minimizing it there used to
be a little button while you do it now
pop out now instead there's a little
button and I pop up in a little pop-up
box you can see I have like my antivirus
and everything like that and the good
thing is you can customize this I
haven't messed with the settings it
works fine like this I think but what
you do is you can customize all your
settings to make them appear in here or
not the action centers here which is
really great um window seven actually
really is good at troubleshooting if you
do have a problem it will it will
download drivers it will do it's
actually really an operating system
actually seems like it wants to help
it's not there to get the way it's
actually there there's a problem it
actually will really try to help them
fix it it's kinda seems weird especially
if you use vista but it's really i'm
really impressed so you see I have like
my battery my Wi-Fi while I'm talking
wife I will just say real quick you can
finally do everything if I click this I
won't because obviously I'm connect
right now but if you click this
you can connect Wi-Fi hotspots and
everything instead I haven't go through
separate menu that always drove me crazy
in vista and then you have the speakers
and yeah so guys let's just bet it i
justjust video on the taskbar primate a
little too long but i'm really impressed
windows 7 i'm liking it i don't think
i'm going to go back to vista or XP or
anything on any computer i'm definitely
going to want to upgrade to windows
seven eighths it's just a great
operating system runs great on slower
and older computers um yeah so anyway
guys that's just about it thanks for
