with an unboxing of the motorola atrix
HD for AT&amp;amp;T for only one hundred dollars
on contract the atrix has a lot going
for it so let's take a look pop open the
box and inside you'll find the phone
setting it aside for a second as always
you'll find your accessories in the
bottom of the box here you'll find a
micro USB cable for charging and syncing
and the power adapter moving on you'll
also see a quick start guide warranty
info and a few QR codes you can scan to
download featured apps now to the fun
part the phone itself I've got the black
model here but it also does come in
white taking a look at the back you'll
see it's similar to the droid razr with
a hump for the camera and cattle are
backing up front you'll see the 1.3
megapixel front facing camera and your
earpiece at the top of the phone is your
3.5 millimeter headphone jack along with
micro USB and micro HDMI even though
this is an atrix phone it doesn't come
with the webtop application built in but
you still will be able to mirror your
screen with the hdmi out along the right
side of the phone you'll see the power
button along with the volume buttons
which are a bit narrow but we're fine
over on the right side you'll see a flap
which is where the micro-sim and microSD
hide if you're keeping track that's
right micro USB micro HDMI micro-sim and
microSD seems legit around back you'll
see the 8 megapixel camera along with
the LED flash and speaker grill up front
is the 4.5 inch called boost HD display
with a resolution of 1280 by 720 on
board of the phone you'll find a lightly
skinned version of android 4.0 ice cream
sandwich with the on-screen virtual keys
that's about it for my unboxing of the
motorola atrix HD if you enjoyed this
