here with a review of the AOC i-25 3 pH
monitor excellent name aside let's take
a look at why I think this is such a
great display immediately out of the box
you'll see that the design will look
right at home on almost anyone's desk
the 23 inch display is surrounded by a
fairly thin bezel it measures just nine
point two millimeters thick thanks to
this it has an integrated base which is
where you'll find your monitor controls
as well as a pair of HDMI ports VGA a
3.5 millimeter audio jack and the power
connector for most people this will be
just fine but there isn't a huge range
of adjustability and mounting it to a
wall is going to be difficult taking a
look at the panel itself it's an IPS
display with a resolution of 1920 by
1080 thanks to the LED backlighting and
each IPS technology you can expect great
viewing angles with only a bit of
dimness when looking at it from more
extreme angles one of the typical
drawbacks of using an IPS display or the
lower refresh rates while gaming put
simply this means that a slight amount
of lag can be noticeable compared to a
more traditional monitor while I'm
definitely not a professional gamer I
found absolutely no problems and the
quoted 5 millisecond response time
equates to practically nothing for the
vast majority of gamers one of the major
benefits of IPs is better color
reproduction well this definitely isn't
going to rival monitors costing five
times the price I found the overall
color and contrast to be more than good
enough for general usage just like it's
not suited for the most hardcore of
gamers this probably isn't for you if
you're working in Photoshop all day but
for 95% of us it's more than good enough
the OSD for the monitor isn't half bad
the touch controls had zero feedback on
the base but that's not too much of a
surprise and the menus are responsive
and give you access to all the settings
you need you'll also find a pair of 2
watt speakers built-in they're nothing
to get too excited about though because
they don't have much volume overall for
$180 on amazon.com I can gladly
recommend the AOC I to 5:3 pH if only
they could rename it to the AOC Super
monitor of doom or something regardless
if you're looking for a great display
for your new gaming build this is
definitely one you should keep in mind
