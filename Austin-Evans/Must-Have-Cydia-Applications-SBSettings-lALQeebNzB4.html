today I'm here with another video in my
series of must-haves city applications
first thing is you probably notice I've
got this for a nice background of my
back yard I think it looks nice but uh
probably want to do this very often I
just figured might as well but yeah I'm
going to continue my series of videos on
must have city applications with one of
one of my top ones
it's called SB settings now before we go
I just real quick do say I'm not gonna
go ahead and I'm gonna cut out the city
apart I'm pretty sure you guys can
figure out how to punch in as besetting
sin Cydia I'll have all the links that
way no problem
anyway so let's just go ahead and get
straight under this okay so SB settings
is a really cool Settings app um kind of
explain you just show you so you go to
the top you just take basically you take
it and you slide your finger across and
whatever that's that's not clonally but
as you can see here there's a lot of
different just settings I mean as you
see here but my Wi-Fi IP address which
my Wi-Fi is off on the data obviously
I've got an iTouch and it says available
memory and things like that but
basically what SP settings is is it is
basically an app that will let you tweak
all kinds of settings as you can see
here in my brightness it's one slight
glitch I'm not sure it really just
hasn't been going away I open it a few
days going it's been stuck up there but
not really sure but normally what you
can see is behind it you see Bluetooth I
toggle we've turned on and off your
Bluetooth the brightness obviously or
you can see it gets me your what's great
you can do processes I really should get
so you got that not sure what's wrong
with it
yeah III guess acoustically so ever but
you can see that processes where you can
cut off various applications like mail
and Safari as well it's free up memory
which is a nice touch I have a add-on to
do the push mail notifications but
that's that's a different story
Wi-Fi you can set that off right now and
SS 18 now I'll go down to the bottom
I'll do it from right to left you can
see on right here
is the power if I hit that it'll just
you know shut it off here you can reach
spring nicely you have an option to dock
I can show you that later you can
refresh and then you just hit more I'm
go ahead and go into more give it a
second now you can see this now this is
very cool um the first thing I'll just
go ahead just run to you guys the whole
thing these are your just basic themes
for SP settings which was that the thing
I just went down you know you just pick
whichever one you want
um then here you go to set toggles and
these are the toggles that you can see
there on like 3G obviously I have that
off I touch now Bluetooth brightness
edge we have fast notes you try on your
location or the toggle for your location
in the phone processes you push me out
like I said I I have added that but SSH
and Wi-Fi so that's that's a nice saying
and you can move them and you know I
doesn't recommend customize that you can
do your dark applications in height now
I will go ahead it takes a moment to
load but basically what this is is you
basically hide applications um sometimes
you don't necessarily need to but you
know you can't you want so I won't show
you guys now because it does take a
little while to load and you have to go
to it everything but basically you can
just turn off any of them and on a quick
side note if you installed the last
application that I had spot bright
search you can still see these so let's
say my stop I don't want anybody to
Steve my stalks I should I click flip it
off and then whenever I want I can go
ahead and although it won't show I can
go into SB settings and do it manually
or I could go over to spot bright search
and just a pull up so no one can ever
see my stocks anyway so now right down
here you can see a thing for your mobile
substrate add-ons this can be helpful in
sometimes doesn't matter basically it
just lets you turn off the different
add-ons that you've done it's you're
experiencing glitches and and stuff like
that this can count handy
I mean you won't you won't probably want
to turn on any of these off just because
I mean unless you're having a problem I
mean go down to extras now this is nice
now there's a lot of different things
like numeron battery if you can see I up
here probably won't be able to maybe if
you're watching in high-definition
see it's joke I've got 40% of battery
life left and I want to turn that on an
optic is it something goes from my Wi-Fi
you can say you got a signal wherever
GSM you can also have your status bar
date your free memory which I do because
that's very handy you know then
different things like the Apple kill
switch if you don't have something
that's killing that you definitely want
to go ahead and shut that off and
different things like that
you know I don't want to give up quite a
drug drug this out for too long I just
want to show you guys this SB settings
one of my favorite city applications
definitely very very handy all kinds of
stuff that you can really use
customizing it I highly recommend it
again I will have links to everything
you will need in the sidebar
just you know hit SP settings in Cydia I
mean you guys should be able to handle
that anyway okay that's just about it
thanks for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
