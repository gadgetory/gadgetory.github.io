using 4G 5g networks are just starting
to roll out and with that we should be
able to see propper gigabit class speeds
but if you own a flagship in the last
couple years you might have noticed
something strange
a 5ge logo so have you been using a 5g
phone this entire time without realizing
it
ya know like 4G before it 5g is not as
straightforward as it might seem
there are several competing 5g standards
being built out right now for example
here in LA you can sign up for Verizon's
5g home service this is using an early
version of 5g which according to Verizon
is good for up to 20 times the speed of
LTE and in the real world delivers about
300 megabits per second down although
theoretically it can go up to 900 and 40
megabits completely wirelessly that's
actually pretty good and it shows how 5g
can be used Delhi of course for your
phone and for your laptop and tablet but
also it can be used to completely
replace a standard home internet line so
putting aside for a second this isn't
true 5g just yet there is a ton of
potential here the final 5g spec calls
for a theoretical maximum of 20 gigabits
per second although realistically it's
going to be much closer to one gigabit
but that is still a huge huge bump over
what we have today
that brings us to five ge now this is
short for 5g evolution and it is what 18
T is calling 5g although spoiler alert
it's not 5g so to give you a better idea
of what 5g is we have a little bit of an
example so this is Pikachu and for this
reference will call them 5g as you can
see he's very cheery he's very happy all
good right well this is me me Q now on
the surface it looks very similar to
Pikachu except these really LTE with
some weird like drawings on his face
clearly not the same thing are you
following maybe I should explain this a
little bit better so if you take a look
at the AT&amp;amp;T site they describe 5ge
as quote the first step on the road to
5g so it does support some additional
technologies that come with LTE advanced
such as 4x4 as well as some better
streaming and better compression but
generally speaking this is not 5g even
though they're slapping that 5g badge
all over it
if this all sounds familiar then you
right back when 18t was transitioning
from 3G to 4G they sent an update to
their phones to change the badge to say
for GE when it is actually still on 3G
yeah they're they're doing that one
again so based on all of this it seems
pretty clear to me that v GE is not
going to deliver a true next-gen
experience but to be fair I think it's
time to put it to the test so let's see
if we can actually track down a fight GE
phone and see how it actually performs I
was wondering do you guys have any view
that the 5g phones done yet I know I saw
they're like a couple of ads about it
the ones that are compatible Reena would
be the iPhone 10s and 10's max I was
reading something that the LG phones had
it as well
pretty sure like the v40 that's what I
had read as well the v40 had it gotcha
could basic I want to get a phone for my
dad and he's like he upgrades his phones
very rarely so I'll make sure he has
something v GE so you know he won't have
to upgrade again a couple years once
it's really common yeah I think um you
know what I'm gonna ask our LG rep to be
awesome thank you that was fun
so did not get a phone but we got some
interesting information they did confirm
that it does support 5g so I think the
main phone looking for is the v40
everything that I've read up until now
seems to show that that actually is one
of the phones that does show the 5g
badge
unfortunately this store didn't get many
V 40s and they shipped them all back
because they didn't sell them oh thank
you appreciate it hey I had a question
so I'm looking for a phone for my dad
and I know you guys are rolling out 5g
soon right which phones are flights you
capable is gonna be the first
which phones that we have or 5tq okay
that'd be great yeah yeah so it is 5ge
so it's not okay 5g so there's no phone
out that's true 5g yeah okay um so the
v40 does support the 5ge
also the SI the s9 is do support 5ge but
it's not when you consider true 5g
what's the difference it's faster than
4G it's in between what 5g is gonna be
so it there's no actual device of actual
5g okay gotcha it's 5ge capable which is
what they're releasing now which are all
the samsung s nines okay the LG b 40
okay that's it okay do you have any of
the equity you have the V 40s so we have
an LG v 40 that supports full 5 GE at
least I hope it does now I have to put a
sim card in here and hope that uh 5g
shows up and I can actually test to see
if it's any good or whether I just spent
nine hundred and fifty dollars on the
phone that uh won't work so it is time
to put 18 T's 5g network to the test
so the first bottleneck is that we
actually might not have 5 GE service
here at the office I'm hopeful that we
will but they don't know exactly have a
whole lot of information about it so I'm
gonna put a sim card in with actual data
all right so it shows we're on ATT on
LTE which is the correct thing because
we should be on LTE but I want to see if
this actually will show us five GE this
v40 does have an update released on
January 4th Oh excellent here we go
what's new 5g evolution indicators
support added okay so there is an update
for the phone that specifically changes
the indicator to 5g evolution now the
question is why doesn't want to download
so we got the phone up to date but
fortunately it still shows 4G LTE now
this should theoretically show 5g the
main issue is that there's not 5g
service here at the office so the next
step is to track down 5g so we actually
can test to see even though it's
probably going to be the same this isn't
going to be a definitive test but all I
want to know is this does 5ge make any
difference whatsoever so after taking a
closer look at the five GE coverage
areas one of the major spots that they
do have
is Los Angeles so we're here in
Hollywood to see exactly whether or not
this is going to work 0:05 GE we got it
I actually legitimately did not think
that was gonna work so it's really
interesting is if you look at the actual
network page what you'll see is even
though it says five GE it still says LTE
here because that's what it really is I
guess the first test is just to see how
fast it is so four point six down and
sixteen up hardly a gigabit like they
had promised now on the other side I
have the iPhone 10 R and this is a phone
which actually is listed on AT&amp;amp;T site as
5g compatible but if you take a look I
have four bars of LTE not 5g it's the
same thing well let's see if there's
actually any difference oh are you
trying to tell me that by G is slower to
be clear these phones are both on AT&amp;amp;T
there's no difference in any way except
that this one is like ten times faster
on the download twenty-nine thirty one
thirty five are these settings the same
are we gonna try like another site or
something so because that seems very
suspicious I'm going to try the standard
Google speed test and see what we get
all right where we got oh there we go
okay that makes a lot more sense we're
seeing way faster speeds on 5ge
which makes sense if you think about it
the 10r has a two by two LTE antenna
versus the four by four antenna on the
v40 okay let's do one more time ready
set
there we go yeah it's consistently
pulling ahead this time actually buy a
lot more so the iPhone still does have a
little bit of an advantage on the upload
but I mean the download is a big
difference 5g is delivering almost
double the speed now whether or not
that's worthy of the 5g badge not so
sure I mean realistically the goal for
5g proper 5g is over ten times the speed
so the fact this a little bit faster
than LTE it makes sense
so what did we learn
5ge is just another name for
lte-advanced and while it is faster you
shouldn't go drop everything to buy a 5
g e enabled phone Tru Phi G is right
around the corner</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
