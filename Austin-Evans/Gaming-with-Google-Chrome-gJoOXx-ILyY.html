with the video going over gaming in
Google Chrome now of course you've been
able to do flash gaming and browsers
roughly since the dawn of time however
Google Chrome has been really stepping
up lately of course it does support
flash it also supports html5 you can
download and install games as extensions
and on top of that it will soon support
USB accessories such as game pads if
you're like me when you hear the word
browser gaming the first thing you think
of is some Facebook game like Farmville
but as you guys will find out here in a
second there's actually a lot more to it
than that the first game is Chrome if
you're a longtime iOS user you'll
recognize this from the first batch is
full 3d games in the App Store poured it
over to Chrome this plays just like on
the iPhone and iPod Touch it's a simple
side scroller they get straight
repetitive after a while but as far as
the graphics go it looks quite
impressive for something in your browser
this is a game that requires an
installation but just like any Chrome
extension it can be removed easily
another fun game is realm of the mad guy
this is an 8-bit style in memo which
means me strongly want to hack a Wi-Fi
card onto my Super Nintendo it's quite
simple you join a server and a handle
straightforward quests such as killing
enemies this is based in flash and it's
one of the more fun browser games I've
played in quite a while so go give it a
shot taking a bit of a 180
we have Crysis 2 yep learn me Crysis 2
inside a browser the way you do this is
through a site called Gaikai which is
similar to online for your browser as
with all streaming services this is
going to rely mostly on your internet
connection but even with DSL I found the
game to run smoothly but the odds dead
are here in there playing games through
die titus free however it's more of a
trial than anything still this can be
awesome if you want to pull your ancient
laptop out and show your friends it can
run Crysis 2 while I won't be
uninstalling steamie anytime soon I do
have to say I was really impressed with
a lot of games I tried using Google
Chrome anyway guys if you enjoyed this
video definitely sure to leave it a
thumbs up and if you want to see more
