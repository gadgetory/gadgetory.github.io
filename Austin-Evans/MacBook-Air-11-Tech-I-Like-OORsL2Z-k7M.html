here with Tec I like on the MacBook Air
11 inch now know a lot of you guys are
friends of Windows however there are a
few reasons why I think the MacBook Air
is one of the best laptops out there one
of the main reasons I like the air is
because of the size this thing is super
portable especially if you get the 11
inch version which is what I have so I
do a lot of traveling for events and
stuff and this thing is absolutely
perfect so it's small enough that it can
fit in a bag I can walk around with it
all the time and yeah it's nice and
lightweight but it still has the power
that I need to actually get work done
speaking of for something that's not
much bigger than a tablet the air is
rocking some pretty decent specs so my
model is outfitted with an ivy Ridge
core i5 processor 8 gigabytes of RAM
along with a 128 gigabyte SSD one of the
main reasons I bought the MacBook Air is
to do video editing on the go now while
it is a bit underpowered for this kind
of thing especially when it comes to
exporting times with giant 1080p videos
for the most part it does just fine even
with a high end editor such as final cut
or premiere one thing I really like
about the air is the build quality and
feel now you can say whatever you want
about Apple but one thing they always
get down is the design this thing is a
very premium product and one thing I
really appreciate is they pay a lot of
attention to the little details so for
example the trackpad is fantastic the
entire thing is made out of aluminum
which feels very nice and sturdy and
pretty much the entire laptop just feels
nice and premium there's no plastic
there's no stickers all over the place
there's no creaking now the stuff that
you usually have to deal with with
Windows laptops of course it's not
perfect the 11 inch model typically has
pretty good battery life around 4 to 5
hours on a charge however as soon as you
start doing any kind of heavy lifting
such as gaming or video editing
it goes down to more like an hour and a
half to two hours the 11 inch screen
isn't bad however it does have a fairly
low resolution of 1366 by 768 now if you
put this side-by-side with an iPad or
even a retina MacBook Pro this starts
looking pretty rough pretty quick so
hopefully the rumors are true and that
we will see some retina MacBook Airs
before the end of the year the air is
running Mac OS 10.8 mountain lion now
I'm not going to get into a review of OS
10 in this video however if you've ever
tried a Mac you're going to pretty much
know what to expect with the air oh it's
tuned is very polished operating system
and there's lots of nice little features
that make it very good for general
if OS 10 isn't your thing you also have
the option of installing Windows via
boot camp now this might seem a little
bit of a weird thing to do to a Mac
however with the MacBook Air I think
it's a totally valid choice the hardware
alone is so solid and in fact it's a lot
better than most other Windows
ultrabooks out there that's actually not
a bad idea to take on that book error
and run Windows on it but I'm interested
to know what do you guys think about the
air what do you like and what would you
change for the next generation
definitely be sure to let me know in the
comments below if you're interested more
