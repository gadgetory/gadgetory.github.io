tutorial showing you how you can
downgrade the firmer on your iPhone 4s
or your iPad 2 so whether you
accidentally update it you got a new
device that came with new firmware or
for whatever reason you had to restore
this is a simple tutorial to get you
back from 5.1 or 5.1.1 down to iOS 5.0
point 1 where of course you can get the
untethered jailbreak it's very easy to
generate your firmware
however you do need one very important
thing your iOS 5.0 point 1 sh-sh blobs
now you may already have this if you
were jailbroken previously on 5.0 point
1 Cydia ought to have saved it for you
or if you previously plugged your iPhone
4s right back to into something like
tiny umbrella and saved it that way as
long as you have your 5.0 point 1 sh-sh
blobs it's gonna be very simple you
might need a couple of firmwares to
downgrade so first of all you're going
to need the 5.0 point 1 IPSW for your
device and it also won't need 5.1.1 so
you may already have these on your
computer in that case I'll have a link
in the description if you have it you
can just simply move it out to your
desktop and gonna be good to go however
if you need to download anything that
also will be a link where you can
download whichever firmware you need
I'll be on that all we're going to need
to do is go ahead and download the
latest build of red snow also of course
I will have a link to that as well in
the description at this point we're
going to put our device into DFU mode
now before you do this make 110% sure
that you have your data backed up as we
will be restoring and going back so if
you have an iCloud backup make sure that
it is fully up to date if you backup
your data through iTunes be sure that
you have recently done it or just go
ahead and do it right now uh beyond that
of course go ahead and plug your device
in via USB to your Mac or PC and let's
go ahead and begin so to put your device
into DFU mode all you need to do is go
ahead and hold the power button for just
a couple seconds until you get any slide
to car off so there we go
go ahead slide to power it off once your
device is off go ahead and hold the
power button for three seconds so one
two three and hold the power and home
for 10 seconds so eight seven six five
four three two one release the power
button and continue holding the home
button for about 15 seconds or so once
you successfully enter DFU mode you
should see on redstone should say iPhone
4s or iPad 2 and should say DFU mode
yeah any problems feel free to go ahead
and just hold the home and power button
for a second it
turn back on you can do the exact same
thing again now come over to extras even
more and then restore now we need to
select our IP SW so hit on the button
here and select your iOS 5.0.1
IPSW now it'll ask you for another one
and at this point grab our your 5.1.1
IPSW and hopefully the inter-pass
confusing as it is for you as it is for
me that made no sense we're gonna
continue on so now it's gonna give us a
little information about our baseband if
you have an unlock and you don't want to
update your baseband definitely go ahead
and not do this tutorial but if you're
not interested in unlocking your iPhone
for us feel free to continue now you're
going to have two options for selecting
your sh-sh blobs so the first is local
so if you use something like tiny
umbrella and you have them on your
computer go ahead and hit local and
select the blobs themselves otherwise if
you have it backed up through Cydia
which I bet is probably the case for 99%
of people click on remote don't give it
a few minutes to fetch the plugs from
the server after a moment your device
should come back to life you will see
something like this and if you come over
to read snow you're going to see all
kinds different things running across
the screen but you really don't have to
worry about it just give it a little bit
of time and it will restore 25.1 and
then it will go back to 5.0 point 1 so
this may take a little while but just be
patient now we'll be back as soon as
it's all done so at this point your
device should be fully restored so all I
need to do is go ahead and set the
language all the kind of normal stuff
that you do and of course be sure to
restore it from your backups of course
whether it's iCloud or via iTunes just
be sure to get all your data back on to
your iPhone now that you're on iOS 5.2.1
you can now jailbreak using absinthe so
if you needed tutorial feel free to hit
up but the link on screen right now and
I'll also have it in the description and
you can get yourself fully jailbroken on
iOS 5.0.1 if you enjoyed this video
