another state and jailbreak video so
today I'm going to be talking about the
upcoming iOS 4.1 update now I definitely
like to keep you guys up to date with
this kind of stuff and this is
definitely an that thing that you should
avoid so I'm sure as most of you guys
know by now that are already is a 4.1
jailbreak for most devices called Lyme
rain I've already done a tutorial on it
you can go check my channel if you want
the details however before you go ahead
and do that or whatever I'm definitely
do keep in mind that Apple is about to
patch it using four point one point one
now what I think I patch it is it's kind
of a little bit calm paid as lime rain
is a very unique jailbreak now the
jailbreak itself is not catchable the
only way to patch it is you know if
Apple decides to start putting out new
hardware so if you already have an
iphone or an ipod touch or an ipad today
then it's not going to be patched so you
don't have to worry however what you do
have to worry about is the tethered
status of the jailbreak currently the
lime rain it uses a secondary exploit
found by comex which i'm sure a lot of
you guys know who comex is with it makes
it untethered however Apple can't easily
patch that and make lime rain and indeed
green poison as well tethered on this is
definitely not something you're you
should you know you should be looking
for as a tethered jailbreak means that
you need to plug it into the computer
and rerun the geo broke program every
time that you need to go ahead and boot
your device while it's not Adam that
huge deal is definitely very annoying
and there's really no reason to deal
with it if you don't have to so that's
why I highly recommend to stay on 4.1
ignore the itunes update which will come
up here in a few days telling you to
update just you know just don't do it
you're going to be just fine as is now
it should have a couple of bug fixes one
thing I've heard of is that it should
fix that a long clogged bug and that was
causing problems with daylight savings
time however I don't think that's really
worth it to fix it compared to going
ahead and losing your tether your
untethered jailbreak rather so guys what
I highly highly recommend and you
to do this immediately because as soon
as four point one point one comes out
you will lose the opportunity go ahead
I'll have an annotation on the screen
right now check it out it is a video
showing you how to backup your SHSH
blobs using tinyumbrella now basically
when this program will allow you to do
is always save your opportunity to
downgrade to 4.1 so you know you don't
if you guys don't upgrade or you need to
restore or whatever you will be able to
do it no problem alright guys this is
very important as if you don't even you
will be stuck on whatever new firmware
and that's definitely not a good thing
so guys go ahead and check out the
tutorial it was made for an early
version of the firmware however all the
basics do apply so no worries just go
ahead ask apple for your SHSH blobs save
it you'll be all good so even though
guys that's it just want to keep you
guys up to date and informed about the
upcoming update you just it's not a huge
deal i mean if you do accidentally
update or whatever you still can do it
as a tethered jailbreak however there's
no real reason to when you can still
enjoy a nice untethered jailbreak anyway
guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
