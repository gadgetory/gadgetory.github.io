here with some ps4 gameplay to kick
things off we've got a Killzone
Shadowfall
which is the base cluesive ps4 launch
title as the 4th game in the Killzone
franchise it drops you in 30 years after
the events of Killzone 3 to stop the
Civil War the story definitely leaves
quite a bit to be desired
however the graphics are nothing short
of fantastic maps are enormous with lots
going on and everything from awesome
looking vistas to scores of enemies that
keep coming and coming until you finally
disable the alarms while the graphics
are fantastic
and not too far off from PC Titans like
Crysis 3 the campaign isn't exactly
amazing there's plenty to get used to as
you have a companion called an owl which
you control with the touchpad on the
DualShock 4 it can help attack defend
stun enemies or most importantly help
you get around the world as a quick
zipline the problem is the combat mostly
boils down to shooting your way through
ways the same enemies in between getting
lost in the often confusing levels it's
a great-looking game but hardly a
must-have title
a surprisingly fun game is Need for
Speed rivals set aside the groan
inducing over-the-top story and dialogue
you go where we won when we won as fast
as we want you may call us thugs and
you'll find it's a fun arcade style
open-world racing game you play is
either a racer or a cop and both modes
are solid but the real fun with rivals
is the free roam you'll find things to
do basically everywhere whether it's
outrunning your friends through speed
traps or getting into a race or pursuit
what's nice is that you've got a lot of
freedom even in the middle of a race you
can feel off and you'll get in a chase
online players show up in your world too
and it's a lot of fun getting into a big
cooperative game graphically Need for
Speed rifles looks great on the ps4
everything moves incredibly fast and the
framerate only occasionally dips usually
when there's a ton of stuff on screen
interestingly this is based on the same
frostbite engine as battlefield 4 which
means you've got decent driving physics
and a few destructible things in the
environment you might not have a lot of
choice in racing games for the
PlayStation 4 but you could do a lot
worse than Need for Speed rivals
you
you can read each other
one of the most hyped games of 2013
biofuel 4 makes an appearance on the ps4
this is the latest in the line of
generally excellent shooters and bf4
step that up a notch with more
destructible environments and a fresh
coat of next-gen paint visually it's not
too far off from running the game on a
fusee which means lots of high-res
textures in fact the install is well
over 30 gigabytes gameplay is similar to
battlefield 3 with a fairly short
campaign and an only slightly
interesting story when you're in the
game it's quite a bit of fun however at
the moment it's hardly stable on the ps4
at all it crashed multiple times on me
one of which corrupted my save which
then crashed the game until I manually
deleted to say battlefield 4 is clearly
a good game but the technical issues
make it a hard sell until it gets a few
more patches under its belt
out of all the ps4 launch titles one of
my surprise favorites is the indie title
resogun it's a fantastic looking twin
stick shooter that features a curved map
where you shoot your way through the
waves of different enemies while working
to collect humans and bring them to the
portal to safety it's a simple yet
incredibly fun idea for a game and
resogun nails it with solid easy to
learn controls and visuals that work
flat-out awesome on the ps4 best of all
it's a free game right now if you have
PlayStation Plus
what's your favorite ps4 game let me
know in the comments below and

all my ps4 coverage anyway guys that
