video going over Snapseed I'm sure love
you guys know facebook yesterday bought
Instagram for 1 billion dollars well
this is great for facebook if you're
using Instagram right now you don't
wanna be forced to have a facebook login
or get it all integrated into Facebook
which of course it's definitely going to
be coming then you might wanna be
interested in a couple of alternatives
such as Snapseed snap see gives you a
lot of the functionality of Instagram
with a fantastic interface and some very
nice filters and effects snapper import
a picture of up to 16 megapixels and
you'll be greeted with a few options
along the bottom of your various effects
with some hobbies hipster styles such as
grunge and vintage which look exactly
like what you'd expect to see on
Instagram where snapseed really comes
into its own is in how well you can
customize your images you can easily
select which attribute you want to
change by tapping and then scrolling up
and down then you can swipe left and
right to adjust the strength of that
effect this really works as well as it
looks after a brief learning curve you
can tweak your images in no time you can
also do broader changes such as
adjusting the style along with what
texture you want to use there's also a
compare button which allows you to
instantly see how much you've changed
your image and if you don't like it you
can simply go back you can also use
pinching gestures to adjust some effects
for example to precisely line up how
much of the image you want and focus
once you're ready you can apply the
changes and be done or add an additional
effect and continue editing I'm not all
that into some of the effects but others
are really quite cool and by far my
favorite is selective adjust this allows
you to create control points to
manipulate individual parts of the image
at a time and this alone makes Snapseed
worth it for me a level of control
really is impressive finally when you're
done you can share it to Twitter
Facebook and Flickr or just save it and
upload it wherever you like Snapseed is
available for five dollars as a
universal iOS app for iphone and ipad
and twenty dollars for windows and mac
with an android version coming soon
overall I think snapseed is a fantastic
application on the one hand it's a great
app just in general so of course not
only does it have a lot of cool filters
but it's also very customizable and the
interface is fantastic on the other hand
if you want to get away from Instagram
this is a great way to go to is you
don't have to worry about it being
logged in with facebook or anything like
that you can simply save your pictures
out and upload them to any social
network you want anyway guys if you
enjoyed this video definitely sure to
leave it a thumbs up and if you're
