here with an unboxing of the new HTC One
X 480 as the flight for HTC this is one
of the highest spec smart phones out
there so let's take a look pop the cap
on the box and you'll find the phone
putting it aside for one second the One
X also comes with the tool to eject the
sim a power adapter with a micro USB
cable and some warranty and Quick Start
information now let's take a look at the
phone itself up front you'll find the
huge 4.7 inch display with a white bezel
up top is the 1.3 megapixel front facing
camera capable of 720p video speaker
grill along with the proximity and light
sensors on bottom you'll find the back
home and multitasking buttons which are
capacitive unlike the Galaxy Nexus on
the top you'll find your sleep wake
button your micro sim along with the 3.5
millimeter headphone jack along the left
side you'll see the micro USB port for
charging and syncing and on the right is
the volume rocker from this view you can
see the phone has a slight curve to it
which really feels nice in the end
around back is one of the headlining
features the One X the 8 megapixel
camera with an F to aperture 1080p video
in the HTC image chip it promises big
performance i'm looking forward to
testing it out below that you'll see the
phone information for my review unit
which shouldn't be on a retail model
some pens were connecting the 1x2
accessories and the Beats Audio branding
and speaker HTC is really pushing the
beats integration on the One X so we'll
see if it's any good fire up the 1x and
the first thing that jumps out at you is
the gorgeous 720p super LCD screen with
Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich along
with sense for it's definitely unique
the size of the One X really becomes
clearer next to the iphone 4s because
it's considerably thinner it really
isn't an issue for me with a 1.5
gigahertz dual-core Snapdragon s4 LTE
the excellent screen and promising
camera the One X looks very impressive
