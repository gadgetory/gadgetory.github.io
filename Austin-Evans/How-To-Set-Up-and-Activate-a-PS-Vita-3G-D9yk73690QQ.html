here with a demo of how you can set up
and activate your PS Vita it over alts
and all that hard but of course you guys
need help I'm right here so let's jump
right on in now the first thing is
you're going to need to pick up a PS
Vita memory card now while you don't
need this to activate it you're
definitely going to need to play most
games on the Vita so if you don't have
one I would recommend picking line up it
doesn't only matter what the size is and
you'll be good to go
once you have your memory card ready all
you do is find this little port it's
going to be on the bottom of your Vita
and just pull it back so really simply
like that now grab your Vita a memory
card it's gonna be really really tiny
what you need to do is you need to it
upside down with the gold little fingers
facing up so guys can see here just make
sure you get it in there nice click it
and you get your memory card installed
this next step is only if you have a 3G
Vita now some of these we're going to
have the sim cards already installed
however if yours doesn't so really
simple way to do it you can just find
another flaps can be on this side right
here and you're gonna have a little SIM
card tray so it doesn't you can't push
it in but just pull it out go ahead and
just take your sim card tray and then
take the SIM card itself and just slide
it in like so there's a little notch
there so you shouldn't have any problems
getting in right and then just take the
whole SIM card tray slide it in just
like so I'll click and then push the
door back and you're good to go there
the next step is going to be installing
the game now you don't have to do this
to activate it however of course you're
eventually going to want to put a game
in and when you do just need to pull
this flop back on the top grab your game
right here slide it in tell it clips and
again just push the little door back
alright so the first thing we need to do
is simply just drag this down
of course the PS Vita does have a
touchscreen so we can do that next step
is to pick a language very simple of
course pick whatever language you'd like
we can pick timezone so I'm go ahead and
leave it on Central Time
and we are going to go ahead and set the
date and time so fact that looks all
accurate to me so we'll go ahead and hit
next we've got a little bit annoying
music let's turn that down
no one likes annoying music now the next
step is only if you do have a 3G Vita
and that is if you want to sign up for
AT&amp;amp;T or indeed it would probably be
whatever carrier that is in your country
so in fact I'm not gonna go ahead and do
that right now you can do it from inside
the UI and I'll show you guys that in a
minute but now we'll go ahead and just
leave it at signup later now it's going
to ask you to connect to Wi-Fi so I'll
go ahead and select mine and put
password n and here's what you may have
some issues so you guys can see here it
says the system update is required so we
click OK to accept it
however it brings us back to little sign
into PSN and you see here if we try to
try to use our account it will not
actually allow us to log in so what you
have to do is do not use and set up a
trial PSN so just go through all this
here just put a bunch of random
information in hit OK and now it should
update all right so now you should be
all ready to go you can see of course
you can swipe through your menu and
everything but there are a couple things
I do want to mention first of all if you
do want to activate the 3G at any time
go ahead and tap on the network operator
app hit start and then from here will
give you options depending on what
country and what carriers you have on
how to activate it so I'm going to do
that right now but of course that is
where you want to do it if you are
interested go ahead and open up settings
here and this is how you go ahead and
activate and get on PSN so you're going
to need to go ahead and tap on
PlayStation Network sign up and then
from here it's going to ask you to go
ahead and update your Vita so as soon as
you do that you can go ahead and update
your system software you're going to be
good to go anyway guys it's going to be
about it on how you can set up and
activate a PlayStation Vita you guys
