here I am with my fourth application
review which is a pretty cool as you see
I've got a new intro and yeah I think I
think it looks much better than the old
one
okay so let's get this one started with
a really cool app called stick wars
light now I'm sure everybody is saying
it's been that paid at the top paid app
and it's been high in the leaderboards
for a while now I mean it's the paid
version of this stick Wars and it's it's
very cool um I really enjoy these kind
of games but to be honest this light
version almost does it I mean there it
is limited slightly to 15 levels whereas
the paid version you would have
unlimited and it does have some minor
things like not as many weapons and I
mean just small things but in general
this is a lot of fun I mean I really
like it
if you're unfamiliar with the way this
works it's real simple you have your
base and basically little stick men come
running at you there are a couple of
different games like it there's a
defender castle which is off of the
which it used to be.we where that's been
brought over to iPhone and stick wars
bicycle it is the little stickman they
run across the field and basically you
just gotta flick and smash and all kinds
of fun stuff you could toss them away in
the air and drop and kill them you can
smash them down like smash them in the
ground and then as time goes on you can
capture them you can build a jail you
can capture them and then train them to
become archers there's all kinds of
different things and it's a lot it's a
lot of fun there's you can make them be
bombers all kinds of stuff and one of
the best kind of things that I really
wish all iPhone apps had was the fact
that there's autosave anytime literally
you get a call on your iPhone or just
you know you're done hit the home button
or whatever it'll save it right that
that second it really annoys me when I'm
in the middle of a game and
not have autosave you know you lose it
so the fact that even this light version
has it is really cool there's not a
whole lot else it's a really simple
application like I said he does have
some ads and like I said it has 15
levels but for me anyway I might end up
buying one of the some one of the paid
apps but for right now this is more than
enough for me so if you haven't checked
out if you have to pay obviously you
don't want to get this but you haven't
checked out this kind of game might be
interested actually definitely go for it
the next up I'll be reviewing is a
really cool one I've had this one for a
while and it's called dropship dropship
if you haven't heard it's a it's a
really interesting really cool game
basically you it's got some really nice
wireframe graphics and I mean it's it's
definitely really cool because it's just
so unique
I mean you won't see anything else like
it it's it's 3d yeah it's just really
basic and simple I mean it just looks
just awesome basically the objective
here is you're a little spaceship and
you go through navigate the maze and you
pick up different humans and then as
soon as you pick them up there's also
you pick up different boxes which are
full of whatever um this is really cool
just because one nice feature is that
the all the humans have names
yeah and dropship will actually go into
your contacts and pick out names from
your contacts so you'll be like saving
you'll see like your friends names and
stuff which is it's a small touch but
it's pretty funny um basically you
develop dictums real simple you just fly
through the all kinds of different mazes
some real simple you just go go down and
uh and then there are enemy little uh I
guess just artillery positions whatever
just a little little almost like
crystals that I'll be shooting at you
generally and you can just shoot back
now a long while the graphics on this
are great I mean they really are just
unique and one-of-a-kind the controls
I'm tempted to say are better the
controls are so great the way it works
is that's real simple on your left in
the right you put your wherever you put
your thumb up as long as on the left and
the right side
that's where your controls be so it's
not like you have to go on the bottom
left to the bottom right it can be
anywhere and you can move over basically
any way you put your thumb down and move
and I thought think that's just really
really a good idea just because it's
real simple you can I mean you don't
ever have to worry about you know oh I'm
gone whatever and like I said it's it's
a little difficult because you have to
like turn it and stuff because one the
one is to navigation ship and one is to
shoot and it can't get a little
difficult but you'll let me quickly
figure out how to work it it's a lot of
fun there a lot I mean when I say a lot
I mean there are a lot of different maps
and stuff and there's also downloads
which is pretty cool where basically you
can download new maps that are available
occasionally you download new maps and
play them like there were back towards
the holidays there were some special
holiday Maps which were pretty cool
there's like giant like Christmas tree
which kind of fun dropship it's it's
there's a full campaign mode there's
then there's also a free play mode to
where you can just go through different
ones and nothing big deal it dropship I
will say it's 99 cents at the moment and
there's also a light version I got this
before there was a light version so I
have not tried the light version but
from what I can tell it's it's pretty
cool it's got a couple of levels I'd say
go ahead and check out that light
version if you if you think you like it
go ahead go for the full version I know
I like it a lot between the graph with
just the awesome looking graphics and
there are really cool controls it
dropships definitely a really good one
to get the last stop that I'll be
reviewing today is a really really
awesome on now if you watched a couple
of videos back I mentioned I bought a
bunch of new apps and this is one of
them and so far it's probably my
favorite one and it is called Sentinel
Mars defense I gotta say this one is
probably the no it's no it is the best
tower defense game I've ever played okay
um it combines some really cool
fix some really good ideas like there
are on the normal path which the enemies
go by they're actually destructible
defenses like there are barriers and if
they break them then they'll keep on
going but uh there's a lot of different
really nice features to this and all of
them add up to me just an awesome
awesome app anyway so uh basically what
it is it's the same same tried-and-true
way of doing the tower defense games
you've got the winding paths that lead
to your base and you basically drop
towers in there and you can upgrade them
and basically just to stop them um now
Sentinel is it's like I said it's got
the destructible defences and there are
also four different Maps and all of them
are different some of them are some of
them actually have like where the
enemies we come in from to two places at
once and you've got to defend them
you've got all kinds of stuff there's
four different
I'm sorry six different towers that you
can get if you unlock new maps new
towers there's also two modes there's uh
there's four difficulty levels I will
say the the graphics on this are really
good um I have actually been able to
really slow it down
but that was on the biggest field on one
like level like 120 or whatever with
like I had like 100 and something towers
and it was like I mean just insane I'm
at you couldn't watch there's like
hundreds of enemies flying everywhere
but beyond that it's pretty solid I
really haven't seen no problems with
glitches or lag it's been it's really
really solid general there are not
really a whole lot of problems with this
application maybe maybe a couple more
Maps would be nice but I mean honestly
it's not really needed I mean the four
that are included are all challenging
they're all very unique different you
won't you won't get you know you won't
just go all these are boring it's really
cool just because it's got such a cool
when you first open it up it's got such
a cool menu
it's got like that's like you're
standing on like the bridge of a ship
you see like different like I guess it
looks like surveillance
cameras and then you see and then you
have options through score and to play
everything and then one really nice
thing is that lets include most tower
defense but not all is that the fact
there's a continue we're just the same
isn't dropship when you shut it off you
can come straight back into the game
keep on playing and some of the games
get really long I mean you can go sixty
different waves ninety a hundred I mean
and then there's the mode where you
could just go infinitely and just you
know just see as long as you can go I
mean I I will say it is in my it's right
up there along with gout caught in my
opinion there's also a light version and
I've actually been playing lifers for a
very long time and I've just now gotten
the paid version and believe me I do not
regret it at all it is only a $0.99
right now it's been five dollars for a
very long time it's just now come down
to 99 cents it's a special sale so
everybody I definitely recommend go
check out the light version and if you
like it what you will it includes the
very first map if you liked it go ahead
pick up the full version I mean you will
not regret it all if you like any kind
of tower defense if you like to field
runners or anything like that check out
at least check out the light version you
you will not be disappointed
