have a special video continuing with the
worldwide developers conference
everything that Apple released now i'm
showing you as you can see safari for
its been abated for a while it's finally
out and it's actually a fully
downloadable know what that means but
this is what's out and you can download
it right now it's not a debated you not
to worry and first impressions this it
is just really awesome really fast so
let's get this one started
okay so the first thing that you will
notice about Safari is that it is vast
I've been using Chrome for a while and
my main reason that I was using it is
because it was fast and I look like a
fast browser oh I don't know any exact
speed tests so this is just kind of off
my my first impressions but I want I was
kind of leaning toward a saying that
safaris faster let me show you can see
here is a jerk and looks very nice let
me show you a page in loading let me
just open up the yahoo and you will see
right off the back done that fast again
one of the really cool features let me
just show you this one real quick is
this is the top sites now opera as well
as chrome have this feature or you can
go ahead and add all your at all your
favorite sites it adds them for you
basically the fat every time you load a
site it will remember in the top sites
that you load obviously this is kind of
a little blank right now but this is a
really cool feature and then another
thing is if you come down here to edit
I'm just going to show you this real
quick you do it small this is the medium
size which it would have 12 on here then
you can add all these or you can do
large you just have six my personally I
like me that's the default but finish
that up now let me show you a couple of
things first let me show you a couple of
the page is loading because this is just
vast I I mean it is so vast I mean you
can see great I mean there's no all with
it all everything loads nice and smooth
and it is so fast I just show you this
real quick you can see everything loads
just great I can just want to watch that
won't do it because probably like the
computer but let me just show you a
couple things there's full tab support
and when you open a new tab it will open
the top sites and if you hit the top
site button up there that will go ahead
just do it tab that you're in you see
those disappeared for a second i
actually really sure why but and then
let me just show you a couple of things
you can obviously for
bookmarks if you do a search here and
then you can come in here and customize
let me just show you customize the
toolbar this is a pretty cool thing
basically this is where you can just
drag all your things to League mais your
toolbar you can editing from bookmark
and address report bugs downloads mail
some zoom autofill mates it's really
pretty cool the default I go ahead went
ahead the first thing I did was at the
tabs that's one of the bigger things but
see that's definitely that one of the
first things when you open up you go
ahead and do that that's I mean there's
not a ton I mean you'll see this party
is not Safari is not really a the I
don't know I'm senator says it's full
features just not that it just doesn't
have a lot of extra features that you
might expect let me show you a couple of
things and you see here when you in the
tight we just pull it right up see I'm
right here we can go ahead and search
apple and just kind of load go ahead
searching just show you how see this is
big by the way so you guys all about and
you can see they have 3gs already up and
I I've already done the thing on that
you guys can check it out and by the way
and then it have safari three or if you
have a early safari or it's not for any
way it will automatically date but if
you want to go ahead and get it right
now come on in here to calm the
downloads thing I've the links
everything and sway bar and then it'll
simple just hit download now go straight
through it and you will get it obviously
it's going to be free you set up and
I've in Windows and Mac obviously
there's not going to be linux as far as
never had that but yeah that's just a
bad get too in depth on this one all I
know is that this I mean I'm really
really impressed with this so far and
I'm going to be switching from my chrome
to this so yeah I definitely recommend
