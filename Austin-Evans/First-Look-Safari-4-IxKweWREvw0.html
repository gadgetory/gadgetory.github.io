have a special video
continuing with the Worldwide Developers
Conference everything that Apple
released now I'm showing you as you can
see Safari 4 it's been abated for a
while it's finally out and it's actually
a fully downloadable I don't know what
that means but this is what's out and
you can download it right now it's not a
debated you're not worried and first
impressions this is just really awesome
really fast so let's get this one
started
okay so the first thing that you will
notice about Safari is that it is vast
I've been using Chrome for a while and
my main reason that I was using it is
because it was fast and I look like a
fast browser
I don't know any exact speed test so
this is just kind of off my my first
impressions but I want I was kind of
leaning towards saying that safaris
faster let me just show you you can see
here is a jerk and looks very nice let
me show you a page and loading let me
just open up Yahoo and you will see
right off the back done that fast
you know one of the really cool features
let me just show you this one real quick
is this is the top sites now Opera as
well as chrome have this feature or you
can go ahead and add all your at all
your favorite sites it adds them for you
basically it's a fad every time you load
a site it will remember in the top sites
that you load obviously this is kind of
a little blank right now but this is a
really cool feature and then another
thing is if you come down here to edit
just going to show you this real quick
you do it small this is the medium size
which it would have 12 on here then you
can add all these or you can do large
you just have six my personally I like
me that's the default
what finish that up now let me show you
a couple of things first let me just
show you a couple of the page is loading
because this is just vast I I mean it is
so vast I mean you can see great I mean
there's no habla at all everything loads
nice and smooth and it is so fast I just
show you this real quick and you can see
everything loads just great I can just
if I wanted to I could watch that or
what don't do it because probably like
the computer but let me just show you a
couple of things there's a full tab
support and when you open a new tab it
will open the top sites and if you hit
the top site button up there that will
go ahead just do it the tab that you're
in
you see those disappeared for a second I
actually really sure why but and then
let me just show you a couple of things
you can obviously
bookmarks if you do a search here and
then you can come in here and customize
let me just show you customize the
toolbar this is a pretty cool thing
basically this is where you can just
drag all your things to League mais your
toolbar you can anything from bookmark
and address report bugs downloads mail
some zoom autofill I mean it's it's
really pretty cool the default I went
ahead the first thing I did was at the
tabs that's one of the bigger things but
see that's definitely that one of the
first things when you open up you go
ahead and do that
that's I mean there's not a ton I mean
you'll see it's parties not Safari is
not really a I don't know what senator
says it's full features just not that it
just doesn't have a lot of extra
features that you might expect now let
me just show you a couple of things and
you see here when you in the tight it
will just pull it right up you see I'm
right here we can go ahead and search
Apple and just kind of load
go ahead search it just show you how see
this is big by the way show you guys all
about and you can see that they have 3GS
already up and I I've already done a
thing on that you guys can check it out
and by the way and then it have Safari 3
or if you have a early Safari or it's
not for anyway it will automatically
date but if you want to go ahead and get
right now going come on in here to calm
the downloads thing are the links
everything and so go ahead bar and then
it'll just hit download now go straight
through it
and you will get it obviously it's gonna
be free you set up and I'm in Windows
and Mac obviously there's not gonna be
Linux as far as never had that but you
know that's just about I'll get to in
depth on this one all I know is that
this I mean I'm really really impressed
with this so far and I'm gonna be
switching from my from Chrome to this so
yeah I definitely recommend go check it
out and see what you think
