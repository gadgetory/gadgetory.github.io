of Tron Legacy for the iPhone and iPod
Touch so this is a really cool app you
know I she was not expecting too much
generally these movie kind of apps are
not that great and what for I was real
I've been really pleasantly surprised
Tron Legacy is actually quite a bit of
fun so I just turn this volume hello bit
here I'm so glad to give you guys a
quick demo let me just show you what all
it has to offer I mean you have single
play which I will course demo for you
guys in a second and we do have a
multiplayer dude it's multiplayer I
really haven't tested this out too much
so I can't say that much but you know
I'm even going to have you create your
profile there's a few tutorials you can
go through your achievements options all
kind of stuff I'm not going to just go
straight to the multi single-player
rather and show you guys what this is
about
now of course this is based off the Tron
Legacy movie however you don't need to
be a fan of it whatsoever to you know to
enjoy so I'm gonna go ahead and into cam
right here just so you guys can see this
is for the most part of racing game so
Quentin the gameplay is not amazing I
don't know the gameplay is not amazing
however it's pretty fun and the graphics
are really really nice especially on the
iPod Touch 4th generation is Retina
display I'm so fine just skipped all
this so there you go guys these graphics
are really quite nice thing I'm not so
sure how you well you can see through
the camera but let's start you just
start yet to really tap this as fast you
can get as much boost as possible to
start the race with and there we go so
the the right side of the screen is
pretty much all just a giant accelerator
and then the left side is the brakes now
as we jump up here we can actually go
ahead and pick up power-ups and things
like that as you guys can see here this
runs really nice and smooth I'm gonna
hope try to keep make sure you guys can
see it on the camera it runs really nice
and smooth and I love the graphics it
really doesn't bring you know really
does remind me quite a bit of what the
movie looks like and it's really this
quite nice looking at me I'm surprised
it's not that bad you know generally
these kind of games you know you can
tell there's a major difference but I
know that I almost could see something
pretty similar to this on you know the
Xbox or the PlayStation so definitely
kudos to them for doing a nice job with
that I'm so we can go ahead and scroll
the lips go ahead and double tap the up
some play I'm planning to me Kenzie
double tap the accelerator to go ahead
and hit the turn
boosting yeah and that's like it's very
hard to control when you're in turbo
boost mode but it's not too bad now the
currently this one is just by myself I'm
just you know just doing I believe a
Time Trial or something but it's pretty
fun now guys this one is currently only
99 cents in the App Store and I've gotta
say that's definitely worth it just for
the you know D great audio you know
there's a lot to like about this
especially once you get into the
multiplayer definitely very very cool
stuff right there now I will mention
where they went with the multiplayer you
do need to go ahead and create an
account which is kind of annoying but
not the biggest deal in the world so
we're about done here I believe we're
gonna get one more lot to go go ahead
whoa turbo tap here and that's yeah yeah
we're going pretty fast here but yeah
there we go so there you go guys this is
about it for Tron Legacy it's not a
really in-depth game you know this is
for the most part what you're gonna do
it you know what you're gonna see here
however it's a lot of fun and I just
like it for the graphics alone I mean
you know it's just really really nice
not to mention the gameplay not amazing
but still pretty decent so guys if
you're interested you can go ahead and
pick this one up currently in the App
Store for 99 cents you know don't don't
go into it expecting too much but for
you know for the price is definitely
worth it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
