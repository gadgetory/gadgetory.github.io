Sony booth at e3 2014 with a hands-on
demo of the new Sony project Morpheus so
I took a look at this at GDC this year
and it was cool however got to spend a
little bit more time with it here I've
got to say I'm impressed so if you guys
are not familiar with Morpheus it's
similar to what you will be able to find
an oculus right so it's a virtual
reality headset you put it on and it is
similar to oculus I'll get a little bit
more into the comparison in a minute so
they have a few demos here one of which
is a Valkyrie which is actually a game
that you can try on oculus really really
cool so I should look even better here
they also had a dinosaur demo where you
can kind of like walk around it was like
kinda like a Jurassic Park Fang looked
really cool but the demo I tried was a
kind of a medieval tech demo right so
you have a couple different weapons you
can punch and the controller's were the
PlayStation Move controllers so you have
one in each hand so you can like punch
you had at one point you pick up a sword
yeah mace give it a few different things
and it was good so I had a small problem
in my demo and they lost tracking but of
course this is super early so you know
definitely can kind of forgive it kind
of losing track of the controller for a
second when it was working though it
looks great so the screen was not quite
up to the latest oculus developer kit -
in my opinion it was good it was fine
but like especially when you look just
anywhere but I'd like the actual center
of the screen things just get a little
bit blurry just like the oculus I
believe it's a 1080p screen so it's good
but when it's like right up on your face
like you definitely can tell that it's a
little bit low resolution I suppose but
it's definitely getting there and it's
totally playable as is now speaking of
the actual headset itself I was actually
impressed so one of the things I like
about the oculus is that it's
lightweight so when you have something
big on kind of head gear on your face
you want make sure that's light you know
like you know grand your head down so
the Morpheus it looks big and it
definitely is bigger than the oculus but
it was super lightweight I was able to
wear my glasses with the Morpheus which
was definitely a big plus and overall
I've got to say I'm really impressed I
really enjoyed my time with it the demo
was a little buggy but this is super
super early stuff I mean oculus is
shipping right now this is definitely
not
so what do you guys think about Sony
Project Marcus let me know in the
comments below be my guys thank you so
much for watching and I will catch you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
