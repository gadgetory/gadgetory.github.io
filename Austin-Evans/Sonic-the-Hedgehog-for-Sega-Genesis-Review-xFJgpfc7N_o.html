Sega Genesis even almost two decades
after its release remains a solid of a
game is any Mario title while you rarely
see 2d side-scrolling games today they
used to be huge and for good reason it's
definitely a refreshing change jumping
from the deke stories and mechanics and
modern games and something it's simple
and fun a story who needs a story just
go collect some golden rings already for
graphics well obviously looking a bit
dated today still have aged well the
bright vibrant colors do a great job of
pushing the Genesis hardware and making
sure that the game doesn't burn your
eyes like some other vintage games the
backgrounds move along with Sonic as
well giving a decent sense of depth all
it looks really really great especially
compared to some of the other Mario
games for the Super Nintendo
the music as many other Genesis games is
fantastic throughout the game you enjoy
a catchy and upbeat soundtrack you
certainly don't get music like
disengaged anymore
gameplay is very similar to most 2d
side-scroller
but with a few key differences Sonic
requires you to build up momentum to use
him most effectively for example to make
certain jumps level design is also great
as there are usually more than one way
to get past an obstacle keep up speed
and you can keep going slow down too
much or jump too late however and you
might have to find yourself a different
way up the original Sonic the Hedgehog
is a great game and is really a
must-have if you own a Sega Genesis in
addition you can also find it as a
downloadable game on mini modern
consoles give you almost no reason not
to go pick it up you won't be
disappointed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
