inside tech today we're going to be
taking a look at quite a few things
including the iPad perhaps going to
verizon I'm also going to take a look at
a couple things from d8 including the
Steve Jobs interview which really
brought a la light on a couple things as
well as perhaps we have some pictures of
the final shipping version of xbox 360
natal lastly we're going to go over the
summer complicated new data plans from
AT&amp;amp;T so if you have an iPhone or iPad or
really any a teaching foam that needs a
data plan doesn't want stay tuned anyway
let's get this one started
okay guys let's begin with one of the
Baker stores which is that the ipad
might possibly be going to a verizon so
guys there's a lot of different reasons
behind this i'll go ahead and go over
what all started off boy genius report
just reported that they had a high-level
source they trust a lot that said that
verizon is currently testing a cdma
which is the kind of network the verizon
is they're testing out testing an ipad
with that so guys this is pretty big
news i mean we've heard ipad you know i
mean iphone rumors going to verizon
which seemed to be getting more and more
and more likely i mean it is looking
pretty pretty confident that there will
be an iphone on verizon but now they're
talking about the ipad might be going to
verizon as well now of course I've has a
little bit differently of course you
know it's not like with the iphone where
you can't get you know an unlocked
iphone or whatever really you have to
get it racing to hear whatever where's
near the ipad anybody get a Wi-Fi model
so the 3g is not a huge deal but it's
still definitely something you want to
keep an eye on now kind of linking into
this was last night the d8 was that
Steve Jobs did an interview which is
pretty rare klien on we talked about ton
of stuff guys I definite recommend go
ahead check out the link in the
description go ahead there's a bunch of
video highlights from the whole event
you know there's a lot of stuff he
talked about not only even try to get
everything but one of the more
interesting things I thought was that
they started out asking him some guy was
like he lived in Houston and he was
saying basically that you know like
can't go one minute without you know
talking on it without a drop call on his
iPhone and you know Steve just basically
just said yeah I know their work they're
working on it you know you may actually
gotten a couple jobs in on 18 teams like
you know things get worse than they get
better and they're about to get way way
better um so guys there's a lot of
things but one of the interesting things
was that they asked him do you see a you
know a benefit of having more than one
carrier in the US he said yeah me and
they're like well maybe will that be
happening soon he's like you know I
can't comment on that um so that guy
that's um you know it might not sound
like a lot
Steve Jobs he's very you know cut and
dry usually he'll usually say no that's
not going to happen or you know he'll be
a lot more firm than it might be a
possibility so guys I really expect
between you know that brings a lot more
credibility to both iPhone and iPad
possibly coming to verizon in my opinion
another thing from d8 is that that
project natal on the hands-free motion
control xbox 360 we're showing off yet
again sport but this time it just might
be the final shipping version so as you
guys can see in the pictures here it
looks very similar to what we've seen in
the past um you know it's going to be a
probably about a foot putting half long
I'm going to have a couple of cameras
and sensors on it but guys it looks
pretty cool now of course this is what
we've seen and it's very very likely
that we will have full details price all
kind of stuff at e3 this year which in
just a couple of just couple weeks I
believe but the main thing really is
that the price we've talked about the
price and a lot of people seem to think
that it will be a lot of money after
$150 of her you can get it with like
that xbox 360 arcade which would be
three hundred dollars um natal is really
great and to be honest I don't say I
mean the amount of tech that's involved
with it that those are those of prices
that make sense you know for the money
part but guys I don't know if I can see
it in some a ton of them we have whipped
with it being bad expensive ok guys so
now I'm going to take a look at the new
AT&amp;amp;T data plans now they've really just
changed up a lot gone is the standard
you know thirty dollars for unloaded
data although if you do have that plan
currently you can still keep it but now
they have two new plans the data plus
and the data pro okay so the data plus
is somewhat similar to what you get on
the ipod ipad right now basically you
pay fifteen dollars a month
200 megabytes of cap today a pro plan
you get 20 it's $25 it's a 2 gigabytes
plan so guys this might seem that seems
so great but then you know you look into
it naturally as per 2 d's on now with
the overage you actually it's a pretty
good deal if you go Oh at two gigabyte
cap you know sometimes you know other
data plans you actually get charged a
ton of money they're actually not going
to charge that much they will charge you
ten dollars more for every gift for
another gigabyte and if you need more
than that and they'll charge another ten
dollars on top of that so guys it's not
like you know some plans where you know
you go over the two gigabytes you go to
point zero zero one day bites you guys
fifty dollars extra so it's pretty
decent now that's the last thing which
is lumped in with all of this that the
iphone is finally getting tethering for
sure so basically it's very simple with
the date of pro plan you get for twenty
dollars go ahead and can have your
iphone tether so this would be on top of
the $25 so guys if you have an iPhone or
any other fun but it's you know
obviously the iphones probably got to be
the biggest one for $45 can get the data
pro plan with two gigabytes a month and
you can also go ahead and have it
tethered and that's it for this episode
of inside k like thank you for watching
I've got a question for you guys what
are your thoughts on the verizon iPad
would that make you more be more likely
to go ahead and buy an ipad you know do
is that one major reason why you can
want to get an ipad 3 cheese because you
don't want it on AT&amp;amp;T jessalyn guys let
me know in the comments personally I
don't think the ipad 3g play on ATT it
used to be not so bad now i'm a little
unsure about it now I like unlimited
data that's that's just something I like
but guys you just let me know in the
comments what you know it would take for
you to get a verizon iPad
anyway guys thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
