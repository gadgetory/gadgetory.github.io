neutron 3.07 $50 is an interesting sweet
spot as it allows you to not only do
fairly intense gaming including virtual
reality but you can also do some other
things such as streaming or even editing
video with some pretty solid performance
under the hood we're also getting a case
that looks pretty decent with a built in
window and with that you can see the
heart of the system which is the Intel
Core i5 6500 this is a quad core
processor that can clock up to 3.6
gigahertz now as a new intel skylake
processor we're getting not only some of
the best performance that you can get in
a desktop CPU but it's enough to really
handle basically any kind of gaming that
you throw at it even though there are
high-end core i7 that can reach well
over $1000 in normal real-world gaming
you're actually not going to notice much
of a difference at all compared to the
$200 for i-5 it's paired with the
gigabyte H 170 MDS 3h motherboard it's
nothing too fancy but it gets the job
done
it also supports up to 64 gigabytes of
ddr4 memory which honestly is probably
more than you're ever going to need
there's also an m2 slot for a super fast
SSD two SATA Express ports and six SATA
3 ports for all the storage options your
heart desires as you probably noticed if
you cut my RX 480 video the neutron 3.0
is sporting some serious graphics horse
power it's all thanks to the new AMD
Radeon rx 480 and I actually did an
entire video if you guys want the full
details but the short answer is this is
one very powerful card for not a lot of
money the biggest problem with your rx
480 is actually just getting your hands
on them so right now they're sold out in
most places so I will do my best to find
you guys a link in the description of
this video but if you can find a 480 it
is absolutely a killer card you're
looking at being able to play games that
tapey ultra settings at 60fps and a lot
of cases you can actually even bump it
up to 1440p for example in Middle Earth
shadow of Mordor you're able to play on
1440p at Ultra settings at just under
60fps move over to Grand Theft Auto 5
which is still a really nice-looking PC
title and you're still able to play it
1440p ultra settings mind you you're
down to about 40 frames per second or so
but it's still entirely playable moving
over to a new DirectX 12 title we have
ashes of the singularity and here again
we're able to play it 1440p at extreme
settings with around 40 frames per
second moving on we have the witcher 3
which is another game that looks
absolutely awesome on the PC here we're
also able to play at 1440p however you
do need to turn the things down to
medium it's probably not a bad idea to
enjoy this one it
P ultra it's clearly the FOIA to gives
you a ton of performance for the money
especially when you consider this is a
great way to build yourself a budget vr
gaming rig to house everything we have
the corsair 100 r for $50 I really like
this case Notley does it look nice it
has a window to show off your shiny new
build it does only have a single 120
millimeter fan in the back however
that's more than sufficient for this
build and you still have room for plenty
of fans up front or even a liquid cooler
up top for memory we have a gigabytes of
Corsair Vengeance Ram notley's eight
gigs a great sweet spot for gaming but
it's also fast ddr4 and there's plenty
of room to expand if you need more later
on for storage we have a 240 to go by
crucial bx 200 SSD paired with a one
terabyte WD black hard drive this is a
good combination as having an SSD and a
modern computer is pretty much not even
negotiable and having a one terabyte
hard drive that's still fairly fast work
great for all the extra Steam games that
won't fit on the SSD powering everything
is the EVGA 500 watt bronze power supply
it might not be fancy but it'll
absolutely get the job done one of the
best parts of building your own computer
is that you get to customize as much as
you want and I will have all the links
you guys need in the description of this
video and if you want to see the neutron
3.0 in action you can check out the
video I did with my friend Alex where
she built a computer for the very first
time hopefully you guys enjoyed this
video if you did make sure to subscribe
to the channel and I will catch you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
