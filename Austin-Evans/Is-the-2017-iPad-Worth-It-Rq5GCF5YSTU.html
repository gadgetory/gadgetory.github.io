at helpless if it's not my studio
there's only one camera though I quit
hey guys this is Austin right actually
and today we're here with the brand new
$330 iPad so as the guys have done an
unboxing or two would you like to have
the honor so with an Apple product you
want to do G oh oh oh this hurts the
birds
oh look now I made a handle ah side down
power cable lightning cable no one cares
let you that why sure about is the
actual iPad one of the time use an iPad
I use an iPad like every day or two yeah
which one to use iPad 2 oh look at real
home button does it actually has a real
home button oh I'm surprised so this is
I don't know what the proper name for
this is it's the 5th gen iPad but some
people call it the seventh gen because
the seventh one it's also the cheap one
so it's not an iPad air or pro it's the
2017 iPad so what's interesting about
this iPad is it's sort of a Frankenstein
of a few different models so this is the
chassis of the iPad air one which is a
little bit thicker than the two and the
pro because of that it should have a big
much bigger battery actually it also has
the same processor the a9 from the
iPhone 6s which even though is not the
newest thing is still better than what
was in the previous iPad air 2 however
what is not new it's actually originally
from the iPad air 1 yeah the display so
it's no longer laminated which means
that it still looks fine and they say
it's supposed to be a bit brighter
although I don't really know if I
believe that or not but what is
interesting about it is that you can
actually kind of see there's like a lot
more air gap it's still a good display
it's still retina but it is definitely
an downgrade from something like the air
2 or the pro I think that's the worst
air gap I've ever seen on an Apple
device ok but it does have some
redeeming qualities
yes so the fact that we're using newer
low-power hardware again it's the iPhone
so it's not an iPad to finish up no and
that we have a thicker chassis is that
battery life on this thing should be
like stupid the bee's knees so basically
this is like an all-day laptop with a 60
watt hour battery so essentially this is
a little over half the size of that but
obviously at
I was going to eat up a lot less power
than it was it like an i5 i7 Dooku like
honest if you don't have a problem with
iPads and battery life I feel like iPads
one of those things that they kind of
just last forever you plug them in every
few days I mean unless you actually use
your iPad a lot cause it's like it's
your main computer yeah a beach is not
crazy it's not crazy in fact so for
comparison this is the iPad pro nine
point seven Oh rotate rotate and take
pictures boom boom you're dead you're
dead buddy oh yeah God your pictures are
so much better oh I can't especially
might have a better camera I'm pretty
sure it has a better camera cause like
look at the noise so it's not only a
fair comparison the pro is six hundred
dollars where this is three hundred
thirty dollars so you lose some stuff on
the camera it's kind of crazy but you
know whatever you can kind of deal with
it one of the bigger things though that
I actually do like about the pro is
stuff like the cover so well that you
can't mean you can use it as a computer
but it's much more difficult but this
you actually do have not only just a
nice little cover to kind of keep things
protected but you also have a reasonable
keyboard it's small it's not perfect but
if you need to like type little bit on
that it's not terrible define I almost
do these are sort of for different
people right if this is for something if
you really want to try to replace your
laptop and you have a little bit of a
lighter workflow I'm not saying you
should do it I'm just saying this is
more well suited to replace a lot let's
look at me okay
I'm here if you need a bag to breathe
it's okay it's okay here oh I got you
okay hold it hold it there you go there
you go you also have Apple pencil
support here which is not on this iPad
included and honestly I feel like it
depends on who you are I think but there
are a lot of people who actually can get
a lot of use out of a proper stylus like
you would get on something like this
surface I think that that's a big part
of it getting an iPad for a lot of
people and this just doesn't support it
one of my thoughts is is that for me
when I use an iPad one of the main
reasons I do that is to watch video and
this has a decent screen and okay
speakers but this has a much better
screen and I would argue way better
speakers on the cost twice as much and
the battery life isn't as good which is
fair so you can watch crappier video for
longer and cheaper there's a definitely
YouTube joke in here somewhere if i'ma
leave it this has better speakers it has
some creature comforts like the ability
to add a keyboard yep it has a
so I have support for the pencil and
cost twice as much so bottom line
yeah I mean it's right in the title of
the video it is in the title the video
is it worth it kind of I think if you
want a cheaper tablet I mean for three
and thirty two bucks you're getting into
that budget territory but it's a lot
cheaper than a traditional like five
hundred iPad I'm a little excited to
think that maybe Apple's finally
listening now made it a little bit
thicker and they put a big fat battery
okay I'm at something that I think I'm
not the only user who's been asking for
so what do you guys think about the new
iPad let us know in the comments below I
guess you can go check blindness out he
has a channel is kind of decent I guess
please do not on my iPad like that
didn't drop it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
