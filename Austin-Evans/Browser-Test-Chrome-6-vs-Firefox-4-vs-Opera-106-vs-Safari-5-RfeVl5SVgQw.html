series of browser test videos there have
been quite a few update since my last
test with an official four-point-oh beta
for Firefox being released it also have
been updates for both chrome and opera
bringing a big jump in speed for both
lastly we had safari five which has been
updated with the new or UI as well as
faster browsing so let's take an
in-depth look at each browser to see
which one is definitively the fast is
available as always with my browser
tests let me take a quick moment to
explain my testing procedure all
browsers will run through the same five
tests multiple times on the same windows
seven core i3 computer all tests will
run as the close to identical conditions
as possible to ensure a fair fight let's
begin with the j s benchmark a great
overall test of straight JavaScript
speed chrome 6 easily won this test
notching a score of well over 500 opera
10.6 was just behind followed by safari
five and firefox for next i ran the
SunSpider benchmark another javascript
speed test lower is better in this test
and the results are largely the same
with chrome taking the win with opera
and Safari just behind it Firefox while
still quite a bit faster than previous
versions was no match and finished a
fairly distant fourth place moving on we
have the Peacekeeper benchmark
peacekeeper is one of the best overall
browser benchmarks as a tests and quite
a few various factors in this test
chrome and opera were nearly identical
with both browsers laying down scores of
over 7,000 to put that in perspective
even the fastest computer rate from
around a year ago would have been very
hard-pressed to put down similar numbers
with any browser writing out the test is
too far in Firefox both with decent is
not amazing schoolers next we have a
test from the internet explorer 9 test
suite the fish tank this test uses html5
to render a fish tank filled with 100
fish and the frames per second are
recorded the manufacturer in this test
is hardware acceleration and as you can
see opera took it handily with a decent
23 frames per second following distantly
behind was Firefox and Chrome with eight
and four free
per second respectively last was Safari
which almost refused to run the test
before finally being able to write it
out of single frames per second and I'm
being generous there the last comparison
Iran is the html5 test this test as the
name implies measures how well each
browser supports the html5 standard
Chrome and Safari did quite well in the
test by supporting over two-thirds of
the standard Firefox and opera were
behind someone it still didn't do too
badly purely based off of speed there's
no doubt that chrome 6 is the winner it
easily be all competitors and everything
except this fish tank test ensuring that
it will remain the fastest browser
available for the time being I must say
though that this has been the closest
browsers test I've ever done and all for
browsers did quite well as always though
there can be only one winner and today
that is Chrome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
