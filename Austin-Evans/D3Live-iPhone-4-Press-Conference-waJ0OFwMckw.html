d3 live are we recapping the recent
apple press conference about the iphone
4 so guys well it was not a whole lot
basically in a nutshell they will a
polluting away free bumper cases as well
as third-party cases if you already have
an iphone 4 or if you buy an iphone 4
between now and sep tember 30th so guys
you know a lot of people did expect this
it's not a huge deal it will be nice
though if you already bought a bumper
for your iphone 4 then you can go ahead
and register to get a refund since you
should be able to get your money back no
problem and if you already have an
iphone 4 but you do not have a bumper
then you can go ahead and register to go
ahead and have apple send you a free
either a bumper or like i said a third
party case and it can be a lot of
different kinds later we don't know
exactly for sure so guys this is pretty
good news this should go a long ways
into helping the death grip problem now
what basically the way it will work is
that sometime next week Apple will open
up their website to allow you to you
know register to get three cases or to
get refunds so that's pretty good
unfortunately though guys there was
really nothing else to it they spent a
long time talking about how a lot of
phones have the same sort of issues
talking about how it was it's not the
biggest deal in the world and you know
some of the numbers were kind a little
bit messed up like once they said like
half a percent of people have called in
but you know you do the math that's tens
of thousands of people so some of the
stuff you can tell you know it really
wasn't planned out that well that says
though guys I think getting everyone
giving everyone a free case is a fair
compromise i think that you know it's a
good idea it doesn't solve all the
iphone four issues and still it's kind
of a bit of it you know it's not that
great to see that you know you have to
have a case on your phone right device
you can lose reception i think it will
go aways and helping ok guys so for the
second segment of d3 live i'm going to
be taking some questions I'm getting
some opinions from everybody's in the
chat currently have 70 people in there
it's just pretty good so this point just
ask them so um do you recommend getting
the iphone now or in September going
good now in once you wait to sep tember
actually that's when the case is end so
i mean really i don't think that
anything else
be happening I think the Apple said what
they're going to say they're not going
to you know all sudden start recalling
it later unless the issue gets bigger
bad think that this is probably going to
just hold it off and it's just kind of
kind of start to fade away you heard the
iphone 4 is just a test I'm not sure
what you mean you are you talking about
like as in testing the new antenna or
not sure if you get a glass case will
that cancel out the death grip I've
never heard of a glass case it probably
will the main thing the main reason that
the death grip is is that the that your
skin when it touches the bridges the two
antennas together then it can't let
starts to kind of really degrade the
signal so anything really that keeps you
from touching that will probably work I
assume glass footwork I honestly don't
know never even heard of a glass case
but I imagine it probably would you
think android will overpower the iPhone
and iOS four by the end of this year
probably not I think androids really
building everything but Ivan for even
with this problem is still probably one
of the best phones around and I don't
think android might have more phones but
as far as a single phone I think iphone
still go stay on top would you reading
from the iphone 3g now that we've seen
what all's going on with iPhone for that
like I said they're going to give away
free cases I think that that will
probably be enough to go ahead and
upgrade I mean the 3g is pretty decent
but it's starting to get old especially
with near the iOS four update so it's
probably about time to upgrade and I
think even though I'm not a hundred
satisfied with what you know Steve Jobs
everybody just announced with the free
bumpers and everything I think that yeah
3 is that time I think that iphone 4
will is it's going to have some issues
but with the case it should be okay oh
yes good point talking about the verizon
towers something i have neglected to
mention earlier is that actually when
Steve Jobs was talking about the death
grip some people were doing it with
their phones right in the audience and
they say that I couldn't do it so
something kind of interesting that Steve
Jobs was saying was that he's like why
should we have AT&amp;amp;T and verizon towers
on the campus on so actually that's a
great point i forgot to mention it that
is a really really interesting thing to
know that they
you have when your verizon cell towers
as well as itt you would expect ATT
because obviously i need to test the
phones it's actually have a verizon
towers lots pretty interesting let's
take one more do you think that I price
of the iphone fool come down because of
this probably not I'm okay diuretic
effect almost definitely not I think
that like I said this is apple's
response they're not going to change
anything else they're going to go okay
we'll give you free cases people go oh
this is great and then people probably
stop talking about it and then it won't
be an issue anymore now if something
else happens if something comes about
that says that you know this isn't
working or there's a bigger problem then
yeah I can see that you know they might
have to you know try some other measures
but to be honest I think this is about
the end of it I don't think we're really
going to be hearing a whole Lyle's do
you think prices coming to the apple
iphone now like i just said i think it's
a pretty good chance that now that they
can you know especially they said that a
CT is one of the bigger issues about the
death grip because obviously the death
grip you know turns the signal down a
little bit but of course if there's not
a bunch of signal round to begin with
you know that's going to really hurt you
but you guys anyway that's it taking all
the questions everything in general not
to impress about the conference but i
thought you know the cases were pretty
decent i guess and you know hopefully
that should be able to fix everybody I'm
you all get free cases for your iphone
so hopefully that's pretty decent anyway
guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
