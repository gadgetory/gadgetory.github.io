their last entry into the console market
after the Saturn fell well behind the
PlayStation in Nintendo 64 Seika decided
to pull out all the stops with the
Dreamcast to regain the lead
looking at the console you'll find quite
a few trailblazing features including a
modem which came standard and lab for
all Dreamcast users to play games online
as well as download DLC years before it
became the standard the Dreamcast also
was unique in the way it's stored data
instead of using ordinary memory cards
like many of its competitors games were
saved on removable packs called VM use a
VM you plugged into the controller and
featured a display along with a few
buttons which allowed you to play a
handful of mini games depending on what
save data you had on the VM you looking
at the controller you'll find that it's
surprisingly good while a bit large than
you might like it's got an interesting
and nicely ergonomic shape which is no
small feat considering you could fit two
VM use into the controller the joystick
is really great and the function buttons
are nicely sized and spaced out the rear
triggers have a near-perfect amount of
feedback and the entire controller is
impressively rock-solid considering how
light it is the Dreamcast hardware is
fairly compact and good-looking upfront
you'll find four controller ports along
with a small compatible with Windows CE
II logo the Dreamcast was unique in the
fact that the operating system was
installed from the disk every time you
turned on the system this meant that it
was possible to use multiple operating
systems and updates to keep the
Dreamcast always a step ahead on the top
you'll find power and open buttons the
Dreamcast takes gd-rom discs that look
just like a CD however they have 1.2
gigabytes of capacity the sides of the
console are fairly clean until you get
to the back where you will find ports to
plug in the power cable a serial port AV
out in either a modem or Ethernet
connections depending on which you had
installed many regarded the Dreamcast as
being ahead of its time and in many
cases that's absolutely true the
graphics were solid in the edition of
online play in the interesting if a bit
underwhelming vmu was very unique
however it just wasn't to be by the time
the PlayStation 2 came out the Dreamcast
was already losing steam and Sega wasted
no time in discontinuing their
console business all together after less
than two years with the Dreamcast in the
North American market regardless of how
it did commercially there's no doubt
that the last ever Sega console went out
with a bang</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
