we're going to find out,
is the Tesla Model 3
worth it?
Hey, are you famous YouTuber
Jake Roper from Vsauce3
and Beme?
- No, I'm Michael Cera.
- Alright let's go drive the car,
let's go drive the car.
- You didn't hug me back!
- So it is time to drive the Model 3.
So you've had this for how long?
- I've had this for four days.
- So we're on Angeles Crest
which is one of my favorite
roads anywhere, this
feels pretty good, there's
a lot of regenerative
breaking, that's always
something when I get in an electric car
I let off and you're basically
dragging on the brakes.
- It helps you drift.
How does it handle these curves?
- I'm not going fast yet but
it feels pretty responsive.
You're not used to being a passenger.
- No I'm not.
- I'm not even starting yet.
So you can imagine that
there will be more models
later on but this is the
long range battery with
the standard rear-wheel drive, right?
- Yeah.
- So I'm assuming that the
all-wheel drive would be
even faster, although
probably a little heavier
maybe, with the motor up front.
- Yeah but it will be
faster, I mean you can see
that with all of Tesla's
cars, between the 85
and then the 85D, you
did get about a second
of extra acceleration from
zero to 60 with the D.
- Right you just have
all that extra, and also
you have two motors.
- You get two motors and
you also get more range.
- So what brought you to the
Model 3, cause you have
a Model S now, right?
- So I do, well by the end
of this week I will not
have a Model S anymore.
- Oh so you're getting rid of it.
- I'm getting rid of it,
there's a few reasons.
The Model S is a wonderful
car but it's very large,
it's also very expensive,
this car is about half
the price of my Model S
and to me I can't notice
too much of a difference
in terms of fit and finish
in the feel of it, I prefer
this one more actually.
- When I drove the Model
S on this road it was fun
and you could tell that
electric torque is right there
immediately, but the
problem was it's heavy,
it weighs like 1,000
pounds more than this.
- But the thing that
blows my mind is how well
it turns, cause I thought
the Model S turned really
well, but this one, it's
just, I keep saying the word
tight, it's just so tight how it turns.
- I heard that some people
have complained about the ride
so we drove up from downtown
LA with this and on some
of the bumps it's a little stiff.
- And kind of what I was
telling you, my Model S
has air suspension, this one has spring,
so it definitely is more stiff and more,
you feel the road more
but it's not a huge deal.
- Ready?
- Do it.
(laughs)
- Oh man.
- Oh man.
- Holy smokes, you went all
the way up to forty-five.
- Shh, you can't say that on camera.
- I'm sorry, you went all
the way up to a nice number.
- So that's one of the nice
things about an electric
car, it just punches you,
we're going like 40 miles
and hour and you roll into
it and it puts you right back
in your seat.
- It's immediate.
- I noticed as we got to
slightly higher speeds,
it did kind of give out a
little bit, you can tell
it's meant for getting on
the freeway versus blasting
down the Autobahn but it
still definitely picks up.
- That's why they really only give you
the zero to 60 number.
- Right, that's the thing
though, this is such an early
build of the car, it does
feel like it's a little bit
of a beta, not everything is complete,
you were saying that the FM
radio was just added, right?
- FM radio was just added,
auto wipers were just
added as I'm filming this
yesterday, with this car
you can only get the
premium model at the moment
so it comes with heated rear
seats which have not been
turned on yet.
- Wait, wait, wait, you're
trying to say that this
has heated seats that you
cannot turn on because it needs
a software update?
- Yes, but only in the back
seats, the front seats work.
- This is a higher specced
up model, the MSRP is 55?
- This was 55,000, out the
door but then it's also
$1,000 document and transportation fee.
- Sure, so it's 56,000 in total.
- Excluding tax but
then you get the $7,500
tax credit and then in California
at least and it depends
on your state, you get a
$2,500 rebate, so you save
$10,000 by buying this car.
- Which is a lot of money.
- How does it compare to your car, 'cause
you have a very sporty Audi?
- I have an Audi RS 3
which is a little bit
more on the sporty side,
it's faster, I will say
but this feels a little
bit like, what's scary
about this is the speed seems way way less
because it's quiet, we were
just doing a reasonably
high speed and it just
feels like I'm driving down
the road so it's like,
in that car that I have,
you hear everything, you
hear the motor, you hear
the turbos, you hear the
exhaust, this is a much more
calm and serene experience,
so this is not something
that I want to go to the
track and abuse for six hours.
- Besides the acceleration
and what have you,
what is the handling like
compared to your Audi?
- It's good, I think with
a more aggressive tire
we could be pushing it a lot
more, oh here's my tunnel,
we'll forward through it anyway, ready.
Warp speed!
Now just spending a couple
minutes with the model three,
something that's
immediately jumped out to me
is there're a lot of really
interesting quirks with this.
Now the first thing actually
you pointed this one out,
the wheels, they actually
come off or at least
the arrow part.
- The arrow wheel cover can pop off,
so we can just do, I'm
gonna use my muscles,
oh they don't exist.
- I got you.
- There we go.
- The idea is that this
is going to help with
the aerodynamics, right,
but I actually kind of like
the wheel that's inside,
I actually didn't realize
this was a thing.
- It's not bad if you get
a Tesla center cap there,
and maybe some lug nuts
that match the color,
that's totally fine.
- Looks good.
Now like a lot of modern
Teslas, there are cameras
all over the place, so just
on one side you can see
that there's a little camera to look back
behind I guess for
traffic over on this side,
do you actually know how
many cameras there are,
'cause there's another one up here.
- There's here you have
there, then you have
some up front, you also
have radar and sonar,
then you have the same on the other side
then you have the camera on the back,
all really they give you
a complete picture of what
the car is seeing when it
does it's machine learning
for actual automated driving.
- So all model threes
come with the autopilot
hardware preinstalled, so
basically the difference
is you have to pay to
unlock it, so essentially
it's a $5,000 upgrade?
- I believe it's 5,000 for
autopilot and then they have
full self driving which is another 3,000.
- But that's not out yet.
- That's not out yet.
- But the idea is that if
you basically pay for some
software updates, it has all the hardware
to essentially be pretty
much fully self driving.
- Oh yeah.
- So as soon as I saw
this car, one of the first
things that jumped out to
me were the door handles.
So the model S, they actually
pop out, with this one,
you actually have to press your thumb in
and then grab the handle
like that, it's a little
weird, it's not quite what I would expect.
- I feel like you get
used to it right away.
So it's like boom, boom!
- There's actually a surprising
amount of room back here,
look at this you have your
wonderful window sticker.
- I like to show that off to people.
- So this is for on the
go charging if you don't
want to buy an actual EV
unit, or Tesla's chargers,
this one you just plug into the wall.
- You have the adapters.
- 120 volt, and then this
is the 250 volt adapter,
so you plug it in and
it charges with this.
- So here you have your
charging port on on the X
and the S it's also
hidden behind one of these
guys but this wouldn't
open, you push in, ooh,
comes out and then the colors
adjust depending on whether
you're charging or not, so
that's pretty nice, and then
you just tap it to close.
- Can you actually control
that from the screen inside?
- You can actually control
it from your phone.
- Of course, naturally.
- So it does come with these things,
I actually should show
you, so this is what
the key looks like.
- So it looks just like
a hotel key or something.
- Yeah it's like a credit
card, so you can use that
to unlock the car and start it,
or you can use your phone.
- Most everything on
this car is controlled
via Bluetooth on the app, right?
- Pretty much, you can
adjust, you can do most
things in the car as well.
- I really like the way
the model three looks from
the front although that is not big, wow.
So this is still the rear
wheel drive one, so figure
that there's not a lot of space in here,
I wonder if they actually
go all wheel drive
there's gonna be even less space.
- The nice thing too is
you can have little holders
for your groceries right
there, it's clever.
- Pretty sure you're gonna
fit two grocery bags.
- And a small child.
- So the interesting
things about this car,
is the screen, because
that's basically where
you control literally everything.
- Yep, that's all there is.
- But you can do, to be fair
you can do basically everything,
so you have climate control,
you have heated seats
on the bottom, you have
your nav screen here
and you have pretty much
all the main controls
from the car that you would normally see
in your guage cluster.
- Yup.
And then you would also
have, you can go more into
different apps so you
have music right there,
but you can bring it
all the way up like that
and they have radio,
streaming, tune in, all that
stuff and then you adjust
all your settings there.
- Something I'm noticing is,
this is really quick and responsive.
- Oh yeah, it's super fast.
- One thing that I think a
lot of people are wondering
about and this is something
when I first drove in it
as well, was something that
was like oh not so sure,
is having all of your speed
and everything all on this
side but it's not actually
that annoying, I feel like
you can get used to having your spedometer
and your mileage and
all that kind of stuff
right off to the side.
- It's right in your
peripheral as you're driving,
you can see it right there.
- There are some weird
things with the software
in the model three,
including the fact that
you have to use the screen
to open the glovebox.
So will you show us the wonderful process
of opening our glovebox?
There it is.
- But the thing I like
about this is the less
you have, the more you
realize what you don't need.
- Right.
- Which I think is a very fantastic thing,
like having all these
buttons and knobs everywhere
are nice but how often
do you actually use them,
once they're taken away
you realize oh not that
often, but this is a fun thing, which is
I wonder if this one
could be considered more
design over practicality,
but the fact that
there is no way to
actually adjust the airflow
with your hand here,
physically, you have to do
it this way, which it's a little weird,
I think it looks cool.
- Well if you're on auto
pilot here, which we can't try
'cause we're on a little canyon road, but.
- But autopilot I can say
having driven autopilot
one point oh with my S and autopilot
two point five with this, it's great.
Let's just say we're going
to the Beverly Hills Cancer
Center, which is a lovely place,
but if you're going there, our navigation
will pop up over here, and that's okay,
but when you're driving
you then have to look
all the way across this to here, and
that's kind of a bummer, and if you did
let's say we're driving
and it goes you know what,
you're gonna get there
with negative five percent,
it'll automatically route
you to a supercharger
on the way, so it'll
make sure you don't die,
well your battery doesn't die.
And you have your charger
here so you can set your
charging unit, I have it set all the way
for a trip 'cause we were
driving a lot but you
generally want to have it
right at the bottom of that.
So you don't do it all the way.
So use for roadtrip,
charging will take longer,
daily driving needs.
- After spending the day
with the model three,
I gotta say I'm a lot more impressed than
I thought I'd be, of course huge shoutout
to my good buddy Jake from
Vsauce three for lending
me your wonderful
vehicle to do a video on.
You should definitely go to check out
Vsauce three and Beam and
J Cooper and all the other
wonderful projects you worked on.
I feel like you have a
specific outro, my friend.
- I do.
- Shall we do it together?
- Yes, are you ready?
- Yes.
- And as always, thanks for watching.
- Was that cool or was that
not cool, I don't know.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
