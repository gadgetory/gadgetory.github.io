the most popular game in the world right
now take one look at which and you'll
see hundreds of thousands of people
watching streams at any given time now
that actually got me curious because
fort night is available on such a wide
range of hardware everything from
high-end gaming pcs to consoles to even
smartphones can you actually run it on
some slightly unusual things like a two
hundred dollar laptop at first glance
things look pretty promising for
tonight's minimum requirements only need
an intel HD 4000 GPU aka integrated
graphics on a laptop from 2013 which I
think should be pretty doable but we're
gonna be pushing the limits here so to
start with we're going to try four night
running on the iPhone 10 now it's
impressive here is that actually looks
pretty much like for night everywhere
else you've got your menu if you got
pretty much everything else that you
want to have unlike a lot of other
free-to-play games on the phone my first
impressions are that this is really
really good looking for a game on the
phone now I'm sure as we take a look at
some higher-end pcs you'll be able to
see more differences but I mean this is
pretty much the full game you're not
really losing a whole lot of anything
here probably the biggest problem with
Fortnight mobile are the controls now
it's not that bad especially if you can
kind of get used to some touchscreen
controls you'll probably be fine but it
is definitely not going to be as nice as
with a controller or especially with a
mouse and keyboard what's cool about
this addition is that it actually does
support cross play so in theory right
now I can be playing with people on PC
on Xbox or on phone next up we have the
full PC experience so this is the Acer
predator Helios 300 a roughly $1000
laptop with pretty beefy specs including
a core i7 as well as a full nvidia gtx
1060 immediately you can tell there is a
huge difference here smelling are we
playing at 1080p on epic settings but
we're getting a pretty respectable 70
frames per second or so right now don't
get me wrong there's nothing necessarily
wrong with the mobile experience but
there is a pretty big difference when
you jump up to the PC honestly probably
one of the biggest things is just a
better control scrimmage so even though
you have the Ultra PC experience doesn't
necessarily mean you're actually going
to be any good at Fortnight but I will
say there is a big difference in playing
something like this versus the phone or
as you'll see in a minute some of the
lower end systems this really is kind of
the way that fortnight is meant to be
played next up we have the Xbox 1s now
this is going to give you a good idea of
what the lower end of consoles are
capable of so this is the least powerful
ps4 ps4 pro as well as Xbox 1x are all
going to give you better performance and
especially better resolution but you are
still getting 60 frames per second on
the console and if this looks a little
bit different to you it's because this
is our portable Xbox one that's set up
you guys want the full information on
this link is in the description so what
you're getting here is that full 60
frames per second experience but at
lower settings some of the most
noticeable things is going to be the
resolution so this is running somewhere
in the neighborhood of 720p it looks
fine that's not going to be super sharp
especially if you're playing on a high
res 4k TV
that being said especially you're
playing on a smaller monitor like this
it looks totally fine and I can't stress
enough that 60 frames per second option
is a huge huge deal it really does add
so much fluidity to the game and it
makes it feel a lot more competitive
versus slightly less performing options
not that I'm hinting toward what the
other things in this video are going to
do I'm really impressed with just how
much optimization that they've done on
this game it's crazy the epic has made a
single title that can scale everything
from a phone to an Xbox OS this is bad
this is why are we all why are we all in
here no yeah next up we have something a
little bit more interesting this is the
Acer Aspire 5 and it's $600 this is by
far my favorite gaming laptop I've ever
tried so for that money you're getting
not only a Core i5
but you're also getting a pretty decent
NVIDIA MX 150 graphics card performance
wise this is actually pretty similar to
what you're getting on Xbox so right now
we're running on medium settings at 720p
now we're getting a pretty stable
lock-on 60 frames per second sometimes
during the action we'll dip a little bit
below that but it is surprising at how
close you can get to a full console
experience on what is a pretty budget
gaming laptop the only problem with a
game like pub G or fortnight is that
everyone is so good that I feel really
really terrible so
yeah now my friends it's time to take a
trip to the danger zone
so far we've been playing on things that
are actually meant to play the game
however fortnight can be run on very
very low settings so this is the 2017 LG
gran the idea here is that this is by no
means a gaming laptop instead this is
very much an ultrabook
and that she does have pretty decent
specs with eight gigs of ram and the
brand-new 8th gen core i7 processor
however graphics not exactly the strong
suit here now no one is going to buy an
ultra walk for gaming but it's
interesting to see how something like
this is going to perform it might seem
weird to try to play a game on an
ultrabook
but to be fair a lot of people do have
this class of hardware and might be
interested in trying fortnight the good
news is it's playable the bad news is
it's not going to be particularly pretty
so first of all you're gonna want to
crank your settings down all the way
down so right now I'm playing on the
lowest settings possible at 600 P and
getting somewhere around 30 frames per
second like here I'm walking around not
even a particularly challenging scene
worth I ain't empowering in the high 20s
it's gonna be playable but it's
definitely not going to be a great
experience so far we've seen a pretty
wide range of hardware to play on
fortnight but my real question is can we
play it on a 200 laptop so this is the
HP stream 800 dollar laptop with some
incredibly low hand specs so we've got
an Intel Celeron and 30-60 processor 4
gigs of ram and exactly no dedicated
graphics of any kind see here what do we
got we got 480p on low I'm gonna tell
you guess and say that's going to be too
high well they'd be nice things about
for tonight though is you can completely
adjust it all the way down to 360p I
like how your avatar in the game is like
18 pixels right now really fills me with
confidence
joining server alright tag placing
fortnight on a $200 PC this is not gonna
go well okay we're actually in the game
right now and that looks hilarious but
we're getting a solid 14 frames per
second
um okay I mean the game is actually
playing it's not crashing it's uh
there's some like pixels on the screen
there's like seven or eight of them it's
fine
no big deal oh okay we froze we froze
that's fine that's fine I'm sure you'll
come back oh okay we're back I guess it
didn't freeze after all Oh what what is
this is this supposed to be a tower
all right froze again it was funny huh
so you look at something like this this
looks like a giant blob of pixels
however this the tree actually doesn't
look that bad it's like any time I look
at a tree my framerate immediately tanks
I've looked down like you know the
ground or something it's fine or look at
this stupid Shack which oh wait it just
popped in a new texture oh wow okay so
it's now no longer garbage town great
okay so can you play fortnight I like
200 a computer yes should you absolutely
not
so I'm gonna say that fortnight actually
runs pretty well as long as you don't
try to you know push its capabilities a
little bit too far I'm curious what do
you guys play fortnight on let me know
in the comments below and I will catch
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
