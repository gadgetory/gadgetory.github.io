here with a review of the Nintendo Game
Boy light as the first Gameboy with a
backlit screen it's definitely
interesting so let's take a look this
was a Japanese only release from 1998
and was mostly based on the Gameboy
pocket comparing the two you'll see the
light is both taller and a bit thicker
up front you'll find the same 2.5 inch
monochrome display with a resolution of
160 by 144 as this is still a Game Boy
it will play all original Gameboy cards
but not the newer Game Boy Color games
in fact the Game Boy Color is the reason
why the light never made it outside of
Japan when it launched the original Game
Boy was coming up on its ninth birthday
and the color proceeded to be released
only six months later effectively
killing the light before it even got
started that said it was still a
solution to one of the biggest drawbacks
to game boys the lack of the lip screen
anyone playing game boys and the 90s can
attest to the black hole like tendency
of gameboy screens to suck in light
while still being dark with the light
you've got an electroluminescent
backlight which gives a fairly dim and
green light but it is still playable in
the dark beyond the screen it's a normal
Game Boy you can still use it without
the backlight to improve the battery
life and the addition of double A
batteries means the rear get some grips
which are actually fairly comfortable
unfortunately you can still run into
ghosting issues on the display but
overall it's still a solid choice and a
great game boy they are a bit hard to
get your hands on these days as most are
still in Japan and cost quite a bit more
than ordinary game boys but regardless
they're definitely an interesting look
how Nintendo was working on a lit screen
years before they hit the mainstream if
you enjoyed definitely be sure to leave
a thumbs up if you're interested in more
