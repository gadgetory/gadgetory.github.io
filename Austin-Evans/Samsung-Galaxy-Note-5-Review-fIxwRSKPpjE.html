line has always been popular but how
does the note 5 stack up it first looks
like a big improvement instead of
plastic and fake leather you'll find the
same aluminum and glass that works so
well on the galaxy s6 there's a new
curved rear and while it's subtle it
does a lot to make such a large phone
easier to use all that glass can make
the note a little slippery though which
is why I'm marking a skin from deep
brand there are several options to
customize the phone without resorting to
a case which is great because the note 5
feels every bit as expensive as the
price tag suggests unfortunately the
premium bill comes with a few trade-offs
the removable back is gone which means
you can't swap the battery and there's
no microSD card slot with 32 gigabytes
of storage standard the lack of microSD
isn't a huge issue but the battery is
now 3000 milliamp hours which is
actually slightly smaller than the note
4 it's enough to get most people through
a full day but it still Falls a bit
short of phones like the iPhone 6 plus
it's a bit of a shame since the note
line has always been geared toward power
users but the nicer build is likely
worth the trade-off what really
separates the note from other large
phones is the s-pen it now pops out with
one seriously satisfying click as far as
styluses go this is hard to beat there's
almost no lag which paired with the
pressure sensitivity means that writing
on the note is actually fun pop out the
S Pen with the screen locked and it
automatically opens up a new note so you
can jot down something quickly there is
one slight flaw put the S pin in
backward and not only will you likely
get it stuck but you'll probably break
something - oops my buddy Don did a
great article on 95 Google taking a look
at what happens if you put the S Pen in
backward but the TL DR is just don't do
it seriously the rest of the hardware is
nicely laid out the power button on the
right side and volume rocker on the left
is nice and comfortable and the micro
USB and headphone jack on the bottom
which is the way to go you won't find an
IR blaster for controlling a TV like the
note 4 and s6 but you can still measure
your heart rate and blood oxygen level
which pair with s health makes the note
a good workout trackers there's also a
fingerprint scanner built into the home
button which works decently but it's not
quite as accurate as I'd like nothing
takes a couple tries to unlock for me
hands down one of the best features on
note 5 is the screen with a big 5.7 inch
display and 1440p resolution this is
about as sharp as screens get colors are
absolutely on point and since it's an
Imola display you get top-notch contrast
it also gets impressively bright even
when outside the only thing I can
complain about is a slight bit of color
shifting at an angle but that's about
the only thing to nitpick the note 5
absolutely sets the bar for smartphone
displays the same phrase doesn't quite
apply to the software though it's
running android 5.1 lollipop and like
the s6 Samsung was much more reserved
from making changes there are a few edit
apps but they're useful for the most
part I'm still not a fan of TouchWiz but
use another launcher or download a skin
and it's totally usable multi-window can
actually be pretty useful for running a
couple apps side by side and with a
whopping 4 gigabytes of RAM the note
does a good job of multitasking although
it's hard to say how much of a
difference the extra memory actually
makes the rest of the specs are no joke
with the same 8 core Exynos CPU from the
s6 delivering one of the fastest mobile
processors out there and the graphics
are also top-notch which is helpful as
you need some serious horsepower to push
a 1440p screen in the real world there's
more than enough power to handle the
best-looking games out there and normal
tasks are absolutely no problem also
carried-over is the 16 megapixel camera
from the galaxy s6 it remains one of the
best in the business with lots of detail
and good color low-light can be a bit of
a challenge as it's a bit slow and tends
to overexpose in darker areas but this
is easily one of the best cameras on a
phone out there video was solid as well
1080p footage is rock-solid for a phone
with nice detail while you can shoot in
4k the stabilization makes things look a
little like jello the Galaxy Note 5
takes what made the s6 great and has a
bigger screen in the useful s-pen the
battery could be slightly better and I'd
appreciate it closer to stock build of
Android but the note 5 is hands-down one
of the best phones you can buy stay
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
