here with a review and giveaway of the
splash vapor flex case for the iPod
Touch 5th generation with almost no
cases out right now for the new iPod
let's take a look at the Flex to see if
it's any good the package is easy enough
to get into just pop the side and pull
the case out pull off the comically
wrong looking cardboard insert and we
have the case itself this is the blank
version and as you can see it's
partially transparent as this is a TPU
case installation is a breeze
insert one side of your iPod and then
press the other two sides in until they
pop into place you can see a bit of the
original color through the case with two
cutouts for the camera and loop on the
back the case has two textures a smooth
rubber on the sides and a more durable
plastic on the back which feels quite
nice on the bottom you'll see cutouts
for your speaker lightning port which
has plenty of clearance for the cable as
well as your headphone jack flip it over
and you'll see there's a nice lay on the
table design allowing you to put your
iPod facedown without worrying about
scratching the screen one issue I have
with the iPod Touch 5 is the camera
protrudes a bit from the back
however this protects that and gives
plenty of room for the flash and
microphone there's also a cutout to use
the loop which technically works but
it's a real pain to attach it and said
if you don't ever use the loop it
shouldn't be an issue
the buttons are covered in a bit stiff
but it's easy enough to access your
volume and sleep-wake without much
trouble
overall the vapor flex is a solid fairly
thin case that keeps your iPod protected
while still looking sharp if you guys
are interested in winning one hit up the
link in the description and post a
comment saying what color you want in a
week I'll randomly pick a winner and
ship your case out to you if you're
interested more feel free to check out

button and subscribe for more anyway I
will catch you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
