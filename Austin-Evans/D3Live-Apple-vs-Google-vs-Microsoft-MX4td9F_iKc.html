episode of d3 live so guys today as
always we will be talking about a tech
topic and this time I'm going to go
ahead and go over a big one it's going
to be Apple versus Google or as
Microsoft you guys you know a lot of
people will get a lot of questions a lot
of people say no Google's gonna you know
beat both of them and you know Apple is
the best whatever but you know it's not
like a straight-up war I mean you know
it's not like no Mac versus PC or you
know chrome person an explorer or safari
guys all three of these companies are
huge and they compete on a very very
large level each of them have many many
different products and now on phones web
browsers search you know computer
operating systems a computer hardware I
mean guys there's a huge amount of
different things that they're you know
competing in so basically I'm going to
go ahead and do is kind of go over a few
of the you know a few of their
categories I'm also going to go ahead
give you guys my opinions on you know
who's leaving where and all that kind of
stuff I'm so guys let's going to start
with probably one of the you know more
bigger topics lately which is phones now
all three of them are really big into
phones right now we have Apple which of
course has the iPhone you know the next
iPhone will be coming out here in the
next couple days
there's iPhone OS 4 which will be coming
out Apple's really really big and phones
guys right now I mean it's it's there's
no doubt they are huge in phones
Google's also we're getting really big
into phones they have Android and
Android there are I mean looks like
every other day it seems like there's
another Android phone coming out I mean
a lot of them are really unique take for
example the HTC EVO 4G it is probably
one of the best phones on the market now
it runs Android and then of course we
have Microsoft with Windows Phone 7
Windows Phone 7 will not be out actually
until the end of the year and really
guys windows mobile 6.5 is nothing to
talk about really one seven comes out is
when everybody's gonna really start
looking to Microsoft and Microsoft has a
pretty good looking system right here I
mean the phones are all going to be have
to be I believe all Snapdragon
processors are better gonna have a very
very cool UI in Windows Phone 7 and you
know they've got a really good
thing going I think um now which one
will win you know I don't really see in
the phone market I'll see a winner
I mean you know a winner might be
fifteen percent market share and a plug
in a field of light you know five or six
or seven different people so I mean you
know you don't have to be a winner to
you know make a ton of money and you
know get a lot of good products out but
I will say that the iPhone is looking
almost unstoppable I mean yeah Android
is really picking up a lot of speed and
there are a lot of phones that Android
just you know it with Android that's
just fantastic but you know the iPhone
is a big big deal everybody knows the
iPhone I mean it's not like you know
when you see an app it's made for the
iPhone it's not like an Android phone
where it can be on 50 different Android
devices and might run differently and
stuff I mean Apple is really on top of
game so I don't see that's the Angelyn
continued to go up as the Windows Phone
would be doing pretty good that I really
don't think iPhones going away or you
know is going to start losing out to you
to them um so the next thing we want to
talk about is browsers of course all
three of them have their own browser
Microsoft obviously has in an explorer
Apple has Safari and Google has chrome
um guys this one's a lot shorter and I
think it's pretty clear that chrome is
an just a great browser I mean you got
Chrome on all platform age of platforms
Windows Mac and Linux and it's a really
really great browser it's fast its
secure and it's got a really really
streamlined interface as I mentioned the
fact that Google has really been you
know plugging it they've really been you
know advertising it they've really been
you know doing a lot of work to continue
to improve it and I explore have been
bad cheers guys and in explorer 9 will
be coming out later I'm surrounded early
next year and it should be better but to
be honest until we see more we just had
a few preview bills I'm not gonna mean
base 9 X 4 8 &amp;amp; 7 &amp;amp; 6
they're all just not very good at all I
don't really see them jumping up ahead
chrome anytime soon Safari actually my
Safari 5 actually might be coming
here in the next couple days so the
rumors say and you'll actually have a
few good features that might be good but
again Safari is a very good-looking
brother especially on the Mac side it
looks really nice with you know the
Cover Flow and everything but it's not
there's nothing to know that's special
about it
I mean add-ons Firefox and Chrome does
better speed chrome and opera can do
better you know I mean it's just not a
great browser in my opinion so again I
say Google you know and the late here
now next room excuse me guys next we're
gonna go ahead and go to you know
operating systems for computers now
again all three of these guys are
getting in on this one now obviously
guys Microsoft is huge right now with
you know windows I believe not about 90%
of computers these days when you buy
will have windows on it and you know
there's a reason for that
one others a really solid operating
system Vista hmm this wasn't as bad as a
lot of people say but it still wasn't
that great but Windows 7 really does
solid I mean honestly guys I use Windows
7 and it is probably the best OS I've
ever used it's solid it looks great it's
smooth it's fast I mean I can't say
enough about it it's an excellent
operating system but you know there's a
lot to be said about Apple and OS 10 OS
10 has a lot of you know a lot of people
love OS 10 and for a good reason I mean
it doesn't have as many viruses although
and anything if it's technology
anything get a virus really so I mean I
hate when people say no extra your
viruses they don't get them as often
okay I mean but that's just a little pet
peeve of mine you know OS 10 is a really
good operating system as long as Apple
doesn't take their eyes off of the Mac
side and you know because iPhones
getting so huge right now if they start
taking away from Mac to go to the iPhone
and I can see that mean Mac might go
down pretty fast
you know because obviously Windows is
you know continuing to climb and you
know chrome is going to be working with
Google so if as long as Apple continues
to focus on the Mac side continues to
innovate continues really
get some good stuff in and I'll say
you're not going anywhere they might not
jump up in your beat windows immediately
as long as they can keep you know a lot
of people who love it and you know as
long as I keep putting out a decent
operating system I don't see them having
any problems now we come over to Chrome
chrome of course is coming out later
this year with Chrome OS which is a it
was just one of the most unique
operating systems it's in its simplicity
guys Chrome OS is basically a browser
that's it it's the Chrome browser
basically but instead of you running it
on Windows or running on Mac it's going
to be that's the entire thing charge
computer Chrome opens up you trough your
your chrome closes that's the whole
thing now the way they intend to do this
is very well it's a very kind of
google-like approach it's going to be
focused on the internet now the internet
of course you know I would say that's
what a huge majority of the time you're
on a computer you want get on the
Internet I mean that's the way a lot of
people are that's what the way I am and
so Chrome OS is one really focused on
this it's going to be based on Chrome
and so it's gonna be pretty secure in
the fact that it's not like you know
you're running a bunch of different
things it's Chrome ok there's not like
you know you're having apps and this and
that you're just running Chrome and you
know a cool thing is it's going to have
a lot of things such as web apps and
stuff they'll actually run very
similarly to you know how a normal
computer would run know for example
Gmail is very similar to you know a lot
of like email clients well of course you
know Chrome OS will support that but
they really plan on ranking it up and
with html5 they can go ahead and you
know write video editors photo editors a
lot of more in-depth stuff that you
would expect that you can burn your
browser and you know the really good
thing about this is that even though
this stuff might be made for Chrome OS
it should run on any computer with a
modern browser so guys I see a lot of
you know ups and downs with Chrome OS
you know of course you can't run a lot
of your own stuff on there it's got to
be you know up on the internet and
really guys if you're if you have Chrome
OS computer and you're not connect to
the internet you're really not gonna be
able to do a whole lot so I don't see
Chrome OS instantly you know taking up a
huge bunch of market share people use
so I just really continue to see Windows
I don't see any time in X several years
windows all sudden you know start people
quit using it but I just do see some
pluses and Mac and Google so we'll just
kind of have to wait and see about that
okay guys so now for the second part of
d3 live which is taking live Skype calls
I'm doing this all in front of blog TV
and I got a bunch of people who are
calling in on skype so let's go ahead
take a few questions
hello are you there thank to you are you
there yeah
hey what's question man yeah
I'm sorry my question is do you see
Apple making their own search engine
that's not such a good question um I
don't think he would be that bad of an
idea but you know just taking it off of
the conference the other day with Steve
Jobs he actually said that you know
Google search is something that other
people like Google do well and he
basically just said that's not something
we're interested in getting into I don't
I'm not so sure that that would change
in the future but for the month for the
moment I don't want to see that
happening but you know we never you
never know you have any more questions
or oh all right well hey thanks for
calling okay
hello are you there yeah oh hey man
what's wrong go ahead my first one is um
you know what um the issues tablet when
it's gonna be a real estate well they're
three of them the the 101 the 121 or the
touchscreen eReader thing I mean the
world running Windows 7 um I believe
they said that one would be coming out
the first quarter of next year so it'll
probably be a while but yeah I believe
they said first quarter next year okay
my next question is um I've been a
system
sure so what I'll be able to trade that
in to get like a discount or something
um probably not usually they'll do those
kind of things but if you had that you
do have a computer if you want to you of
course you could sell it on eBay or
whatever you wanted to and get some
money like that I don't think they would
have an official program to do that oh
and my last question is you know what
the release date for the android 2.0 is
that's our yep 2.2 um it's not out
looking is gonna be an official release
date it'll come out on different phones
and different times
um a lot of phones are getting it
they're like people are hacking it onto
there
I believe the Nexus One and the Droid or
is gonna be the two first runs that will
get them and I should be broke soon but
I would expect you in the next couple
months that you would see it start Froyo
to start rolling out all kinds of
thoughts my final question oh not really
a tech question but I was wondering if
you could do a shout-out to me or
something okay what's your name on
YouTube
43 eyes okay well there's your shadow
right there thanks for calling
okay bye okay let's go ahead and go
ahead and get another call so if you
guys won't go ahead and call in hello
max are you there yeah making video
what's going on you got a question
yeah any smartphone that's in the market
right now
that's a great question um you need to
be honest I don't know I don't know if I
was buying a smartphone right now I
would absolutely wait until Monday to
see what the next iPhones all about
we know a lot about it but I just
couldn't buy a phone now until I see
because you never know what they're
gonna add but they're if I was gonna buy
one today
it'll probably would be the HTC EVO 4G
that is a just a crazy phone I mean you
have 4G you got Android you've got a
Snapdragon processor you got a front
facing camera a huge screen I mean it's
there's so much bad to like you know
ain't no problem best call in
let's go ahead and take a look at the
next question oh hello are you there hey
which question oh yeah yeah I got you
it's me I was wondering where do you see
technology in five years oh man that's a
hard question I don't think that what I
see technology in one year
uh I see a lot more focus on the
Internet
I see a lot more I see you know Chrome
OS I think that's gonna be a bigger
thing I don't know if it'll actually be
Chrome OS itself but I see a lot more
data being going out to the cloud I see
a lot more computers getting a lot
faster but also a lot more focused on
just getting on the internet just you
know not not running a bunch of you know
like windows up today runs a lot of
stuff but I see a lot of it can be
focused down and just solely on the
internet you know I also see lots of
getting thinner and smaller and faster
but you know that's the kind of normal
stuff that you know always happens any
other questions or I don't know that's
it thanks okay
thanks for question ok let's go ahead
and get another call here hello are you
there hey you metal train going down
just a little bit okay okay where's
question okay dad can do just fine oh
okay um well Modern Warfare 2 is a good
game I mean there's no doubt that's a
very very good game but I like halo
played for a while I'm not a huge fan of
either to be honest I like a lot about
it I like to kind of tend to like you
know like fall out you know like
open-world games but I got to go with
halo I mean there's there's no beat good
match of Halo you know it
I don't know man my xbox been breaking
so much lately I don't know if I'm gonna
spend all that money to get it and then
it'll break again
well hey thanks the question thank you
okay hello are you there okay three
questions or more so the first question
ease
bujji sees the leader in gary the moment
Xbox Live or PSN network right now I
think Xbox Live I mean you know the
service is great and there's a lot of
features that you don't get on PSN but
you know if a lot of the rumors were
true about PSN premium I can see that
jumping ahead of Xbox Live I mean you
know be able to get you know like free
demos of any game being able to download
playstation original PlayStation games I
think that could be a pretty good thing
yeah it's also that yes and what the
premium stuff for means now nothing
November believe it like to see what
some people found some YouTube in night
so nice and for thousands of a person's
house oh yeah definitely yeah I mean
yeah right so a second question
he's a you see the lead research bingo
Google I know Google is bottom this is
what you think yeah Google no doubt Bing
has a nice interface but yeah I just
find that when I'm searching I've tried
bang I mean I actually used it for a
couple weeks
they're just comparing it and it just
doesn't seem as accurate I don't know if
it's just because I'm used to exactly
how Google works and you know when you
see things a little different I mean if
Google wasn't around I think everybody
okay with Bing but Google just see it's
faster in my opinion any everything just
loads and stuff almost and the results
just seem to be better you know
yeah and my third question Matt well the
last question really got and what what
do you think he's the best that Booker
me likes these sizes because I'm a lot
of filmer for YouTube and only got
stream flows but I'm still
sure what's it really so well it depends
on I mean a lot of it depends on your
budget I mean you know if you don't know
if you don't have the budget like a 15
or 17 inch to the 13 would probably be
okay but really I think the sweet spot
right now is the 15 inch with the core
i7 processor if you had the money for it
that's gonna be a really powerful it's
probably want to be the the most
powerful Mac's around shorter maybe like
the iMac or the MacBook Pro I mean it
started the Mac Pro I mean you get the
core i7 but it's also a pretty decent
size I mean that would probably be able
to you know halo a lot yeah cuz always
I've always that probably is choosing
products from that falafel I've been
thinking where the iPhone would like to
get an angel phone and this has been my
biggest one to think about oh yeah no
problem thanks to the call okay let's go
ahead and take one more call here guys
hello are you there oh I'm exhausted
okay let's try one more real quick here
