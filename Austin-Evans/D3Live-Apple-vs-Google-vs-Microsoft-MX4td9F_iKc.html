episode of d3 live so guys today as
always we will be talking about a tech
topic and this time I'm going to go
ahead and go over a big one it's going
to be Apple versus Google or just
microsoft guys you know a lot of people
will get a lot of questions a lot of
people say no Google's going to you know
beat both of them and you know Apple is
the best whatever but you know it's not
like a straight-up war i mean you know
it's not like no Mac versus PC or you
know chrome vs internet explorer or
safari guys all three of these companies
are huge and they compete on a very very
large level each of them have many many
different products and our phones web
browsers search you know computer
operating systems a computer hardware I
mean guys there's a huge amount of
different things that there are no
competing in so basically I'm going to
go ahead and do is kind of go over a few
of the you know a few of their
categories I'm also going to go ahead
give you get my opinions on you know
who's leading where and all that kind of
stuff I'm so guys let's go ahead and
start with probably one of the you know
more bigger topics lately which is
phones now all three of them are really
big into phones right now we have apple
which of course has the iphone you know
the next iPhone will be coming out here
in the next couple days there's iphone
OS 4 which will be coming out Apple's
really really big and phones guys right
now I mean it's not there is no doubt
they are huge in phones Google is also
getting really big into phones they have
Android and Android there are I mean
looks like every other day it seems like
there's another android phone coming out
I mean a lot of them are really unique
take for example the HTC evo 4g it is
probably one of the best phones on the
market now it runs Android and then of
course we have Microsoft with Windows
Phone 7 Windows Phone 7 will not be out
actually until the end of the year and
really guys windows mobile 6.5 is
nothing to talk about really 17 comes
out is when everybody's going to start
looking to Microsoft and Microsoft has a
pretty good looking system right here I
mean the phones are all going to be have
to be I believe all snapdragon
processors are better going to have a
very very cool UI in Windows Phone 7 and
you know they've got a really good
than going I think um now which one will
win you know I don't really see in the
phone market I'll see a winner I mean
you know a winner might be fifteen
percent market share and i plug in a
field like you know five or six or seven
different people so I mean you know you
don't have to be a winner to you know
make a ton of money and you know get a
lot of good products out but I will say
that the iphone is looking almost
unstoppable I mean yeah android is
really picking up a lot of speed and
there are a lot of phones that Android
just you know it with Android and just
fantastic but you know the iphone is a
big big deal everybody knows the iphone
I mean it's not like you know when you
see a nap it's made for the iphone it's
not like an android phone where it can
be on 50 different android devices and
might run differently and stuff I mean
Apple is really on top of the game so I
don't see that's the Android continue to
go up as the windows phone be doing
pretty good that I really don't think I
phone's going away or you know is going
to start losing out to them um so the
next thing we want to talk about is
browsers of course all further than have
their own browser well Microsoft
obviously has internet explorer Apple
has Safari and google has chrome um guys
this one's a lot shorter and I think
it's pretty clear that chrome isn't just
a great browser I mean you got Chrome on
all platforms windows mac and linux and
it's a really really great browsers fast
it's secure and it's got a really really
streamlined interface as mentioned the
fact that Google has really been you
know plugging it they've really been you
know advertising it they've really been
you know doing a lot of work to continue
to improve it and I explore have been
bad cheers guys an explorer 9 will be
coming out late or rather early next
year and it should be better but to be
honest until we see more we just had a
few preview build I'm not going to mean
based on an eight for eight and seven
and six you're all just not very good at
all I don't really see them jumping up
ahead of chrome anytime soon Safari
actually my safari five actually might
be coming
here in the next couple days so the
rumors say and the alleged you have a
few good features that might be good but
again Safari is a very good-looking
brother especially on the mac side it
looks really nice with you know the
cover flow and everything but it's not
there's nothing to know that's special
about it I mean add-ons firefox and
chrome does better speed chrome and
opera do better you know I mean it's
just not a great browser in my opinion
so again I said Google you know and the
late here now next room excuse me guys
next we're gonna go ahead and go to you
know operating systems for computers now
again all three of these guys are
getting in on this one now obviously
guys Microsoft is huge right now with
you no windows no I believe not about
ninety percent of computers these days
when you buy will have windows on it and
you know there's a reason for that one
of those a really solid operating system
vista mmm this wasn't as bad as law of
people say but it still wasn't that
great but windows 7 really just solid I
mean honestly guys I use windows 7 and
it is probably the best bruhs OS I've
ever used it's solid it looks great it's
smooth it's fast i mean i can't say
enough about it's an excellent operating
system but you know there's a lot to be
said about apple and OS 10 OS 10 has a
lot of you know a lot of people love OS
10 and for a good reason I mean it
doesn't have as many viruses although
anything if its technology anything get
a virus really so I mean I hate when
people say Marik's don't get viruses
they don't give them as often okay I
mean but that's just a little pet peeve
of mine you know OS 10 is a really good
operating system as long as apple
doesn't take their eyes off of the mac
side and Neil because I phone is getting
so huge right now if they start taking
away from Mac to do it to the iphone and
I can see that mean Mac might go down
pretty fast you know because obviously
Windows is you know continuing to climb
and you know chrome is going to be
working with Google so if as long as
apple continues to focus on max I'd
continues to innovate can you just
really
get some good stuff in and I'll say you
not going anywhere they might not jump
up in your big windows immediately as
long as they can keep you know a lot of
people who love it and you know as long
as I keep putting out a decent operating
system mount see them having any
problems now we come over to chrome
chrome of course is coming out later
this year with chrome OS which is a
which is one of the most unique
operating systems it's in its simplicity
guys chrome OS is basically a browser
that's it the chrome browser basically
but instead of running it on windows
running on Mac it's going to be that's
the entire thing charge computer chrome
opens up you drop your your chrome
closes that's the whole thing now the
way they intend to do this is very well
it's a very kind of Google like approach
it's going to be focused on the internet
now the internet of course you know i
would say that's what a huge majority of
the time you're on computer you want
down the internet I mean that's the way
a lot of people are that's what the way
I am and so Chrome OS is when we really
focused on this it's going to be based
on chrome and so it's going to be pretty
secure in the fact that it's not like
you know you're running a bunch of
different things it's Chrome okay
there's not like you know you're having
apps and this and that you're just
running chrome and you know a cool thing
is it's going to have a lot of things
such as web apps and stuff they'll
actually run very similarly to you know
how a normal computer will run know for
example gmail is very similar to you
know a lot of like the email clients
well of course you know chrome OS will
support that but they really plan on
ramping it up and with html5 they can go
ahead and you know right video editors
photo editors a lot of more in-depth
stuff that you would expect that you can
bring your browser and you know the
really good thing about this is that
even though this stuff might be made for
chromeless it should run on any computer
with a modern browser so guys I see a
lot of you know ups and downs with
chrome OS you know of course you can't
run a lot of your own stuff on there
it's got to be you know up on the
internet and really guys if you're all
if you have chrome OS computer and
you're not connect to the internet
you're wrong i'm going to be able to do
a whole lot so I don't see Chrome OS
instantly you know taking up a huge
bunch of market share people
using it so I just really continue to
see windows I don't see any time in next
several years windows all sudden you
know start people quit using it but I
just do see some pluses and mac and
Google so we'll just kind of have to
wait and see about that ok guys so now
for the second part of d3 live which is
taking live Skype calls I'm doing this
all in front of blog TV and I got a
bunch of people who are calling on skype
so let's go ahead take a few questions
hello are you there take to you buddy
there yeah hey what's question man yeah
I'm sorry I my question is do you see
Apple making their own search engine
that's not such a good question um I
don't think he would be that bad of an
idea but you know just taking it off of
the conference the other day with Steve
Jobs he actually said that you know
google searches something that other
people like Google do well and he
basically just said that's not something
we're interested in getting into I don't
I'm not so sure that that would change
in the future but for the month for the
moment I don't really see that happening
but you know we never you never know you
have any more questions or oh alright
well hey thanks for calling ok hello are
you there yeah squeeze your ass again oh
hey man what's 10 I am like three
questions go ahead um my first one is um
you know what um the Asus tablet when
it's gonna be a real estate well done 3
of them the the 101 the 121 or the that
that touchscreen ereader thing I mean
the world running Windows 7 um I believe
they said uh that one would be coming
out the first quarter of next year so
it'll probably be a while but yeah I
believe they said first quarter next
year ok my next question is um
the nicest computer so will not be able
to trade that into I get like a discount
or something um probably not usually
they don't do those kind of things but
if you had that you do have a computer
if you want to you of course you can
sell it on eBay or whatever you wanted
to and get some money like that I don't
think they would have an official
program to do that oh and my last
question is you know what the release
date for that Android to point is I
that's already up I make 2.2 2.2 um it's
not outlet is going to be official
release date it'll come out on different
phones different times a lot of phones
were getting it there like people are
hacking it on to their i believe the
nexus one and the droid is going to be
the two first ones that will get them an
extra deep throat soon but i would
expect you in the next couple months
that you would see it start froyo to
start rolling out all kinds of phones at
my final question oh it's not really a
tech question but i was wondering if you
to do a shout out to me or something
okay what's your name on youtube 43 eyes
okay well there's your shadow right
there thanks for calling okay bye okay
let's go ahead and go ahead and get
another call so if you guys won't go
ahead and call in hello max are you
there yeah what's going on making video
what's going on you got a question oh
yeah if you give any smartphone that's
in the market right now which would it
be that's a great question um need to be
honest i don't know i don't know if i
was buying a smartphone right now i
would absolutely wait until Monday to
see what the next iphone is all about we
know a lot about it but I just couldn't
buy a phone or now until I see because
you never know what they're going to add
but there if I was gonna buy one today
it will probably would be the HTC evo 4g
that is a just a crazy phone I mean you
have 4g you got android you got a
snapdragon processor you got a front
facing camera a huge screen I mean it's
there so much bad too like you know you
know yeah that's all right well thank
you answer my question hey no problem
thanks for calling
let's go ahead and take a look at the
next question oh hello are you there hey
which question oh yeah yeah I've got you
oh it's me hidden to me oh and i was
wondering where do you see technology
and five years oh man that's a hard
question i don't know what i see
technology in one year ah i see a lot
more focus on the internet i see a lot
more um I see you know chrome OS I think
that's going to be a bigger thing I know
if it will actually be Chrome OS itself
but I'd see a lot more data being going
out to the cloud I see a lot more
computers getting a lot faster but also
a lot more focused on just getting on
the internet just you know not not
running a bunch of you know like windows
broke up today runs a lot of stuff but I
say a lot of it can be focused down and
just solely on the Internet you know I
also see lots of getting thinner and
smaller and faster but you know that's
the kind of normal stuff that you know
always happens any other questions or I
don't know that's it thanks okay thanks
for question okay let's go ahead and get
another call here hello are you there
yeah woman hear me hey you might wanna
turn you're going down just a little bit
okay okay which question okay can you
hear me yeah can you use fine okay mom
warfare two or hey little 30 okay um
well modern warfare two is good game I
mean there's no doubt that's a very very
good game but I like hey loud played for
a while I'm not a huge fan of either to
be honest I like a lot about it i like
to tend to like you know like fallout
you know like open world games but I got
to go with halo me there's there's no
big good match of halo you know it yeah
and
doing an xbox live I don't know man my
xbox been breaking so much lately I
don't know if I'm going to spend all
that money to get it and they'll break
again I don't know yeah is really good
you should get it mm-hmm Lainey thanks
the question all right thank you okay
hello are you there hello okay i drew
the chapel right okay free questions
report um so the first question is Bujji
sees the leader in going at moment Xbox
lowball PSN network right now I think
xbox live I mean you know the service is
great and there's a lot of features that
you don't get on PSN but you know if a
lot of the rumors were true about PSN
premium I can see that jumping ahead of
xbox live I mean you know be able to get
you know like free demos of any game
being able to download PlayStation
original PlayStation games I think that
could be a pretty good thing yeah cuz I
saw there yes end bloody premium stuff
on the internet doesn't know whether to
believe it like trying to see what some
pipe some people felt on youtube in
light so i support that was a good
pushes ass oh yeah definitely yeah I
mean yeah but it's a second question is
a who'd you see the lead in search bingo
google I know Google is bottom this is
what you think yep google no doubt Bane
has a nice interface but I just find
that when i'm searching I've tried bang
I mean I actually use it for a couple
weeks just comparing it and it just
doesn't seem as accurate I don't know if
it's just because I'm used to exactly
how Google works and you know when you
see bangs a little different I mean if
Google wasn't around I think everybody
okay with Bing but Google just saying
it's faster in my opinion and everything
just loads instantly almost and the
results just seem to be better you know
yeah and my question last question
really go Adam what what do you think is
the best survival curve we liked these
sizes because I'm a lot of silver for
you
and only got screened closer but I'm
still easing back and forth not sure
what to do really so well it depends on
I mean a lot of it depends on your
budget i mean you know if you don't know
if you don't have the budget of 15
or 17 inch the 13 would probably be ok
but really i think the sweet spot right
now is the 15 inch with the core i7
processor if you had the money for it
it's going to be a really powerful it's
probably want to be the most powerful
max around shorter maybe like the imac
or the macbook pro I mean started the
mac pro I mean you get the core i7 but
it's also in a pretty decent size that I
mean that would probably be able to you
know halo a lot yeah there's always
always that promise choosing products
for that falafel I've been thinking
where the iphone would like to get an
angel phone and this has been my biggest
want to think about oh yeah yeah thanks
personal questions no problem thanks for
