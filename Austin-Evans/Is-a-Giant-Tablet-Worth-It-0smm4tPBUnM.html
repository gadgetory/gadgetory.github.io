getting bigger and bigger as a giant
tablet actually worth it
Samsung has taken a gamble the answer is
yes with the galaxy view with an 18 inch
screen this Dwarfs even reasonably sized
tablets like the iPad air 2 it looks
more like a portable monitor than a
tablet the size is immediately
noticeable when you get to the box
besides a few basic specs it's all
business inside there's not a lot to it
you'll find the Quick Start Guide and
the laptop style power adapter what I
want to know is what exactly can you do
with it
the general idea isn't too far off from
normal Galaxy Tabs it's running android
5.1 lollipop with a custom launcher
that's very video focused with that 18
point 4 inch 1080p screen watching video
works well apps like Netflix are going
to give you a solid experience the
display itself isn't anything all that
special though it gets reasonably bright
and colors are solid but it's the size
that's really the main draw if you get
close you'll see it's not the crispiest
when it comes to detail but for video
it's fine one helpful thing is the
built-in stand it's useful for propping
up the view to use it like a TV well
it's not really meant to be used as a
laptop it's also sort of usable on a lab
the stand will also double as a carrying
handle which is kind of nice you can't
use it as a portable device the battery
will last nearly all day but it's pretty
ridiculous this is a seriously heavy
tablet and the size means that you're
basically forced to carry it around with
a handle all day good luck fitting this
in a bag especially since the stand
doesn't come off it's also not
adjustable which means you're basically
either setting it on a table or carrying
it it's a good idea in theory but it's
an annoyance in real-world use something
else is a disappointment are the
speakers tucked behind the stand you can
see they're big but they sound really
tinny they get reasonably loud but for
such a video focused device it's a bit
of a surprise the ports are pretty
straightforward there's a headphone jack
micro USB and power port but I can't
help but wish it had an HDMI end so you
could use it as a portable display as
weird as the galaxy view is though at
the very least it's a decent Android
tablet it's got an 8 core Exynos 7580
which has plenty of power for a 1080p
display it's not the most powerful
tablet out there but it can handle some
gaming but you'll probably want a
controller holding such a huge tablet
for more than a few minutes gets
uncomfortable not to mention it looks
absolutely ridiculous
after a bit hit-and-miss some scale
fairly well to the 18 inch screen like
from
in most video apps like YouTube or
decent but it's clear nothing is really
meant for the view other apps that are
designed for phones look almost
comically terrible Android doesn't have
amazing support for tablets as is much
less enormous ones
well the galaxy v likes a rear facing
camera and actually has a pretty decent
2.1 megapixel front-facing camera
totally fine for something like Skype
Google Hangouts for making YouTube
videos one of the things I've really
appreciated about Samsung is their
willingness to take risks Tek can really
feel like it's all the same these days
but Samsung is always down to try
something new that said the galaxy view
might be an interesting idea in theory
but in reality it's hard to see who
exactly the view is for pair of that
with a $500 price tag and it's a really
hard sell so would you guys want out of
a giant tablet let me know in the
comments below and I will catch you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
