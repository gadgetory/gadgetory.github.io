day for the new AMD r9 in our seventh
series of graphics cards so be sure to
hit that thumbs up button if you
appreciate me pulling it all nighter to
get you guys this video and let's jump
right on in today I've got three is the
new cards the r9 280x r9 270x and r7
260x if you guys don't know what any of
those names mean go check out my earlier
video where I break all the cards down
first of all we have the 2a DX which my
review sample is a custom sapphire card
and measures in at just under 11 inches
and it sports three gigabytes of gddr5
memory like the rest of today's lineup
for ports we have a pair of DVI and HDMI
along with a DisplayPort below the
vapor-x cooler we have a pair of eight
pin powder connectors however on
reference cards you'll see one six pen
and one eight pin here up top we have
two cross fire fingers for up to four
way crossfire as well as a button to
switch between the dual biases on the
card next we have the r9 270x which is a
reference card unlike AMD's usual
designs I've got to say I really like
the look of the card with its red and
black color scheme and blower cooler
that measures in at 9.5 inches and this
one is rocking 2 gigs of ram for power
you'll find two 6-pin pci ii connectors
and a single crossfire connector for
two-way setups lastly we have the r7
260x which is also a reference card it
sports the same cool-looking red and
black design however it's a much smaller
and more open cooler that measures 6 and
3/4 inches and it comes standard with 2
gigabytes of memory with such a small
PCB it only needs a single 6 pin power
connector and it's good to go for
two-way crossfire unlike it's more
expensive brothers the 260x has true
audio which can improve audio quality
and take some load off your CPU however
we'll have to wait for games to support
this for now for this first wave we're
looking at tweaked versions of 7000
series cards the r9 280x is essentially
a 7970 with the same clock speed across
the bore but at a new $300 price the r9
270x is based on the 7870 however it's
gotten a five-percent quark
and 14% faster memory making it about 9%
faster than the 78-74 $200 the r7 260x
is based on the same GPU as the 77 90
with a 10% increase on the core clock
and 8% on the memory making it amazingly
enough about 9% faster with a price of
one hundred and forty dollars so who are
these cards for well the 260x
is aimed at playing games on high at
1080p it handles Metro last light at
just over 45 FPS on high Crysis 3 at 33
frames per second in battlefield 3 on
ultra at 36 fps the 270x is better
equipped allowing you to play most games
on Ultra at 1080p it pulls in just under
74 FPS and BioShock Infinite 50 6.4
frames per second with Metro last light
on very high in 33 FPS inside Crysis 3
on very high if you want even more power
the 280x is great for maxing things out
at 1080p or even bumping up the
resolution to something like 1440p here
we're looking at over 44 frames per
second with Crysis 3 on very high
quality 75 point 4 FPS with Metro last
light and 96 frames on ultra with
BioShock Infinite all right so let's
break this down the 280x comes in at
$300 and because of that it really
doesn't have a whole lot of competition
the GTX 760 is a bit slower but it's
also 50 dollars cheaper so overall the
280x is a solid card for the money
the 270x comes in at $200 and here it
runs into the gtx 660 at 180 it's
clearly a great 1080p card and faster
than the 660 however it is $20 more so
it always out the r7 260x at 140 dollars
is just a little unfortunate just likely
77 90 that it's based on it's a good
card for most gamers
however yet again NVIDIA has thrown a
wrench in by dropping the much faster
650 Ti boost to only $10 more making the
260x a hard sell so what do you guys
think about the new AMD cards of course
this is a quite the entire lineup we've
got just a couple more cards to take a
look at however definitely be sure to
let me know what you think in the
comments below I also want to show you
guys one more
slightly different kind of game a little
while ago I showed you endless blitz a
game for iOS and Android made by my
friends over at HH Craig it's a fun
endless runner style game where you
avoid the other players while collecting
coins and power-ups and the best part is
that you're playing for actual prizes
they're giving away a 60-inch sharp TV
every day this month along with the
grand prize of a 70 inch 4k sharp TV to
go along with the contest
there's the sharp NATO powerup which is
super ope and lets you run down the
field in a tornado filled with sharp TVs
because well there's really no because
it's just cool
anyway I definitely sure to go check out
endless blitz at the link in the
description of this video anyway guys
thank you so much for watching I got my
review sample a little bit late from AMD
so I had to really hustle to get you
guys this video so hopefully you enjoyed
anyway guys I will catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
