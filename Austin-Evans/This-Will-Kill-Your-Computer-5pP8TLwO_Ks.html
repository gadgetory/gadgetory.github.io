this is the USB Keller now might not
look like much however this will
straight up kill your computer so this
is a device that's used to test hardware
so what looks like an ordinary USB
device we take the cap off it could be
any old flash drive instead there's a
series of capacitors inside so if you
plug it into a computer it will charge
those capacitors up and once they're
full it turns around and releases all
that power at 240 volts straight back
into the computer in theory killing it
well the USB Kolo go is a little bit of
a giveaway it doesn't take much to be
able to pop this thing open now before
we proceed do not try this at home
seriously not only is it very possible
for this thing to kill electronics but
it's also a lot of voltage here you want
to be careful and by being careful
I mean don't try this at home so to find
out if this is actually going to work we
have Anna Sue's Chromebook now USB
cochlea - this is going to work on
around 95% of computers and the reason
for that is that while some computers
have properly capped USB ports most have
completely unprotected ports which means
that if this thing sends a ton of power
through the computer instead of being
able to block at the port it's going to
send it straight to the motherboard for
a bunch of stuff it's going to be dead
so in theory I plug this in and it's
going to die so plug it in in three two
one
whoa okay hold on hold on hold on that
was so fast like I didn't think it took
like half a second like it plugged in I
heard a little tiny click it was dumb
for I mean I see this light which makes
me think there's maybe some life but the
screen is definitely dead maybe the
battery's still intact which is running
that light but Chromebook done for
I don't do the MacBook I don't want to
do that look I think it's good : I quit
man
I'm just gonna kill it I don't do the
MacBook I'm not even joking right now
part of me wants in to not survive ooh
we want to sing good everyone yeah but
everyone's not gonna have to buy me a
new MacBook when this one dies and why
all right all right MacBook time this
guy it's on him you're gonna have
macbook blood on your hands we're going
to try the USB killer on the brand-new
2016 MacBook Pro now normally I would
not want to kill this under any
circumstances however apparently Apple
has actually fixed the USB ports so that
they are not susceptible to an attack
like this so because this doesn't have
normal USB ports we're gonna be using a
USB C to USB a adapter this shouldn't
affect anything but we'll find out dude
I'm so nervous I'm so nervous right now
all right there's nothing to it let's
plug the adapter in in three two one
oh it clicked it clicked
oh it's clicking you hear that oh it
survived all right that's enough cooking
that's not looking okay you're get
you're good oh good I was so convinced
it was about to die so now what I want
to know is do we actually kill the port
so I plug in power yes so we can
definitely still charge with the port so
I think everything should be fine I also
have a USB Drive here so we should be
able to see it pop up or not
while do we actually like kill the date
on this port yes again so it looks like
this is still getting power so the power
part of this port still works as far as
data goes we completely killed that
venerable port Wow now it's time to
raise the stakes this is a 32 inch TV
and this happens to be a smart TV
however even normal flat-screen TVs will
typically have a USB port so usually you
plug in a flash drive to look pictures
video or even firmware so we're going to
find out well the USB killer be able to
kill an entire TV plug it in in three
two one
oh I heard it the TV still on it's not
ticking I heard one loud click and that
was it I wonder does the USB port still
work because the TV still fine
so five out of this actually works
you're not we're completing keyboard in
which might sound like a weird thing to
do however since this is a smart TV it
actually does support a keyboard so
nothing No
the see I don't even think this is
getting power well the USB Co didn't
kill the TV it did at least fry the USB
port next we have a phone now this might
seem like a little bit of a weird choice
however the 6p does have a USB C port so
plugging into the Nexus 6p in three two
one
oh oh whoa wait the phone's rebooting
holocene plug plug plug so it reset the
phone that was a really loud crack - so
everything seems to be fine on the phone
now let's see if we actually plug it in
so what I want to know is does the
port's to work so we have a PC here plug
it in okay so we are charging so at
least we have that working did we get
data yeah this is acting just like a
charger it doesn't see any kind of data
coming through on either side so it
might not have killed the phone and to
be fair you can't still charge which
honestly is by far the most important
part of being able to use a port however
the fact that we've killed data on two
different USB C devices does not bode
well this USB killer is no joke as long
as you're careful with your electronics
and don't let random people plug things
in you should be fine however all it
takes is a single second and you can do
some serious damage now if you're really
worried about this there are USB
protectors that will actually physically
lock out the ports on your computer and
I'll have one of those links in the
description however is longer careful
you should be okay because we did do
some damage today I wanted to give back
so we made a donation to the EFS they
did some absolutely amazing work to make
sure the internet stays open and free
for everyone if you enjoyed this video

tech including stuff like this
definitely be sure to subscribe to the
