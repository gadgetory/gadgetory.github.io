talking a little bit about viruses and
what you can do to protect yourself you
know a lot of you guys who are really
tech savvy you're probably gonna mount
all of this stuff however I'm really
aiming for this is those of you who
aren't super technically inclined you
don't know all about the new latest
viruses and all that kind of stuff so
want to wait and give you some of the
basics some of the you know the 101 of
computer viruses so the first thing I
want to talk about is what is a computer
virus now there's a lot of different
names they're known under usually a
virus perhaps a computer bug malware
there's a lot of different names but
basically the way I like to explain it
to people is that it is a program on
your computer that is trying to do you
some harm so maybe that might be to scam
you out of you know paying it for some
vampire software to remove itself you
know ransoming it may be that it's gonna
send you pop-ups and all kinds of
prompts and stuff or it may be something
really covert like just stealing your
information stealing what you're typing
or you all kinds of stuff that data
that's on your computer so that's
generally the way I like to explain it's
a program that's really gonna do some
harm one way or the other can do I mean
there's lots of different types but
something that you definitely do not
want to computer now there's one of the
really big things I like to tell people
is don't get to the point where you've
got a virus and you're trying to get rid
of it now of course it's totally
possible to get rid viruses and I will
talk about them at that in a minute but
before I get to that I want to talk
about how to just avoid getting the
virus in the first place and the number
one thing that people tell me is oh well
I don't I'm not going to get a virus
because of this I'm gonna get a virus
because of that the really simple truth
is anyone can get a virus I don't care
if you're on Windows you're on Mac I
don't care if you sit on google.com all
day I don't care if you know you browse
an incognito I mean it doesn't really
matter you can get a virus on pretty
much any computer at all now there are
certain differences I mean for example
if you have a Windows computer there's
more but there's a larger chance to get
a virus as opposed to a Mac but does
that mean that you sitting on your Mac
cannot get a virus at all and that's a
really common misconception I definitely
do want to clear up so as far as getting
viruses you can get them from a lot of
places so for example if you torque a
lot this is definitely a very common
place where you can get viruses just
snuck into the files whatever and that's
not say every single torrent and entire
universe
the virus but it is certainly a place
where you can't get a virus typically
though what you'll find is viruses on
sites so for example if you go to some
generic site that you've never heard of
on there's definitely gonna be a little
bit more of a chance of you finding a
virus there that as opposed to you know
something like you know Facebook or
YouTube or something like that I mean if
you're on AI if you really spend a lot
of your time on just the standard sites
and even like Facebook like Google like
YouTube you know that kind of the
reputable sites there's almost you're
almost never going to get a virus but
what will happen is when you go go off
to some new web site that you may have
never heard of you definitely do need to
be a little bit wary now don't get me
wrong I'm not trying to say you know
never go on any site other than Google
or YouTube or anything like that that's
absolutely not the case but when you're
on some web site especially if it looks
a little sketchy just be a little bit
cautious the way I like to kind of talk
about it is you know if you're on I like
a weird part of town or something you
know like kind of like a bad part of
town you're gonna be a little bit more
cautious and that's the exact same way
if you're on some web sites you never
heard of that you know it looks a little
bit Shady just be cautious I mean it
doesn't mean that you need to
immediately leave and never come back to
it that's this may not be the worst case
the worst idea ever but just kind of be
cautious think about you know oh what's
that looks like a download link I don't
know if I want to click on that or you
know stuff like that now of course you
know there's a lot to talk about you
know as far as when you get on a web
site like that you know you're you're
looking around it looks a little shady
it's like oh do you want to download
this pack of Smiley's do you want to
download this or that one of the easiest
ways to get a virus and I'll just be
straight front with you guys the easiest
way to get a virus is by just
downloading something now there are
holes in your software and I'll get in
that just a second but the easiest way
is just human error so you know if you
go onto a site and it says hey you want
to download a free pack of Smiley's do
you want download Microsoft Office for
free do you want to table that's
going to be some kind of enticement some
kind of free offer like hey you want
this for free and obviously yeah
everybody likes free stuff go ahead and
download that and yeah sure you may get
you know this or that or whatever
whatever they say but it also may come
with viruses malware or whatever so you
really really should be cautious with
that now again I don't want to scare
people there are absolutely legitimate
free downloads of all kinds of software
around the internet so it's not like
every single thing if it says free it's
definitely gonna be a virus that's
absolutely not the case but yet
think about what you're downloading this
is a site look legitimate have you had
good luck on it in the past do you have
your friends have gone there is it a
reputable site if that's the case and
usually you're gonna be fine it says
it's free it's gonna be free for a
reason but if it's something a little
bit shady you've never heard of and it's
offering something especially if it's
like offering something you know like
really extravagant like you know
Microsoft Office or something
just be really really cautious almost
definitely that's gonna be a virus or
it's not gonna be exactly what you're
looking for so I'd really recommend
avoiding that now as soon as you learn
how to be really smart about computers
you learn not to download stuff not to
click on links that you if somebody
sends you a random link oh it's a great
idea to click on it because in addition
to a human error there's also things
that can be totally out of your control
so take for example a link so let's say
you're on Facebook and somebody shares a
link okay so yeah pretty common you're
gonna wanna go ahead and click on that
link however there's a lot of times like
lots that go around that you know people
lose control their accounts and start
sending links and all it takes is for
you to click on that link and you can
very well just get a virus that's simply
now the way it works is that it's kind
of like you know there's a lot of
components involved in from you getting
you on sitting at your desk onto the
internet there's lots of software
there's lots of you know complexity
around it so there are several different
things that can go wrong and if any of
those go wrong there's a whole security
glitch or anything like that you can
absolutely get a virus from that so take
for example let's say just let's just
take a generic example of someone who's
on the Internet so let's say you're
sitting on your you know your computer
you're on Facebook not doing anything
exciting you click on a link and you
know it goes white or something
something look seems a little bit wrong
well you could get a virus that simply
and the way it works is that like I said
there are a lot of different software in
play so for example you have a browser
if you there's a problem with your
browser if there's some security hole or
bug or anything like that then a virus
could get into that way there are also
plugins so for example flash you guys
see like flash videos like on YouTube
right now that's a plug-in and that can
also have security problems same goes
for Java Silverlight there's a lot of
different you know patches and bugs and
all kinds of stuff that can happen
and a lot of the time you don't have to
do anything you can just click on the
link you're done there's not a whole lot
you can do so that's why you really
should exercise caution I mean you know
it's gonna happen everybody no one's
gonna be omniscient and you just go oh
that's that's a link I'm never gonna
click on that I mean no you know it's
gonna happen but just kind of think
about it if it looks like some really
weird looking link it's like some you
know a bunch of if the link looks really
really weird that kind of thing is
usually kind of a tip-off that that
might not be a great idea to click on it
all right now as far as these kind of
viruses and these kind of attacks there
is a way to combat them now there's not
a hundred percent you know there's never
going to be any way to say every piece
of software on my computer is what ever
since acute it's just not going to
happen however what the difference is is
if you're using good software everything
it can really help you out so let's say
you know you're a browser pretty much
everyone is going to be using a browser
and what a browser is if you're not
familiar is just the piece of software
that allows you so let's get on the
internet so you're probably going to be
using one right now could be Internet
Explorer
it could be Google Chrome Apple Safari
Mozilla Firefox there are a lot of
different types of browsers well none of
these are really awful compared to the
other or whatever but they all can have
security bugs the easiest way to avoid
these is to keep it updated and this is
a great piece of advice just in
computing in general keep your stuff
updated now while I know you're always
gonna see you know pop ups like Oh up to
click here to update or new update
available or this and that it's really
attempting to just get rid of it's
annoying yes just to pop up saying hey
it's time to update there's something
new you know a lot of times like I don't
need that I don't want to waste my time
however a lot of time these can be
security updates so for example in your
browser a lot of times a lot of these
newer browsers such as Chrome will
automatically update so that means is
you will never even notice it it'll
update and you'll turn on one day and
it's updated and it's all done you never
did a thing and that's really good a lot
of time you don't have to worry about
that there's nothing really particularly
worrying about that um however if you
anytime you see some kind of update on
your computer says hey new Java a new
flash new this renew that go ahead and
accept that it may be a little bit of
pain to do but it definitely could help
you with viruses in the future all right
so let's say we've gone through all this
you know max click on suspicious links
or anything like that and you know
that's a little bit of a bad idea when
you know you're not updating all of your
software however that still may not be
enough
and again I really want to stress I'm
not trying to be trying to freak you
guys out or anything like that I'm just
trying to give you some good facts and
try to you know not get worried about
you know this or that just kind of know
that no matter who you are no matter how
smart you are no matter what software
you are you're running you can run into
viruses and problems everything like
that so in this case it's good to have
some antivirus software now I highly
recommend this if you were running
Windows if you're running Mac or Linux
it is optional and a lot of people do
not run antivirus on those programs on
those operating systems rather and the
main reason for that is not that you
know something about if you're running a
Mac is you know impossible to break or
anything like that but it's just the
simple thing of most people I believe
upwards of 90% of people use Windows ok
and everything else is gonna be Mac or
Linux now if I'm gonna write a virus am
I gonna go after the 3% or 5% or
whatever I'm gonna go out to the 90%
obvious it's gonna make more sense to go
after the 90% so generally lots more
viruses do target Windows however again
I'd really wanna stress this even if
you're running a Mac you're not immune
that's very very very easy to fall into
it's just not the case you can
definitely get a virus on a Mac so if
you're on Windows just because there are
a lot more viruses for Windows I do
recommend running some kind of antivirus
software and there are a lot of kinds on
the market and most of them do a good
job personally I prefer to use Microsoft
Security Essentials it's what I run it
is totally free it is run by Microsoft
so you know that this you know it's
gonna work pretty well and typically it
does a very good job of scan your
computer in the background it's not
gonna be you know slowing your computer
down like a lot of other programs
including the paid ones will do you know
it's also really pretty good about
catching viruses now a lot of you guys
do use paid so for example McAfee or
some other things which you pay for and
while these are not awful a lot of times
I do like the free alternatives better
just because they're obviously gonna be
cheaper free is always good but in
addition to that you know that a lot of
times are gonna be a little bit softer
on system resources and things like that
so I mean you can certainly pay for
antivirus but in my opinion there's
really never a reason get something good
for free
like I said Microsoft Security
Essentials is good there's also a couple
others such as Avast
B I definitely get yourself protected if
you're on Windows on Mac it's definitely
very optional there are good antivirus
software
available however like I said it's not
entirely optional it is entirely
optional rather just kind of keep an eye
out don't do be cooking bad links or
anything like that now the really good
way I like to explain antivirus is just
think about this analogy so let's say
without any antivirus your doors
unlocked your house door is unlocked
right so you know a lot of people do
keep their doors unlocked and a lot of
times you may not have any problems and
that's very well the case the antivirus
may sit on your computer for years and
never have to block a signal fires
that's great you don't have any problems
however all it takes is somebody to come
open the door obviously in our case it
just takes one buyers
it's our computer we don't know we're
none the wiser a lot of time and it
could be doing all kinds of bad things
now when any type of virus is basically
locking your door now locking your doors
gonna keep a lot of the buyers out
however if there's somebody who really
wants to get in or you get really
unlucky you might break a window and I
might bust your door down so antivirus
is a good cushion but again it's not the
be-all end-all of security it's gonna
help in a vast majority of the
situations that you could get a virus
however it's not going to help you in
every single spot you can still get a
virus occasionally although it really
does help so I definitely recommend get
some antivirus special for your on
Windows now we've gone through all the
prevention I know we've been going for
quite a wide hood but we've gone through
what a virus is we've gone through how
to best protect yourself over like I
said doesn't matter how smart you are
doesn't matter how you know precaution
precautions you take you certainly can
still get a virus now there are a couple
of really good indicators of when of
virus hits
so some viruses are going to be up in
your face it's not like they're gonna
try to hide they're gonna be like giving
you pop-ups they may be slowing your
computer really really far down and that
can be caused by other things but a lot
of time it is just a simple virus where
they can you'll be sending you like some
program like I know there's some really
tricky things that pop up acting like
it's antivirus software like over
detected blank virus on your computer
you pay blank amount of money to get rid
of it now these are almost always
scammed because that's just the virus
there's no any type virus software and
if you see some piece of software that
pops up on your computer that you've
never heard of it's generally a pretty
good indicator although of course
sometimes programs can change you know
there
and whatnot so but if you see something
that you've never heard in your entire
life up in your computer typically
that's a pretty good sign that you may
have a buyers especially if it's asking
for money that's one of the number one
things a lot of times the viruses don't
care about your personal information or
anything like that because that really
does get into the illegal thing but they
can just pop up something saying hey
you're infected pay us $60 and we'll get
rid of that and a lot of people are like
oh wow I didn't know that okay I'll go
get my credit card right now that's a
really bad idea
so just really think about that kind of
stuff in those kind of cases it's good
to just take your computer to someone
who knows what they're doing now if you
are fairly confident as in your
technical knowledge there are a lot of
different ways I'm gonna get into how to
remove every single virus in the history
of the universe but if you know what
you're doing a lot of times you can just
clear the stuff out by yourself however
if you're really not entirely sure what
you're supposed to do all the time it's
a great idea to just take it to someone
who does know what they're doing and a
lot of times they will get rid of it now
might they make you in that may end up
costing you know quite a bit of money
perhaps the same as you know what the
virus is asking for however the
difference is the virus has your credit
card it can charge whatever it want they
can do whatever they want or does if you
take it somebody who knows what they're
doing they're just gonna clean it up and
you're gonna be good to go I'm moving on
from you know just the rule of really
basic you know pop-ups this and that you
pretty obviously do have a virus there
are some really stealthy things now
these things are typically going to be
aimed at getting your information so
there are things called key loggers
which log every single keystroke you
have on your keyboard obviously is going
to include a lot of personal information
usually like credit card information
passwords all that kind of stuff and
that's definitely a big threat as well
as just other things just get really
really deep you may have a virus and not
even know it and it could be doing all
kinds of stuff now in this case if the
antivirus doesn't pick it out there's
really not a whole lot that you can do I
mean if you know that you do have this
virus if you find some clue about it on
your computer you definitely can you
google it that's a fantastic thing
Google is a great way you know Google
how to get rid of this virus or you know
just kind of see other people's opinions
although again if you want to be very
clear don't be just downloading anything
just because you have a virus doesn't
mean if you get more viruses or anything
like that just always use your common
sense but a lot of times Google is going
to be good for if as the people have the
virus maybe other people have figured
out you know what
this virus is how to get rid of it that
kind of thing but again just you know
use common sense but a lot of times that
will be very helpful so anyways guys in
a little bit long video but I do want to
go over a lot but really on the basic of
it on the base of it just kind of use
your common sense don't download stuff
that you don't really know about and if
you do try to run a virus scan on it
make sure it's not it's going to be
perfect you viruses still can't get in
but it's a little bit of a measure of
security doesn't take very long I'm so
try to download and scan your viruses
viruses some scan your programs that you
download can I keep an eye on torrents
not saying that you guys should never
use a torrent the entire life but a lot
of times torrents can get viruses and
whatnot in them and as well as try to
keep your software updated very
important just if you see an update or
if you have if you know where the option
is usually it's gonna be there's gonna
be an auction most programs to check for
updates apply those updates as often as
you can it's gonna be a little bit of
annoyance but it will keep you much more
secure and finally if you do get a virus
and you know at all all your protective
measures have failed if all else fails
just take it somebody and let them you
know run the by your skin and clean it
up for you or if you know somebody who's
really technically inclined let them do
it and of course if you know enough
about it for yourself you can do it
yourself but really if you do have a
virus you know that's going to be taking
you know your personal data and whatnot
stop using that computer if you can
don't be continuing to give it more
information just stop using it and try
to get that virus off before you do
anything else there's a lot of different
methods if you I'm not gonna get into
every little thing but just just be a
little bit cautious hey guys that's been
about it for my video just giving you a
really brief explanation well not brief
at all but an explanation of what
viruses are all about and how to keep
yourself protected now if you guys
enjoyed this video and you think it
helped definitely be sure to share it
with your friends your family who may
not be quite as technically inclined as
you are I'd really appreciate that and
again if you enjoyed the video
definitely be sure it has that subscribe
button you'll be notified whenever I
post any new video anyway guys thanks
