here with a holiday gift guide for under
$200 and of course as a filming this
video with Black Friday and Cyber Monday
is coming up in just a couple days so I
figured this would be a great
opportunity to go over some of the best
deals for under $200 to kick it off we
have an awesome deal on a Playstation 3
so this is the brand-new super slim
version with a 250 gigabyte hard drive
it also comes with a few games so you
get Uncharted 1 uncharted 2 as well as
infamous 1 and infamous 2 now this is
something that usually runs anywhere
between 250 and 300 dollars however
today only it is going to be on sale on
Amazon for 200 bucks so for $200 if you
don't already have a PlayStation through
you gotta go get it I mean it's a really
really good deal of course though it is
probably going to be only today only
it's their Black Friday special so if
you guys are interested be sure to hit
the link in the description continuing
on with so many stuff they also have a
really good deal on the Vita so you can
get the brand new Assassin's Creed
liberation bundle so it comes with the
white Vita which I can quote awesome a 4
gigabyte memory card as well as the new
Assassin's Creed liberation game for the
Vita for only $180 and certainly this
came out like I think a couple of weeks
ago for 250 bucks this is another great
deal but again this is gonna be only a
today I believe so again link will be in
the description of this video so by the
time you watching this it might be sold
out so sorry about that but if you can
catch it for $180 and you don't really
have a Vita this is pretty much the
cheapest way to do it by far there are
also tons of really good video game
deals on Amazon today so I'll just drop
a link in the description they're
constantly changing by the time I told
you guys about the deals that are going
on right now that um my video is
uploaded a probably already be gone but
there's a lot of really good deal I
picked up like the entire God of War
series for $15 earlier for the ps3 so
there's lots of really cheap games like
$7 $10 I think they had like modern
warfare 3 for like $10 earlier or maybe
15
I don't know but again if you guys were
interested in any kind of video games
for the 360 ps3 etc etcetera etc
Angelyn has tons and tons of deals going
on between now and I believe Monday
moving on we have the audio technica ath
em 50s now these are some absolutely
awesome headphones I wear them all the
time they're my favorite headphones by
far and the only about 105 dollars in
Amazon right now so I paid 160 170
dollars earlier this year and they're
well worth that price believe me they
just destroyed beats and all these other
you know branded headphones audio
technica make some really good stuff
but for 105 dollars
this is I really really good deal so if
you guys are looking for some really
nice over the area headphones with some
really killer sound quality check it out
something else that I use all the time
that's on sale right now is the Logitech
performance MX mouse now this is a
really cool Mouse for one if you take a
look at it it looks really goofy it's
not it doesn't look like a normal Mouse
but trust me when you actually put in
your hand it's very ergonomic all the
buttons line up nicely and so Wireless
too and it works on PC as well as Mac
now this is OK for gaming I use it for
gaming occasionally but what it's really
made for is productivity and all that
kind of stuff so it's got several
buttons
you got like a back and forward button
on the mouse for your browser there's
also a little button which will open
Mission Control on Mac there's all kinds
of different things and you can
customize it as much as you want now
this is usually $100 and it's well worth
it and that's what I paid but if you
guys were wanting to get right now it's
only gonna run you 50 bucks if any of
you guys are youtubers or just like to
shoot video the zoom h1 is absolutely
awesome so I like to think of this as
like a Swiss Army knife because that's
quite a few different things so of
course audio is very important I'm sure
you guys all know this I mean you know
video sure it's great to have nice
lighting all that kind of stuff if you
get really bad audio not so good so the
zoom h1 has it does a couple things for
you for one it has a great microphone
built-in so I actually used this at CES
earlier this year big trade show tons of
noise very very noisy on the floor but I
use it to get all the audio for my
videos it cut through it it was very
nice very very usable which is really
nice considering it's only like 80 bucks
on top of that also does have inputs and
outputs so you can hook up other
microphones and use that as the recorder
you can also hook in headphones monitor
your audio overall really really awesome
little microphone it's only about 80
bucks on sale right now now this one's a
little bit out there but I think you
guys might enjoy it it is an Android
figure so you guys can see this right
here app each one I've just the other
day they're really cool okay so I'm just
gonna say this right up front this
doesn't do anything it's just a little
Android dude so it's nothing special but
if you guys like Android or you can feel
just like little Android robot guy you
pick these up for like 10 bucks or so so
if you want to be a little stocking
stuffer just something cool to sit on
your desk okay go for it now moving on
to bigger stuff we have the Google Nexus
7 so this is a $200 tablet and I can
just say this with full confidence this
is the best cheap tablet period
so there are iPads and Nexus tens and
Microsoft Surface there's a lot more
expensive tablets which are fine which
are great but if you're wanting to spend
$200 or even up to $300 on a tablet
nothing can even touch the Nexus 7 now
there is one exception I'll get into
that one second but overall the Nexus 7
has a quad-core processor and Android
4.2 a really nice build it's $200 that I
mentioned that yet it's seriously great
so if you guys are interested in a like
a cheap tablet that is not actually
cheap that seriously if it was $400 I
would still recommend definitely check
out the Nexus 7 last but not least we
have the Amazon Kindle Fire HD now I
know I just kept finish telling you how
great in the Nexus 7 is and it is it's a
great tablet but the Kindle Fire HD does
have a couple reasons why you might want
to go with it over the Nexus so for
starters it does have a better screen as
well as better speakers which hang good
stuff you like to watch a video but more
importantly than that it's a little bit
easier to use if you're not going to be
super technically inclined so especially
if you're buying this for a gift for
somebody who you know might not be able
to totally figure out how to use Android
4.2 which honestly it's not that hard
but the Kindle Fire HD is very simple to
navigate and also it does have great
integration with all the kinds of Amazon
stuff including Kindle for reading books
you have full access to the whole prime
store as long as you do have Prime and
come on if you use Amazon you should
totally get pride but it's a good tablet
it's not better than the Nexus 7 for
most of you guys and for me I definitely
do prefer the Nexus 7 but if you're
buying this as a gift or for somebody
who just really really likes to use
Amazon stuff it's really hard to beat
anyway guys it's gonna be about it for
my Holiday Gift Guide for under $200
I'll have links to everything I
mentioned in the description of this
video but definitely do keep in mind
that some of these are going to go super
fast so especially that PlayStation 3
and the Vita both of those are going to
be gone at the absolute maximum
tonight I think they're lasting till
midnight and they very well may sell out
before then so if you guys are
interested in anything I mentioned
definitely pays to get it now as opposed
to later when the price goes up
I'll beyond that I will definitely be
doing some more of these holiday gift
guides most likely a $200 plus I don't
think I'm gonna put a price range on
that one so if you guys are interested
in catching more awesome deals and cool
tech stuff be sure to subscribe to the
