you how to jailbreak your iphone ipod
touch or ipad on the latest iOS 4.3
point 1 firmware now before we begin
there are a few things I do want to
mention first of all this is only going
to work on Windows computers if you have
a Mac you can still do the jailbreak
what are you going to need to use pwnage
tool which is that's what pretty
similarly how are there are some key
differences so you're going to need to
find a separate tutorial on that and the
second thing is the device compatibility
this will work with the iphone 3gs the
iphone 4 the ipod touch 3rd and the ipod
touch 4th generation as well as the ipad
1 what this does not support as the ipad
2 which will be coming in a lighter
jailbreak this jailbreak is tethered now
what tez it means is that you will need
to plug your iPhone iPod Touch or iPad
into the computer and rerun the
jailbreak every single time it shuts
totally off and this definitely is
pretty annoying and that's one of the
reasons why i only recommend this if
you're in advanced jailbreaker if you
have never jailbroken before at the very
least i do recommend at least learning a
little bit about what different things
do you know and some of the terminology
and a lot of that kind of stuff before
proceeding with the jailbreak okay so to
do the jailbreak well i'm going to need
two things the first of which is the
snowbreeze program itself I hunk in the
description download that that's no big
deal and then the second one it can be a
little bit more complicated but
shouldn't be a big deal is your firmware
for your device so the firmer obviously
is going to need to be the four point
three point one and it used to be the
correct firmware for your device so you
can't use an iphone firmware on an iPad
or anything like that it needs to be the
correct firmware another a couple of
ways of getting this first one is just
find on your computer i'll have a link
in the description for example there's a
very good chance that itunes might have
already install ready downloaded it in
which case you can just drag it and drop
it onto your desktop no big deal at all
otherwise if you have not done that i
will have a download link where you can
just download it takes just a few
minutes and you'd be going to be go so
once you have both the firmer and
snowbreeze downloaded you need to go
ahead and connect your device via USB to
your computer now this is not one
hundred percent necessary but I
definitely highly recommend it and allow
it to do a full sync backup all your
music you're at
context photos all that kind of good
stuff have it all backed up in itunes so
we can get all that data right back as
soon as we're done with jailbreak you
shouldn't lose a thing so let's open up
snowbreeze and give you guys a little
demo of how it works so here we go this
is snowbreeze you can do check for
updates but if you just downloaded it
shouldn't be a big deal so just click OK
and we can click next I'm going to be a
little laggy here close credits so first
thing is it's going to ask for us for
our ipsw now that is that firmware file
that we either downloaded or found so
you can just download it or whatever you
can do so I'll just drag it in there
notice just a second type identify the
ipsw and then it will realize what
device we have firmware and all that
kind of stuff once it correctly
identifies are firmer as well as our
device we're ready to continue so just
click Next now you will find that there
is a simple mode in expert mode now if
you do have an iphone you will see a
baseband preservation mode however i'm
not going to be getting into that now
Gurman just click expert mode and
continue now there are going to be a few
options but we're just going to I'll
give you guys a quick overview of them
so we're going to start with general and
they're going to be a few things here
now these options are all optional
however I definitely recommend there's a
couple of them that you need to do so
for the ipod touch 4th generation and do
keep in mind some of these will change a
little bit varying the devices but you
probably want to enable just battery
percentage as well as gestures menu you
can also install ssh if you i typically
don't do that i like to just waiting in
start later but what you will want to do
is make sure this box is checked install
working mobile substrate that will make
sure that many of the great apps such as
winterboard and etc etc will properly
work on 4.3 point 1 i'm you can adjust
through partition size but i don't
really recommend that just leave it as
is next step download custom apps if you
have apps packages sources need that you
can add them into the ipsw again not
necessary at all but that's the option
is there if you like so once we've got
all that done there's not really a whole
lot just check build ipsw and click Next
so the ipsw does take quite a bit but
what i hate's nose done of course the
developer of the eye of snow breeze is
allow you to play pacman while it's
loading so if you guys want you can play
a little bit of pac-man I'm not going to
do that right now but that's there and
you can have a little fun while it's
waiting anyway guys this is going to
take a little while so I will be right
echo soon as it's done okay so it's all
done now before we begin we do want to
make sure that it did work properly so
you should see on your desktop these
snowbreeze ipsw as well as a folder that
says I booty for four point three point
one this isn't be a very important but
we're not going to use this just yet
what we do need though is the ipsw so
once you see that you do get the done
screen we're ready to be continued on
and actually get the idea study loaded
so at this point you should have your
ipod or iphone connected or of course
iPad connected via USB you know it's
backed up and all that kind of stuff
we're going to put their the ipod or the
iphone or whatever into a dfu mode state
so i'm going to put this over just love
it here and I'll give you as a demo of
how to do it so we just need to shut off
our device now so pretty simple you just
hold the power button down until you get
slide to power off and try to do it
right and then just let it shut off now
make sure you want to make sure that the
pinwheels stopped and the screen is
totally off to make sure that it is
actually off so now we're going to do by
just adjust this is going to put into
DFU mode I will walk you guys through it
but of course there are instructions on
screen I just follow those when you do
the tutorial so I'm going to click start
and we're going to prepare to press the
power in the home so ready set go
holding them both and hold them for 10
seconds so we just let it count us down
here okay we're about ready to release
the power button release the power
button and continue holding the home
button so it says 30 seconds usually
takes about 10 seconds but we'll just
continue holding it until it gives us
the okay so it sounds like it's about
done there we go so now it is running I
read and we're ready to roll so there
you guys will see it says your device is
now in a poem dfu mode state and we're
ready to begin now at this point itunes
should automatically open up if it
doesn't just open it yourself and it
should pop up with the thing saying it
is detected a device in recovery mode so
we can go ahead and click OK and now we
need to restore that firmware onto our
device so to do it you need to hold the
shift button down on your keyboard so
while you're holding shift click restore
with your left mouse button and it
should open up a little dialogue here
and just scroll down to your desktop and
select that snowbreeze ipsw that we just
made click open just let say yes restore
again this will take just a little while
so get started sit back and you shell
out for a few minutes and I'll be back
when this one is done ok so just
finished up so as you guys can see here
everything looks pretty much stock
except for the addition of cydia however
we are not quite done yet as you can see
here from click on City it does not do
anything so the last step is going to be
running I buoy ok so to get the device
to boot properly with all of our
jailbreak tweaks and whatnot we're going
to need to run I booty and of course I
booty should be on your desktop as soon
as snowbreeze major ipsw it should have
done the file there then you need to
open up the I booty executive Bowl file
and we're going to be good to go so as
you can see here it's super simple it
will ask us to select our device
obviously hopefully you're not
jailbreaking more than one at a time
then we just need to click start another
way this is going to work we're going to
do into dfu so you guys should know the
drill do the exact same thing as before
okay so once I booty is finished itunes
will most likely pop up again with the
same stuff over this time we don't need
to restore it also let me just close out
of this and pull in our device now we'll
take just a minute to boot up but take a
look here now if we open up cydia you
should find it actually works just fine
so it's going to want us to connect
Wi-Fi and all I can stop I can do that
later but as you guys can see your see
does work and we are officially
jailbroken if you found this video
helpful be sure to subscribe I do lots
other jailbreak videos and all kinds of
stuff like that if you have any problems
or questions about the jailbreak
definitely let me know in the comments
below and I will do my best to help you
