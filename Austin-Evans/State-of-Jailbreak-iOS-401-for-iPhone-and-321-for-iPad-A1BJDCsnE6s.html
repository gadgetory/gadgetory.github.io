of jailbreak video so of course it just
did one of these the other day and in
that video I was I said that you know
that would probably be outdated very
quick um I was joking I didn't actually
think it would be outdated in two days
but guys but yesterday apple announced
the new firmware and then today they've
announced more new firmware so guys I
walk you through what's going on with
the total jailbreak situation because
it's again it's getting more and more
complicated first of all and hopefully I
you guys are watching this video before
you've even noticed it four point zero
point one is now out for the iphone not
for the high pod touch just for the
iphone so guys this is a really really
simple update basically of course it
with iphone you have the signal bars
well basically the signal bars are now
taller and they're going to be you know
better at showing your signal and yeah
guys it's not going to help you if you
download it's not going to help you get
better reception it will just look like
you're getting better reception or and
look it should just be more accurate
guys of course this is standard dude if
you're planning on jailbreaking do not
update it all it does seem like this is
a very very minor update for the iphone
it is not for the ipod touch obviously
so it looks like it's going to be a
minor update so guys trust me just stay
off of it it's not going to help you
anything if you really have to do it it
looks like it will be jailbreakable here
in the next you know really recent time
but course guys just stay away from it
for the just a moment so guys there's
another thing and for the ipad this is a
little bit more serious three point two
point one is now out to the ipad now
this would date fixes a couple things
for the ipad it fixes the Wi-Fi issues
which are no of a lot of you guys are
having a few and a few minor bugs and
stuff but one of the most important
things is that it now patches the spirit
jailbreak so you can no longer use
spirit on three point two point one on
the ipad guys that's not good news you
know of course it's really you know
there's really not a whole lot i mean
spirits fantastic for jailbreaking but
now it's pretty much totally updated so
guys please stay away from three point
two point one on ipad there's
no there's no there's no time frame or
anything we have no idea when an update
for spirit or some other Jarek will be
off the iPad so guys just hang hang
tight do not update your iPad's if you
plan on being jailbroken and if you do
just know that it could be a while
before there's a new jailbreak for you
lastly guys not touched it a little bit
about this in my last video but 4.1 has
also helped so yeah guys Apple has been
very busy 4.1 for the iphone and ipod
both the beta is now out on this is only
for registered developers only and guys
it looks like this will be a pretty
substantial update for the first beta it
doesn't seem like there's going to be a
whole lot but apple's promising is
they're going to add a lot more new
things so guys this one actually is
pretty simple to jailbreak you can you
can go ahead and just use redsnow on the
same redsnow jailbreak bit many of us
have been using already that will
already job at 4.1 hey guys I wouldn't
be surprised if they update it or you
know update then maybe the base fans or
something so guys just be really careful
obviously it's Anna beta so ninety
percent of you guys aren't going to be
able to get in any way but guys just you
know stay away from 4.1 as always and
just in general guys of course do not
update any firmware if you're jailbroken
because you will lose your jailbreak
always you may or may not be able to
jailbreak after the fact but it's always
a good idea to you know do your research
do see what Apple's patched all kind of
stuff so guys hopefully you got you all
filled in now this should be the last
update for a little while of course
Apple's been really busy the past couple
days but yeah guys as always if you have
any questions any comments about whether
something will won't work just leave in
the comments and I'll do my best to
answer anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
