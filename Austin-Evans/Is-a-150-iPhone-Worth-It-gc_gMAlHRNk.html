guys it's Austin if this is the iPhone
5s not exactly the most cutting edge of
devices however it is now eight hundred
and fifty dollars well some people are
paying six seven eight hundred dollars
for the brand new iPhones you take just
a little step back you can save a ton of
cash and the reason is this is on a
prepaid carrier there are actually
multiple ways to get this for $150 and
the cool thing is you still have no
contract so you own the phone outright
and as someone who used the 5s for a
little while this is a lot of phone $450
this design has held up really well so
sure the 5s is a couple years old at
this point however it's still all
aluminum it's all glass
you've got the chamfered edges it's a
little bit of a small foam but this
absolutely still holds up and of course
the most important underrated feature
the iPhone 5s is stands up unlike you
know every other phone ever the box
should look really familiar
so here we have our Apple paperwork and
stickers you get the power adapter
itself with a lightning cable and you
get the non courage edition of the
earpods this might only cost 150 dollars
but you're getting the exact same
experience from with this cost over 600
the cool part about having an iPhone
that's this inexpensive is it's actually
even cheaper than iPod Touch so this is
a great first device to give to a kid
who maybe is not ready for a smart phone
however when they are throw a SIM card
in here and you've got a fully working
smartphone this is still very much a
modern iPhone so you have the Lightning
connector you have bluetooth 4.0 so it
work off all the latest accessories like
the Apple watch really the only
downgrade is that it has a headphone
jack and of course there's no way anyone
would ever want a headphone jack that's
so ancient and useless right this design
really has held up well even though it's
a few years old apple just released a
few months ago the iPhone se and design
wise it's almost impossible to tell them
apart to put things in perspective
another phone you can get for around
$150 is the Moto G for now this is not a
bad phone at all however when you put it
side-by-side with the 5s well that's a
bigger phone sure the plastic bill just
cannot hold up with you really nice
metal and glass here something cool
about the 5s is that even a couple years
later it is still fully up to date on
iOS 10
knowing apples track record I won't be
surprised to see this get updates for at
least another couple years not something
you can say about all other budget
smartphones probably the biggest
downside of using the 5s in 2016 is the
display now it's not exactly a bad
screen we've got a four inch display
with a resolution of 11 36 by 640 the
issue is it's just small that's not to
say that apps don't work on the 5s
but everything is just tiny so the
keyboard is well it takes some getting
used to especially if you used any kind
of reasonable sized smartphone over the
last couple years and abs tend to have a
little bit more of a compact view isn't
that a deal-breaker and some people
might in fact like the smaller size but
it is definitely gonna take some getting
used to if you are coming from a larger
phone there are also cool features like
touch ID normal fingerprint sensors have
become very common on the higher end of
smartphones on the budget side they're
pretty rare and while this is the first
generation of touch ID honestly it's
really hard to distinguish the
difference between this and what you
would find on the iPhone 7 and that
really is one of the advantages of
buying an older flagship so something
like the Moto G 4 which is built with a
budget in mind has to make some
sacrifices on performance side on the
build quality side where something like
this was built to be as high end of a
phone as you could get sure it's a
couple years old at this point but it's
really hard to tell this is this is it's
hard to get over the idea this is a
hundred and fifty dollar smartphone I am
curious about the performance story
though so when the 5s came out it was
hands-down one of these fastest phones
you could buy so with a couple years
advantage and a few more cores to work
with how does the g4 stack up
oh it didn't even win a multi-threaded
okay so I think that just settles it
right there the moto G for it's not a
bad phone it's not a slow phone with a
5s it's just in a different league gave
me why is the 5s is no slouch so even
with the newer titles such as asphalt
extreme but are we getting a nice smooth
frame rate but this still actually looks
pretty decent although my driving skills
are not so decent one thing I'm really
curious about is camera performance so
when the 5s came out it had a great
camera however the last few years have
seen smartphone cameras especially in
the budget end get so much better this
is pretty close so I think the Moto G
has the big advantage in detail so those
13 megapixels actually do make a
noticeable difference and I also think
it did a little bit of a better job with
the exposure and especially the white
balance I think is much more realistic
on the moto the iPhone shot is
definitely warmer but I do think that
there's a little bit more depth of field
maybe it's got a bigger sensor I'm not
totally sure but this is a very nice
looking shot for $150 iPhone 5s is
absolutely worth it compared to any
other budget phone in this category
you're getting better build quality more
performance a great camera there's a lot
to like here considering that this is
the cheapest way to get your hands on a
brand new iOS device there's a lot that
you can do with it and it's a gift if
you're gonna upgrade grandma to an
actual smartphone or you just want to
give us a shot so what do you guys think
about this thing definitely be sure to
let me know in the comments below and I
will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
