October Windows XP will officially be 15
years old and it has had quite the life
not only was it a big step up over the
ancient looking windows 98 and ME but it
remains one of the most popular os's
running on around 7% of computers today
that got me thinking could I build the
ultimate Windows XP gaming PC with
minimum requirements of a 233 megahertz
Pentium it's not exactly tough to run
but the tricky part are well the parts
while official Microsoft is bought for
XP ended in 2014 it's actually still
fairly well supported by hardware
companies today and that includes the
AMD FX 95 90 this obscure CPU is
actually still one of the fastest
processors ever made even a few years
later it's essentially a highly bent FX
8380 core CPU that can clock up to a
whopping 5 gigahertz with 8 cores to
work with even the fairly old piledriver
architecture can wipe the floor with a
lot of modern chips but the downside is
that it's power-hungry that's where the
as rotten 990 FX killer motherboard
comes in not only is it one of the few
boards that can handle the kind of power
that CPU needs but importantly it has
drivers available the only key thing
missing or ethernet drivers for XP but
that's easy enough to get around with a
USB Wi-Fi adapter the hardest part was
actually finding a graphics card both
AMD and NVIDIA stop supporting XP years
ago but luckily AMD did make a driver
for the Radeon r9 270x one of the newest
cards that will still work on XP another
limitation is memory even though they
later made a 64-bit version we're using
the standard 32-bit edition of XP which
tops out at 4 gigs of memory one area
where we have no problems is with an SSD
a 256 gigabyte crutial MX 100 works just
fine the real question is how does
Windows XP run at 5 gigahertz in a word
fast really fast
it's nearly indistinguishable from a
modern OS when you add a fast CPU on SSD
there's no delay in basic tasks and even
web browsing feels just as quick as
anything else
unfortunately most browsers no longer
support XP but Firefox is the exception
for now but even so I wouldn't really
recommend this as your main system
considering XP hasn't seen updates in
two years and it wasn't exactly the most
secure OS anyway the Internet is a bit
of a minefield when it comes to viruses
luckily most programs do still support
XP like CPU see where you can see the 95
90 is fully recognized as well as all
eight cores are showing up inside task
manager gpu-z also shows
r9 270x up and running no problem the
older drivers really aren't much of a
problem either considering we're limited
to DirectX 9 games anyway speaking of
there are a fair few games that will
work older titles like the original
Modern Warfare run no problem on XP no
infinite warfare require far prior to
blew my mind back in the day and it
still looks decent eight years later
it's even moderately taxing when you
crank everything up compared to Mirror's
Edge catalyst the original might not be
able to hold up but it's just as fun as
ever and again looks decent moving on to
a newer game we've got the 2013 reboot
of Tomb Raider which again looks and
works fine on XP being limited to DX 9
hurts a bit graphically but it's no big
deal of course no one's going to do all
of this just to play tomb raider you're
gonna do it to play the greatest game of
all time Windows XP pinball pushes the
hardware to the absolute limit with
cutting-edge 3d graphics intense sound
effects and most importantly the
ultimate way to waste time straight out
of 2001 another classic is minesweeper
this might not be quite as demanding but
thanks to our eight core 5 gigahertz
processor we're able to get it to just
barely playable framerates
so should you build the most overkill
Windows XP gaming rig of all time
probably not XP is best left to a
virtual machine or second partition but
then again the siren song of pinball is
hard to resist smash that like button if
you guys enjoyed this look back and let
me know in the comments below what crazy
PC build I should do next
anyway guys thank you so much for
watching and I will catch you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
