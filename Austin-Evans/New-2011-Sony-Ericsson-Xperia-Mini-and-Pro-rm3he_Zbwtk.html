latest smartphones the second-generation
Xperia mini and Xperia Pro both phones
forced several key improvements over the
predecessors although not name which
certainly could make it tricky to
decipher between the new and older
versions of the phones to begin let's
take a look at the Xperia Mini it
features a new three inch multi-touch
display with Sony's Bravia Engine and
Reality Display if it looks anything
like the same technology on the Xperia
Arc that I can safely say that the
display is going to be somewhere between
great and outstanding it also features
what is currently the latest version of
Android 2.3 Gingerbread you will also
find the same second-generation one
gigahertz Snapdragon processor for many
other Sony Ericsson phones a five
megapixel rear facing camera with
support for 720p HD video recording as
well as a reported 30% boost in battery
life the new experience should be
available in many worldwide markets in
the third quarter of this year most
likely around August next we have the
second-generation Xperia Pro just like
before the pro is very similar to the
mini with the addition of a slide-out
physical QWERTY keyboard
this means that should retain all the
same features and specs including the
one gigahertz processor 3 inch display
and Android 2.3 Gingerbread but in an
ethic of the design for those of you who
prefer a physical keyboard the Xperia
Pro will also be available later this
year so there you have it the
second-generation Xperia mini and Xperia
Pro personally I'm quite impressed with
both as they make considerable strides
forward with plenty of power pectin is
still compact chassis of course be sure
to let me know what you think in the
