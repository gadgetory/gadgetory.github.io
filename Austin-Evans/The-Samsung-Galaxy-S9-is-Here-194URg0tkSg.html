chance to head out to San Francisco to
get a sneak peek at the brand new
Samsung Galaxy S 9 and s 9 plus design
wise is definitely an evolution over the
Galaxy S 8 so just like when you went
from the s6 to the s7 it wasn't huge
difference on the surface the s9 looks
very similar I'm definitely not going to
complain the s8 already had one of the
nicest looking designs on the market and
here we're keeping that same infinity to
display but it's going to be about 15
percent brighter as well as with some
slightly smaller bezels evolution not
revolution amazingly enough something
else that carries over is the headphone
jack yes my friend you heard correctly
this is a flagship for 2018 which has a
headphone jack for real though props the
Samsung for keeping it around while
pretty much everyone has abandoned it a
lot of people still really do appreciate
having a headphone jack and with the s9
it's can become the only high-end
options with one in fact the audio side
of things to seen upgrade across the
board as Samsung took a page out of the
iPhone playbook and switched over to
stereo speakers what they're doing is
combined the standard bottom firing
speaker from the s8 with the speaker
grille that's going to give you a decent
sounding stereo setup now it's not going
to be quite as nice sounding as the
iPhone 10 or pixel but it is a huge
improvement over the previous generation
in my brief time with the s9 it sounds
pretty good and on top of that you're
going to be getting Dolby Atmos support
so this works not only with the speakers
as well as the headphone jack and while
for normal stuff it's not going to sound
amazing
it is cool to have that codec built in
something helps improve this time around
is the fingerprint sensor after
basically every tech reviewer on the
planet complained about the galaxy s 8
as well as the node 8 is now been moved
below the camera in addition to moving
it is also now a little bit raised so
especially when you're just trying to
reach the fingerprint sensor from the
back without looking at it it's much
easier to find this 9 is going to be
available in three colors here in the US
black blue and pink personally I really
like to look at the blue especially when
the light hits that I think it looks
really really nice but in a lot of
international markets you're also going
to get a gray option the rest of the
design should look very similar you're
still getting USBC fast wireless
charging as well as ip68 water
resistance look it is definitely not
some huge overhaul but Samsung took the
print everything that was good about the
galaxy s 8 and just cranked it up to 11
with the s 9 - big thumbs up for me
inside you're getting the brand new
qualcomm snapdragon a 45 processor with
four gigs of RAM on the
in six gigs on the s9 plus not only is
this going to be the first phone
launching with it but you're also going
to be getting a twenty five to thirty
five percent performance improvements
I'll have to take a closer look when I
get the s9 in for review but based on
first impressions is blisteringly fast
although that shouldn't exactly be a
surprise because that's basically every
flagship from the last few years now the
software is still very much an evolution
of Samsung skin on Android it's fine
it's usable it's not something that's
going to be a deal-breaker but it is
going to be nowhere near as clean as
what you're going to find on the pixel
bixby is also back and improved with the
same wonderful BIC speed button so
there's a few improvements so you can
now use Google Translate to translate
text light as opposed to taking a photo
but for the most part I think everyone
is just going to ignore it and use
Google assistant or at least that's what
I'm gonna do one thing that hasn't
really been improved is battery life so
the sizes are going to be the exact same
3000 milliamp hours on the s9 and 3500
on the s9 + new unless they've gotten
some crazy efficiency boosts it's going
to be fairly similar to last year which
is to say decent but not spectacular
especially in a world where the iPhone
10 and pixel 2 XL can easily last all
day and then some the screen under the
hand is still phenomenal so it's very
similar to last year's phones which is
to say about as good as it gets on a
phone today
so it's going to be a little bit
brighter about 15% or so on the max
brightness but for the most part it's
going to be right up there with the very
best that you can buy one of the most
exciting updates is with the camera so
well the s8 had basically the same
camera from the s7 the new Galaxy S 9 is
going to have an all new camera sensor
as well as it's going to be getting a
telephoto option if you jump up to the
galaxy s 9 plus the coolest party trick
is an adjustable aperture so this is
typically found on higher in cameras
what's going to allow you to do is
actually adjust the amount of light
coming into the shot so you have two
options here F 1.5 or F 2.4 now unlike a
normal camera you don't have any options
in between but it is really nice to be
able to have at least some flexibility
when you take a shot so for example when
you open it all the way up well it's
going to be a little bit softer your
lighting a lot more light in a low light
situation whereas we are out here in a
nice bright day you might want to close
down a little bit to get that extra bit
of sharpness speaking up low-light there
are also some other improvements
including taking up to 8 shots and
combining them into one to be able to
get better noise processing as well as
they had a little demo set up where you
could actually see some of the low-light
photos in action and it was very very
dark so it looked pretty
but of course this is something I'm
going to have to try when I get in for a
full review now with the promo now I do
have the normal options to be able to
adjust things like shutter speed and ISO
you also can adjust the aperture here
but on top of that there's also a new
mode super slow motion which will record
it up to 960 frames per second the way
it works is that will start recording
standard 720p video at a normal frame
rate and then either when you manually
trigger it or you can set up a zone that
will automatically trigger when it
detects motion it will court a quick
burst of 960 frames per second video
it's not going to be the sharpest thing
in the world you can do some really cool
things with this and it's all made
possible by the fact that this new
sensor has memory stack actually on top
of it very similar to some of the Sony
stuff and for example the rx100 mark 5
now this does mean that you can't
exactly set it to 960 frames per second
and let it do super slow motion all day
long but when you get those short little
bursts with standard video around it
even though it's not the sharpest thing
in the world you get some really cool
effects video on the hole is actually
pretty impressive so in addition to your
standard 1080p and 4k modes which is the
4k actually now goes up to 60 frames per
second but you're also going to be
getting two options to record either to
h.264 or the new one more efficient H
EVC codec as far as the telephoto camera
on the galaxy s 9 plus it's fine it's
not exactly going to be great and some
of the portrait mode shots I took
actually aren't that impressive looking
but for the most part the standard
camera on the s9 and the s9 plus is
going to look phenomenal Samsung is also
introducing a brand new revolutionary
feature called AR emoji so totally
unlike an emoji on the iPhone 10 this
uses the front-facing camera
to paste a very very scary version of
your face on an emoji which then will be
hilariously shared out not only as a
photo or video if you want to record
that but as a series of stickers that go
to your camera roll the Samsung Galaxy S
9 will be available for pre-order
starting on March 2nd and will be going
on sale on the 16th now yes it is not
going to be a huge update over the
galaxy s 8 but there's a lot of nice
little improvements here that does
actually add up to a pretty nice-looking
package so what do you guys think about
the galaxy s 9 let me know in the
comments below and I will catch you on
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
