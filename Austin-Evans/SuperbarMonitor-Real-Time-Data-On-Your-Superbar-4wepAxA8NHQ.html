today I'm here with a very useful little
piece of software called super bar
monitor using this you can easily put on
your super bar on windows 7 little icons
that will give you all kinds of useful
information such as your disk usage cpu
ram all kinds of really really neat
stuff it's only for windows 7 but if you
do have windows seven it's something
that i really recommend to get so anyway
guys let's get this one started
ok guys so the first step obviously is
going to be installing a program now
these are a series of programs there's
five of them in all and you can download
whatever you want mix and match run them
individually and the best part is none
of these are installable all of them run
just simply as a just a file on your
computer just open it up it will run
close it and delete it whatever you
don't have to worry about it you know
installing a bunch of stuff on your
computer if you don't like it just toss
the file in the trash you're done some
of you guys to download this you come to
this link I which I will have in the
description it is a German site so you
might want to run through google
translate or use chrome and it'll do it
for you but pretty simple just go
through here pick out which ones you
want you should be able to see it says
download you click the links there's
several different ones like I said and
you feel free to just download the ones
you want to use so like for example down
here yeah down here there's battery and
obviously if you're using a desktop you
don't want the battery one so guys just
go ahead and look around and pick
whichever ones you want out download
them and yeah so once you download them
I have all five right here it's very
very simple all you gotta do is just
double click on one and open it up so
let's pick the volume so we double click
it and you guys will see right down here
that we have a volume monitor so let's
go ahead and slide over here with the
rest of them so if we go ahead and look
at it you can see that my volume is low
but if I want to go ahead and turn my
volume up and you see here it stays
perfectly in sync with what my volume is
also we can go ahead and click on it and
it will tell us the volume we can
manually do it from inside the
application as well as being adobo as
well as muting so it's a pretty cool
thing now options this is pretty much
standard with throughout all the
applications you will have a general
thing that will let allow you to have
this program auto start with windows
which is pretty handy instead you know
having to open it up every time you turn
it on he'll do it for you there's a
couple other options which you might
want to experiment a little bit with I
personally didn't bother with it but
it's not bad so let me go ahead and show
you guys a couple others so you see
here's my
hard drive which just shows how much
space i'm using them a hard drive and
each one has their own individual
options but like for the example this
one like i can pick which drive and how
often i want update etc same with like
the cpu you know I want to see I want to
update like maybe I every half second or
pretty much however you want to do it so
yeah guys that is a very very cool
little piece of software called super
bar monitor like I said it's for windows
7 only unfortunately but if you do have
windows seven it's a highly recommended
upgrade and I'm enjoying it a lot anyway
guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
