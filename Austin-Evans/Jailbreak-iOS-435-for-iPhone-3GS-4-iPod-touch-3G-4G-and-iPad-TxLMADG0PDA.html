showing you how to jailbreak your iphone
ipod touch your iPad on the latest four
point three point five firmware now
before we begin there are a couple of
things I do want to go over first of all
this jailbreak does support most but not
all devices so that support the iPhone
3GS the iPhone 4 the iPod Touch 3rd
generation the iPod Touch 4th generation
as well as the iPad 1 this does not
currently support the iPad 2 in addition
it is a tethered jailbreak tethered
jailbreak means that after every single
time you need to reboot your device you
will need to rerun redstone Buddha's
tethered which I will show you guys how
to do that in just a little bit now if
you're already on some earlier version
of iOS and you can absolutely feel free
to skip four point three point four as
well as four point three point five
however if you're already on four point
three point five or if you get a new
device that comes with four point three
point five or whatever you can go ahead
and do the jailbreak all right so you
will need three things to do the
jailbreak first of all you're going to
need the red smoke program itself this
is what we're going to be using to
jailbreak your iPhone iPod Touch or iPad
now you will to download this from the
link in the description is available for
both Mac and Windows and I will be
giving the tutorial for both I know
secondly you're going to need two
firmware files you're going to need your
four point three point four firmware for
your device as well as a four point
three point five I know again I'll have
a link in the description you may
already have one or both of these on
your computer otherwise you can just
download them so again be sure to have
the link in the description for all the
information you need if you're on
Windows there's one additional step
right click the red snow executive will
file hit properties that come over to
compatibility at this point you need to
run this program in compatibility mode
for windows xp service pack 3 as well as
run this program as an administrator and
you only need to do this if you were on
Windows Vista or Windows 7 if you're on
Windows XP or some version of OS 10 you
can feel free to skip this step let's
just go ahead and open up read snow and
begin the jailbreak so the first step is
to find the IP SW now contrary to what
you might think you actually need to
find the 4.3 point for IPSW here so we
go ahead and select that give it just a
moment to process or firmer and click
Next and basically what we're doing is
tricking redstone to thinking we're on
four point three point four but the
jailbreak will indeed work for four
point three point five all right so the
next step is we have a few options
so install city is the number one most
important thing be sure that is checked
install custom bundle if you know what
you're doing with that
feel free to install that you also have
options to enable battery percentage as
well as multitask gestures now battery
percentage if you're on an iPod Touches
fan test you might as well enable that
and you can also do multitask gestures
I'm not gonna be doing that right now
we also have boots heathered right now
and that will be I will give you guys a
little demo of that in just a minute but
go ahead and just make sure that install
Cydia is checked and any other options
you want and click Next
at this point be sure to connect your
iPod iPhone or iPad via USB to your
computer now this is not an entirely
necessary step but I do recommend it and
that is to allow iTunes to fully sync
and backup all your data you shouldn't
lose any data in the jailbreak however
there's always a chance that something
could go wrong
so by doing that you will be covered all
right so now at this point we need to
put go into DFU mode if you've ever
jailbroken before especially with red
snow you're probably very familiar with
this but in case you had it that's very
simple so I will walk you through it and
of course the countdown that program
does have a countdown timer as well ice
as soon as we click Next we need to hold
the power button for three seconds and
now hold the power as well as the home
button for 10 seconds so just continue
holding it should be just about like
this 2 1 ok now release the power button
and continue holding the home button now
so 15 seconds typical it's gonna be like
6 or 7 seconds but again just hold it
until you get this screen right there ok
so now at this point we're pretty much
done we just need to allow red snow to
run through and work its magic
so it's downloading jailbreak data it's
rebooting and then also you will see
lots of lines of code running across the
device this is good this means it is
working so at this point just go ahead
and sit back it will take a few minutes
to run through and get everything
properly set up so I'll be right back as
soon as it's done ok so we're all done
just simply slide to unlock and if you
scroll over to your last page you will
now see Cydia however we're not quite
done yet
Justin Sierra if you open it it's not
really gonna do anything so now what we
need to do is go back into red stove and
boot is tether so everything will work
properly ok so now this point me to
reopen red snow and go through the same
process as we did before just let your
for point three point four IPSW Lots
process and all that kind of stuff now
instead of running the full jailbreak
however we're just going to need to boot
as tethered this is something I
definitely want to stress just be sure
to collect just boot tether I now ignore
everything else there's something I
definitely want to stress that you're
going to you have to do this every
single time you reboot your device so
whether you install something like
winter board and
to reboot people need to rerun red snow
or for any reason so it's not like you
just have to run this once and do it
forever every single time you need to
reboot you will need to reread red snow
I want to be very clear about that so
let's go ahead and pull our device on
screen and resize it so you can see
again we just need to go into DFU mode
just like we did before
ok so we're all done now this time if we
scroll over to our second page you will
now see city installed so soon as you
see this you're pretty much good to go
it'll ask who are you you can just let
to wherever you like have done and allow
it to fully sync for the first time city

you how to jailbreak your iPhone iPod
Touch or iPad on iOS 4.3 point 5 anyway
