episode of d3 live so today I'm going to
be talking about a really big topic it's
going to be Android versus iOS vs
windows phone 7 vs webos now I've been
very fortunate enough to be able to use
all four of these platforms pretty
extensively over the past month fact
I've got a couple of the phones right
here and I'd like to do is talk a little
bit about some of the pros and cons of
each operating system so unlike you know
when you're buying a computer you okay
well I'm going to buy windows or mac
it's it's basically really simple if
your goodbyes to the phone there are a
lot of choices and indeed they're even
more than what i'm talking about
including blackberry and several others
but i'm going to be focusing on are the
four major in my opinion platforms of
course being webos and etc eccentric
cetera the first one I want to start
with is webos and some just got happen
to have a veer right here on webos is a
fantastic operating system that's been
around for a couple of years and but
it's got if anyone if you any of you
guys have ever used it you'll know
that's a fantastic operating system the
multitasking is top-notch you can run
tons applications at a time it's really
simple to use the gestures and whatnot
and it works really really well and I'm
a big fan now since palm or who used to
make webos was bought by HP they're just
now starting to release some new phones
they're starting to get in your web West
to al they're really moving forward and
we're getting some new stuff and I'm a
huge fan of webos especially after using
the beer for a couple of days there's
some really nice things like and
kindness on here and there's some really
nice things about the veer and webos in
general and I'm a huge fan of them
however it's not perfect I have found
some recent glitch eNOS and laggy and
all that kind of stuff which is really
not all that prevalent in iOS and etc
webos is a fantastic operating system
and then moving on I'll talk a little
bit about iOS of course this is the
operating system that the iphone ipod
touch ipad they all run now as far as
iOS goes again it is probably the
longest running OS here it's not really
but it's one of the most mature since
its own version for you know they've had
lots of time to iron out the kinks and
features all that kind of stuff and it
definitely shows well you can hand in by
an ipod or an iphone they turn it on
you're just swipe to unlock tap on
whatever app that you want to go to it's
just as simple as that you know iOS is
very centered around user friendliness
getting you to where you need to be when
you need to be there now on the other
hand though iOS is a bit stale of course
you know there are some things you can
do you can multitask fine like that kind
of stuff but when you look at web OS
which is absolutely fantastic
multitasking you look at Android which
has widgets which has a lot more
openness you can download all kinds of
stuff when you look at the fantastic
version rather the fantastic OS and you
I of Windows Phone 7 you can say that
iOS is getting a little bit stale I'm
definitely looking forward to seeing
what they put out in iOS 5 they're
moving long do we can talk really
briefly about android android of course
is all over the place you know you can't
go anywhere without finding an Android
this and Android fat you mean androids
all over the place now if you're not
familiar with what Android really is put
simply it's google's phone OS so
Google's created an OS it's on currently
on version 2.3 right now and they've
done a lot of stuff with it you know
it's got a nice UI it's very open so you
can do all kinds of you know crazy stuff
like download applications the Apple
would never dream of letting you do I
mean there's also a lot of really cool
things about Android that allows you to
do some nice stuff like you have phones
with keyboards with headphones without
keyboards phones with two inch screens
phones with four and a half inch frames
mean there's a wide variety of hardware
that you can get android on and that
makes it a fantastic choice for a lot of
people now the last one I want to talk
about is Windows Phone 7 now this is
Microsoft's even though it's technically
the 7th version really it's a brand new
from scratch operating system now if
you've never tried windows phone 7 I
highly recommend you do so as far as
just the overall UI and the way it works
it's very very unique so instead of like
for webos rio s or something like this
right here it's very very cool as it
allows you to have a I believe they call
the Metro UI where it's a very stylized
and very interesting-looking operating
system to use another are some downsides
to Windows Phone 7 now while it's on
several carriers and they're starting to
develop if you're looking for like a
phone like with you know really
something specific like a 4.3 inch
screen or this is that you're going to
probably need to look to Android because
Windows Phone 7 is just now getting
started there are only a handful of
Windows Phone 7 devices on the market
but there's a lot to like about it and
it's certainly one of my favorite
operating systems to use okay so for the
second
III live I'll be taking live questions
from everyone in the chat so as always
every episode III life is filling from a
live audience we've got quite a few
people in the room right now so let's
just take some questions what are the
best features of Windows Phone 7 well in
my opinion the number one features to
you I it's a very very unique UI and i
wish i had i don't have one on hand to
show you guys but I'm just definitely
look it up and take a look at some
pictures and video or better yet try to
take a look at one in person it's really
unique you I it's very smooth smooth
very fluid it's really nothing like the
android and iOS and all the devices that
we currently use right now so that's
number one feature it just looks totally
different there are also some nice
things that I think that where it's
headed right now like for example is
going to be getting better multitasking
but just got cut copy and paste so
there's a lot of reasons why Windows
Phone 7 is really taking off in a good
direction as web a wet still hostile 0
friendly if so would you recommend it to
him yes the hospital 0 is actually here
amazingly enough uh uh yeah the web list
is really friendly for a lot of people i
mean i've seen some people who kind of
like a little intimidated like it seems
complicated and stuff but it's
absolutely not in fact one of the great
things i love about webos is that
there's no home button there's no
buttons of any really tight as far as
you except for you know you're locking
your volume rocker and everything and
that's because everything is using
gestures so for example let's say i'm
using this i'm in the browser so i want
to go back one step looking for a button
or something I just swipe on the bottom
little gesture area goes back unless I
want to change a different application
just swipe up the card comes up and then
I can go scroll between them so there's
a lot of really nice user-friendly
things and that's one of the things I
love I mean there's no buttons there's
no even capacitive buttons I mean you
just swipe it's just the most natural
thing in the world so yeah I absolutely
do love webos and while of course it's
not perfect either as far as the general
use the core of it use abilities
absolutely rock-solid keys install
android on an iOS device yes you can
under certain circumstances so yeah you
can't install android and there's my dog
you can't install android on an iphone
2g on iphone 3g or an ipod touch 1st
generation it's called the I droid
project so you guys can feel pretty
google that and get all the information
but you can run it on certain devices
and other working on trying to get
android up on all kind so definitely
some pretty cool stuff
which one is the most stable I know
that's actually a great question of
course it's very very important um as
much as I love webos is certainly not
the most stable operating system in the
world windows phone 7 is not half bad
but I think iOS is probably going to be
the best just because it's been around
for so long but I've had lots of time to
work out all the little bugs and issues
and have a lot kind of stuff I've been
an iOS user for several years now and it
was not that bad you know three years
ago and it's even better now so I would
say I list is probably the most stable
of I probably the most boring one if I
was buying a new phone today for under
two and fifty dollars what i recommend
with the following do with the following
os's now that's a really difficult
question I mean every person's taste is
very mean for example do you want a
landscape keyboard do you want no
keyboard at all do you want a small
screen large screen you know it what
carrier there's a ton of different
factors and I really just can't say
there's one particular phone or there's
one particular OS it's way better than
all of them that's everyone who's
watching this video should get it but i
think that they each do have their pros
and cons for example like iOS if you
want an iphone but you want a physical
keyboard nothing you can do there you
know if you want webos phone let the you
know i can 4.3 inch display up there's
nothing you can do there so i just
really recommend take a look at the
different carrier options that you have
whatever carrier that you're on take a
look at you know what kind of features
are most important to you and kind of go
from there so anyway guys that's about
it for this week's episode of d3 lot I
