with a demo of voice utils now this is a
very cool Cydia tweak that allows Siri
to open up a wide variety of different
things so let's go ahead just give you
guys an example open camera and as you
guys can see here will open up the
camera application
now also works for quite a few others
open music man as you guys can see here
it'll open up the first party
applications is no problem but we can
even do third party apps open Angry
Birds and you guys can see here is a
very very quick very snappy we're gonna
shut that off but it works really quite
nicely so just to give you guys another
example open jetpack and there we go
jetpack joyride is up and running voice
utils also handle some cool system tasks
so for example unlock susiecakes and see
here will unlock your phone for you now
if you do have a passcode lock on it it
does respect that but otherwise it's a
pretty cool thing but let's G oh you got
something maybe a little bit more useful
reboot and there you go so it will
reboot your phone anyway guys as you can
see voice she tells us a really really
cool little program open Cydia and you
know I never get tired of that now the
version that I'm showing you right here
is pre-release it's not quite done yet
you can't go ahead and download voice
utils and there's totally free in the
city right now whoever the functionality
I showed as far like opening apps and
stuff is not quite out however it has
been submitted to Big Boss and it should
be out hopefully in the next few hours
if you have a jailbroken device and you
want to make Siri a lot more awesome I
definitely recommend giving voice utils
a shot anyway guys if you enjoyed this
video definitely be sure to leave it a
thumbs up and if you want to be notified
