comparison between the next three
iterations of Firefox ever since
changing over to a much faster release
cycle like Chrome Mozilla has been hard
at work cranking out new version after
new version to start with we had the
latest release version Firefox six in
the beta Channel we have the nearly
complete Firefox seven and lastly still
an alpha development we have Firefox
eight the first test is going to be on
memory usage one of the biggest new
features in Firefox seven and eight is
improved handling of ramp thanks to a
new feature called mem string as you can
see here it leads to a very nice
improvement of roughly twenty-five
percent less system resources needed to
run the browser with six tabs next we
move on to the Peacekeeper benchmark
this is a fairly general overall test of
browser performance and as you can see
here Firefox 7 is a decent improvement
over spread sir surprisingly Firefox
eight does a bit worse however as it is
still in alpha there's plenty of room
for improvement before it's released
continuing on we have the v8 benchmark
this is a pure JavaScript test to
determine how quickly a browser can load
web sites such as Gmail here again
Firefox seven and eight do fairly well
in posting a modest improvement getting
away from the benchmarks there are a few
new features to go over as well firefox
7 is all about better performance with
better garbage collection css3 support
and improved password sync firefox 7 is
on track to be released late September
Firefox 8 is a smaller update largely
focusing on internet explorer 9 style
and on notifications now when you load
the browser first it will offer to let
you disable slow or unwanted add-ons
overall I'm quite impressed with what's
on the way for Firefox version 7 brings
a substantial jump in speed as well as
very welcome memory improvements that
should help improve responsiveness and
cut down on crashing firefox 8 is less
impressive however as it's still an
alpha there's plenty of room for
improvement before it's released if you
enjoyed the video be sure to leave a
thumbs up and if you're interested in
more browser test be sure to subscribe
