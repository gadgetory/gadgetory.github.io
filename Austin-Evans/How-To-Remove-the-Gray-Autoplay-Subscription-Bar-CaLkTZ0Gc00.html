on how to remove the YouTube
subscription / autoplay gray bar we're
gonna call it basically this giant thing
down here so if you don't know what this
is basically this a bar that will appear
on all of your videos or rather all of
your subscription videos so I'd let's
say I'm going to go ahead and you know
click on a video well this is going to
pop up and it's gonna autoplay every
single video now if you're like me you
find this really annoying as not only I
mean guys you can see this is a takes up
a huge amount of space especially on a
laptop as well as the autoplay you can
go ahead and shut it off but it will go
ahead and turn mic on for every single
video so that is there are actually two
different ways to go ahead and remove
this okay so the first one is really
simple all you have to do is just come
up to the URL and find the + sign where
it'll say play next etc etc go ahead
click here dry it backward and then
backspace and hit Enter when you do this
it will remove it unfortunately though
this will not really help you that much
as every single video you watch you will
need to do this so the other more the
other simpler method is to go ahead and
come over here if you're on Google
Chrome now I will mention there is a
grease monkey script on Firefox that you
can use but I prefer this one especially
because I like Chrome but this one's a
lot simpler all you have to do is while
you're running Chrome just go ahead and
come to the link I'll have this in the
description and just install it
basically this will automatically remove
it so I'm just go ahead hit install
let's go ahead and show so let's go
ahead and come out to subscriptions and
let's just pick this video for example
so now you'll see it starts to load and
then it doesn't so guys this is a really
really simple video I just had a lot of
people asking about it and really you
know wanting to know how to get rid of
it so this is just a really simple way
to do it just install the script anyway
guys thanks for watching
okay since you've watched the video this
far I have a little secret take a close
look through the video you just watched
I left a secret annotation and now if
you find the annotation and see what it
leads to post a comment below</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
