exactly would you want to buy one let's
take a look
and I can't slow down no can you feel it
the Reno stopping now feet off the
ground hand to the sky
yeah with my side doing my vision
directly we collide at number five we
have TV integration with the Xbox one
all right so this probably sounds a
little boring
I mean who buys a game console just so
they can watch TV however there's just a
little bit more to it than that
if you take a look at the back of the
Xbox one you'll find an HDMI IN port
which you're supposed to use with your
cable or satellite box and it works just
fine you can play games and watch TV at
the same time or use Kinect to change
the channel with your voice but since
it's just a normal HDMI port there's
nothing stopping you from plugging in
another game console want to place in
GTA 5 hook up your 360 and bam you've
got your game running inside the Xbox
one this does add a little lag so you
probably won't want to play all games
like this but it's a really cool little
feature you can even play a 360 and xbox
one game at the same time well if you're
totally crazy anyway and while you're at
it why not play some Wii while I'm
waiting for the new Super Smash Brothers
I guess I can buy my time by playing
some brawl on the Xbox one of course you
can plug your cable box into the Xbox
one too I mean you know if that's what
you're into coming in at number four is
streaming and recording your games I'm
sure a lot of you have heard of sites
such as twitch which allow you to go
online and watch tons of people play all
sorts of different games usually this
requires either a pretty decent PC or
expensive capture cards like what I'm
using to record this video with however
with the new consoles you can capture
directly to sites like twitch and
Ustream well that is if you have a ps4
Microsoft and now streaming a few months
ago however actually didn't end up
making it for launch
luckily the ps4 has no such problems
quality isn't amazing however it's not
too bad considering as you can see not
only can you stream your gameplay but
you can also use the PlayStation camera
to add your video as well as a little
bit of commentary on the other hand
you're able to record your gameplay with
the Xbox one you can use the game DVR to
record clips as you play and like the
ps4 quality is only 720p but it's really
not too bad
you can edit gameplay on the Xbox and
send it to your SkyDrive and from there
you can upload it to youtube or do
whatever you want with it
it might not replace a dedicated
streaming setup but be
able to grab a quick clip or stream some
gameplays straight from your console is
really awesome and number three we have
the new controllers for the ps4 and Xbox
one the DualShock 3 was a good
controller and the 360 gamepad was
excellent but these new consoles step it
up a notch on the PlayStation side we're
looking at a much much better experience
than before the shape has been
redesigned to fit better in the hand and
it's also got tweaked buttons and sticks
there's now a concave shape which fits
your thumbs nicely and the triggers are
actually not terrible anymore
in comparison the Xbox one controller
isn't a huge leap but it really doesn't
have to be it's seen some tweaks to the
shape and design in both the stakes and
triggers feel better than on the 360
there's more to these controllers than a
few minor improvements however the Dual
Shock 4 comes packed with some serious
tag there's a touch pad like you'd find
on a laptop in the center along with the
built-in speaker like the Wii U there's
also an LED on the back which the
PlayStation camera can pick up to track
you in-game
the Xbox one controller might not be
quite so advanced however it does have
one awesome feature impulse triggers
while having Rumble motors is nothing
new the one also puts a pair of
vibrators inside the triggers it sounds
like a small thing but it's a really
cool addition especially in racing games
like porta where you get real feedback
when the brakes lock up or you start
smoking the tires both controllers are a
solid step forward with some cool new
features however for my money the Xbox
one has the best controller period right
now coming in at number 2 we have the
Kinect and PlayStation camera last
generation we had the first Kinect and
the PlayStation Move and both were okay
but this time around you actually might
want to use them side-by-side the Kinect
is absolutely massive however don't let
looks fool you it's a lot more useful
and it's also included with every Xbox
one with the PlayStation camera you're
also able to play if you augmented
reality games such as the playroom which
is included with every ps4 and it's no
kind of fun if you know you're into that
yeah it's it's kind of overrated though
I mean I don't really like it that much
you can also control the PlayStation 4
with your voice
PlayStation take screenshot resogun
start
on the other hand the connect is a
little more full-featured Xbox on all
might be a little creepy Kinect is
actually always on and always listening
so all I need to do is walk into a room
say Xbox on and it will automatically
turn on both your TV as well as the Xbox
you can use voice control for a lot more
than that though Xbox go to Call of Duty
ghosts Xbox snap TV Xbox go home you're
also able to use your hands to navigate
through the Xbox operating system it's
not really any faster than using the
controller or voice but it's a cool
feature Kinect can also log you in with
the camera automatically along with
telling multiple people apart without
having to sync individual controllers
all in all while the PlayStation camera
is nice the Kinect is really what gives
you that Wow
kind of next-gen feel coming in at
number one is the sheer power of the new
consoles as great as the Xbox 360 and
ps3 are after seven years they're really
starting to show their age take a look
at the ps4 and Xbox one and you'll see
that they solidly move the needle
forward
inside you'll find each has an 8 core
AMD processor and GCN based graphics
they might not be able to match up with
a $2,000 computer but these new consoles
have a lot in common with gaming PC's
the graphics inside both consoles are
basically the same thing as you'll find
in an AMD graphics card the ps4 actually
takes this a step forward with the full
eight gigabytes of superfast gddr5
memory which is more than what you'll
find and even $1000 graphics cards
having a full eight cores to play with
also allows you to do multiple things at
once for example play a game as well as
take a Skype call all of this tech
jargon equals some awesome graphics rise
center of Rome on the Xbox one really
shows how much more power we've got now
compared to the last gen and Killzone
Shadowfall
as a ps4 exclusive that's got tons of
great lighting effects in depth of field
we've got Fortson motorsport 5 for the
Xbox one which is a solid racing game
that runs at full 1080p and finally
there's battlefield 4 for both consoles
that nicely wraps up solid graphics and
great gameplay all this together makes
me really excited to be a gamer right
now there is so much awesome stuff
however what do you guys think what is
your favorite feature of the Xbox one
and ps4 definitely be sure to let me
know
