Air and for $1200 there's been a lot of
controversy about the performance of
this laptop and on top of that just
exactly what's inside this thing so of
course the question is how powerful is
it really interestingly there's only a
single processor option for the MacBook
Air this year it is a dual core Core i5
8210 why this is an eighth generation Y
series processor which does give it a
dual-core chip with hyper-threading and
the clock speeds actually aren't all
that impressive
is it 1.6 gigahertz base and a 3.6
gigahertz boost a far cry from a lot of
the quad core systems that you can often
find this price point so there's some
interesting things with this chip first
of all it has UHD 617 graphics something
I've never seen any kind of Intel chip
yet and also interestingly this is a 7
watt TDP so what that means is that most
of these white series processors are
used and things like the 12-inch MacBook
now that does not have any kind of fan
and originally I was actually told at
the Apple event that this MacBook Air is
fanless however a lot of reports have
shown this actually doesn't a fan also I
update it and heard the fan so let's
open it up and see what's actually
inside I thought we had to like clarify
that I heard a loud fan is usually a
pretty good indicator there's a fan
inside just saying take this off and
immediately we see that there is a fan
so it should be a big surprise so what's
kind of interesting about the MacBook
Air this year is that this is one of
these smallest fans I've ever seen for
cooling in a laptop now this is actually
not strictly necessary if they would
have gone for a slightly lower NY series
processor with a lower flight 5 watt TDP
for example the fan would have not have
been necessary but on the flip side that
means that you're really relying on a
lot of other issues with cooling so say
you're in a very hot environment the
actual chassis of the computer really
can't dissipate as much heat whereas
adding even a small fan like this should
make a big difference and it gives you
the added benefit of getting a couple
extra watts of TDP which will give you a
little bit more performance I will say
it is a very very clean layout so now
that we have the trackpad here but we
also have our three battery cells now
what's interesting about this battery is
that at least based on the rumors and
certainly taking a look at it seems to
sort of back that up is that unlike most
MacBook Pros that are current where you
kind of have to replace a large chunk of
the laptop to be able to get rid of the
batteries with this it looks like you
could probably swap these out pretty
easily you also see the fairly large
speakers and then we've got what is a
pretty
small motherboard and I assume that's
probably our t2 chip underneath here hey
look at that the Apple t2 chip so this
is actually very similar to some of the
SSDs that you'll find inside an iPhone
but this handles a lot of these sort of
lower end processes on the macbook
including encrypting the SSD running
your touch ID
it's got secure Enclave it's got the ISP
which runs the webcam there's a lot of
very smart things that are on the iPhone
it all run from this tiny little t2 chip
alright so with the computer put back
together let's actually see how it
performs starting out with we do have
Geekbench which is the classic all right
there we go
4301 on single core and 7725 on
multi-core it is an upgrade over the
last generation MacBook Air but it is
not a big upgrade over well much
anything else I mean sure it's decent as
a dual core we really have moved on to
quad core across the board for the most
part now except we have the Geekbench
compute test this one's kind of
interesting because this does have a
unique GPU I've never seen these 617
available now it is one of the Intel UHD
series GPU so it's probably not going to
be anything crazy but maybe a little bit
faster
maybe they added two more numbers to the
last when I tested this is 22 135 that
actually a little bit faster no to be
fair I'm running metal right now but
that's actually pretty decent so that's
a fair bit over the 615 and that's
closer to what you would find with the
for UHD 620 graphics I've got to say
we're just getting in the video and I've
already found some interesting stuff
with this MacBook let's keep going and
get into a little bit of Cinebench so
what's interesting here is I actually
think the Y series processors have been
changed this generation so not to get
too far into nerd town but traditionally
Y Series on the Intel side means it's
their very very low TDP chips which are
traditionally used in fanless designs
now obviously this is slightly higher
and it is of course using a very small
fan but instead of getting the
traditional dual-core chip with the
low-end GPU
we're getting the same low-end CPU so
obviously we need to keep that TDP low
we are getting that bigger GPU so for
context the 12-inch MacBook is $100 more
expensive and with that you get the core
m3 and that's not even really going to
be on par with what we're getting out of
this you really would need to bump up to
something closer to the core i7 to get
equivalent clock speeds and I don't
think you're going to get anywhere near
that same GPU performance
all right so 121 on single core and 250
on multi-core
that's not that impressive to be totally
honest it's fine but it's basically what
I would expect out of a wiser
like the 12-inch MacBook for example the
GPU though that's what I want to see
right now
32 yeah there we go again so with the
12-inch MacBook you're looking at a
score roughly around 25 24 something
like that so 32 is a pretty decent bump
now all of this being said this is not
an incredibly powerful laptop right I
mean this is still a MacBook Air it's
still got a dual-core processor but it's
basically especially on that GPU side
I'm pretty impressed next up let's test
the SSD performance on the MacBook Air
now I do have the base model which has a
very very tiny 128 gigs of storage kind
of not even cool at this point but well
okay that's pretty cently fast so 1917
megabytes per second on the read and 476
on the right that's pretty solid so for
context that's faster than any other one
swing a gig drive I've tested and it's
not too far off of the 13-inch MacBook
Pro with the 256 gig drive this is a
very fast SSD next step we have
something a little bit more intense a
full 4k video edit inside Final Cut Pro
10 so for reference this is a project
from the disses channel so it's almost
exactly five minutes long and it's a mix
of pro res a lot of graphics and stock
footage and it's about I don't know 70%
renders or so so let's kind of scrub
through here it's performance actually
holding up reasonably well oh and just
so you guys know I am editing off of a
samsung t3 SSD mostly because there's
not enough storage in the macbook to fit
well anything but especially not a bunch
of 4k video I mean that's not bad it's
definitely able to play it back but I'm
curious about is what the actual export
times will be so with a fully rendered
timeline of pro res 42 let's see how
long this five-minute 4k video takes to
export so settings are correct
this is h.264 alright ready set go
all right so just over 6 1/2 minutes to
render a 5 and a timeline no no you're
not going to want to spend a lot of time
editing on the MacBook Air specifically
with 4k footage but it is possible
however we have a slightly different
method for speeding things up in true
building the ultimate fashion map repair
supports full Thunderbolt 3 which means
that we can add an external GPU because
why not
so this is the gigabyte gaming box with
a full AMD rx 580 GPU inside now
recently Final Cut has received full
support for external GPUs and especially
with such a thin and light laptop like
this I'm curious to see just how well it
performs now we know we don't have any
kind of crazy scientific tests here what
I do have is well a curiosity of how far
we can actually push it so specifically
with final cut it does look like the GPU
is being used it's hard to benchmark
exactly how much of a difference it
makes
but just for some reference here this is
all playing back at higher quality and I
am running it at full 4k and an
unrendered timeline and the computer is
able to keep up reasonably well so we
were going to try fortnightly running on
the internal GP of the MacBook but I
don't want to be here all night so let's
uh get big scroungy for you going ah why
do we ever try to play fortnight on Mac
there's always such a disaster or just
waiting and crashing and just being
garbage so the new MacBook Air is a
little bit more powerful than I expected
but it is definitely did you switch did
you start loading what are you serious
it actually took 20 minutes - oh ok
alright hopefully you guys enjoyed this
video the 13-inch MacBook Air is a
little bit more powerful I expected and
you can't do some stuff with it but
don't get your hopes up like playing the
game of fortnight or anything
if you're bored though you can feel free
to check out this is where there's lots
of it is that aren't boring if you'll
excuse me
going to go be really frustrated it why
this is taking 20 minutes to load and
then logs me out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
