today I'm here with a review of touch
Mouse
it's a new application by Logitech and
basically it allows you to use your iPod
or iPhone as a touchpad slide keyboard
on your computer it's pretty cool you
guys might know there were a couple
other apps to do similar things to this
but what's really good about this app is
it's 100% free so I'm going to show you
guys how to use it there's little it's
not quite just download it and use it
there's a little bit of a setup involved
but show you guys how to download it use
it and get all set up and use your iPod
Touch or iPhone as a tri pad it's pretty
cool stuff anyway let's get this one
started
okay so obviously the first step is
going to be just downloading the
application just search either touch
Mouse or load you to Logitech I'd see
that Rock Logitech I search it in the
App Store you know it's real simple it
is free so go ahead just download and
install it
now before we again let me just make
sure that you guys it'll work for you is
all you need basically is Wi-Fi so if
you have Wi-Fi hooked up in your house
and you have one computer hooked up to
the network and then obviously your iPod
or iPhone you'll be all set so just
download the application and backup okay
now you'll see I had it right here but
by itself it's not gonna work we can go
ahead and open it but this is all you're
not gonna actually gonna work it's gonna
say please select a server or enter your
computer's IP address now we will get to
this in a second but first you had
should have to hook your computer up and
get it running so I'm gonna show you
guys how to get the software everything
on that side first right now okay guys
so now that you have the application
downloaded and installed on your iPod or
iPhone now come over to your computer
and we go ahead and get set up on this
end it's very simple you will need to
download a piece of software but it's
very small and it should be a big deal
so go ahead and open up your web browser
of choice and then you need to go to
logitech comm slash touch Mouse
I'll have the link in the description so
come here and it will come to this page
it's very simple totally free like I do
is pick your operating system just go
ahead and click it so you go you have OS
10 Windows 7 Vista or XP so I'll have
Windows 7 so you click your right one
and then you select the file and you see
the 32-bit or 64-bit download it install
it it's very very small you know it'll
take you about a minute to download and
install it all together it's very very
quick so once you have that done and
installed you're pretty much set you
don't need to configure anything or
pretty much do anything at all besides
just download and install it it'll
automatically run the background and any
time you need to use the application
your computer will automatically
recognize it and everything so let's go
ahead and give you guys a demo ok so now
that we have the software installed on
the computer and we have the touch Mouse
on the on your iPod rifle let's go ahead
and show you guys how it works
so ch come to your iPod or iPhone will
an open up the application I do is you
let it load now if you see here up top
now where it says complete select a
server it has my PC name so I hit it
give it just a second to load and we are
in so you see here on right there
it says touch smells so let's go ahead
and you start using it so if you see
here right up there it was really quite
nicely so I'm gonna go ahead and get
this off screen and open some stuff up
for you guys so it's really simple
we can use two fingers scrolling so you
just like that if you see here along the
top we have the left center and right
mouse click so I want to right click
this one so I just click this and I have
my full menu and there's a lot of cool
things um said you have to finger
scrolling no pinch to zoom or anything
but it still works pretty nicely so I
can go ahead obviously if I want I can
go ahead and you know open anything up I
like mmm and it works pretty nice but I
will say one thing guys one thing you
will definitely need to do is fix the
settings so on bottom here you'll see
there's a couple things keyboard which I
get to a second disconnect which is
pretty obvious you just disconnect it
shut off and settings so you probably
want open up settings now in settings
there's some different things like such
as two finger scrolling etc but what you
want to look at is scrolling speed and
tracking speed tracking speed I've
cranked way boy down I mean it was just
darting all around the screen that great
at all and scrolling speed this is the
same but beyond that up pretty much left
everything else alone it works pretty
well so let's go ahead and show you guys
the keyboard so let's let's rename all
these files so hey guys this one so
let's do is right-click it come over
here and hit rename so if we see here
and pull keyboard
so I'm if you look at the keyboard we
have the full keyboard as well as we
have the windows gene which I'm going
hit that for you guys real fast there we
go
so you see here mm-hmm there we go
you see here you also have your other
keys but we can go ahead and type
something so well i'm bevvan idiot at
pressure done that so let's go ahead and
right click my file again hit rename so
let's go ahead and put the keyboard in
us rename it so we rename it test you
see the text comes up on the keyboard
and it also comes across on the screen
too well it's pretty good so as soon as
we're done we'll go ahead and close it
off and then if you guys probably can't
see but it's been renamed so now we have
a video called test so yeah guys that is
just a quick little demo and review of
the logitech touch mouse application it
works really nice you'd be surprised how
nice it is to have you know with your
iPod or iPhone use it as a mouse across
the room or something because because it
works over Wi-Fi as long as they're both
connected to the same network it doesn't
matter you could be in another part of
the house or whatever so it works really
nicely and this is especially I think
would be really good for if you have you
have like a home theater computer and
you need to get your mouse and
everything just pull out your iPod and
you can you know control it on your TV
screen which I think that would probably
the best but still it works as a really
nice trackpad can you see here I mean
you have your two finger scrolling left
center right click and you have the
keyboard as well so guys I gotta say
it's pretty pretty cool I'm really
enjoying it and you'd be a little
surprised how often you use it you know
obviously I like using a mouse but you
know this is a really ignition and for
free it's pretty cool so guys I
definitely recommend it go check it out
like I just said spring the app store so
you know take a look see if you like it
anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
