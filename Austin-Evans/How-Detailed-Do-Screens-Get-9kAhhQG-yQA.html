surrounded by screens whether they're in
our pockets on our desks or in our
living rooms
you've probably heard phrases like 4k
and retina display thrown around but how
good these screens need to be surely
everything has to be good enough at some
point right the easiest way to compare
screens is the resolution basically all
modern displays are made of pixels which
are individual dots that can be whatever
color they need to be to make up an
image one pixel isn't all that important
but put a lot of them on screen and get
yourself a pretty convincing image when
someone says something is 720p or 1080p
what they're talking about is the
resolution how many pixels it has so
take this video for example if you're
watching it in full quality the
resolution is 1920 by 1080 pixels this
is known as Full HD and is what you'll
find on most TVs and even some phones
these days most people are perfectly
happy with HD it's nice and clear with
plenty of detail so what's the point of
going beyond it I mean it's not like you
can see the difference with higher
resolutions except when you can let's
take the iPhone for example when it was
launched Apple made a huge deal about
the fact that it had a Retina display
screen so pixel dense that your eyes
just can't make out the individual dots
unfortunately it's not quite that simple
and there's an easy way to see why so
grab your phone and hold it out at about
arm's length from your face now take a
close look at the screen can you make
out the pixels probably not start
pulling it closer and closer though and
you'll eventually be able to notice that
things get a little pixelate that's
because resolution is only part of the
story the size of the screen makes a big
difference in how detailed it needs to
be well we all basically take for
granted that holding our phones at arm's
length means everything is nice and
sharp if you look at a TV with the same
resolution that clothes it's going to be
a pixelated mess if you take a 60-inch
TV with the resolution of 1080p it comes
in at 36 pixels per inch where that same
HD resolution on a 5 inch smartphone
delivers over 440 PPI there's nothing
too crazy here of course if you take the
same resolution and stretch it out over
a bigger screen it's going to be less
detailed Carlton Bale has an excellent
post on his site which breaks down how
far away you have to sit from a TV to
see the
Frances in resolution for my 60-inch TV
I said about eight feet away which is
just on the edge of where you can start
to see the advantage of moving to a
higher resolution like 4k most people
won't get the full advantage of 4k
unless they have a very big TV that
they're sitting fairly close to however
the difference is much more noticeable
on a computer coming back around to
Apple they judge a Retina display on a
tablet or laptop as not being able to
see pixels at 15 to 20 inches away move
over to a desktop display though and
typically you'll be sitting less than 2
feet away
at these kinds of distances even a 4k
monitor isn't detailed enough to fool
your eyes phones aren't quite so simple
however we've had very high resolution
screens for a while however since we
keep our phone so close to our faces
they kind of have to be even though the
original Retina display on the iPhone is
mostly good enough there are definitely
cases where you can take advantage of a
higher resolution screen put it
side-by-side with the 1080p display on
the HTC One m8 and 1440p panel on the LG
g3 and up close I can make out the
difference between all three it's subtle
but with fine detail the One m8 is
noticeably sharper where the g3 is so
ridiculously pixel dense that even with
the phone all the way up to my face I
still can't see the pixels personally I
think 1080p is ideal for most phones as
a PPI of over 400 really does seem to be
the sweet spot even apples number to be
bumping up the Retina display to this
range for the next iPhone so while most
screens these days are pretty good we're
still not quite there yet anyway if you
guys enjoyed and you want to see more
videos like this definitely be sure to
subscribe to the channel and I will
catch you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
