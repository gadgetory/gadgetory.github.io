today I'm here with a hardware review of
the gateway NV 52 laptop I've been using
this computer for nearly three months
now and I found a lot of good things
about it along with a few snags I'm
going to go over the design of the
laptop from the screen to the keyboard
to the general feel of it to see if this
is the computer for you let's get this
one started first of all let's take a
look at the outside of the Gateway
computer while somewhat bulky on paper
at 1.5 inches thick actually feels
considerably smaller in person one trick
the designers used was to make the
bottom half of the laptop slightly
recessed compared to the outside edge
giving the illusion that the computer is
much thinner than it really is
the weight is also a bit on the heavy
side at a bit below 7 pounds for the
size of the computer it doesn't seem
unreasonable but if you plan on carrying
it around all day you might want to
think about it for a bit the lid sports
a nice honeycomb pattern that helps keep
fingerprints from becoming too big of an
issue however as with a lot of modern
laptops it's a good idea to keep a cloth
handy one great thing about the NV 52
are the ports as it has just about
everything you might need along the left
side you will find the power jet Gigabit
Ethernet VGA out HDMI out two USB 2.0
ports eye microphone a headphone jack
along with the card reader on the right
you will find the plug for the modem 2
more USB and the dual layer DVD burner
there's also draft in Wi-Fi included as
well between the four USB ports Gigabit
Ethernet in both VGA and HDMI out you
should be covered the keyboard is of
course full sized with a number pad on
the right side the keys themselves are
fairly flat and can occasionally be a
bit difficult to type on but
get used to it fairly quickly the number
pad fits nicely beside the keyboard and
works just fine along the top of the
keyboard you'll find a row of touch
sensitive buttons these do various
things such as allow you to control the
volume turn off the touchpad turn on and
off the Wi-Fi and turn on the my backup
software in addition one button is
totally customizable so you can launch
anything you like with it with just a
single press of the button the buttons
add a nice touch of class to the
computer and generally what fine but
unfortunately in the dark they are
practically invisible the trackpad is a
nice size and supports multi-touch
gestures the multi-touch works fairly
well allowing you to zoom in with pinch
and zoom as well as to finger scrolling
the trackpad is slightly recessed from
the rest of the laptop which is a good
thing as the feel of the trackpad and
the surrounding plastic feels nearly the
same something that might be a bit of a
weakness is the left and right click
buttons both buttons are integrated into
a single narrow bar and while it looks
nice it can be a bit annoying to deal
with I generally try to use a mouse
myself but while they aren't great they
certainly aren't a deal-breaker the
screen is a full fifteen point six
inches and it's really quite good it
features LED backlighting which allows
the screen to get very bright personally
I usually keep the brightness nearly all
the way down it also helps the computer
to save power compared to most standard
LCD screens the color and contrast on
the screen
both are outstanding with rich vibrant
color throughout it sports a 16 by 9
widescreen ratio as well which is
perfect for watching movies the
resolution of the screen is 1366 by 768
which is fairly standard for a screen of
this size there is also an integrated
webcam along the top of the screen with
a built-in microphone it's certainly
nothing special but it looks decent and
is just fine for Skype video chat or
live streaming one unexpected plus of
having such a bright screen is that you
can turn up the brightness and it's
easily enough to illuminate you in a
dark room
the speakers on the NV 52 are so-so
they're moderately loud enough to fill a
room with sound but they get fairly
tinny sounding when you really cranked
it up which is pretty average for a
budget laptop the hardware of the
gateway NV 52 is very solid and nicely
built it could easily pass off as a much
more expensive laptop I haven't had so
much as a little problem with it so far
as build quality is concerned either the
somewhat annoying mouse buttons aside
the NV 52 is a very solid and I really
don't have any complaints be sure to
stay tuned for part two of the review
where I will go over the performance and
specs such as hard drive processor and
more you can also check out the unboxing
of the computer which will be in an
annotation on the top left of the screen
anyway thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
