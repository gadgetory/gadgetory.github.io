cheapest gaming PC we've ever built at
just under $300 let's put this thing
together and see how it actually
performs and huge shot the last pass for
sponsoring this video if you guys have
watched the channel for a while you know
that I've been using last past four
years since way before they ever
actually sponsored a video now LastPass
really is the single spot that you can
keep all of your passwords and allies
safe but also secure so you just don't
have to worry about them anymore with
LastPass you never need to write down
remember or reset another password
they're all kept safe and secure and the
LastPass vault and the best part is is
that it will generate a unique and
secure password for every single site
you visit which is especially helpful if
you're one of those people who uses the
same password for every single site you
use John LastPass will autofill your
passwords across your computer as well
as your phone where it works not only on
websites but also inside of apps on top
of that LastPass has some great
two-factor authentication options
including support for the Yubikey which
is what I use on my personal accounts if
you're not ready using LastPass to keep
your passwords and login safe and secure
definitely be sure to go check it out at
the link in the description and of
course you'd shout out to LastPass for
sponsoring this video now let's go and
build a PC if you remember the very
first 300 ollar boson we did it was
taking advantage of an AMD Athlon
processor so it's only fitting that this
newer version has a much much newer
version the Athlon 200 GE unlike older
Athlon this is taking advantage of the
newer rise in architecture so inside we
have choose n cores which are clocked at
3.2 gigahertz they do support hyper
threading as well as importantly we also
have AMD Vega graphics built in mind you
it's Vega 3 so it's about the smallest
version of a you can get but this is a
big step up over those earlier Athlon
and actually should give us enough
performance for gaming I hope so
it's a $55 processor himself backing it
up we have a good bytes of Corsair
Vengeance lpx Ram now it's important
about this is that anytime you're using
something with integrated graphics such
as the Athlon 200 GE you want to give it
as much memory bandwidth as possible
which is why we're going with dual
channel memory and while eight gigs
isn't a ton especially for such a cheap
system that's less than $300 it should
be just fine everything is going inside
the gigabyte a 320 M s2h there's a very
cheap motherboard but importantly
because we are based on the new horizon
chipset where you have a lot of the
higher-end features so not only will
support our Athlon processor but you
could go all the way up to something
like a rise in 720 700 X if you ever
want to upgrade although that might be a
slightly ambitious upgrade but we do
have support for ddr4 and importantly an
m2 SSD that's important because we're
using a 128 gigabyte a data into SSD now
first of all an SSD is always faster
than a standard mechanical hard drive
one of the nice things about budget
builds is that this is actually cheaper
than a full harddrive now with only 120
gigs of capacity it's not going to be
great but it definitely should be enough
to install a few games and get us up and
running again this computer is all about
getting us ready to go right now
with plenty of upgrade potential later
like buying a hard drive or more memory
or a graphics card or better processor
all these things are possible at some
point but not today when you build a
budget computer there are a lot of ways
that you can cut corners and save a
little bit money one area you shouldn't
cut corners on is with the power supply
so this is a 450 watt EVGA 80 plus
bronze unit now the 80 plus is important
yes you could say probably like 15 20
bucks by getting a cheap Diablo tech
power supply and it would work for like
15 minutes if you're building a backpack
PC there's something that's actually
going to last you a few years and
importantly give you a little bit of
great capacity in the future going to
something a little bit high quality is
definitely worth a few extra dollars
that it costs so what I like about this
case is like I was saying it actually
has some features which is not always a
given when you spend a very very small
amount of money on a case so with this
guy we do get an 80 millimeter exhaust
fan and it also has a full USB 3.0 port
like a single one but you know USB 3 is
nice on a very very cheap case look at
this we even have a little dust filter
on the bottom which is actually not
super important because the power supply
is on the top but uh ok I'll take that I
like how it is ridiculously lightweight
this case is so we do have our USB 3.0
port on the side you also do have a pair
of USB twos on the front and once we get
the motherboard and we'll have a few
more around the back I'm guessing that
would open up our optical drive we had
one but in true cheap PC building
fashion instead of an optical drive that
so we're gonna stuff all our extra
cables that we don't need so we've
actually built a system in this case
before and it is a little bit tight but
it's not too bad and one of the nice
things is it is a full micro ATX case
which me
you're gonna save a little bit of room
on your desk or underneath your desk or
wherever you want to put it
the main issue here is that there's
basically no room around back for cable
management but uh for a system like this
especially considering how basic it is I
think we'll be just fine I'm not doing a
full PC bill tutorial in this video if
you guys want to check that out we do
one every year and I'll link it in the
description as well as in a card but the
system itself actually should be pretty
easy to put together one of the nice
things about this is because it is so
cheap there are very few components it's
not really that difficult to work inside
the case basically what I'm saying is is
that if this is the very first time
you've ever built a computer it is hard
to go wrong with something like this it
is about as simple as it gets
I'm not she kind of excited to see just
how well this performs so I did take a
look at the rise in three and the rise
in five chips with integrated graphics a
little bit earlier in this year and they
were impressive but they're also like
double the price of this mind you this
is like half the CPU cores and less than
half the GPU but considering that we can
build this entire system for less than
$300 I really just want to see how good
is it really also wow that is some
incredibly well applied federal piece do
you see that like what color perfect it
is I feel bad about ruining it squash
because Ram is so expensive these days
the eight gigs of ram is actually the
most expensive part of this build and
you could get away with four especially
if you're not really trying to do all
that much gaming you'll be just fine
but considering that I actually want to
have enough RAM to you know open up a
couple tabs in chrome and also play a
game of fortnight I feel like eight gigs
is they were the investment and the nice
thing about this board is that even
though it's not really super simple to
upgrade since you only have two DIMM
slots you couldn't theory bump this up
to 16 gigs later once ran prices
eventually you know come back down to
earth so if we screw our SSD into place
we're actually almost done this is a
very simple build all that's left now is
to put the motherboard inside the case
get everything wired up and we can
actually see how well our awesome 300
ollar system performs or how not awesome
it performs a little bit of cable
management installing windows and a
couple of software updates later let's
see how the actual system performs the
spiritual successor the boson so start
out with we have the good old classic
Cinebench now this is not an incredibly
powerful system with only a dual-core
rise in base CPU as well as those Vega 3
graphics but well I have to benchmark
things cuz that's what I do not too bad
so we've got 121 single core and 355 on
the multi-core now the only issue with
these Athlon chefs I make guesses are
call
there's really no overclocking
capability unlike the rising chips but
because this is a full desktop processor
we look like we're pretty much running
at 3.2 gigahertz across the board
13:22 so definitely not setting the
world on fire but again this is better
than the equivalent Intel integrated
graphics getting into a real game we
have csgo now on medium settings at
1080p we've got somewhere between 50 to
60 fps we want to go a little bit higher
we can turn the settings down but this
is pretty playable is they still they
still got you yeah all right
Wow we all died together so fortnight
does run it's at 720p at medium settings
but we do get a pretty respectable 35
frames per second I would love to show
you overwatch but for some reason when I
actually try to open the game even
though it's running here it just turns
off the monitor like legitimately just
turns the whole thing off like I can all
tab back in and windows pops right up
nothing is crashing just the monitor
doesn't like overwatch yeah there we go
hamster do wins again so overwatch is
actually kind of playable now mind you
we are running it on low settings and
it's at 75 percent scale at 1080p which
is I think roughly 1600 by 900 ish my
math is right but it's totally playable
we're getting about 40 frames per second
or so next up we have call of duty black
ops for a game which should not be able
to run in the system but I'm going to
try anyway yep yep yep CPS or whatever
yeah yeah it's fine low low low low low
off off off off off low low low off off
off off off off off off perfect that
sounds exactly like what we need right
now based on the twelve frames per
second loading screen I don't have high
hopes right now I don't think it's gonna
work the problem with black ops is it
actually just needs too much RAM so on
addition to having CPU memory we also
have to keep in mind the graphics is
sharing that same 8 gigs of ram so when
you combine it all together black ops is
just not being cooperative J guys has
reasonable sense that it's very
specifically told me the beginning that
it was not going to work but I want to
try it anyway that my friends is the
cheapest gaming PC we've built in a very
very long time as always links to check
out all this stuff will be in the
