here with the speed test between the
iPhone 5 and Samsung Galaxy s3 has
arguably the two best phones out there
right now let's see which is fastest my
first test is of the iPhone 5 on Verizon
LTE as the big new edition you can
expect speeds of over 13 megabits per
second down and 4 megabits per second up
and generally much higher
unfortunately I can't demo the galaxy s3
for you but both phones are fully
capable of awesome speeds next step we
have Geekbench which takes a look at the
overall performance of each phone one
interesting note while both are
dual-core the galaxy s3 typically runs
at 1.5 gigahertz
the iPhone 5 fluctuated between 800
megahertz and 1.2 gigahertz depending on
the load the Geekbench cores were fairly
close with the galaxy s3 pulling in a
total of 1422 points and the iPhone 5
with 1648 still a win as a win moving on
we have SunSpider
which is a javascript test for the
browsers this will give you an idea of
the CPU performance as well as how some
heavier sites are handled Safari has
improved in iOS 6 and does quite well
here against Chrome although neither
half bad at all the lower the score the
better and the iPhone 5 - the clear
winner with less than half the time
taking compared to the galaxy s3 now we
have geo benchmark this is all about
testing the graphical performance and
games with a complex run through the
egypt benchmark and as you can see
there's really no contest the iPhone 5
is able to consistently run it smoother
and bumps against the vsync quite often
or the galaxy s3 struggles a bit as the
iPhone has fewer pixels to push I reran
the test in the off screen mode with
both phones rendering at 1080p an iPhone
managed almost double the frame rate
with a score rivaling the iPad 3 even
with jelly bean which most galaxy s3
models are lacking right now there's no
denying that the iPhone 5 has some
serious firepower
of course specs aren't everything so let
me know in the comments below which you
would pick and why if you enjoyed be
sure to leave this video a thumbs up and
