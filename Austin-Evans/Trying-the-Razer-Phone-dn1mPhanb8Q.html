here with something just a little bit
different this is the Razer foam so as
you guys can probably tell we're here at
the Razer HQ or we get to do an
exclusive unboxing of the new Razer foam
it was just announced so the idea here
is that this is going to be a phone that
is meant for gamers so now I just have a
pretty interesting screen which we'll
discuss in a minute but it has crazy
speakers you can also see it is kind of
built like a tank
look at that so if you guys are familiar
with next bit Razer purchased them a
little over a year ago you can see a lot
of that DNA in the Razer foam so it's
very sort of squared off but it also has
a nice sort of metal texture which feels
exactly like the sort of finish that
they have on their laptops so if you
take a look at the phone you'll see that
it does have fairly large bezels
although that does house dual front
firing speakers but what's really
impressive about this is the display it
has a 5.8 inch 2560 by 1440 p panel
what's really interesting is this can
run at a full 120 Hertz before we get
too far into it though let's see what
else comes in the box so we get some
paperwork on the razor phone we also get
the power adapter so this phone is using
USB C however what it doesn't have is a
headphone jack so to be fair they do
include a USB C headphone adapter in the
box and supposedly it's going to be
pretty good with a 24 bit DAC but the
problem is if you want actually play you
know a game listen to headphones you're
going to be doing something like this
it's not a deal-breaker but for a gaming
phone a little bit goofy however what is
cool as the speakers that are built into
the phone that's pretty loud so yeah I
think it's actually pretty safe to say
this is probably one of the loudest
phones I've ever heard I would still
like to have a headphone jack but that's
a decent compromise so just playing with
the phone for a few minutes I can
immediately tell that the ultra motion
display actually does make a pretty big
difference so the idea here is that
while it is a high resolution panel it
also can run it up to that 120 Hertz
refresh rate basically all phones that
you buy today are running at 60 Hertz
which has been standard for a long time
but once you step up to 120 Hertz it
actually is a lot smoother
so for basic stuff like web browsing or
scrolling through menus you can see that
does look a lot more fluid where you're
really going to see the advantage is in
games so for example here in Riptide
renegade we're running anywhere between
90 to 100 frames per second and because
the display is now like
to be variable refresh rate but it also
can wrapped 120 frames we're seeing all
of the performance here I've got to say
it actually does look noticeably
smoother than a normal phone it's maybe
not the biggest difference in the world
but you do notice that a little bit of
extra fluidity any game that has an
unlocked frame rate right now will work
out of the box on the razor phone with
these high refresh rates but even if it
is going to be locked at 60 Hertz you're
still going to get the benefits of
having that variable refresh rate so for
example if the frame rate drops a little
bit lower the screen is going to stay
with it exactly like something like free
sync orgy sync works on the desktop
inside the razor phone has about as high
in specs as you would imagine so it has
a snapdragon 835 processor a pretty
impressive eight gigabytes of RAM as
well as 64 gigs of storage and you can't
expand that via microSD and since this
is a phone that's meant for gaming it
does have a pretty sizable 4000 milliamp
hour battery and that's backed up with
Qualcomm quick charge 4.0 plus which
should recharge the battery by about 50%
in 30 minutes as far as cameras go
around back you get a pair of 12
megapixel shooters one wide-angle one
telephoto so somewhat similar to the
iPhone what you're getting here you can
get a pretty decent wide shot but if you
zoom in a little bit it switches
automatically to the telephoto just just
considering the world boom I've got that
Markel action I can't judge the camera
too much just yet but it seems to be
pretty decent as long as you have good
light like this now one thing I will say
is it would be nice to have a button to
switch between the wide angle and the
telephoto right now you you zoom in on
the camera app that automatically
switches so it does have an 8 megapixel
front facing camera but it looks a
little bit soft the razor phone is
available for pre-order starting today
and will be shipping on November 17th
for $700 so this guy's going to ship
unlocked or work on GSM carriers such as
AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile now some hundred
dollars is definitely a lot but
considering the specs especially
considering just how good the screen and
speakers are it might be worth a look if
you're interested in gaming which you
know if you want a razor phone you
probably are anyway what do you guys
think about the razor phone let me know
in the comments below and I will catch
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
