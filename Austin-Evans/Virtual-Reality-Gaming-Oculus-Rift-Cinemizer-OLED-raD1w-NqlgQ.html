here with a look at virtual reality
gaming at e3 2013 while there have been
headsets to promise an immersive gaming
experience for years only now we finally
getting to the point where technology is
caught up to start with let's take a
look at the carl zeiss sinem Iser oh le
d out of all the VR headsets out right
now this is one of the more
normal-looking ones that looks a lot
like a pair of sunglasses what makes
this a bit special is that it works with
anything with an HDMI output meaning you
can use it with most game consoles PCs
or even for normal video if you'd like
inside or a pair of 8 70 by 500 displays
for each eye and while they're a bit
small it's an immersive experience if
you're gaming with a PC the centum Iser
supports head-tracking as a mouse input
meaning you can look around the game
just by moving your head unfortunately
it comes with a side effect of making
you look really dumb while using it they
had a couple games available to try for
the Xbox 360 and PC at the demo Crysis 3
looks awesome on the display thanks to
the great graphics and the head tracking
really was basically one-to-one with no
noticeable lag the biggest problem is
that since moving your head replaces
using the mouse to look around
inevitably you'll end up twisted in a
weird position while keeping your hands
on the keyboard using a controller would
help a lot here for shooters which
aren't really designed for VR headsets
moving on we have oculus rift definitely
the most popular virtual reality device
at the moment this works similarly to
the cinemas however it's much larger and
entirely fills your vision making it a
lot more of an immersive experience
playing some counter-strike with it I
immediately noticed that the 1280 by 800
display while still good is a bit low
resolution although the final shipping
version should be outfitted with a 1080p
screen even though physically the rift
is fairly big it's incredibly light
making it no problem to wear for longer
periods without getting tired I was
slightly disoriented after taking it off
but after a few seconds I got totally
used to it by far the most impressive
demo of the rift is EVR a tech demo made
by the developers of EVE Online it drops
you in a cockpit of a space fighter and
thanks to the fact that you can sit down
just like you would in a real fighter it
bypasses any weird orientation issues
when I first put on the headset and
immediately look down to see the arms
and legs of the pilot in the game in the
exact spot as my own ball
my mind was instantly blown thanks to
the excellent head tracking you can look
all around the cockpit as you watch for
enemy planes and lock onto them by using
your head to adjust the track of your
missiles after the EVR demo I'm really
convinced the oculus rift
sinem Iser OLED and other virtual
reality headsets are the future of
gaming it feels so natural to look
around in games like you do in real life
and having a 3d display entirely filling
your vision makes it easy to entirely
focus on the game what do you think of
virtual reality headsets like the Rift
and sinem Iser definitely be sure to let
me know in the comments below if you're
interested in more check out my hands-on
of the PlayStation 4 and if you enjoyed
be sure to leave this video a thumbs up
and subscribe for more videos like this
anyway guys I will catch you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
