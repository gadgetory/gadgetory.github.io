to my unboxing of the brand-new blah
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
totally how you sound
you gotta be a couple octaves higher hey
guys it's me Austin I'm on a mountain
what is the poor man's graphics card so
I do a lot of these like budget gaming
pcs and yeah like it's really fun to
play with like the like 295x2 and like
780ti like all these crazy high-end
expensive cards but the thing is you
don't really need that
and I would straight-up never pay that
much for a graphics card back when I was
buying them yeah it's kind of silly to
pay $300 extra for like 5 frames per
second like if you have that kind of
money you're going crazy but I feel like
you can build something that's really
solid like if you can play a game on
like medium to high settings at 1080p I
feel like most people it's going to be
totally fine and you can spend way less
money you view the entire computer that
runs 1080p high for like less than the
price of like a 780ti easy alright imma
throw this at you okay so you can look
at every component in terms of how many
frames per second this graphics card
drives versus another graphics card but
that's not necessarily the way to buy a
PC yeah you could look at it in terms of
I'm spending $200 more on this graphics
card so I'm spending double what's it
400 versus $200 and it's going to give
me odd dude let's say only 70% more
performance because that's pretty
typical yeah um but the other way of
looking at it is I'm spending $800 on
this computer and I'm spending another
$200 and I'm getting 7% per performance
so actually if we had to pick like a
really solid budget card though like
what Jim said you cuz like I know for me
like I feel like you can get solid stuff
not the hundred to two hundred 'allah
range I feel like that's the meat of
like the solid stuff like I would like
it to 70 X that's a card that like
for $200 is such a dick it's good enough
where you've got like the power to
handle 1080p no problem right now yeah
you also have I would say future
proofing I hate that word gets
have two cases in the yes word it is but
you do have two gigs of memory it should
hold up for a little while compared to
like say on Dalek card like I really
like the 270x but like what's a like
single card it's like reasonably-priced
it kind of jumps out at you I guess for
me it'll be because he Nvidia AMD you
can have that are getting a wet day to
have that argument all day and I'm not
going to bother because it's not worth
my time
so what it'll be is whatever is on sale
that junk that is in my budget and that
budget if you want the best bang for the
buck is going to be one 19.99 to one
49.99 okay you find whatever the highest
tier card you can is within that price
range and that's probably going to
deliver anywhere from there to around to
29.99 is going to be that the best bang
for the buck in terms of FPS per dollar
who can lift the most PC parts at the
same time so clearly is to incredibly
attractive strong dudes we can lift like
multiple whoa whoa coming out the guys
whoa okay way to do that I think it
what's the heavies computer that you
like you regularly pick up the heaviest
computer I reckon I don't personal rigs
I try not to pick it up but it's only 40
cons
yeah that's pretty heavy Ike yeah I mean
like I guess like 60 pounds I think it
taken you had water cool you get the
whole deal I've got a couple Reds in
there oh this cat curing a sitcom laptop
up like the 40,000 foot mountain couch
yes okay so I think we both Thailand on
actually okay well I actually I don't
know if I would call it a tie because oh
the only thing even resembling a PC part
around here is this thing and I think we
can all agree to this is not a real PC
so I didn't even end up with one it's
like it's called the air for a reason oh
wait wait do I give them on camera
actually what like holding and touching
it good washing
why are we sitting the death of 4.5 inch
and 4.7 inch flagships
so that's actually interesting question
because I mean I feel like for a while
there that was pretty much what we were
seeing like neom galaxy s3 and these
these kind of films like four point
seven four point eight is a great size
I nationwide the phones that I was
really surprised about last year was the
I still feel like that is the best like
as far as sized like screen ratio foam
and that hair remember that but it's
awesome
I think they actually like it's almost
perfect texture the curve the size it's
just the perfect combo yeah and so now
we're looking at phones like getting the
five inch like the LG g3 I think you
have one it's little right I did to my
deck it's a cool phone that's big it's
just very very big the LG g3 is too big
and not because it's too tall it's
actually about the same height as the
HTC One m8 but the problem is that I
cannot reach the left edge here and the
2560 by 1440 p screen yet another
example of of EPA measurement oh it
straight up doesn't make sense of you
have you you have your so g3 I'm
actually working on right now I think
one of the big things with the g3 with
that big screen like the size doesn't
matter as much as like that resolution
can you tell the difference
mmm when I look at me like like super
up-close like you know like that like
these like little tiny dots in the
wallpaper I can see but no like not
normal use but I don't know like I mean
you look it like the iPhone like they're
like okay they're gonna be coming out
look at four point seven and a five
point five or something yeah I
understand like a big phone like the
note 3 or something like there is like I
think for some people it makes sense to
have a nice big screen if you like watch
a lot of video if you want to get rid of
your tablet if you don't sing well yeah
actually your fine motor control isn't
that great having your buttons like yeah
I had no problem with that however I
feel like that's more of a nitch kind of
thing it's just like the same people who
carry around like a 15 year 17 inch
laptop there's most people are probably
more not going to be more couple with 11
or 13 inch laptop yeah it's gonna be the
same thing with phones and take
something at four point five four point
seven will see these flagships kind of
they're going to hit the the upper bound
people gonna start complaining they're
guys start going okay maybe we should
bring this back a little bit so I don't
think they're going where I really do
think that four point five four point
seven maybe even five inch I think that
that might be a
good kind of middle-ground but I feel
like it's got to come down and kind of
love love for the most part I find this
usable yeah but I find the iPhone 5s
comfortable yeah yeah and you know
something I think a logical discount is
that using a phone with like one hand is
really hopeful like how many times are
you walking around like trying to text
somebody or like you don't have like an
extra hand free it's easy to kind of
just say oh let's use two hands but it's
convenient to be able to use one hand a
lot because yeah it I think I think it's
a we'll see because we've had this
conversation it's like four inches it's
never gonna be bigger than that like I
remember whom the iPhone came out number
how huge that screen see now you figured
up today just like and when the horse
came out and that resolution I can put
my face on the screen I can rub it all
over it not I can see the pixels this
technology keeps marching forward well
so you'll see where it takes us yep all
right so that's about it now before we
get here I think we've got to give a big
shout out to why we're actually here in
Colorado we're here for the Highlander
oh you guys sure it's perfect so we're
here for the Highlander my human
billboard here so basically we hiked up
like a NASCAR driver the second highest
mountain in the lower 48 states we did
14,000 feet do a bunch of game 21400
battle back glass for our pizza and that
last 400 row so I'm gonna make sure
y'all know about it Sam I'm like I'm
like assimilated I'm a little y'all and
Joe just just just move towns United
States you're like most of the way here
so we climbed up there with a bunch of
like tech gear like laptops keyboards
all that kind of stuff and we actually
had the World Record highest land party
ever in history so you guys we've got a
bunch of videos it's going to be a
couple in your channel there's gonna be
one of my channel text indicates a new
egg like there's gonna be tons of videos
and definitely stay tuned for that for
like next week something like that
sometimes gonna take us a while because
there's a lot of footage which yeah so
then please stay tuned for that also if
you guys are somehow not subscribed to
Linus which I doubt that any of you
aren't but of course where can they find
you is this Linus tech tips thing
think that's it that's a cat channel or
something oh yeah the cat Channel I
forgot about camera capture so you guys
injured you on the fine let the cat
don't go to the cat channel
yeah bottom line is tech tips on YouTube
you actually update that catch oh I
think about a long time I do videos once
Molony yeah really yeah I actually have
one on my phone that I've been meaning
to upload of me playing with like little
fuzzy balls right so you guys want that
one exclusive alright guys it's like

a mountain my battery died so I
straight-up don't know what time it is
alright is that wall look like blue is
not just a toilet flushing I hope that's
what it is okay cool so we're doing
questions so let's just do a wrap-up so
