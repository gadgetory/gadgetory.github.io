my 80 death 413 part series of my old
stuff so again I just show you i mean i
do all kind of stuff you know no PSP box
no game boy blue gameboy color even an
old game cube so i'm gonna be covered
all kinds of stuff as usual guys so just
hang out and um i'll show you some old
stuff anyway let's get this one started
okay guys so to begin with let's go over
something i'm sure a lot of you guys
ladies not if you're younger but if
you're a little bit older you might have
had one or two of these it would be the
original Game Boy pocket this was really
cool actually to be totally straight
with you guys actually bought this not
too long ago but I'd actually a little
not quite an old enough to have one of
these I started out with a gameboy color
but uh the Game Boy pocket it's actually
really cool um one of these days I'm
nothing to do a review of this um as you
can see here it's really cool I plays
just the original gameboy games and not
the game would color or anything like
that I will say it's a got a really nice
screen on it just you know just randomly
am just saying this but the screen on
this is actually bigger than even on the
game would call it which I thought was
funny but other than that it's very
similar to the game boy color and
actually I had two of these I have a
black one as well and I might you know
you might be wondering why go up to well
I like to buy stuff like this and well
they're both red sheet but also there's
one major difference if you look at them
do you see the difference just look at
for a second I'm fine to get
you see here this one has a little power
button light but this one does not and
now there's what kind of a long story
behind that where you know people
weren't really happy with not having
light so they change it for that but I
saw this one day and I saw it didn't
have a light on so I figured hey that'd
be kind of cool because if you guys you
guys may or may not know I'd like to
collect Game Boys and well actually if
you're watching the videos I'm sure you
do but Jay guys some to really cool game
boy pockets they're both pretty much
identical this one's not quite in a good
shape you see the basically the same and
yeah that's pretty cool pretty cool game
boys and yeah connect stream definitely
uh I will know definitely I will be
doing a review on these at some point
but just for sure you guys right now
they're pretty cool ok guys let's change
gears just a little bit and let's go
into some old cell phones how about that
one or that one how about one of these
or maybe else up like that I hear this
is a good phone too oh yeah this was
kinda nice too so yeah guys don't ask me
how I have all these cell phones yeah
cell phones good get those cell phones a
lot I don't know um so there's a bunch
of old cell phones guys I'm gonna be
totally honest with you I don't even
know wise to have these I mean tell me
they're pretty ancient well actually I
don't think this one's that old but I
mean show you guys meet real quickly
this was actually not too bad but
actually yeah guys like sounds kind of
dirty actually these all to work as far
as I know to which is kind of weird
mostly picked up a lot of these all
these were pay-as-you-go now in singular
but all these were pays you go just to
pick up you know for going on a trip or
something because for the longest time I
did not have the cell phone and you know
these were like twenty and thirty
dollars and stuff so I figured why not
well if some of these were actually real
phones like I'm pretty sure this one was
although this one wasn't mine but uh
pretty cool again another one of these
page go just like so Pete still see
people I thought guy
just the other day but yeah and actually
you guys have seen a few months back
actually a video on this one but uh well
there's a video with a bunch of other
stuff but this one's really cool this is
like the first cell phone was one of the
first cell phones and really really cool
I member i used to play this like crazy
and i'm going to show you guys its
soffel area something size of that
battery and seriously you should show
you compared to you know that's the
battery so kind of uh come a long way
but no just look like that but you guys
if you want me to do a review on any of
these I might be able to I don't know I
just think I just can't keep around just
because we're kind of cool to have but
uh nothing all that exciting I guess ok
guys so next we have something a little
bit bigger as you can see this is
actually my very first computer and yeah
this was it was bought in like 2002
didn't get a computer for a while but uh
let me just show you this should well if
you know about specs this should pretty
much tell you real fast 128 gigs of ram
and yeah XP and I actually use this for
my only computer for probably close to
five years honestly guys I mean I use
this thing forever I mean it is crazy I
mean so yeah let me tell you a little
bit about it I guess um you know out
there um say I think we've got this
about 2,000 to it costs like four
hundred dollars whatever I have a
monitor and my closet it's too big to
get out but got this um and I seriously
yeah with 128 megs of ram using Windows
XP I used it for actually got want to
say almost exactly five years until i
got i finally got a laptop and you know
got out of the stone age but uh yeah
this computer i mean seriously guys I I
use this computer so long I mean at one
point it got so filled with viruses and
stuff it literally I mean was just
ridiculous I mean I mean it takes 10
minutes to load brand-new with viruses
enemy has taken 30 minutes but yeah this
is all ahead so let me just go ahead
give you guys a quick walkthrough
so if we look up here k most focused
there we go so up here we have the CD
it's just CD and if you see right here
this will be a jet button right there
and the funny thing is that broke
literally the night I got it I pushed
you once they broke but whatever going
down a little bit we have the three and
a half inch floppy drive still works
just fine actually only hard I thought
me drive I have the power button which
was funny because that thing almost
always tried to break on the specs if we
move it down here underneath this little
panel we have two USB audio and and
microphone so yeah so let me go ahead
and flip it around for you guys and I
show you what's on the back ok guys so
not on the back I'm just going to be
really keep it really basic and simple
i'm sure you guys don't care fan power
cable move over here a little bit you
know you got a bunch of older porch got
keyboard mouse printer serial ethernet
etc etc good in here nothing really all
that exciting special you know but kind
of some old reports you don't see on
computers these days like the serial
port you know i can't remember the last
time I was helping kid with the serial
port at least a semi modern one but you
know nothing all that exciting but you
guys that was my very first computer
which it still works too God takes so
long to boot I mean seriously guys i
don't know where I got the patience to
use this thing but I hip was only
computer ever had so I was like hey this
is this is cool um so yeah that's about
it um Wednesday's think I make a video
show you guys exactly how long you have
to wait with 128 gigs of ram I mean
seriously guys I mean just to give you
an idea that's my ipod touch this has
128 megs of ram that runs XP this one's
iphone OS so you know i mean that's a
pretty big deal there guys that's about
it for now i hope you guys enjoyed as
always if you want me to do reviews of
any of this stuff just let me know and
I will most likely do it because i know
i have absolutely no lack of stuff to
take a look at but yeah anyway guys
