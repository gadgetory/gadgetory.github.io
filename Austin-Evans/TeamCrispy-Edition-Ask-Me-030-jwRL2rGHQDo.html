me to Los Angeles I'm still trying to
figure out how I got here
and your guys's opinion is the iPad pro
a laptop replacement or just a big iPad
there's potential and Lou won't stop you
from buying one if people have replaced
laptops with it I guess in that sense it
is a laptop replacement it is like any
other iPad it's a laptop replacement I
think we can we can safely agree though
that if we're like if we're talking bang
for your buck it's not gonna compete
with a thousand-dollar laptop what is
your favorite daily gadget also your
great well yeah that's a great way to
start a question I do really like the
bag I have right now it's like this
crazy theft proof thing okay so it's
called a pack safe and essentially in
here behind the canvas there has a mesh
on the inside so that you can't you
couldn't cut through it the rx1r mark 4
is totally my favorite but this is this
a small pocket camera and I know pod
cameras are kind of going the way of the
dinosaur these days but this is not that
far off from like a DSLR you've actually
you were shooting on the RX 10 right
yeah we did the only thing we brought
with us it has really nice 4k quality
you have like s log you have like a lot
of really cool features but it overheats
really quickly not just in 4k so you can
record 4k flex five minutes before it
gives out but I've shot an entire video
on this before and no one notice the
difference I have two pairs of Sony
wireless headphones oh it uses all the
time stepping outside of like the phones
and tablets I think that's one that I
use the most in the bluetooth bluetooth
so and I actually almost prefer those
like even at the gym than in-ear
headphones what is the biggest mistake
in your youtube career this video haha
there have been plenty of mistakes but I
think all those mistakes led to
something right like every time I tried
some new video and it didn't work I
learned from that and I didn't do that
in the in the future whatever I got I
learned from it so like there are plenty
of mistakes but nothing is something
that jumps out like me I really wish I
didn't do that because I think all the
mistakes that I have made were helpful
in some way and I think that's the
nature of mistakes though really I think
you're looking at it like very
practically whereas I think I'm
envisioning the question more
conceptually like as far as maybe a way
of doing things that has that in
retrospect wasn't yielding sort of the
most or where I was getting the most
enjoyment out of content I've made
mistakes where I've like you know
inputted
number wrong or like I don't think I
don't think Austin's happy with that
kind of answer no want you to soul
search right now you know being new at
it and then thinking you have to rush
something out whether it was like the
race to you know get it get it knocks it
out first as you start to mature and
stuff you realize that I want to be
first and you take the time to make
something that you enjoy I think that
delivers the best content is the
BlackBerry Prive going to revive
blackberry is a contender in the
smartphone industry no no I think it's
cool actually if you guys tried yet not
yet I have one sitting at office video
soon I think it's cool I think there's
some cool stuff I like a padding I think
it would been a lot cooler three years
ago though what are your hobbies other
than YouTube that you do on your free
time so these guys have a way better
answers than I do because I would say
video games and more work
mine's easy watch basketball play
basketball I got a video coming up that
kind of exposes oh yeah one of my things
so I play hockey couple Canadian a
couple times a couple of times a week I
like maple syrup the best investment in
tech so I think for me it would be a
good microphone if you're at all
interested in video right a good
microphone can last forever well but
like a dishwasher is that tech no why
not relax forever if we're talking about
how long it lasts like a stove is a good
one too yeah very I regret taking this
question are we allowed appliance is the
last like 25 years how did you guys meet
each other we all met at the same CES
but different places right so this is my
first year at CU I was your first year I
think it's like wow my second because
like I just met you we talked for a
little bit and yeah we hung out and then
I think it was that same CES that you
were having a dinner right with like a
bunch of tech youtubers yeah I remember
I was super so like at the time like you
I think you actually probably the
biggest of all three of us at that point
really uncomfortable with this big and
biggest thing that would be the first
time we met you - yeah can you sing
hotline bling team crispy Edition can I
get some lyrics do we know when to come
in I can't remember hang on
no they call me online
no don't worry about those you used to
call me on my cell phone late night when
you need my love call me on my cell
phone late night when you need my love
and I know when that hotline bang
represent Oh Rob if you're bouncing cuz
you're bouncing oh yeah we were so close
