open you're not asleep okay well you
sleazy well I hey guys so today I'm
actually here with a little overview I'm
going to be reviewing my dog of course
but now I'm getting I'm actually going
to be doing for you guys today is giving
you a little tour of my new computer so
I know a lot of you guys have seen I
know a lot of you guys have seen I've
been trying to get myself a nice
computer built for past most of this
year I guess I don't know how long it's
been but so I finally got it all the
finally able to get the money up and get
all the parts ordered and I built it all
a few days ago so I've spent a couple
days so I figure about time to go ahead
and give you guys a little tour of it
but I never got a lot of requests to do
office tours and whatnot I'm not gonna
be able to do that in this video just
because it's well it's not really done I
don't know I've got I've got more
cleaning and organizing and what not to
do but what I will do is give you guys a
little tour of my computer and desk and
all that kind of stuff so starting with
the the biggest thing on this desk is my
Asus 23 inch 1080p monitor essentially
was totally not expecting get it monitor
this big and this nice but I was
actually able to get it on Newegg it was
really cheap was ordering my computer
like the day the morning I was ordering
I noticed that they had this wait to
mark down
it's actually an IPS display which like
awesome viewing angles great color this
is a nice nice display and I guess for
cheap so I was able to buy it you see
down here my speaker is the wow he won
now I'm sure a lot of you guys have seen
I reviewed this February I don't know
why I reviewed a while back it's
actually a really really cool speaker
I've got a hotel actually it's it's just
charging right now but I've got hooked
up where you know I'm playing games of
one I will get this whole desk vibrating
very cool I'm speaking of the desk I
know it looks like it looks terrible
it's at this terrible terrible finish
where any little scratch looks like me
there's disgusting fuzz man but as you
can see here's my mouse and keyboard
as you can kind of guess I've spent all
my money on the computer and I didn't
have much left for a mouse and keyboard
but aunt ish it's not that bad
moving over here show you guys my audio
technica at2020 this is the microphone I
used you guys can see see it and III
live sometimes it's pretty much what I
use for all my videos these days I'm
gonna use it for like voiceovers always
I also use it for like like verb videos
where if I'm like showing approach
wherever usually I'll have this and my
laptop off to the side really good mic
looks cool to it
I think so over here get my beats by dre
studio headphones these are pretty
decent I'm a big headphone guy I don't
really like I guess it's just because I
never really played loud music and stuff
I was like - can you have my headphones
and listen to stuff as loud as I want
without people get annoyed at me so yeah
these are my headphones they're nice and
comfortable but I'm looking to upgrade
these just I'm just not really satisfied
with the audio quality but that's kind
of another story um so let's go ahead
and get into the computer so so as you
guys can see here this is the Hat the
coolermaster half 9:12 case it's
actually kind of a cheap case but man
I've got to say I really like the look
of it so use a little give you guys a
little tour of it I'm you see you're
about USB and power and all kind of good
stuff
have a DVD burner in there literally I
didn't really have a use for blu-ray
I've got a card reader which is kind of
weird you haven't see here because
obviously I'm doing video all day I'm
put the SD card is the weirdest thing
I've ever seen in fact wish I had an SD
card to show you guys it like goes
upside down it goes in like a quarter of
the way like I have no idea up right
here I have to 120 20 millimeter fans
pulling air in this case has good
cooling but let's go ahead and get the
side panel off and see if I can do this
without dropping the panel one hand
there we go didn't destroy anything
hopefully so yeah guys this is the this
is the inside of the case now I know
before anybody says anything I am not
done with the wiring I know it looks
like some like an electrician threw up
or something in here but no I've just
got a few things wired tied
it's not final yet I just got done
building it and there's still more
tweaking and whatnot to be done so the
wiring on it looks horrible and I'll get
that fix but anyway I don't think you
guys a quick overview of what I was in
here I'm I'll see if I can get
you guys a better angle
yeah DVD drive and all that kind of
stuff in there I have a 2 terabyte
spinning hard drive in here so that's
where I'm gonna be putting all my videos
you know all the kind of larger files
and whatnot if you guys can see all the
way down here is a little two and a half
inch hard drive caddy I have a 500
gigabyte laptop drives I just had laying
around that I figured you know might as
well use and then below that below that
is my ocz vertex 3 solid-state drive
it's 120 gigs and that's what I have you
know all my you know windows on all my
Steam games applications or whatnot I've
gotta say guys if you've never used a
computer with a solid-state drive it's
absolutely awesome
I mean I've coming from like a laptop
and stuff where you know like in fact
that that hard drive came out of a
laptop and you know it's spinning hard
drugs are okay but man solid-state
drives just get that stuff done so fast
it's really nice I'm still I can lean
over here you're fine
my gigabyte z68 motherboard not a big
fan that motherboard to be honest if I
was buying another one I probably would
not buy that at probably it was
something else but it's okay I'm getting
most of the kinks worked out I'm just
you can see here I have a gigabytes of
corsair dominator ram and you can see
that there that's probably the coolest
color in the world I mean come on Lee
black yellow red no this is light blue
come on
so here's my cooler master hyper 212
plus a CPU cooler
love this cooler man this computer I've
got a Intel Core i7 2600
CPU above 100 105 degrees you know
gaming all kinds of stuff now I had an
overclock just yet like I said I just
there's still some tweaks and what I
want to get worked out before I get
everything overclocked and running a
hundred percent but uh yeah this thing
is ice this thing just runs icy cold
um speaking of fans if you guys can see
here I've got a 120 millimeter fan right
here 120 millimeter fan right here and
120 millimeter fan right here so I've
got a lot of airflow around this
heatsink and in fact I got another one
right here if my RAM wasn't so tall so
yeah this this thing will be able to
I'll be able to overclock it really nice
and easy coming down here no this can't
allow the whoa you guys can see there's
my graphics card I'm using an Asus
Radeon 6850 uh that's the graphics card
on the back I've been able I was
planning on buying another one in
putting it in crossfire and I can still
do that if I want but for right now I'm
able with this graphics card run any
game that I play right now it max
settings at 1080p without any framerate
issues so I figure you know I'll
probably end up getting another one and
overclocking the whatnot once like some
cool game like Battlefield three comes
out that this won't be able to run maxed
out but until then that is perfect uh uh
all this one live wires and by dog a
walk around you guys from the back um I
have the corsair TX 750 pounds of lye
got 750 watts more than enough when I
decide to add a 68 15 all kind of stuff
um yes guys I'm using VGA I laughed me
if you want it's just not the DVI isn't
working again I've got some tweaks and
whatnot to work out
Levi guys that's about it for my little
overview of the new computer and whatnot
hopefully guys found this video
interesting and yeah I was I do want to
say one thing that kind of this a little
bit of an apology I know I said that
would do a video showing you how to
build a computer but I ran him through
some problems while I was building it
I've got like about two and a half hours
of footage already recorded but when I
got into putting the CPU cooler on I had
a problem I almost broke it and when I
obviously so I had to shot the camera
and go fix it and by the time I had it
fixed you know I had the whole CPU
cooler thing I couldn't use you know I
tried to I was recording putting the
motherboard in it didn't get that
totally lined up right and so what I had
to rerecord that so after I had those
problems I just stopped recording which
I probably should have just stopped and
pulled everything out and rerecord it
but unfortunately was not able to get a
video showing you guys how to how to put
it together so I do apologize for that
but hopefully got
don't mind and to make it a few guys
because I do kind of feel bad if you
have any questions or anything about how
I built the computer definitely be sure
to leave them in comments
sorry about that guys but anyway that's
about it for my little overview and desk
tour and computer tour and all that kind
of good stuff but again if you guys have
any questions feel free to leave them in
the comments and yeah catch you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
