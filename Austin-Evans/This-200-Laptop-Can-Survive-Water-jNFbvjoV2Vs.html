rugged laptop you'll find for $200 so
this is the Isuzu Chromebook see 202's
now on top of being a rugged laptop it's
also got pretty decent specs for $200
inside the box we're really not going to
be getting a lot we get part of the
power cable
as well as the laptop it's so take a
look at it and what you're getting here
for about the same price is most cheap
laptops and Chromebooks is something
that should be a lot more durable so
it's got this rubber coating that goes
all the way around the edges which
should especially help for drop open
this guy up and something else
interesting is the keyboard so this is
water-resistant so no you should not go
swimming with your brand-new laptop but
for example if you drop a drink on it it
should be fine so well it might be just
a little bit on the thicker side there's
not a lot of compromising the design so
you still have full articulation of the
actual displays so and you also have a
pretty solid selection of ports
including a pair of USB 3.0 as well as
HDMI out the C 202 is rocking an 11.6
inch 1366 by 768 display
now it's not IPS so you have to keep
your expectations a little bit lower
however I've looked at a lot of these
cheaper laptops and this is not a bad
display viewing angles are acceptable
colors pretty decent it's not going to
blow you away but it's totally usable
another probably gonna want to think of
one of these guys the speakers are not
amazing so a big part of that is because
since this is a rugged laptop the
speakers are sort of touched here on the
sides and they're a little bit recessed
they sounds okay but you're probably
going to want to pick up some headphone
something a little bit odd is that even
though it has an Intel Pentium sticker
on it it's actually powered by us so on
in 30-60 processor now that paired with
four gigabytes of RAM means that this is
plenty powerful enough for Chrome OS but
the fact that it's got the wrong thing
on it is a little bit weird the keyboard
is a little bit mushy but since its
water-resistant I'll give it a pass
there it does have a good layout with
nice spacing the trackpad is a little
bit on the honestly erratic side it's
just maybe not quite as precise as I'd
like but again this is a $200 rugged
computer you're not buying this for the
amazing typing experience what you do
want to pick it up for is to see whether
it can actually survive falling off your
desk or getting hit by a water balloon
the idea is that this is a good laptop
for school or work so not only is it a
Chromebook you have the full browser as
well as stuff like Google Docs but it
says claims that it can
a three-foot drop example if you knock
it off a table or dead but let's put
that to the test 3 2 1 oh that hurt it
looks okay though so there's a little
bit of scuff on the rubber and a little
beat up here doesn't sound good but the
laptops still worse so maybe not
something you want to do with your
laptop all the time but it was a pretty
decent drop and it did survive this is
not a waterproof laptop the idea is is
that if you accidentally say knock your
drink on the keyboard it should be able
to survive 3 2 1
it looks like it still works the screens
still on so well the tripod is not
exactly working but yo totally works we
are good to go I mean it's really wet
right now and you probably want to let
this dry out but the laptop still works
time to take it up a notch so this is in
no way meant to be able to survive a
water balloon but since it's done well
so far
let's see kind of nervous right now ah
thank you thank you I got a little
nervous door that 3 2 1 oh no it's so
alive I mean it's completely soaking wet
oh we got a little bit of like screen
bleed here so it's maybe not in the
greatest shape ever but it's still alive
screen has seen better days but this is
a properly rugged laptop for $200
you know it just died good night we
actually do live so after drying out
overnight the Chromebook has come back
to life so if you look there's a little
bit of damage to the screen so this is
probably going to be permanent but of
course this is not meant to be able to
handle a water balloon to the screen
it's more for things like spills and
drops so as always I'll have a link to
check this guy out in the description
I'm curious what do you guys think about
the Chromebook let me know in the
comments below and I will catch you in
the next one it'll all be over soon bow
guy don't you worry</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
