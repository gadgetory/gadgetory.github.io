dual camera smartphone for months there
have been rumors that the next iPhone
would have dual rear facing cameras but
the bigger question is why exactly would
you want this there are several phones
that already have a pair of cameras but
one of the first was the HTC One m8 back
in 2014 this uses a standard sensor with
a smaller camera above which lets you do
some interesting things like change the
perspective of a shot after the fact or
adjust the focus to give you selective
depth of field this is pretty gimmicky
but things have improved a lot since
then
instead of upgrading the main camera LG
opted to add another wide-angle camera
on the g5 this lets you switch between
two different focal ranges on the fly
while a normal camera usually has a zoom
lens that can get you a tighter shot the
laws of physics means including a zoom
lens on a thin smartphone is nearly
impossible so now you're looking at me
on the LG g5 s main camera it's actually
really nice for a smartphone camera
however it is actually not that wide and
now we're recording on the g5 wide-angle
camera as you can see we're getting a
lot more in the shot it almost looks
like you're shooting on a GoPro right
John this is a pretty clever use of dual
cameras you'll notice pictures from the
wide angle or a bit softer but when you
need to get everything in the shot it's
a big help
the interface is pretty decent as well
if you start zooming instead of pure
digital zoom it transitions back to the
main camera which while not totally
smooth is a very cool feature you've got
some interesting options for taking
pictures or video with both cameras at
once to get a different perspective the
cool thing about this is that there's
really no downside the main camera takes
terrific shots and all the extra dual
camera features just adds the experience
on the other end of the spectrum there's
the Huawei p9
this takes a slightly different approach
with two nearly identical cameras around
back
one is a standard 12 megapixel sensor
with a Leica lens where the other is a
monochrome sensor in theory this gives
you a couple advantages the first of
which is that since it uses both cameras
to take a picture you're gathering more
light which the phone is able to use to
make your single photo better switch it
to monochrome mode and you also have a
dedicated black and white camera which
can give you cool results there's also a
mode to adjust depth of field like the
one I made if you want to make your
shots look like they were taken from a
bigger camera in reality though this is
really on the gimmicky side while the
camera app is like a styled and maybe a
bit complicated yet full of useful Pro
features the full code images are good
but
spectacular it's not that far off from
the best cameras like on the galaxy s7
but it's hard to see how much the dual
camera setup is really adding here that
said having the same camera really
doesn't hurt there are some cool
features now but most importantly
there's a lot of potential for the
future it'll be interesting to see what
the next iPhone does but dual cameras
really do seem to have a future you
might not need one today but this could
be the next big thing in smartphones the
