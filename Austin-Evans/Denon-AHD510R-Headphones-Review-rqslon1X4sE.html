of the Denon a HD 510 are over the ear
headphones I'm so I've had these for a
little while now
I actually took them to Las Vegas to
kind of test them out you know I listen
to all kinds of different genres of
music I listen to them on the plane back
and forth kind of test the noise quality
of you know how it keeps out all the
background noise as well I also use
these as my main aging headphones while
I was over there so to use but for all
for anything all of my videos so over
I'm ready to go ahead and give you guys
my full review tell you what I like and
what I didn't like and whether I think
you should purchase these or not um so
as with any headphone review we've got
to start out with the sound quality
itself pretty much the most important in
my opinion the most important thing when
you're buying headphones is whether they
sound good I mean why would you ever buy
headphones if a sound bad on this front
um mostly good mostly good it's they're
not perfect they're not going to be
amazing but for the $1 price point I'd
say that they get I get I give them a
pass so the base and the base is a
little bit low and I will say that but
overall everything else sounds pretty
decent the mids really quite good now it
can do keep in mind this is compared to
other headphones in the you know the hon
dollar price point
I mean don't go comparing these two you
know some really expensive Sennheiser's
or beads or anything like that but when
you take a look at headphones and
roughly this price range they do do
pretty well so like I said they're a
little lacking in bass which is kind of
a disappointment considering that most
over your headphones do kind of excel at
bass but there's still a reasonable
amount the treble and the highs are
acceptable again it not amazing but
pretty good and the mids are above
average I would say now for what this
kind of means fret in practical terms
and I found that metal if you kind of
listen to a lot of techno or hip hop on
these aren't going to be the greatest
now do keep minded that I'm not trying
to set it say I'm bad or anything like
that it's just that they are not really
suited for you know high bass you know
that kind of song they just follow flat
otherwise though most other genres of
music they do sound really quite
respectable you know they have nice
volume they're pretty clear they're
actually really quite clear you know
there's not a whole lot of mightiness in
the song so overall with the sound
quality goes I do
give the dens the girls are pretty good
on that front now it's going to move on
to the build quality now this is the
point where the reviews gonna take a
little bit of a bad turn as I really am
NOT a fan of the build quality of these
headphones so as you guys can see here
they are mate well hopefully you can see
that they are made of plastic now
there's nothing particularly wrong with
this however they just kind of feel
cheap so you know it's kind of hard to
say I mean you know I haven't had any
issues with them they haven't broken or
anything like that but I've had them for
you know a couple of months or anything
of any kind of long term so it's kind of
hard to say how they will hold up over
the long run they they just kind of feel
a little bit cheap you know they're all
pretty much entirely made of plastic now
it does have a nice kind of padding up
top which kind of does help keep it
comfortable and I will say that these
are very comfortable you're probably the
only other headphones I've worn that are
more comfortable than these are the
beats by Dredd studios and those are
probably something those are just
amazing so as far as comfort goes you
wear these for a long time no issues and
they do have some pretty nice padding in
the cups it's a little bit firm but once
you use them for a little while you get
used to it real fast and once I can kind
of get broken in a little bit and you
don't have any issues there so again
like I said the build quality is not
fantastic it just they just kind of feel
cheap on the other hand though on the
plus side is that they do they are very
light so I don't actually know the exact
weight or anything like that but I can
tell you these are pretty lightweight I
mean you're not gonna really have any
complaints about that you know you're
tossing a bag or even around your neck
or whatever you're really not gonna
notice and they are super lightweight so
I guess it's a decent trade-off but
personally out preferred they made it a
little bit nicer materials maybe you
know a different kind of plastic or
something just to kind of give it a more
of a premium feel because of course
these are $100 headphone plug one good
feature about these headphones is that
they do have controls for your iPod or
your iPhone so as you can see here you
do have your plus and minus you going to
adjust your volume as well as you can go
ahead and skip your songs and if you
flip it over on the back here you'll be
able to see it does have a small
microphone port you can go ahead and you
know use voice control or just use it as
you know just a general microphone to
report things now I should has really
impressed with the microphone it's
surprisingly really good quality the
buttons are
pretty generic I mean there's nothing
they're not bad they're not good they're
just you know they work pretty
functional but there's nothing really
particularly amazing about them now the
cable is kind of prone to getting all
you know wadded up and it's kind of
tangled which again not a lot of the
cables on headphones these days are
getting thicker however they do it don't
ask me but better you're getting where
you know you don't have to worry about
them getting tangled and this is about a
three-foot cable so it's the course
deciding to get you know extremely
tangle it's not gonna be a big deal you
see here you can get it wadded up and it
will get tangled pretty quickly I will
go ahead and take a look at the end
itself it's decent
there's not a whole lot to say about it
it will fit and you know pretty much any
ipod iphone you know anything really
device with a three-and-a-half
millimeter headset jack it's a little
bit big and bulky but again not a huge
deal in my opinion one so overall I had
kind of mixed feelings about these
headphones on one hand the audio quality
is really pretty good now for the price
I don't have any issues with the audio
quality I think it sounds pretty good
you know you're not gonna like again I
don't want to say that it's gonna be
amazing I mean for the same price you
probably get some Sennheiser's which
will sound a little bit better but
overall I mean there's really not a
whole point about the audio quality nice
if I had more bass but not really a big
deal it's not like you know the songs
are with a lot of bass or I'm you know
just they just you can't listen to him
or anything like that she says they're a
little bit lacking in that area now my
major problem with these is the build
quality now I just really just have a
hard time paying $100 for headphones
like this and they really feel like much
more like 30 maybe $40 headphones and
they just feel really pretty cheap now
whether this could actually be an issue
later on if they're gonna break or
anything like that it's kind of hard to
say they don't feel like they're going
to you know like you know you can crush
them or anything like that but I'm just
saying that they don't feel very very
high quality same goes for the cable you
know just it just kind of seems a little
bit cheap and it definitely is pretty
annoying I mean I'm just enduring this
review I mean I'm just looking down and
the cables hurdy getting that all
tangled up so overall I think these hip
bones are pretty solid unfortunately I
think they're just a little bit too
expensive now currently these are $100
pretty much the MSRP which is $100
that's pretty much everywhere you find
them I think I really can't recommend
them at
price now if you can find them for maybe
$75 then yeah I would definitely
recommend these they're pretty solid
again the audio quality which is the
most important thing is really pretty
pretty intact and you're not gonna have
really any issues with that and of
course I could definitely live with the
build quality so you can find these for
maybe $75 or perhaps the price goes down
when pick these up otherwise you might
want to pass they're just not quite the
up to the build quality that you expect
for this kind of level of headphones
anyway guys I do want to give a big
thanks to Dan for sending these out to
me for free to review for you all anyway
guys thanks for what</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
