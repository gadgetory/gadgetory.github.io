guys a bit of information on what
exactly is going on with jailbreaking
stay so if you've been paying attention
to it you know that it is getting really
complicated there are so many different
devices different firmwares this that is
that it can really be confusing there
hasn't go ahead and walk you through
what's going on what you can do today
some some of you might be able to go
ahead and jailbreak on iOS four today
others might want to wait a little bit
so I'm going to go ahead and cover
everything that you need to know so
first of all guys iowa's for if you have
an iphone 3g and ipod touch 2nd
generation mb model boy guys click right
about here so I'll have an annotation
click on that and I will show you the
video on redsnow that I made redsnow is
a really really solid program I like a
lot it basically will allow you to go
ahead and jailbreak if you're on the
gold master hey guys so some of you
might be otherwise you can go ahead and
get on it so if you want to have one of
those two devices in you on jailbreak
feel free that's a great way to do it I
was jailbroken for several weeks on that
on the other hand if you have either of
those two devices or an iphone 3gs old
bootrom when click right here that will
take you to my snowbreeze video which
explains how to do that well it's not
it's a little bit more complicated than
redsnow but still it's not too bad and
that's what i'm currently jailbroken on
right now but of course guys there's
pretty good chance that if you're
watching this video you don't have one
of these devices you have maybe an ipod
touch 3rd generation maybe an iphone 3gs
or maybe even an iphone 4 so guys in
that case there is several things that
you need to be looking out for so the
main thing is that there will be a
jailbreak coming very soon called spirit
now some of you guys might have heard
about it even use spirit before it's a
very very simple program basically
course it doesn't work for 4.0 yet but
basically back 13 point 1 point 3
without all you had to do was plug your
device in click the button your
jailbroken it's really that simple well
guys spirit will be updated very very
soon the iphone dev team and comex are
almost done finishing it up you know
putting the final touches on everything
to make sure that it's ready for a
release so guys I don't have any
information on when it will be out so
you know
getting dozens of messages every day
trying to you know people asking what
wins it out this is this so guys just
please be patient they are working on it
as fast as I can it almost is ready of
course I will have a full tutorial the
second it comes out so no worries guys
you want you know stick around on the
channel i will definitely cover it and
everything so guys that's about it one
last thing i do want to mention since a
lot of people ask me about this as well
that there is going to be an unlock for
the iphone for coming soon as well um so
actually he's just this morning the
planet being another member of the
iphone dev team was able to fight first
get and unlock ready to go on iphone 4
so guys this is really good news you if
you have an iphone 4 you will be able to
have it jailbroken and unlocked before
too long to you know use it on whatever
carrier you you want so again guys
definitely just stay tuned to the
channel i will be you know covering all
the jailbreaks as always and of course
this video is probably gonna be outdated
very quickly because you know jailbreak
stuff that happens every other day it
seems like so just take a look at the
annotations on the screen if anything
changes i'll let you know i mean a lot
kind of good stuff so guys thanks for
watching and you know if you have any
questions just feel free to leave in the
comments but hopefully I you know
answered all your questions and
everything that you know keep you up to
date and you know what kind of jail
breaks are coming everything anyway guys
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
