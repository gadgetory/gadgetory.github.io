the review of the PlayStation Vita now
as the successor to the PSP from 2005
this has a lot to live up to especially
considering how well the 3s is doing but
is it have what it takes
at first glance the answer looks to be a
giant yes just like the last generation
the Vita absolutely destroys the 3ds as
far as graphical capability goes it's
powered by a quad-core ARM Cortex a9 CPU
along with 512 megabytes of RAM it also
has a quad core GPU with 128 megabytes
of dedicated memory tech jargon aside
that gives the Vita more memory overall
than the PlayStation 3 graphics aren't
quite up to the level of the ps3 but
they're not all that far off
the tech doesn't stop there either the
Vita also sports a 5-inch OLED q HD
touchscreen to put in perspective the
PSP has a 4.3 inch screen and the 3ds
has an even smaller 3.5 inch display or
to make it a bit more clear the screen
on the Vita is roughly the same size as
the entire iPhone 4s as it's an OLED
panel that means it's also very clear
and vibrant with fantastic saturation
and excellent viewing angles while it
could be slightly high resolution
overall this is the best display I've
ever seen on a mobile device
another thing sony tried really hard
with are the different control methods
you'll find the same overall layout from
the PSP with shoulder buttons your
normal PlayStation buttons and a d-pad
but there are also now two analog sticks
not only do having to make playing many
more games a lot better they are also
raised making them a lot more ergonomic
than the slide pad on the PSP the Vita
also has a touchscreen which is the only
way to get around the UI and is used in
some games along with the rear touchpad
this is a fairly unique addition that
can give you some interesting new ways
to play games for example an uncharted
golden Abyss you can use it to presume
in the scope of your rifle which works
really quite well you can also use it to
push the ground up in the little
deviants just as you would push up a
piece of fabric from behind as if that
were not enough the Vita also comes with
a full complement of motion controls
including six axis and a compass just
like on the iPhone or Android this can
come in handy for many different types
of games and along with the rest of the
controls really do a very good job of
immersing you in the game going back to
uncharted is a great example you can use
the analog sticks and shoulder buttons
ordinarily but when you need to zero in
on someone you just flip the rear touch
panel to zoom in and tilt your visa
slightly to line the shot up perfectly
between the gray and
rolls large display and with a decent
pair of headphones the video does a
great job of sucking you into a game of
course it's not all good news to start
with the video is massive while around
the house it's fine it's borderline
pocketable it is fairly thin in
lightfoot size but there's no getting
around the fact that it's a huge slab of
glass and metal the UI is also well not
great to be honest on firmware 1.6
unlocking the video generally takes
several seconds which while not a big
deal is long enough for you to sit
around wondering why it's taking so long
the overall interface is also a bit too
cartoony for my taste but I will say
that runs very smoothly and there's
hardly any light to be found most likely
due to Sony keeping one of the CPU cores
and reserved speaking of the
responsiveness it's clear that the Vita
has tons of power there's almost no lag
to be found anywhere in the US or in
games they'll be interesting to see how
much farther developers can push the
console the Vita has a pair of cameras
I'm currently using the front-facing one
to record right now and now as you can
see negative are particularly good both
the front and rear facing cameras maxed
out at a resolution of 640 by 480 now as
far as stills go as long as you have
decent light you can take an okay
snapshot but beyond that it's really not
going to be worth much but the video is
actually kind of decent so it does
record in 480p at 30 frames per second
so everything's nice and smooth as you
can see in good light it's not too bad
it over both the Stills and video
degrade really rapidly when you get out
of nice light so they get very saturated
very grainy
of course you can hear the microphone is
not very good at all the Vita has two
different ways of playing games
you can purchase physical games which
come on carts they're roughly the size
of an SD card or you can download them
from the PlayStation Store the Vita has
no accessible onboard memory supplying a
memory card is basically required
they're close to the size of a micro SD
card and entirely proprietary so you'll
have to buy one from Sony they come in 4
8 16 and 32 gigabyte sizes at the moment
and range anywhere from $20 for 4
gigabytes up to a wallet seering $100
for a 32 gigabyte card the Vita has
compatibility with PSP games PSP minis
and apps as a recording this review apps
aren't live yet but will include Twitter
Facebook Skype Netflix and many more
when the Vita officially launches ps1
games should be available soon as well
you can play PSP games by downloading
them from the store and they run very
well with the option to use the second
analog stick
the Vita as well as using a filter to
make the graphics look a bit less
pixelated with all this power you've got
to pay for it somewhere and in the
Vita's case it's in battery life sony
claims three to five hours of life and i
found that to be pretty accurate as with
mixed use and some standby time i got
around three and a half to four hours
out of a charge certainly not bad
considering the specs of the Vita and
how thin it is but it would be nice to
have a bit more longevity there are also
some oddities
for example the browser is reasonably
fast however it doesn't seem to cache
pages and has to read render the content
anytime you scroll giving you a
checkerboard pattern pretty much all the
time the left shoulder button also
squeaks when pressed hard on my console
which is a bit odd considering just how
well the rest of the Vita is built I'm
willing to bet that I'm just unlucky but
it is something to consider
overall my nerd side which is about 90%
of me absolutely loves the Vita the
power is there and the controls are
absolutely fantastic
not just for a handheld console but for
any console period like most new
consoles it's probably not a bad idea to
wait a little while to see what games
come out as well as let Sonique work out
the kinks however if you're looking for
an absolutely awesome little console
right now I highly recommend the PS Vita
if you enjoyed and want to be awesome
definitely be sure to leave this video a
thumbs up and if you want to see more
