Nintendo switch and while some might
want to use it in its puny normal state
of course here we need to build the
ultimate Nintendo switch one of the nice
things about the switch is that as a
handheld console there's actually a lot
that we can do as far as the aesthetics
which is where this comes in this is a
shell exchange as well as a different
shell for the joint cons now if you know
anything about the world of joy cons
you're probably familiar with this
incredibly handsome gentleman mr. Kevin
Kenton you've opened up a joy Connor to
my friends a couple two hours late ale
lettuce a snap driven table I've never
done that we basically just ruin the
strike we should we just break the dreck
on so um we'll be back tomorrow once we
actually sort out this joy con mess so a
day later we have a magically completed
joy con swap never lined would happen in
between
we're don't worry about this part that's
not that we didn't need a replacement or
anything I gotta say that this actually
looks really cool if you guys want to
know how to do the joy con swap for
yourself kevin has actually done a full
video showing you natalie the different
shells but also how to do stuff like the
d-pad swap yeah so actually did one
specifically on these atomic purple ones
this is so happy just kind of just
seeing whether it works or not which it
actually works great so yeah check that
out out of the box something the switch
doesn't really have a lot of is internal
storage and especially with games like
la noir which require like 15 20 gigs of
storage to actually just install it even
if you have the cart what you're gonna
probably want to pick up is a micro SD
card and thankfully you can even get
like 128 gig cards for like 40 bucks
thankfully this is pretty much the
easiest thing you can do to a switch
just open up the kickstand and when you
suddenly have 128 gigs of storage
I've through the joy console nothing
else is exciting one of the things that
makes the switch interesting is the idea
that it is a portable console that can
be docked however one of the problems is
is that you actually can't scratch the
screen if you're not careful as the
inside of the dock is pretty much just
hard plastic that's where a good glass
screen protector comes in I think these
notches are actually gonna make it a
little easier one screen protector fully
enabled so this is starting to look cool
but we do not have the ultimate Nintendo
switch yet next we have the wired LAN
adapter to get this guy up on Ethernet
wow that's actually a pretty big
adapters
so no here oh there we go
so we show that there actually we're
connected over Ethernet so the else you
can use is the power plate the idea here
is that not only is this a portable
charger that you can drop your joy
Kahn's on but it will also charge your
switch the switch has ok battery life
but generally speaking the joy Kahn's
actually do last quite a while
however it's nice to be able to have a
little bit of a bigger battery if you
really want to get some extra juice out
of the switch this comes in a few
different pieces so there's the dock
itself which you will drop the battery
on what you should do here is if we take
off our joy cons they should just slide
right onto the battery so by default
they will start charging the joy cons
and you can just use it like this and
then drop it into the dock to charge the
entire thing however so with this tiny
USBC cable that it comes with we
actually can charge the switch using our
joy con charger so you plug this end
into the switch and this end into the
top we should in theory get a charge a
now charging so if you want to use your
switch like this you can get triple
charged action even though you might as
well just put the joy Khans on here
because it'll charge it anyway but um
you know I don't have anything to say
it's just the thing ok I will be the
first to admit that our stand could use
a little bit of work which is where the
play stand comes in so way this is
supposed to be used is that it's
actually going to be a stand that you
can use to fully adjust where the switch
is going to be standing while still
being able to charge it hey it works ok
this is not the most ridiculous setup
ever but say you want a dock that's
going to be a little bit more portable
than what Nintendo throws in the Box
well that's where this comes in so on
one end we have USB C but on the other
we have melon USBA but we also have HDMI
oh look we're even on Ethernet now this
is fully portable oh this is so good and
it looks totally the same like I can't
see any like latency or any real issues
with this look at this this is not the
most ridiculous thing we've ever built
this actually is like mildly practical
we did it we actually have something
that's not totally stupid well at least
yet all right mr. Kevin Kenton please
come in here for a second
we have our switch going into a USB C
hub which is being powered by a battery
it's going HDMI out to the display and
we have a USB Ethernet adapter all and
glorious 1080p this is super cool and
that uh I'm really proud of what we just
accomplished even though it doesn't make
any sense
well it makes sense it's just 1,000%
unnecessary but it's awesome
some say unnecessary some say Ultimates
ultimately necessary but say you want to
build the ultimate actually Portable
Nintendo switch where that is where this
monstrosity comes in this is a 10,000
milliamp hour battery case for the
switch wait a minute this weighs just as
much as the switch so I just need to
plug this in and then pop the cable in
on the bottom and then okay so now we
are charging with this giant battery
bank so it's cool here is that nollie do
you have an additional USB a if you want
to run another accessory but it also has
USB C power and so if you really want to
get crazy we can double up our batteries
oh there we go
so now we have a portable set up with
double batteries and the kicker is so
you get it kicker we actually have a
decent kickstand because this has one
built in and it kind of works right
right right
you know I think most sane people would
see this and go this is a horrible
mistake
you should stop but not us because we
double down this is the clip grant to be
clear this clip is meant for a
smartphone so not only do we have our
smartphone here with all the chats and
stuff up there's also a small battery
built into the grip which is charging
the Joye cons however no way that's
gonna work oh oh oh it does it does oh
wait wait wait hang on I've got to bend
it a little bit it's like literally
maxed out on the lip all come on oh come
on we got it it works
don't worry about the duct tape I
complain really gently when you clicked
on the ultimate Nintendo switch video I
hope this is what you had in mind also
we can't turn the volume down because we
taped over the volume buttons so we
learned a lot today most notably some of
the stuff
is pretty good this type-c dock is
actually awesome but of course if you
guys want to check out any of this stuff
the links will be in the description and
let me know what you guys want to see
next time on building the ultimate
terrible idea I hear you guys thank you
so much for watching and I will catch
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
