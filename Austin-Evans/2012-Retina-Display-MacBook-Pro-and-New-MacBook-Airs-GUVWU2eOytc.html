the video recapping WWDC 2012 Apple
announced quite a few things to the
event however what we're going to talk
about today are the new MacBooks to
start with let's talk about the next
generation MacBook Pro now they're
actually keeping the current generation
around and I'll explain that in just a
minute but first starters let's go over
the brand new flagship of line so the
new MacBook Pro has a lot of new
features but probably the most important
is the new Retina display so it's a 15
point 4 inch panel with a resolution of
28 80 by 1800 if you guys keeping track
that is a lot of pixels that's more than
the iPad 3 that's more than any kind of
high definition TV it's even more than
the 27-inch iMac the new MacBook Pro is
also quite a bit thinner so it's not
quite as thin as the MacBook Air however
it's pretty close at only 0.7 inches all
the way across on top of that they've
also removed a few things and added some
ports so they had to remove the optical
drive I don't think anyone is all that
surprised about that and they've also
removed firewire as well as Ethernet in
exchange they've added a pair of
Thunderbolt ports USB 3.0 as well as
HDMI out these new MacBook Pros are also
fast so you can pick it up with either
an Intel Core i5 or Core i7 CPU both of
them are going to be quad core and there
are also the latest Ivy Bridge models on
top that you can pick it up with either
8 or 16 gigabytes of RAM an SSD between
256 gigabytes 512 gigabytes for 768
gigabytes
again an SSD there's not going to be any
kind of normal hard drive option and as
far as graphics go it's going to be
powered by the nvidia geforce GT 650 M
the new MacBook Pros are going to be
shipping today and it's going to start
at a list price of $2,200 definitely not
cheap however for that money you wanted
to get the quad core Core i5 I'm gonna
get a gigabytes of RAM and a 256
gigabyte SSD like I said earlier these
are not the only new MacBook Pros so the
current generation with the same design
is still going to be staying around so
it's going to be starting with the
13-inch it's gonna still be $1200
however it will now have the new core i5
with the intel HD 4000 graphics the
15-inch model of the macbook pro is also
going to be staying around and just like
the 13-inch it's going to gain a few new
features so it will have a Core i5 or
Core i7 and have USB 3 don't stay the
same prices the MacBook Airs also saw an
update so the design is just the same
and you're still going to be able to
pick it up as an 11 or a 13
model however the prices and some of the
specs have changed the 11 inch air still
starts at $1,000
and for that price you're going to get a
core i5 four gigabytes of RAM which is
that from two gigabytes previously and a
64 gigabyte SSD at $1,100 you'll be able
to get that exact same set up but with
128 gigs of SSD storage moving on to the
13-inch air for $1,200 you'll be able to
pick up the base model which comes with
four gigabytes of storage a slightly
upgraded core i5 as well as 128
gigabytes of storage now for another
$300 on top of that you can bring that
120 gigabytes up to 256 alright so let's
go over all these new models so for
starters the next generation MacBook Pro
is going to be starting at $2,200 it's
going to come in a 15.4 inch variety now
of course that 15 inch display is going
to be retina which should be really nice
it also comes standard with a quad-core
processor 8 gigabytes of RAM and a 256
kilobyte SSD we also have brand-new 13
and 15 inch MacBook Pros now these are
going to come with Core i5 or optionally
a core i7 and they will also come with
normal standard spinning hard drives we
also have the new MacBook Airs which
come in a 13 inch and an 11 inch model
so the 13-inch starts at $1,200 and
comes the Core i5 4 gigabytes of RAM and
128 gigabyte SSD the 11 inch will also
come with 4 gigabytes of RAM a slightly
low respect Core i5 as well as 64
gigabytes of SSD storage and space
configuration for $1000 now all these
computers are shipping as of today and
they will all get a free update to
mountain lion next month so you guys
have it before recap on all the new
MacBook Pros and MacBook Airs I'm very
curious to know what do you guys think
personally I'm going to be ordering a
new 11 inch MacBook Airs smooth I'm done
editing this video but of course I'm
very curious to know what you guys are
thinking anyway if you enjoyed this
