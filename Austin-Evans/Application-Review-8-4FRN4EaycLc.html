I've got finally my application of u8 I
know it's been a while since seven but
seeing as I've been making lots of other
videos but it I do at least have three
really good apps in this Terminator
Salvation light hero smart alight and
real race all three I'm very happy with
so let's get this one started
okay so let's get this one started
Terminator Salvation light this is a
pretty cool one um I admit I hadn't
really I know the Terminator Salvation
came out a while ago I really hadn't
paid much attention to it
light version came out just a bit ago
and I got it and I'm actually very
impressed with it it features some
really nice graphics some pretty nice
gameplay very reminiscent of maybe like
a xbox title or something with with some
really nice things such as like cover
and in like no health meter but you have
like read the ABS on the edges of your
vision which is very cool and all that
stuff you see an Xbox it also has some
decent cutscenes and graphics like a
like I said the graphics are great
basically what it is is yeah as it is a
light version it's very short
I think it's I played through it maybe
like less than 10 minutes but still like
gave me a very good idea of the game and
I'm probably gonna go ahead and get it
just because it was very cool basically
what is is terminator if you guys have
seen terminator salvation or you guys
know about terminator you'll know it's
pretty simple it's set maybe I think a
couple years like maybe 2010 or
something I'm not really sure it's it's
set in a near future where that
Terminator robots have taken over guys
I'm sorry I really don't know much about
it so I'm probably tting this all wrong
but basically you've got to shoot a
trope few different robots and
everything and yeah it's it's pretty
simple um like I said it takes some
really good ideas such as you can get
into cover you can tote obviously you
can totally run around you can get into
cover shoot it's very cool I haven't
really seen yet being able to get into
cover everything besides in the snake in
assaults in that game but that would
only didn't count so much just because
you were just sitting there one you
basically it's a really short demo but
it's a lot of fun because you you walk
around totally and you take down lots of
different enemies and everything um I
gotta say I was very impressed with it
there was no framerate issues really at
all um even on jailbroken even on my
jailbroken iPod
um there was it was very simple to move
controls were decent um although I would
definitely switch from the standard you
can you have on the left you have a
little that d-pad but a little scroll
with I forget what all they come up with
a new name for every day and then you
got on the right you've got the fire
button and then you're supposed to tap
on the screen to turn but I'm much
preferred using the accelerometer or
pretty well I'll leave this one as s
guys I like it yeah I definitely go
check it out it's obviously this free
light person I'm Prime ight get go ahead
and get the full game I'm not sure yet
but I was pretty much the light version
at least okay so the second app that
would be reviewing today is hero of
Sparta light now this one no my first
impressions on this one is very simple
if you've ever played on the PlayStation
God of War
then heroes Sparta is very very similar
it uses similar camera angles um it
first the thing not the the iPhone games
I thought was closest to is Crowell
which I really like this that game um
here's part but the thing is he Kroll is
it's just a side scroller even though
the 3d it doesn't look like it basically
you go that's right here this part you
can actually move forward back although
you're still on mostly linear path but
really the gameplay if you don't have
Crowell the gameplay is really really
similar to God for down to even I mean
basically it's obviously Sparta instead
of the stead of the themes of God of War
but still it's very similar you've got
everything from you've got you go at
when you have the counter the meter the
counts every time you take down an enemy
then you go into modes where you go uh
where when you get into a I think it's
focus mode I'm sorry I totally forgot or
basically you just tap different parts
of the screen once your frenzy again I'm
not remembering the correct terms for
this but you go and you tap the
different things and there's really cool
cutscenes or you're telling it but it's
it looks like cutscene where you're like
jump on top of him and I like stick it
through his head and everything it's not
is gory obviously is god of war just
because I mean it's the it's an iPod or
an iPhone it's not you know doesn't have
that great graphics
and speaking of graphics you know it's
not that bad by any stretch of
imagination but I can't let Crowell
better it's a little blurry grainy um
your little your uh your characters much
smaller and in general it just seems
less fluid than Crowell that's just my
opinion obviously it's not bad I mean
it's not unplayable anything it's just
something I kind of noticed the demo is
I mean the demo the lite version is very
short again like just like in Terminator
it cuts off halfway through the first
mission ceiling get to play the first
mission but again I was able to get a
good idea of it and this one I'm
probably gonna not get it was decent but
I just wasn't that impressed with it I
did like a lot of the different things
about it but just not quite for me I
don't thing but again it's the lite
version if you guys like this game
especially if you like to call it war
this looks just like god of war for the
iPod so you know you guys might want to
go check it out okay guys so here is the
app that I've been waiting for for a
long time it's actually my second video
I ever made was a preview on this it is
called real racing it came out actually
the the morning of the World Wide
Developers Conference and I was excited
about it I didn't quite pick it up
because I was busy getting all ready for
the WWDC and I kind of forgot about it
but a couple days later I totally I
remember I got oh I totally thought
about that and I got I've been using for
several days and guys it's $10 and I had
never been happier with spending $10
period I mean yeah you think $10 yeah
that's pricey for an app but you
consider I mean this game is just
awesome
it's hands-down the best racing game
ever I've ever seen on an iPod or iPhone
it mean it beats I was a huge fan back
like ten years ago I was a huge huge fan
of Gran Turismo for the PlayStation guys
this blows that away I mean everything
from graphics are quite a bit better got
inside you've got your inside to you
where you can actually your your
steering with the accelerometer and you
actually the you actually see the inside
I guess the helmet view
I don't know but you basically see
basically what your what you would see
if you were driving the car
everything from gear shifts the whole
camera angle pans perfectly when you
turn the iPod left and right it really
is very cool it features now one slight
thing and this is kind of just something
that I mean you guys probably wouldn't
care about I do a little bit is it it's
kind of generic cars and I understand
that because if you want to use a real
car you have to license it and that
obviously costs money and it's expensive
there it's well same thing but it costs
money and everything so I guess I get
why they kind of use generic cars I
would liked maybe a little bit better if
there's actual real cars but I mean
that's just kind of a nitpick now guys
this is not gonna be my full-on review I
will be doing an in-depth review on I'm
just gonna kind of go over a few the
features of it yeah definitely look up
for a look out for an in-depth review ok
so basically there are some really cool
features on this one of which is serious
online play you can go online do time
trials join leagues all kinds of stuff
in addition you can record your replays
you can report to replace and upload
them to youtube I think that's awesome
and I will definitely I have not
actually tested yet I'll probably be
testing it out very soon you guys take a
look and that's also let you guys know
just how awesome this looks seriously
the graphics on this or awesome I mean
there's light there's shadows all the
models you don't see there's nothing
ugly about them I mean yeah obviously if
you play a 360 it's not that great but
for an iPod or an iPhone that are
awesome there's lots of cars I want to
say there's 50 or 60 I'm pretty I've
haven't played the game a ton I've been
just mostly pulling at it my pocket
everyone smiling racing a few races but
there's different different types of
cars such as hatches sports cars muscle
cars I mean there's also there's also
all kinds of different like I said
online Championships you can go to all
kind of stuff I'll just cut here guys
definitely look out for an in-depth
review want it but if you will if you
don't want to wait for that I know
there's no light version but definitely
if
you like racing games at all I mean guys
this this this is just awesome hey guys
