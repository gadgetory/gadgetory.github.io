2 is official and it takes everything
that was good about the original and
brings it up a notch
was the added benefit of not having a
notch
the original razor phone was a
polarizing device what it did well it
did really well what didn't work though
was basically a deal-breaker the
highlight last year was the 5.7 inch
1440p XO display now what made this so
good for gaming wasn't just the pure
size of the display or the quality but
the frame rate as opposed to basically
every other smartphone out there which
is capped at 60 frames per second the
razor phone can go all the way up to 120
fps and that continues with the razor
phone to the 120 Hertz panel carries
over this year but with some key
improvements most notably brightness so
the last year's panel actually was a
good solid accurate display but it just
didn't get all that bright thankfully
that is something that has been improved
with the razor phone - with up to 50%
more brightness now mind you when we
were able to try it on a brief hands-on
the difference wasn't massive but it is
definitely going to be at least somewhat
brighter than last year the fluidity is
just as impressive as it was last year
with a full 120 Hertz refresh rate
everything is buttery smooth not just
games I mean the UI itself is one of the
most noticeable things we're doing
something simple like scrolling through
a web page or some email now the closest
competitor is actually the iPad pros
with pro motion this is a very similar
feeling with that 120 Hertz refresh rate
and it's really some things that you
kind of have to see to really understand
what's kind of interesting is that the
game support actually is a little bit
more hit and miss so on the Android side
a lot of titles only hit around 30
frames per second much less 60 or even
120 but a fair few games are becoming
optimized for that higher refresh rate
either with running with unlocked frame
rates or with running with some kind of
higher mode that will at least target
something like 90 FPS when it does
support it it makes a big difference but
the issue is is that well a lot of games
don't even come close but I guess the
hardware is there my actual favorite
feature though are the speakers now with
a razor phone one what you got were two
incredibly loud incredibly detailed
speakers and that carries over to the
razor phone too but with some key
upgrades
unlike most other phones with dual
speakers such as the iPhone which takes
advantage of the earpiece as well as the
bottom firing speaker and don't get me
wrong that does sound good but with
having to
huge proper speakers aimed directly at
your face it makes a big difference it's
really straightforward the razor phone
has the best speakers on any smartphone
period now not only are they rich and
detailed but a big part of it is the
stereo separation now it is further
helped by the fact that it does have
Dolby 5.1 surround support which is
weird because there are two speakers but
you move past that what you're kidding
is something that does give you some
real presence music and video sound good
but it's especially noticeable in games
so specifically with hub G you can
really tell where people are around you
purely using the speakers which is
really impressive the only downside to
the whole audio setup is that we still
don't have a headphone jack which would
be nice on the ultimate gaming phone but
I mean at least there's a good dongle in
the Box the screen speakers were really
the strong suit is the original RAZR
phone it's nice to see they've been at
least somewhat enhanced for this new
version and that's going to definitely
be a trend it is a very similar phone of
the original RAZR phone just improved in
some not so subtle ways see the problem
with the og was that while it was a good
gaming phone it really wasn't good for
much beyond that there was no water
resistance no wireless charging the
screen was a little bit dim in daylight
and the biggest issue was that the
camera was straight-up abysmal no credit
where credit's due
they have improved the camera quite a
bit with firmware updates but there's
only so much you can do with the
hardware that's included which is where
the razor phone 2 comes in thankfully
they've stepped up the game with new
Sony sensors improved optics for both
the standard as well as telephoto
cameras and a fully rewritten software
stack from the ground up to better take
advantage of photos that are not crunchy
and terrible the phone I tried wasn't
running final software so I'm not able
to share the images that I took on it
but it was a big improvement over the
original razor phone no no it probably
won't compete with the iPhones and the
pixels and the galaxies of the world but
at the very least it should be a usable
camera which is very nice in your
expensive flagship gaming phone and that
is a big deal when you're spending this
kind of money you should expect no
compromises so one of the additions this
year is full IP 67 water resistance now
that's actually kind of impressive
considering just how huge those speakers
are it's not easy to waterproof
something like that there's also a new
glass back which supports wireless
charging it up to 15 watts speaking of
the glass back while the overall
dimensions of the
phoner very similar there is a
revolutionary new feature this year an
RGB chroma Razer logo yes it actually
isn't as bad as it might seem so you can
of course turn it fully off and the
colors are not only going to be full RGB
but fairly subtle it kind of looks more
like a colored logo than a bright flashy
damer logo gamer logo gamer unlike other
gaming phones the razer phones design is
fairly subdued now sure it doesn't have
the same sort of flash as the ROG phone
but a lot of people myself included
probably would prefer something that's
just a little bit more subtle the rest
of the specs are good but nothing all
that crazy
you've got the snapdragon 845 paired
with 8 gigabytes of RAM 64 gigs of
storage expandable via microSD as well
as a big 4 thousand milliamp power
battery the only thing that's really
remarkable is the vapor chamber cooling
unlike a lot of other water-cooled
smartphones which have a tiny little
heat pipe razor instead opted to go for
a nearly full sized vapor chamber which
goes directly on top of the processor
now how much of a difference this makes
is remain to be seen but it does make a
big difference when it comes to gaming
for long sessions when you don't want to
throttle down to like half your normal
clock speed like some other smartphones
the razor phone really did kick off the
gaming phone trend something I don't
think is going anywhere anytime soon but
the real question as it was last year is
do you actually need a gaming phone take
a look at the PC space for example
there's a very clear need for gaming
focused hardware sure you can play some
games on ultrabooks but it's not going
to be anywhere near the experience of
playing something with proper CPU
especially proper dedicated graphics on
the mobile side though that need is
there but the actual hardware really
hasn't caught up so when you consider
that the $800 Razer phone has the same
spec as a 400 hour poco phone sure the
razor phone might not throttle quite as
much but the overall experience not
counting the screen the speaker's the
actual performance itself isn't going to
be massively different all that being
said the razor phone one had a ton of
potential but some major drawbacks
whereas the razor phone 2 can be really
summed up very simply it is a refinement
of that original design and it really is
what the razor phone one should have
been that $800 price though it means
that this is squarely up against the
high-end flagship of the world now the
main question for me is going to be the
camera
I really don't think it's going to match
up to the very very high-end stuff like
the pixels and the galaxies but as long
as it is decent enough I think that'll
be good enough for most people but the
difference between good enough and great
is a huge one in this space right now
the real elephant in the room right now
is the ROG phone now on paper it does
have some superior specs in some ways it
does have the headphone jack some
additional accessories and that 90 Hertz
OLED display so I would like to think
that the Razr phone ROG would be a good
head-to-head comparison but until the
ROG phone comes out it's really hard to
nail that down there's no doubt that the
razor phone too is a big step forward
with that high refresh rate display the
loud speakers and the solid performance
it should be a real winner if you're
into gaming I'm really curious what do
you guys think about the concept of a
gaming phone and is it really worth the
extra money</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
