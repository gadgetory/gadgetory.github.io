the test of the 2012 MacBook Air for
starters we'll be doing a boot test and
here the air is extremely fast only
taking just over 13 seconds to boot this
is mostly due to the faster SSD that
makes opening ass very quick next up we
have nova bench which is a general test
of performance with 8 gigabytes of RAM
the core i5 and 128 gigabyte Toshiba SSD
here the MacBook Air notch to score of
633 which is a decent improvement over
the 542 score of the last gen air moving
right along we have the Blackmagic disk
speed test to see exactly how fast the
SSD is write speeds generally hovered
around 350 megabytes a second and talk
four hundred and sixty mega it's a
second for reads which isn't far off
from the fastest full-size SSDs on the
market today
for graphics I used Cinebench which runs
through the scene of a car chase and
recorded the French per second while the
intel HD 4000 graphics are much better
than the last MacBook Air the benchmark
is only able to wrap up with 15 frames
per second which is far off from a
laptop with high-end dedicated graphics
next we have a gaming demo with
Minecraft as you can see the air handles
the game no problem and although I did
turn the render distance down a bit
everything else works maxed out of
course if you're on a crazy server you
may need to turn a few things down but
overall I had no problems moving on
we've got portal 2 surprisingly this
runs on the MacBook at native resolution
with all settings turned up except for
anti-aliasing from time to time the
framerate did dip below 30 frames per
second but overall it was quite
impressed and they became perfectly
smooth by bumping this things down very
slightly lastly we have a test of the
video editing chops this is a one-minute
1080p clip dropped into ScreenFlow and
exported at 720p the air did respectably
well here taking just over three minutes
you can cut that down a good bit by
moving to 720p also shut up for a minute
so you can hear the fan noise
overall while it can't compete with the
new retina MacBook Pro the 11 inch air
is a very fast portable machine that can
handle moderate video editing and even a
bit of gaming if you guys enjoyed this
video be sure to leave it the thumbs up
