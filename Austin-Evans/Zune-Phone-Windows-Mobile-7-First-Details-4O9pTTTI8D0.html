today I'm here with a video I'm going
over all the latest rumors we have on
the Zune phone as well as Windows Mobile
7 both should be announced at the world
mobile Congress later this month and
some of the things we know we're
actually pretty impressive
you know Windows Mobile that got kicked
around I mean it's old it does it's slow
and it's just nothing nothing really
compared to you know like the iPhone OS
for Android so well it's finally getting
redesigned it might just maybe be able
to actually compete so let's go ahead
and go over everything we know and see
what we got anyway let's keep this one
star
okay so let's go over the hardware part
this which is obviously the zenfone now
it's got we got a lot of the specs on it
we don't have everything but from what
we know it's pretty good well what we
know the Windows Mobile is actually
going to need a lot higher specs to run
so you know most pretty much any windows
mobile 6.5 device right now will not be
able to run Windows Mobile 7 blame the
only device that we do know that will be
improved or I'm sorry upgraded the way
the HTC hd2
and that obviously has a Snapdragon
processor that's huge capacitive screen
so you know that both pretty well for
Windows Mobile 7 so just just kind of
basing off of that and plus what we know
is pretty easy to piece together what
those zoom phone is going to have should
have a Snapdragon processor and we do
know that it's one had an NVIDIA Tegra
chip the NVIDIA Tegra is what the Zune
HD uses and it's a pretty powerful
little chip it allows you to play 720
video obviously you're not gonna really
enjoy 720 video on a small screen but
you can output it to a TV shouldn't run
really nice and smooth also can run some
pretty nice games look at the Zune HD
there's some really pretty graphically
intense games that it runs with that
problem so I would definitely expect
Windows Mobile to you know utilize the
same sort of games now the only thing we
really don't know about is what it's
going to look like now even though we're
calling it the Zune phone and for
businesses basically those in phone
we've been waiting for it's not going to
be named you know Microsoft Zune phone
or any it's not going to really be
marketed as a Zune phone the zooming
part comes from the software which I'll
get into in a minute but that said we
can still expect that it's going to pull
a lot of features and looked from the
Zune HD I'm not expecting to be very
angular maybe not quite as you know all
metallic and and you know basically like
you know just a really mean wedge
looking things that you know something
that's the stuff like an iPod Touch so
it would kind of expect something maybe
not quite so as aggressive looking but
still something that looks pretty cool
so you
I think the hardware-wise the zoom
funnel is pretty good but now we're
gonna get into Windows Mobile 7 so let's
move on to the software side which is
arguably going to be bigger than just
this info it's going to be Windows
Mobile 7 when does mobile 7 really
should be a pretty big step up from you
know will 66.5 all the previous it's
gonna require a lot faster hardware but
it also shouldn't it be a lot smoother
and a lot a lot nicer looking if you
look at windows mobile 6.5 pretty much
any Windows Mobile 4 it's really make
first a stylus and you know that just
really doesn't cut it for this day and
time now fingers I mean passive screens
with your finger that's the way to go so
all these small menus and a lot of stuff
I mean they've tried to make it they try
to fix it earlier that's like putting a
band-aid over it I mean that's not
that's not not cut it so I would expect
it to be a very a lot more finger
friendly and obviously it's going to
look a lot better as well I would expect
that they would use some zoom some stuff
from the Zune HD HD has a really really
nice looking interface so I would expect
they would pour some not all but some of
the really nice-looking things like you
know some of the cool transitions and
how the text is like you know layered
and stuff that looks pretty cool so I
would expect they would bring some of
that over but probably one of the most
significant things about Windows Mobile
7 specifically for the zenfone is going
to be exhumed software now if you pay
attention you know that the zoom they
like of course when they first came out
soon was the mp3 players and that was
pretty much it
but the mp3 players didn't do too well
so they kind of mixed it up and right
now only the only zoom Hardware you can
buy as an HD they've gotten rid of that
all everything else instead they're
trying to bring the zoo brand name over
to some more like software almost like
it a competitor to iTunes if you look
better I've done this on the Xbox 360
with the Zune Marketplace which is where
you buy music movies and TV shows and
all that kind of stuff so they're going
to bring over the whole thing to Windows
Mobile 7
so you're going to have a really nice
music player I would doubt it'd be very
very similar if not identical to
actually there's an HD as far as the
music is concerned you'll also be able
to buy music and movies and TV shows
just like on iTunes as well as you would
get the access to buying the Zune pass
which for certain amount of money per
month you can download unlimited songs
so between the Zune the zoom software
and Windows Mobile 7 hopefully this new
Zune phone can actually really step it
up and get Windows Mobile back to where
it used to be ok so guys that is my
wrap-up of the Zune phone as well as
Windows Mobile 7 you know put together
the Zune phone looks like a pretty solid
piece of hardware the NVIDIA Tegra chip
is great snapdragons great and you know
finally having capacitive touchscreen
cuz it's gonna finally just make Windows
7 but as Mobile 7 pretty good so in the
hardware side of things it looks pretty
solid on the software side it's a little
harder to tell we don't know a whole lot
of details but Windows Mobile 7 could be
pretty decent anything that it's taken
years and years to do it I've got to
expect the pavement doing something
there yeah take a look Hey look this is
an iPhone I think this looks pretty good
let's try this on ours but glad to see
both the Zune phone and Windows Mobile 7
should be announced at the world mobile
Congress later this month
so then we'll finally see if it's going
to be worth it or not
but until then I gotta say I'm kind of
optimistic
it looks both of them could be pretty
decent and hey that time Windows Mobile
stopped sucking here guys thanks for
