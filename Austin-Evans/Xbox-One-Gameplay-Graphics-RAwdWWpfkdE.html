the demo of graphics and gameplay on the
Xbox one the first game we've got is
Ryse son of Rome Ryze reminds me a lot
of God of War as the hero is a Roman
general bent on revenge and the gameplay
focuses a lot on gory combos to take out
waves of enemies as far as next-gen
games go Ryze definitely does a great
job showing off the power of the Xbox
one the lighting in depth of field was
great and some of the levels are huge
with tons of AI on screen at once one of
the most impressive parts of the visuals
are the facial animations a lot of the
in-game cinematics are awesome but
buried blood and we know they bleed us
Wheaton gameplay a solid if a bit bland
it revolves around chaining together
attacks and blocks against several
enemies at once and after you wear them
down you can activate an execution which
finishes them off and regains you a bit
of help as well as long as you have
decent timing it's not that difficult
and while they look cool executions
quickly become a bit repetitive while
character models for the enemies are
reused all the time overall Ryze is a
fun fairly short game that nicely shows
off what you should expect out of
next-gen games
oh fuck Fortson motorsport 5 is one of
my favorite games for the Xbox one I've
always been a big fan of realistic
racing simulators like Gran Turismo and
this latest version of courts it does a
great job while it's a bit down on the
sheer number of cars and tracks there's
a lot new like Drive Attar's
which replace the typical in-game AI
with drivers based on real-life players
which is fun except when they drive
dirty which is basically all the time
by default the game leaves on a ton of
aids to help you drive but as you turn
more off which you totally should you're
rewarded with majorly increased bonuses
and credits visually portal looks great
as it's running at 1080p at 60 frames
per second one of the few Xbox one
titles that does you have the normal
behind the car views along with the very
nicely detailed and cockpit view for
each car and impressively it keeps up a
solid frame rate making sure the sense
of speed never drops you've also got a
split-screen mode which is a feature I
wish more games would bring back
all-in-all fortune is a solid racing
game for the one
next up we've got the latest entry into
the Call of Duty franchise ghosts this
is also available on last gen consoles
like the 360 so it shouldn't be a
surprise that it's not massively
different on the Xbox one story wise
this is Infinity Ward's first time
moving on from modern warfare since 2007
and it's well it's a Call of Duty game
you're an elite commando and a squad of
ghosts in post-apocalyptic America only
this time you're joined by a dog which
is a complete killing machine meters
seriously how does the dog even do this
there are a few other new additions like
extinction mode which feels like the
classic zombies here you're fighting
aliens in a more open map while
defending a drill you're able to upgrade
with better weapons and perks as you go
along and it's actually quite a bit of
fun graphically ghosts can't really
match up with other Xbox one titles
there are cut down loading times and
some nice depth of field effects but
even with the low resolution textures
the game still runs at 720p albeit at a
smooth 60 frames per second overall it's
another cold duty game with a fresh coat
of paint
Dead Rising 3 is flat-out fun it's an
open world zombie game that doesn't take
itself too seriously for a change
seriously what other game lets you kill
zombies with a tennis ball launcher or a
remote-control helicopter while the
story and characters are fairly
over-the-top with the most impressive is
how much choice you have the amount of
weapons you can use in craft is enormous
the controls are probably my biggest
complaint it's easy to accidentally grab
the wrong item or do the wrong action
but for the most part you can jump into
bashing zombies without too much trouble
the giant open world of Los perdidos
might not be able to match rise for
sheer looks but it makes that board in
scale you can blast through massive
amounts of zombies with a car and seems
like this oh really what drive home what
these new consoles are capable of better
yet it does this with no load screens
once you get into the game which is a
surprisingly nice little thing that is
until you die anyway for sheer fun
though it's hard to beat Dead Rising 3
I've got to say I'm impressed with the
Xbox one launch lineup but what do you
guys think definitely let me know in the
comments below be sure to subscribe to
the channel as well so you're always
kept up to date with the latest and
greatest anyway guys I will catch you
