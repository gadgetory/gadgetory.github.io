going to be going over the new unto the
jailbreak for iOS 5 recently chronic dev
team member pod2g posted a video of an
ipod touch 3rd generation on iOS 5.0
with an untethered jailbreak if you guys
keep up with the show you'll know a few
weeks back pod2g tweeted that he had
found an untethered exploit and does
look like he finally does have it up and
running now while this demo was an ipod
touch 3rd generation on iOS 5.0 this
should work on both five-point appoint
one as well as newer devices most likely
even the iPhone 4s and iPad 2 this is
going to be what's known as a user lion
jailbreak what that means just put very
simply is that Apple will be able to
patch this in the future firmware update
so it is very very important to not
update your devices especially once it
comes out and will most likely provide a
patch which will totally kill any chance
that you have of getting an untethered
jailbreak there's no ETA when to expect
this but definitely stay tuned as I will
be posting a full tutorial as soon as it
was released in other news muscle nerve
from the iphone dev team tweeted that
there's going to be an upcoming redsnow
update to work with tinyumbrella to
allow you to downgrade your firmware of
course in iOS 5 Apple did patch the
flawed that allows you to downgrade your
firmware using what was known as SHSH
blobs the next version of red snow will
be available soon however you can go
ahead and get your iOS 5.0 point 1 SHSH
blobs saved right now all we need to do
is go to the link in the description and
download tinyumbrella this is available
for both PC and Mac now I need to do is
plug your iPhone iPod Touch or iPad into
your computer open up tiny umbrella and
allow it to save your SHSH blobs and if
there are any new updates to any of the
things I talked about today I'll have an
annotation on the top left of the screen
that will keep you up-to-date the tweak
of the week is lockscreen multitasking
this is a very simple free tweet that
allows you to get your multitasking bar
straight from your lockscreen just
double tap your home button and you can
immediately jump to any app you like
instead of unlocking and then finding it
lockscreen multitasking is free and
cydia hey guys it's going to be about it
for this week's episode of state of
jailbreak if you enjoy definitely sure
