today I'm here with a bit of a tutorial
I suppose on how to get your winterboard
working if you have jailbroken with
blackrain excuse my voice I'm a little
bit sick right now but basically a lot
of people are having problems with
blackrain or more specifically having
problems getting things open course this
is going to assume that you already have
blackrain installed but I'm go ahead and
show you as a few different tips on
things that you can do to try to get
your winterboard working because
obviously know things are huge deal
let's go ahead and get this one started
okay the first thing and definitely the
most important thing is that when we go
ahead and back up to when you first
jailbreak okay and this is opening up
the blackrain installer okay you cannot
and I'm really one stresses okay even
though you see city of rock and I see
you cannot put city and I see together
it city is totally just messed up and
there's all kinds of problems basically
the only fix is to restore your device
which is not fun at all so first thing
absolutely as far as I know there's no
problems with rock go ahead and install
city and rock but no cydia and I see it
just is a bad combo and it messes
everything up so like I said if you if
you have accidentally done city and I
see together the only fix to fix Cydia
is to just go ahead and read restore
your device Andrey jailbreak which
obviously is no fun okay so that's just
the first thing so but if you go ahead
and your city is running and everything
in your stuff problems well then you go
ahead and continue to the next step okay
so the next step is making sure that
your winterboard installation went right
occasionally from time to time stuff can
you know you install and it didn't quite
work something went wrong along the way
okay so all you need to do is just go
ahead and hit search going up to the top
punch in winterboard okay so go ahead
and hit it now if you're still having
problems you've installed it you think
you've done everything right the best
thing to do is just to hit reinstall
okay you know I mean it's not always
sometimes there's different problems but
you'd be surprised at a lot of times
that could be the big problem another
thing is when you're in cydia if you see
change on the bottom changes what you
need to do is you make sure that you
need to make sure that all of the
important cydia packages and everything
Ernst are properly installed and updated
there was a little bit of a glitch i had
when i first installed cydia but it
wasn't wanting to install
all the important essential upgrades and
obviously winterboard relies on a lot of
those so definitely choir in city and
make sure that there's no changes go
ahead and just you can just hit it and
just go in there and if it says you know
update or whatever go ahead and do that
and then after that you might want to go
ahead and reinstall winterboard that's
still in helping let's go ahead and go
to the next okay this one guys this
one's dead simple but you know it might
it might be a good idea to think about
it is you might want to just go ahead
and restart your device so I mean it's
totally simple and just hold the hook
just hold the power button for a minute
45 seconds or whatever and just slide to
power off just just do it and then just
slide it right back on let's shut off
then go ahead and turn it back on and do
it you know that that's also a thing and
like I said once you do that go ahead
back into cydia and install winterboard
again if it's not still not working now
between all of these things you should
be able to get winterboard working
because it does work all right go ahead
and show you guys my winterboard and
this is I've just restored this just
like an hour ago whatever it does work
supreme preferences everything is
working and I've tested themes it I had
no problem now if you still are having
problems just about the only thing left
to do is just to restore your device
which you know just plug it into itunes
hit restore and then go ahead and hit go
ahead and hit the black rain and riri
jailbreak it I know it's pretty big
hassle and it's up to you you know you
might want to wait out or whatever but
if you really want themes like most of
you do that's probably going to be your
best bet so anyway I'm just go ahead and
gave show you guys a demo of a theme
running on 3.1 point2 just so you know
that it does work okay guys so this is
the this is a theme and obviously you
can see it runs just fine you know it's
3.1 point2 and black rain I don't know
what exact the problem what exactly the
problem is with the winter
we're not working but you know just
taking a few simple steps you know just
common sense stuff most of you guys
probably would have already tried it but
just do try some simple things and it
really should go ahead and fix it I mean
winter boards really is really robust
and you know there's nothing special in
three-point 1.2 or anything blackrain
you know that really should mess with it
basically all you got to do is you got
to make sure that cydia is fully
installed correctly and then just go
ahead and try you know if it's still not
working for you reboot your reboot your
device try reinstalling it simple things
like that anyway guys that's it that's
just quick simple thing just trying to
help you guys out get winterboard setup
so jailbreak is all done and no worry
about anymore anyway thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
