few hours ago everybody a few hours you
know figure everything out go through
the new itunes take a look at the 3.1
upgrade ordered your nano all that kind
of stuff but one of the big
disappointments was definitely the ipod
touch basically there was no camera and
i know that was a huge deal but you know
if you look at it Warren depth it's
worse um okay so let me just first break
down what that holds an ounce at the
keynote today ok so the a kike bite
model is 499 32 gigabyte 299 + 64
gigabyte 399 ok sounds pretty simple
right if you just listen to that you
know great now ok it's really misleading
the a gigabyte model is the exact same
second generation exact same as this one
right here ok now if you look at it I
guess what they're doing is they're
carrying over a gig by they'll continue
to make it but basically the way it
works is straight up in a nutshell if
you want one of the new ipods which are
there's a few things it does obviously
have the 3gs in terminals which is
definitely something you would want you
know with the ill play games fast or
load everything faster on all that kind
stuff and not to mention the 32 and 64
gigabytes but the problem is if you want
one of the new ipods not the new ipod
touches you guys start by spending three
hundred dollars if you get the a
gigabyte you're just giving the same old
model there's nothing necessarily
nothing wrong with the current ipod
touch but the fact that i mean look at
this I mean you know it's great but hey
you know I don't want to buy another one
I mean it's there's no improvements so
basically I don't understand this they
on the site they kind of have updated
and stuff like that but there's nothing
updated I mean I there's nothing updated
so let me just kind of show you guys run
through because there's a lot of
different models going on they probably
start phase them out but so let me just
scroll through it ok so if you want a
new ipod with
new internals on the new ipods also come
with voice control which is debuted in
the iphone 3gs so you know you can
control say play green day or what about
that and they also come with the new
headphones like the iphone where it has
the remote in the mic which is a nice
feature but if you want an older model
you're going to have to spend you know
for the eight two hundred dollars the
deal is though is that assuming that you
don't want a new one which you know a
lot of people don't want spend three or
four hundred dollars to get something
that's i mean not that much improved so
then you've got the choice of getting an
older one and the way Apple works it's
kind of confusing so let me just kind of
go through it and basically can I just
tell you guys why you should not get a
kickabout model okay so along with the a
gigabyte there are three other models
called refurbished you know you guys
better refurbished models basically the
deal with the refurbished models they've
actually taken a dive and no I say
refurbished their the second-generation
model and these are the exact same this
is this is this is the exact same
generation as the APK bite which you
would spend one night 99 so let you
scroll through the prices here for
refurbished 8 gigabyte model it's 149
dollars that's a deal I mean that's the
same maybe that's the exact same ipod
basically you would have spent yesterday
two hundred thirty dollars for now let
me just real quickly go through and to
kind of tell you what i mean by
refurbished now these are not like
refurbished like a used ipod or whatever
these come in you know the brand new box
that come with all new accessories a lot
of these have just been record turns use
make the couple times i mean they're
they're basically the way to go i mean
there's no reason to spend 50 more
dollars to the exact same thing I mean
yeah you know you want something new but
seriously when you opened up on the i
bought refurbished it's it's a good deal
and the fact that you can you know
obviously get the ipod touch no let me
just go through basically you say fifty
dollars as opposed to getting a new and
a used one and like i said there's no
difference the exact same thing which
makes no sense to me
but you know whatever now where it moves
up is the 16 gigabyte is now 2 not 1 99
so basically if you want to say spend
two hundred dollars on iPod touch you
don't want to spend next 100 to get a
new one you want to get an old one
basically you have the choice between
and brand-new 8 gigabyte or a
refurbished 16 gigabyte you know guys
refurbished I mean you know you want new
but refurbished is definitely a good way
to go so I mean you know you can double
the thing and I will say the 32 is now
249 that's not so much of a good deal
just because for 15 more dollars you
know you do get quite a bit for 5400 you
know I just don't understand it I mean
not only did they not put cameras and
everything in there jacking up the price
so if you want a new ipod touch you have
spent 300 otters yeah you can still get
two hundred dollars for an 8 gigabyte
but that's last year's model like I said
I mean this is an egg gigabyte right
here now I love it but it's an old one I
don't want an open i'm going to spin go
buy one right now i want a new one so
the fact that apple just kind of not
only didn't add cameras but check the
prices way up then happened there's no
16 gigabyte or nothing you basically if
you want to buy 200 199 model for a fake
egg whites you're basically just buying
last year's model and the thing is they
don't they aren't very clear about that
I mean during the keynote it was kind of
not really noticed and a lot of people
don't know that so now I've been I've
researched up trying to figure out what
they're doing so hopefully guys this
video helps you out um basically the net
so my advice is stay away from 199 a
kike by model especially if you have an
ipod touch 2nd direction there's nothing
new it's the exact same thing so you
know just if you want if you don't have
an ipod touch recommend maybe going with
the 8 gigabyte refurbished because for
1.9 that's i mean that's pretty good I
mean yeah you could get for the same
price neg kick by nano but I mean ipod
touch no doesn't have a care if it's got
a lot more um but yeah guys I just
rambling here but definitely want to let
you guys know that and definitely really
be cautious and you know do your
research on this before you buy anything
so yeah thanks for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
