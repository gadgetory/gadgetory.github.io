the most popular piece of technology in
the world there's a lot of hype around
the new iPhone 7 is it worth it
hey guys is Austin and it's safe to say
there is a lot of hype riding on these
two phones
don't let the 7 name fool you these are
almost identical-looking to the 6 and 6s
at first glance you're still getting the
same sized 4.7 and 5.5 inch displays on
the 7 and 7 Plus which is an interesting
choice the easiest way to spot the
differences around back where the 7 has
a noticeably larger camera hump and the
plus has an even bigger one the largest
change though is what isn't on the phone
and something else that's I think super
divisive is the lack of the headphone
jack no way so oh yeah I don't know if
you noticed but there's actually no way
you're right yeah
Apple has a long history of killing
Poor's before people are ready however
they may have taken a step too far with
the headphone jack to make up for this
they include a set of lightning ear pods
along with an adapter to plug normal 3.5
millimeter headphone in the ear pods are
well their ear pods they're totally fine
but they aren't replacing your high-end
cans any time soon
to be fair the headphone adapter works
exactly as you'd expect plug it into the
phone and your headphones will sound
exactly like on previous iPhones however
its small and easy to lose you'll
probably end up needing another but at
least they're only $9 headphone makers
haven't been shy about making their own
lightning headphones though and some of
them are actually pretty good you're
definitely paying a premium but at least
you're getting quality your other
options are bluetooth headphones in
addition to the sod selection that have
been around for years like the Jaber
freedom Apple are about to have their
own option available air pods
there's a lot of good things with the
air pods and the you know the newbies oh
yes you tried the air pods right what do
you think about the air pods I think
they're crazy expensive they're way too
much money these are fully independent
ear pods that rely on Apple's new w1
ship to make syncing as seamless as
possible that same chip has made its way
into the new beats solo 3 headphones and
it really is dead simple to connect with
the ability to move between devices that
are connected via iCloud the solo 3
sound like beats for good and bad but at
least the tech inside works actually use
the iPhone 7 though and you'll find a
few problems with this wonderful new
future if you want to listen to music
over aux-in charge at the same time
you'll need the Apple lightning dock
which looks cool but runs a hefty 50
dollars it's not all bad news on the
audio side though
in addition to the bottom firing speaker
from the last iPhone you now get an
interesting stereo setup with the
earpiece also working as a speaker but
we've seen these other phones with
bezels the same size and these huge
speakers that sound phenomenal so yeah
good improvement would like that to
continue one change that feels
incredibly weird at first is the new
home button unlike before this actually
isn't even a real button at all turn the
phone off and you realize is just a
piece of glass that doesn't move with
the phone on though it uses a tactic
engine that vibrates to give the
illusion of an actual button press I
feel like it's like it's 90% there but
for a button I excited to work 100% of
the time right right right
and if you have anything on your finger
yeah there's no ways gonna work there is
one upside to the lack of a headphone
jack the iPhone 7 is now water-resistant
it's not fully waterproof ready to be
under a meter of water for 30 minutes
you should probably leave the iPhone
behind on your next scuba diving
excursion but for a quick dip in the
pool it should be fine or at least
that's what I would have said if I
getting that last shot didn't kind of
kill the phone so didn't realize until
this morning however the home button now
is being really inconsistent sometimes
it works but the taptic engine is way
off so I'm getting all kinds of weird
sort of feedback over the bigger issue
is with the camera so if you look around
back you'll see that especially the main
camera lens is seriously fogged up
there's definitely some water that's
gotten inside the foam that's that quite
as bad when you look at the telephoto
lens or if you try to take a picture
it's pretty blurry so you know the
second camera clears things up a little
bit however even with the front-facing
camera you can see that there's
definitely ooh there's definitely a lot
of condensation in there which is
disappointing
this phone is rated to be under a meter
of water for 30 minutes however after
being under about two inches of water
for 30 seconds it was enough to do some
serious damage to be fair this is
probably an isolated incident with my
phone as I've seen a lot of other water
tests where people have had the iPhone 7
underwater for hours and spent totally
fine or next time you decide to get your
iPhone 7 wet you may want to think twice
something else they can be a pain to
deal with is the new jet like finish it
first lanes it looks pretty killer with
a serious polish but it absolutely
attracts fingerprints and tiny scratches
even Apple admits that you should
probably use a case with it which isn't
exactly encouraging for the long-term
durability personally I prefer the matte
black finish on the 7 it still looks
nice but it handles minor wear and tear
a lot nicer both of the new iPhones are
also rocking some serious power
inside you'll find the new a 10 fusion
chip which uses a pair of high-powered
CPU cores along with two that are more
focused on battery efficiency I have no
complaints in terms of performance I saw
just be tested obviously
you can see how quickly it moves is it
actually best moving between apps you
know it's like the no-brainer the plus
does have a slight advantage when it
comes to memory with three gigs of RAM
compared to two on the normal seven but
it's hard to note as much difference in
real use thankfully Apple has also
bumped up the storage options
the base model now starts with 32 gigs
with options to go up to 128 and 256
gigabytes the bigger difference is in
battery life the seven plus still easily
last me through a full day and then some
but the seven has seen a big improvement
to nearly magic while it's not exclusive
to the new iPhone iOS 10 is a big
improvement with a pretty solid facelift
iOS is looking better than it has in
years the super flat design of iOS 7 has
been toned down a bit and the entire
interface feels like it's been coated in
an extra layer but I have noticed a few
crashes here and there but there's no
denying that these are some of the
fastest phones out there another area
where things have improved is in the
camera Department the iPhone 7 now has a
new brighter F 1.8 aperture lens which
brings in about 50% more light compared
to the success
it's a noticeable upgrade there's a
slightly shallower depth of field and
low-light and seen a big jump which is
helped by the addition of optical image
stabilization on the regular 7 in
addition to the 7 plus autofocus is also
incredibly quick it's right on par with
the galaxy s7 as the fastest focusing
phone out there right now pictures are
nice and sharp with very pleasant color
Apple has always hit a nice middle
ground between punchy and over-the-top
and this is no exception
when the note 7 and well s7 edge camera
first came out I was comfortable saying
that that was the best actually on any
smart phone now that the seven cameras
come out it's a close one into AI so
that's really impressive for both of
them the iPhone 7 is rocking a new 7
megapixel front-facing camera and it's
really not bad the improvements in color
have also come across to the selfie
camera and while it's still not as wide
as the terrific front-facing cameras on
the s7 and note 7 it's a nice
improvement where you'll notice a bigger
difference is with the new telephoto
camera that's been added to the 7 plus
it's a 2 time zoom compared to the main
camera which can give you some very
different perspectives when shooting
without relying on digital zoom Apple
has done a good job of making switching
between the two cameras seamless however
the telephoto camera
just can't match the quality of the main
shooter it has a smaller aperture and
it's a physically smaller sensor which
hurts especially in low-light on the
other hand video on both the seven and
seven plus or absolutely top-notch the
stabilization is the best in the
business right now even when shooting in
4k and the slow motion options deliver
some really cool results on one hand the
iPhone 7 is a solid improvement you're
getting blistering performance water
resistance improved cameras and better
battery life on the other though you
have a nearly identical design in the
total lack of a headphone jack borders
on a deal-breaker for some as always
they're expensive and not for everyone
but if you're looking for some of the
best phones out right now the iPhone 7
and 7 plus are worth it so what do you
guys think about the iPhone 7 let me
know in the comments below and
definitely be sure to subscribe to the
channel to catch more is it worth it
episodes like this anyway guys thank you
so much for watching and I will catch
you in the next one
iPhone 12 is 12 times more revolutionary
than the iPhone 9 we'll see that so I
thought but then that would make me it
wait what 9 yeah the actual number of
sub pixels is not a crazy difference
between that and 1080p what was that I
think there's a cat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
