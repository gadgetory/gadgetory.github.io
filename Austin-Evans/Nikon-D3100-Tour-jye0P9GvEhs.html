the Nikon d3100 yet so I know guys I've
had this for a while about a month or so
now and I'm still going to be reviewing
it however I've been having a lot of
computer issues likely we're editing
long videos at all it's just just a
nightmare so what I'm gonna do is just
give you guys a simple tour of it for
now until I go ahead and finally give
you guys a review so I've had this thing
like I said for about a month I've gotta
say there's a lot I like about it couple
things on that quite so happy with but
overall I'm very happy with this DSLR
I'm glad you can start with giving you
guys a little tour here one thing I
really like is the size the portability
the ergonomics all of that I'm really
really liking so with the standard 18 to
55 kit lens that comes with it of course
you can get I believe there were a
couple of other kits that have different
lenses and obviously you can buy a body
online get whatever lens you like
however together it only weighs about a
pound and it is really pretty quite
lightweight for a DSLR now you know
that's that's not saying much if you're
coming from a point-and-shoot or a
camcorder or something like that but as
far as you know I mean it's still not
all that big and bulky and I like the
weight a lot same goes for ergonomics
I'll just pull in here if you guys can
see there it's got a nice little rubber
piece here with a little well your your
thumb fits really nicely in there go
ahead and slide through your different
modes you pull that this is the live
view switch actually anybody else
cameras on but there's a lot of you
switch you're not going to hit that buy
extent and then hit this we are
recording so pretty cool and definitely
you're not gonna accidentally hit pretty
much anything you that you don't want um
here's your d-pad you know it's a pretty
standard d-pad nothing special but it
works just fine and you also do have the
trash button a light that lights up when
the car that you're reading to the SD
card and a small speaker I'm not
flipping it around to the front here and
you will find the cameras focus you'll
find a little light which helps it with
auto focusing and you'll find a nice
deep grip you know it for my hand it
fits perfect like seriously you know you
just put your top finger there I mean
this thing feels like you know it's not
going anywhere I definitely do like that
for such a small DSLR the Argonaut looks
they really did do it right I'm not
going to just run up to the
pop here I'll try to go through this as
quickly as I can we do have a wide
variety of different options you can go
ahead and turn it on and off
one thing cool thing is doesn't take any
time at all to turn on and off very cool
you can go ahead obviously that's your
shutter you have the info button which
pulls up various things on the display
or just turns it off and you can go
ahead and set the aperture here by
actually just turn on the manual here
and show you guys just by doing this I'm
go ahead and adjust it however we like I
know with this lens it's three point
five to five point six uh you know I'll
get into the kit lens in a minute but
you of course you can just adjust it
depending on whatever lens you have if
you have single shot which is pretty
much what you usually do you have burst
which lets just want show you guys first
here so I want to go ahead and take a
picture let's turn off the flash
everyone so let's go ahead show you guys
burst mode and while I'm failing on
sports there we go
and turn off auto focus there we go so
you guys can hear it's pretty decent as
it's respectable I'd say it's about
three maybe four frames per second and
full auto so for sports it's not going
to be too bad and of course you do have
auto focus as well as you have that
sports mode which is pretty much why
this is made for then you have time
shedder and you have quite shutter time
self timer you know fairly standard you
click it ten seconds later takes picture
and quite shutter basically just the
light doesn't illuminate it doesn't make
little beeping sound when it's auto
focused and the shutter slightly quieter
but not a big deal now nothing to go
through all the these mode switches it's
got a guide mode to be honest I've never
really gotten into this it's super super
basic I don't think it's going to be
useful on me for pretty much anybody
unless you're just a total total total
camera noob which I hope I hope I hope
you're not ah you're buying if you're if
you're buying I came up this you really
don't need to use the guide mode in my
opinion you know the auto mode pretty
much does everything the guide mode does
better um you know the auto mode it's
really simple when you turn on the auto
focus you just point at it and you hear
the beep
take a picture you're good to go anyway
you do have quite a few others auto
without flash all kinds of scenes
lectures of course what I usually do is
just try
manual and do everything myself so you
know it's pretty sis pretty simple you
can do it however you like they're up
top here you do have a little thing for
the hot shoe pull the little piece off
go ahead and mount a hot shoe
now you can't mount a microphone that's
a fairly big downside to this camera you
can't mount a microphone of course you
could mount it but you couldn't plug it
in because there is no just show you
guys here
there is no microphone input I mean you
have four normal standard TV's HDMI mini
USB and a proprietary GPS mount however
if you want to go ahead and hook it up
if you're doing mainly video like I do
there's no way to go ahead and hook this
up to a you know an external microphone
which is definitely a pretty big
downside however you know if you want it
to be if you want to do pretty much
anything else it'll still work just fine
I'm actually a squid and just pop the
flash here and the flash is pretty good
it's actually surprisingly good I was
not expecting the flash performance to
be as good as it is with this camera you
know it's really quite respectable it
it's it's a powerful flash and the
camera's smart enough to you know to
accurately do it it's not going to blow
your stuff out or whatever I'm
definitely very good flash here so kind
of skipping around here and of course
you get the lens I won't really talk too
much about the lens its standard 18 to
55
that's a autofocus vibration reduction
you know it's it's an okay lens it's
definitely not too bad considering it
comes pretty much for free with the
camera but you'll probably want to
invest in something better I know I'm
definitely looking at buy myself a prime
lens because this is the this is my
first Nikon DSLR so uh lens is not too
bad just not anything special you do
have the button right here which I'll
kind of toggle on and off the flash the
cool thing is the camera can pop the
flash by itself so you don't have to
actually manually turn it on you have a
function button which is cool so you
know when you're shooting you want to go
ahead like for example I have to set to
ISO so if I want to change my ISO around
just go ahead and hold that button very
cool you do have the microphone right
here um get a nice close up here
microphone not entirely great it's only
single channel so you're not gonna get
stereo my sound but you know I don't
have too many complaints about it it's
it's it's it's it's passable and that's
pretty much what I've been using
much we're going to have to use with
this camera unless you want to you know
have a separate microphone and you know
edit all the video and audio together so
let's go just take a quick look around
the back of our showing you guys this
side you have a variety of buttons on
this side you've got your info button
you have plus - which allows you to zoom
in on pictures and navigate around a
little bit go and open up the menu
there's a better than I spin you I've
gotta admit this is got a really nice
menu go ahead and just change all kinds
of stuff picture control you want you
can raw or JPEG picture size white
balance active d-lighting
I mean guys I don't get into a lot of
this in the main review I don't want to
spin the whole you know another 10
minutes talking about all these
different things but it's pretty cool
now one thing I do want to talk about
though is the movie settings now like I
said guys I obviously do a lot of videos
this is what I bought this camera for is
to make videos and on that front it's
pretty good it does shoot 1080p at 24
frames per second I found this to be
really quite good you know 720p actually
the 720p video must have found aren't
actually that good compared to 1080p I
think a lot of is just in the file ups
turn off the screen here but anyway yeah
the 1080p video isn't is definitely a
lot better looking than any other
quality settings I've found so that's
pretty much what all I shoot in is 1080p
um so that's just about it I think yeah
I guess that is just about it as far as
the only other thing I want to just talk
about is the video in the audio coming
the video in the picture quality picture
quality is really quite good with this
you know for the price point that you
pay you're definitely still going to get
something way way better than any point
shooter or anything like that and the
video quality also is really quite good
but again I will get into the specifics
and everything in the review later
assume I guys definitely do like this
camera quite a bit if you're interested
if you're on the fence I definitely say
go for it there's not a whole lot of
downsides the battery life is good the
ergonomics are excellent you know the
camera is really nice and speedy and you
know the video quality is really quite
good as long as the pictures so there's
not a whole lot of major downsides
probably the biggest thing is just that
the auto modes aren't quite that great
but of course that's what manual modes
for to you know get that fine grained
control so anyway guys thanks for
