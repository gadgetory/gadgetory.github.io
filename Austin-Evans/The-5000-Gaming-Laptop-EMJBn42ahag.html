you want the ultimate protection when
you're browsing online head over to Nord
VPN comm slash Austin and use the promo
code Austin to get yourself seventy
seven percent off hey guys is Austin
last year I took a look at the most
ridiculous over-the-top gaming laptop
that I had ever seen
however fast-forward 2018 and we have
this the new most ridiculous powerful
over-the-top gaming laptop that I have
ever seen this is the assuit
rog g7o 3 and let's just get the
elephant out of the room immediately
this laptop as expect right now costs
$5,000 now if that doesn't immediately
put you off from spending as much as
some used cars there's actually a ton to
like with this laptop now I'll freely
admit I spend a lot of time on the
channel reviewing some very budget
laptops well that's fine this is so
ridiculously overkill in every possible
way that I kind of don't want to give it
back so when you're spending this kind
of money you should expect to get all
the bells and whistles out there and
this pretty much does deliver so to
start out with it has the awesome new
Intel Core I 9 processor now that on a
laptop is going to get you six cores and
the scissor is actually overclocked it
even farther so this guy will run up to
four point eight gigahertz right out of
the box
now that's not some kind of baby
overclock we're just kind of hits it
every once in a while it will hit 4.8
all the time it's so so ridiculous for a
laptop the crazy overkill doesn't stop
there either so inside this guy is also
rocking a full desktop class GT X 1080
graphics card with a full eight
gigabytes of gddr5 X memory yeah this is
uh no joke and because of course that's
not going to be enough things get even
crazier from there as far as memory goes
this guy has a full 64 gigs of RAM and
on top of that it has SSDs three of them
in addition to the two terabytes of puny
mere mortal sshd storage in this guy
you're also going to be getting those
three PCIe SSD s together in raid so in
total that gives you one point two
terabytes of full SSD storage and raid
which combined can run it up to eight
point seven gigabytes a second for
context a normal SSD is going to give
you around 600 mega
a second so yeah this is fast and yeah
it's probably so fast if she really
won't be able to tell the difference but
it's cool all of this adds up to what is
very possibly the smoothest nicest
windows experience that I've ever had
so of course stuff like booting up is
pretty much instant well not instant but
I mean it takes a few seconds but things
like opening up a program or just minor
little things that you can't get used to
taking a half second or a full second on
normal Windows PCs even hiring ones with
SSDs are done almost instantly with this
thing it's kind of hard to get across
some video but using this thing for a
couple days it's kind of hard to go back
to a normal PC it is just that fast of
course all this is in hardware that is
not exactly thin nor light this is
easily one of the biggest gaming laptops
you can get however is really nicely
built which it should be to be fair
because it does cost five thousand
dollars because this laptop is so
obscenely powerful a soos took a page
out of my playbook and they include dual
power supplies in the box and my friends
you're definitely going to need dual
power supplies because between the core
I 9 which is overclocked as well as the
GTX 280 which is also overclocked this
guy absolutely destroys battery I mean
for context this has been literally
sitting here in idling for 15 minutes
and right now we've burned about 13% of
the battery doing nothing besides
sitting on the Windows Start screen and
if you're the kind of person who's put
off by trying to carry a giant 17 inch
laptop which probably weighs like 10
pounds as well as dual power supplies
every day and this is probably not the
five thousand dollar laptop for you
however for the rest of us who are
ridiculously insane and want one of
these myself included there's actually a
lot of other cool stuff that's included
with the laptop of course you've got all
the ports you could ever hope for
including Thunderbolt 3 HDMI main
display port Ethernet USB you name it
this is got it this also applies to the
basic stuff like the keyboard
it's got good travel nice spacing and of
course it does have the full RGB
treatment but what's also impressive is
the trackpad not only is it giant but
this is a little generally the best
trackpad that I've ever used on Windows
it has the windows precision touchpad
drivers but importantly it has that
awesome sounding left and right click
it's really mechanical and this
legitimately feels like an expensive
laptop which of course it is as I will
remind you for the fourth time in this
video
typically below $1,000 from mere mortals
who don't have $5,000 to spend these
speakers are pretty solid here as well
though generally speaking it does get a
little loud so you'll probably want to
hook up a headset but now that do you
have two speakers that are sort of on
the bottom chassis but you also have two
front firing speakers directly at you
that being said when you're gaming it
gets loud so you know buy a headset
remove this little rubber flap as well
as a single screw underneath and you'll
have access to most of the expandability
with the laptop so you're going to find
your one two three SSDs as if that
wasn't enough you're also going to have
your two and a half inch as this HD bay
and on top of that you're going to have
access to 32 of your 64 gigs of ram now
of course with a computer that's going
to be this powerful you also have to
have a screen and match so while it's
only a 1080p display you are getting a
full 17 point three inches and it
supports not only g-sync but also a
hundred and forty-four Hertz refresh
rate and with the GTX today the power it
has no problem taking advantage of that
full frame rate so here on fortnight at
full epic settings we're getting
somewhere in the neighborhood of 130 to
140 frames per second just right in the
sweet spot of what this display can
handle but if for some reason you have
some super demanding game because you
have G sync it will kick in to sort of
smooth things out if you do go down to
say some mere mortal frame rate like 60
or 70 man poop G stands absolutely no
chance against a laptop like this
so we're easily in the hundred frame per
second range and we're running around
here on those full epic settings and of
course a big part of that is because we
do have the GTX 1080 inside but it's
also being backed up by that core I 9
considering that will easily hit 4.8
gigahertz that does sort of bring up the
general settings of pretty much any game
you throw at it but keep in mind they
actually we have different modes so
right now we're running on silent mode
and it's actually reasonably quiet
however if we want the maximum
performance and if a mere 109 frames per
second is good enough I can just switch
it over to either balance or over boost
and as you'll hear it's a lot louder but
we're also going to start to see the
frame rates go even higher generally
speaking I actually like to use it on
quiet mode yeah you're giving up some
performance but in exchange it's going
to be a lot quieter however if you have
a good pair of headphones
this actually is not a bad way of
getting a little bit of extra
performance although better have some
pretty solid headphones even though it's
a slightly older game GTA 5 can still be
taxing you crank everything up and here
running on full Ultra settings we're
getting summer in the neighborhood of
around 60 frames per second now that
actually still doesn't look too bad
especially because we do have the G sync
panel but it's crazy at this game which
start on xbox 360 looks this nice a few
years later provided you have a lot of
hardware to throw at it another game
that can be quite demanding is Middle
Earth shadow of war now here running on
full Ultra settings in 1080i can we're
actually staying somewhere in the 90 to
100 frames per second range that g-sync
panel looks super smooth and keep in
mind this is still running on the quiet
mode there's definitely a little more
performance there and some better
thermals if you don't mind letting the
fans crank to hyperspeed this thing is
absolutely ridiculous
between the massive size the dual power
supply is the terrible battery life in
the eye-watering lehigh price tag it's
just not a good idea for anyone to pick
up and yet I kind of love it this went
all out to make something awesome and
I've got to give them props for that
well at least until they make me send
the laptop back you know who won't make
me send a laptop back North VPN the
proud sponsor of today's video so
whether you're browsing on public Wi-Fi
traveling abroad or you just don't want
your isp snooping on your data you

VPN is what I've been using for quite a
while so last year Ken and I went to
China for an event and what we were

internet like Twitter and YouTube and
how we did that was using Nord VPN as of
recording Nord VPN currently has over
4,000 different servers in 62 different
