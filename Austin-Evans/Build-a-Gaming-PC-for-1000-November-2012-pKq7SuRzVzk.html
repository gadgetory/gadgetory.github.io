a video going over a game PC for $1,000
now this is really focused to getting
you some excellent to AP performance in
newer games such as battlefield 3 black
ops 2 and Assassin's Creed 3 and pretty
much anything else you throw at it if
you guys are interested I also have a
couple other bills you might want to
take a look at so either 7 or $50 bill
which is obviously a bit cheaper you do
lose that on some performance and a few
of the goodies but overall you're gonna
get some really solid performance and if
you're looking to spend a little bit
more money I also have a fifteen hundred
dollar bill which as the name implies is
more expensive but more importantly it's
going to be a lot better especially if
you plan on doing multi monitor gaming
to kick our build off we're going to be
using an Intel Core i5 35 70 K processor
now as far as price to performance goes
nothing can even touch this even the
more expensive core i7s now the big
thing here is that it is a quad core
design clocked at 3.4 gigahertz which is
fine that's great however this can
easily be overclocked well excessive 4
gigahertz in our system as an Intel Ivy
Bridge CPU based on the new 22 nanometer
process during normal usage it's gonna
stay nice cool and quiet however when
you need to do something serious lifting
like gaming it's gonna be able to be an
absolute powerhouse for about $220 this
is gonna be a great start for our build
moving on we have the cooler master
hyper 212 Evo now its predecessor to the
212 plus with something that I highly
recommended and in fact I use one of my
own build however this is the newer
version with a slightly tweaked fin
design as well as a higher quality fan
which should give even better thermal
performance
now I'm really doing some major
overclocking and excessive 4 gigahertz
is really important to not use the
standard Intel heatsink and instead uses
something like this she's gonna give you
a little bit better performance as far
as just dissipating all that heat that
you're creating for about $30 this is
going to be well worth it for a graphics
card we're going to be using a gigabyte
gtx 660 as this quickly becoming one of
my favorite GPUs out there as it really
nails that price to performance curve
now it is slightly overclocked with the
base clock of 1033 megahertz and a boost
clock of up to 1098 megahertz and it's
paired with 2 gigabytes of gddr5 memory
now one of the cool things about this is
the wind force cooler
basically what gigabyte has done is put
a giant heatsink on there and two huge
fans now I don't think it takes a genius
to say that if you get a ton of airflow
on a graphics card it's gonna keep it
nice and cool and that's not where the
main reasons why I like this card is it
really is a great all-rounder for about
$210 after rebate this is going to be
perfect for a motherboard we're going to
be using a gigabyte gaz 77 X
you d3h so long name aside this is a
solid board thanks to that z77 chipset
you have full support to overclock your
processor as much as you'd like and it
also does have some other cool bells and
whistles so what you're going to find is
support for two-way SLI which is great
if you ever want to take another gtx 660
and upgrade your system and kind of
improve the performance there it also
does have support for more the standard
things including USB 3.0 SATA 3 and
support for up to 32 gigabytes of ram
for $150 this is going to be perfect for
memory we're going to be using a
gigabytes of samsung ddr3 ram now take a
look at it it doesn't look like anything
special at all there's no heat sink it's
actually lower profile than most RAM
however don't let looks fool you at all
this is probably some of the best stuff
that money can buy so for starters the
base clocks are not bad at 1600
megahertz however where this really
shines is an overclocking you can really
overclock this stuff way way way higher
than most other kind of typical ramped
even with all kinds of fancy flashy heat
sinks and the best part of all is that
this is really cheap and only thirty
eight dollars for an SSD we're going to
be using a 128 gigabyte samsung 830
series drive now I'm a huge fan of SSDs
I feel like they're probably one of the
best ways to increase performance in
your computer and with an awesome
thousand dollar bill like this we can't
pass one up so the reason I want the 830
Series Drive is really simple it's very
reliable and very fast sure it might not
be quite as fast as some of the fastest
and newest drives out on the market but
it has been around for a little while
and because of that it's got a really
great reliable day's track record for
about $100 this is a great great great
way to go okay maybe maybe only two
greats but it's good for a hard drive
we're going to be using a one terabyte
Western Digital caviar black now there's
a reason why this is the standard for
gaming computers for starters it's fast
sure maybe not quite as fast as your SSD
but it's gonna give you perfectly
respectable performance and with one
terabyte of storage to work with it can
have plenty room for all your games
music videos pictures all that kind of
stuff is gonna fit on there no problem
for about $100 for a power supply we're
going to be using a corsair CX 600 now a
lot of people are under the assumption
if you get a high-end gaming PC you have
to have a thousand watt power supply and
all kinds of craziness however that's
not the case at all with 600 watts of
capacity this is going to be more than
that for a build as is including all the
overclocking you want to do but on top
of that you're also going to have some
overheads so if you want to add
additional hard drives fans LEDs all
that kind of stuff
handle and no problem unfortunately this
isn't modular but besides that there's
not a whole lot to go wrong with only
$65 for a case we're going to be using a
corsair carbide 300 are now I'm a big
fan of this case for a few reasons for
starters I personally do like the look
of course you guys might have different
tastes and maybe you want something a
little bit flashier however it's very
clear it's very understated but it still
looks kind of industrial and kind of
cool-looking on top of that since it is
a corseted case you can expect solid
quality as well as great air flow as
well as plenty room for cable management
and all that kind of fun stuff for only
about $75 I highly recommend this one
for an optical drive we're going to be
using a sony DVD burner now like I say
in all my builds this is totally
optional so if you want you can skip
this no big deal however I do like to
include it is it's fairly inexpensive
and on that rare occasion when you want
to listen to a CD or install something
via DVD it can come in handy of course
though if you guys want to you can feel
free to skip it or if you want you can
upgrade to a blu-ray drive but if you
just want to stick with the DVD Drive
it's gonna run you about twenty three
dollars for operating system you have
the choice between Windows 7 and Windows
8
now I'm gonna totally leave this one up
to you guys whichever one you prefer
both will Bart just fine generally
windows 7 is the safer choice everything
already works on it it's very simple and
easy to use
however Windows 8 is newer it's
definitely quite a bit faster than
Windows 7 and you also do have the new
Metro UI which kind of a mixed bag some
things I like some things I'm not such a
huge fan of however whichever one you
guys want to go for feel free this is
gonna run you anywhere between 70 and
$100 so there you have it an awesome
$1000 gaming PC now of course keep in
mind the prices are constantly
fluctuating so I will have links to all
the parts listed in the description of
this video if you guys are looking for
more information feel free to check out
my seven or $50 bills as well as the
$1500 builds here if you guys enjoy
don't forget to hit that like button and
subscribe for more content anyway guys I
will catch you in the next one as this
is an overclocked card that means you're
going to have plenty of performers to
handle pretty much any game you throw at
it including battlefield 3 and go ahead
and mount it in the back of your case
it's gonna be no problem and on top of
that of course since it is a water
cooling you're going to get some really
really nice performance out of your CPU</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
