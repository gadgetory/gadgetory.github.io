here with gaming pc myths part 2 so a
couple weeks ago I did a video going
over a lot of the common misconceptions
that people have about PC gaming and
since some of you guys like that video
and suggested a ton more for me to go
over here are more gaming pc myths the
first one is that consoles have better
graphics than a gaming PC now this one
really isn't true both the PlayStation 3
and the Xbox 360 are both pretty old at
this point and while the ps4 and Xbox
infinity will definitely improve this
they still should be no match for a
proper gaming computer especially with
the 360 and ps3 a lot of the games are
actually running at 720p or low
resolutions whereas with a gaming
computer you can rent to 1920 by 1080
you run at 2560 by 1440 in fact you can
even game on multiple monitors if you
want that's the thing you gonna be able
to do with a console anytime soon
another is that to be a PC gamer you
have to use a mouse and keyboard and
while this is a good way of controlling
your games and it's what I use 95% of
the time if it's not for you you can
also use a controller so the best way to
do is if you have an Xbox 360 controller
if you have a wireless version you can
buy an adapter if you have a wired
controller all you do is plug it into
your computer and it'll be good to go
now not all games will support
controllers for example you're probably
going to be wanting to use one with
StarCraft
however most games will automatically
detect the controller and you'll be good
to go and even ones that don't are
pretty simple to set up another myth is
that you have to buy an expensive gamer
mouse and keyboard now all sometimes it
does make sense to get a little bit of a
nicer mouse and keyboard for the most
part this isn't necessary so take a
mouse for example a lot of times you'll
see some specialty mice which will have
a bunch of buttons on them or have some
super high settings but for the most
part this really isn't necessary now
sure in some games having 10 buttons on
your Mouse might be helpful but for most
people it's really not worth spending
all that extra money to get something
that's really marginally better than
anything else on the keyboard side of
things
typically the major upgrade you're going
to want to look for as a mechanical
board now this is something I use and it
does make a difference however just like
with the mouse while it is nice to have
it really is not a necessity it's not
going to make a huge difference in your
games if you're going to be using a
standard mouse and keyboard that cost 30
bucks or a really nice gamer set that
costs 200 each another one I see all the
time is that you have to have a thousand
watt power supply to run a gaming PC now
a lot of people way overestimate what
they actually need I would have no
problem building even a fairly high
rigged with a 500 watt supply now of
course there's no real maximum amount of
power that you can have in a system if
there's extra overhead it's not going to
hurt anything however if you're paying a
bunch of extra money for an 800 watt
power supply when you're running a core
i3 and it's 7850 it's definitely not
really needed another common myth is
that you have to have 16 gigabytes of
RAM right the thing is gaming PC's
actually don't really need all that much
RAM obviously if you're going to be
trying to play battlefield 3 on a half a
gigabyte of RAM you've gotta rent in
some issues however if you do have 4 8
gigabytes of RAM that's really all you
need for a gaming PC now sometimes it
can be helpful to have more RAM so for
example some programs like Adobe After
Effects and virtual machines can
definitely eat up 16 gigabytes of RAM
but if you're just doing a normal gaming
PC for 8 gigabytes of RAM is really all
you need and since you made it to the
end of the video I've got a special
giveaway just for you guys
