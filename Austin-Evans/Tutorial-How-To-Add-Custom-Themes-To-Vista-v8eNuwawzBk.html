going to be beginning a new series of
videos showing you exactly how to
customize Windows Vista to basically
however you want I've started
specifically for this a new profile and
basically I'm going to be showing you
guys had these themes how to change
settings a lot of things to really make
Vista pop really make it unique now I
will just say this will fast some of
these things I will show you will not
work on Windows 7 and Windows XP you
really what I'm showing you is for Vista
and Vista only some things may work but
really don't try to do something that's
made specifically for Vista on your XP
computer and don't complete crashes just
wanted to throw that out there anyway so
I'm going to be showing how to make that
had to make but how to add a custom
theme to Vista so let's get this one
started
okay so let's get started the first
thing I want you to do is go into the
description and I want you to go ahead
and hit the page that will link you to
how to download vista class
I just haven't have it right here so
I'll go ahead open it up this class is
basically what enables you to use the
custom themes now and I'm sure you've
seen in both Vista and XP that there is
a themes along with SATA if you go into
it you can see like your desktop and
your stream server and there's things
but you really can't do anything well
the reason is is that Microsoft
basically locks it down you they don't
they just say basically no you just can
only use ours you can download
occasionally a steam from Microsoft but
really it's it's pretty rare so
basically what this does is Vista class
it's a really simple program it
basically runs and basically allows you
to install whatever custom theme you
want and in a moment I will show you how
you do this so basically it's real
simple
now I real quick I just do want to say
this is not it is not it's it's almost
like jailbreaking I mean there's a very
slight bit of risk but it's okay just
like a jailbreak there's you have a
little bit of risk but it's simple
enough to back it up well you shouldn't
have any problems at all I mean so
basically I just wants to do is just go
ahead and just you definitely read
through and this does work for service
pac-12 and if you don't have service
pack which I don't know why you wouldn't
but it so it works for all this - don't
worry
basically just download it and you'll be
set okay so once you have taken your
computer you've restarted it and
everything is the programs run total
through you know you're all set
and you restart okay now what you need
to do is you need to find a theme find
what everything you want I will just say
real quickly if you're running Windows
base Vista basic like I am you will not
add you not be able to run Aero or at
least that's that's another I don't want
to get into that right now but basically
right now you will not be able to run
any Aero and if you don't know what area
it is the transparent windows where you
can see obviously you can see through
everything you will not be able to run
anything like that like I said I might
get into that in a later video but just
just a heads up so if you try to
download all those things either will
not work or it could be buggy because
it's not made so basically look for
something in the description that says
like Vista basic anyway okay so let's go
ahead and what you need to do is find
whatever once you found it download it
as a zip file and I'm you will unzip it
let me just show you where she does it
but go on your computer on your C Drive
it should be C Drive wherever your your
whatever your whole uh where Vista is
installed wiper drive you have it on and
let's go into the windows file see when
I get down here then go open up the
resources and you'll see themes this is
where you will do it so like let's say
I've got this next level where I unzip
it and I say put it into windows
resources themes or you can obviously
just drag in right here and make sure
you don't accidentally drag it into
another file in here although there
probably won't be because you haven't
done anything yet but so now once you've
done that like now some things are a
little odd they're not quite right but
basically is I'll show you on this
Windows 7 theme you see there's a bunch
of stuff you basically need to ignore
everything but the theme now sometimes
these will actually not work because
they didn't properly structure them
right like see here now you have to
ignore this and now this can kind of be
a little tricky because basically have
to keep going until you see a month just
go into a folder it basically has this
file the en - us the shell file
wallpaper doesn't have to be there and
it's going to have a Windows visual
style file and that is what will that's
what you will hit and basically what you
do is you just click on this now we'll
do it in just one second and that will
install the theme for you so I'm just
going to go ahead and show you guys
double click it and then now your
parents will set up now normally you'll
see that the different things but if you
scroll down to the bottom you see now I
have a Windows 7 and some pop-up Vista
so now you see the window 7 now some
themes will this will change them all
not and basically what you do is you
will hit apply
and do it I will pause the video right
now because it will like like crazy so
one sec okay guys so here we go now you
can see everything looks different like
down here now some things will need to
be tweaked like this one definitely does
but I'll just go ahead now you exit out
now if you see these your any windows
she had open will kind of go blank or
whatever that's fine that's normal don't
worry about that anyway so now you can
see it down here test logs much bigger
you see that you see that going here you
see all this different and I see like
this is little uh this is there's
there's always gonna be some problems
not always but a lot of the time but uh
basically you see you've got it there's
not a whole lot else you tweak it like
like let's say like I want these to be
smaller
I mean to be larger I mean it's very
simple just to make them large icons and
you can change everything but basically
you can see that I've got a full custom
theme roman writing anyway I'll have
more on how to customize later so yeah
thanks for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
