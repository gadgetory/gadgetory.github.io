since the original Nintendo 2ds came out
but today there's an upgrade big shout
out to Nintendo for hooking us up with
the 2d s XL a little bit early so to
Dias has always been a little bit of a
weird product one of the 3s came out the
big feature was the new 3d screen and of
course that's exactly what the 2d s
takes away so if we open up the box the
first thing we see is the power adapter
so this doesn't seem like something that
should be all that impressive but the
new 3dsxl doesn't even actually come
with one you're actually kind of like
the look of this so with the blue
accents and the kind of textured black
finish it ooh it looks really nice one
thing I will say though is it feels very
lightweight it doesn't feel like there's
a lot of sort of heft to it but to be
fair it's all plastic and it feels
pretty well put together I mean so the
first thing I notice is that there are
some weird quirks with the design so the
hinge itself actually kind of sticks out
a little bit and because of that the
front-facing camera is actually exposed
even when the 2d s is closed so when you
open it up it makes sense you can see it
pretty well there but when you close it
it's actually kind of exposed something
else is kind of weird is that there's no
obvious way to put the game's end
besides what I assume is the hyneman's
flop yeah so inside here we can put in a
3ds game a DS game we also have what
looks like a micro SD card which is
going to be a word gigabyte so right
here besides the headphone jack there's
oh the stylus what that is the smallest
stylus I've ever seen what what what
hold on so this is what the normal 2 DS
stylus looks like you know it's meant
for human hands whereas this is the 2d
SXL it is a lot smaller like I don't
even how is that even supposed to make
sense that is comparing the original 2d
s with the XL the first one you'll
notice is the XL is our lot bigger and a
big part of that is it now has a
clamshell design so you look at the
original 2d as something I think a lot
of people made fun of through the sort
of weird flat design now to be fair in
the hand it actually doesn't feel too
bad depending on
you know how big your hands are for me
it feels about right but what comes to
actually trying to put this in your
pocket good luck wear something like
this even though it is very large it
folds up nice and neat I will say I do
like the look of the to D s XL so as far
as I know right now in North America
there's only this black and blue color
but I think it looks pretty nice some
things that really keep coming back to
you though is that this is really light
it feels not cheap but why didn't you
expect the real comparison here though
is with the 3dsxl
and the first thing I noticed with these
two is they actually have slightly
different camera layouts so with the
3dsxl
if I open this guy up you'll see there
are two 3d cameras or gets one 3d camera
on the back
so essentially you can use this for some
mini games but they actually do take
stereoscopic 3d images now the 2d sxo
also has that but instead of being on
the screen they're actually on the back
yeah after I say weird right put them
side by side and the biggest difference
that you'll notice between the 2d sx l
on the 3dsxl is the lack of 3d screen
so with this guys you can turn on the 3d
switch and get adjusted to the sort of
strength that you like and there were
some cool things that they did do with
the 3dsxl including some eye tracking to
sort of customize the screen as before
for 3d s if you got a little bit off
access it could look really weird
however for me I just don't really enjoy
the 3d it's kind of nice a couple games
do it well but for the most part that
switch is off all the time which
essentially means it's the same for 2d
yet so this is the new Nintendo 2ds XL
and that new name means that it has the
upgrade specs from the 3ds so while the
original hardware came out in 2011 they
have since upgraded it and it runs a lot
smoother when you look at the XL side by
side with the original 2d as there are a
lot of very nice upgrades so some of
them are super obvious the screens are
much larger on the newer unit so there
are also some more subtle upgrades like
the original 2d has only had a fairly
small and weak speaker whereas the 2d of
XL has dual front firing speakers or
side ish firing speakers actually open
the camera so I guess that means camera
time the first thing I notice is having
the cameras on the back means that
they're really sort of twisted so if I
try to take a shot of savage Kenny here
that's a must
some potato quality again the angles are
super weird you actually kind of have to
so you might not want to take your next
selfie masterpiece on it but for a lot
of stuff like games that need it for AR
style it works of course as a game
console we have to play some games so to
start with we have Pokemon Sun the
Pokemon games I will be total amounts of
you are a huge reason why I played the
Game Boy the DS and 3ds that's really
what keeps me coming back to Nintendo
handhelds and Sun I think is well
another one that I spend a lot of money
on yeah I've bought a lot of Pokemon
games it looks good these screens on the
2d s are not great to be totally honest
with you but it's about the same as
every other 3ds so it's really not a
whole lot to complain about speaker also
sounds decent not great look decent next
we have Super Smash this is a game that
really impressed me is it's even
playable on the 3s considering this
hardware originally came out in 2011
decides that not only does it look nice
and playable we're getting a full 60
frames per second is awesome smash is
also one of the few games that do
support amiibos so with the 2d s what
we're doing is we're actually putting in
the middle of the screen but once we do
that it pretty much immediately loads up
the amiibo you can train it you can do
different things to be honest I don't
find that there's a ton of games that
really make amiibos all that useful but
it's definitely nice to have so one
thing I've noticed thing is the stylus
actually isn't quite as annoying as I
thought it would be yes it is very very
short but depending on how you hold it
it actually doesn't feel about that
then you do have the option of buying
digital games for the two GS XL as
opposed to buying the physical ones so
most of the titles are available in the
eShop but generally speaking I'm not a
big fan of the way that Nintendo handles
a lot of the account stuff and to be
honest I prefer having the actual
physical games what is cool though is
you do have the full Virtual Console on
here there aren't a ton of games but you
do have a fear a few options such as the
original Pokemon games you have some NES
titles some Super Nintendo games Game
Boy Color and there are still more
coming for example pokemon gold and
silver will be available on the 3ds a
little bit later in the year so Nintendo
is still making both the 2d s as well as
the new 3ds XL right now so which one
should you pick up
well if you want to be chief and you
want just a basic Pokemon machine it is
hard to argue with the 2d s at about $80
it is definitely not perfect it will be
nicer than headset our speakers and
design is a little bit more portable but
I think a lot of people will be
completely fine with this but 3dsxl is
definitely the superior console as far
as tech goes so they just have all the
updated specs but you have the
additional buttons and controls amiibo
support and it does have that nicer
looking 3d screen but for me I don't
ever use the 3d so that really is not a
big deal which makes the 2d SXL look a
lot more appealing for $150 the 2d s XL
is probably the end of the line for the
3ds
now that's necessarily a bad thing well
sure it's about half the price of the
switch but more importantly there are
still games that are coming up with this
so stuff like pokemon ultra sun moon
will be out a little bit later this year
as far as I'm concerned this is my
favorite 3ds design yet so what do you
guys think about the 2d s XL let me know
in the comments below and I will catch
you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
