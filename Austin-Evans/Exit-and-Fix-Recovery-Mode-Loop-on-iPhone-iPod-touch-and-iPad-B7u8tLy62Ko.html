recovery mode tool box now what this is
is a series of utilities that are really
helpful if you have a jailbroken iPhone
iPod Touch or iPad now this is not a
jailbreak holder what it is is like I
said a series of utilities so you can do
some different things just straight from
this instead of having to you know
hassle and find individual programs and
all that kind of stuff it just does it
all in one so the first thing I will
show you guys and the most important in
my opinion is the recovery function
Cinelli can you intro career mode which
you can also exit it i know if you guys
have been jailbreaking for any length of
the time you'll probably know that
something is gonna go wrong here you can
be stuck in recovery mode or something
however with this it's very simple so as
you guys can see here if my iPod Touch
4th generation plugged in it is in
recovery mode right now
so all these do is you click exit
recovery now there we go it says
disconnected and it will go ahead and
reboot
and there we go so as you guys can see
here we're right back to normal we can
get on our device and nothing has been
lost or anything like that so triggers
doesn't see here the recovery mode
function does work pretty well now I
will mention that sometimes you do need
to unplug and replug it in it won't
properly recognize or something however
that's pretty rare and overall does work
pretty well now on top of that does have
a couple of other features so you can
also enter a poem vfu mode state yeah
not gonna be the most useful thing in
the world but if you ever do need to you
can just do it from a single touch of a
button on top of that you also do have
access to the entire state of jailbreak
comm guides now this is all about this
is my website where I kind of keep you
guys all up to date with the
jailbreaking stuff so you know full
tutorials and guides on what firmware
and what geo breaks and all that kind of
stuff so all you need to do is just plug
your device into recovery mode toolbox
click the button and it will bring you
straight to whatever page you need
lastly but certainly not least we also
do have the device info so if you need
to if you have an iPhone or an iPod or
need to look up exactly what firmware
it's on or anything like that you can
certainly do that just plug it into here
you guys will see the name
what firmware you're on and also it will
show you your serial number or your
activated state baseband phone number
all that kind of stuff I did disable the
serial number and the phone number
obviously I don't really want to show
that oh there's no phone number on here
but yeah so it's about that simple but
anyway guys it's gonna be about it for
my video on recovery mode toolbox very
simple little program however it's
pretty cool of course is free I'll have
a link in the description of the video
that's the guys go ahead and check it
out and if you're you know jailbroken
and all that kind of stuff is something
really nice to have anyway guys if you
enjoyed the video definitely be sure to
leave it a thumbs up and if you're
