pocket game for the iPhone iPod touch
and iPad so this is a really cool
application that basically turns your
camera on your device into what looks
pretty much exactly like the original
Game Boy camera so you guys not familiar
with the Game Boy game I'm not talking
about for the tas or anything like that
i got for the original game boy there's
a pretty cool add-ons you can plug into
it it allows you to take pictures with
your Game Boy and how as you might
expect pictures taken with an old-school
game board that we're not particularly
amazing but it was kind of a ton of it
is really cool I was in four colors it's
black white and a couple shades of grey
I just kind of give you got a really
nice looking effect and the developers
of application have really done a
faithful job of bringing it over to the
iPhone the iPod Touch as well as the
iPad 2 of course so media has a quick
little demo of it so you can see here hi
guys it's a really cool looking of bags
like I said it's only just a couple of
colors I believe the final resolutions
like 200 by 200 so they're not very high
resolution or anything like that but
they're not meant to be and they're
actually there are some pretty cool
things you can do with it so of course
you can just snap a picture you can
adjust the brightness so you kind of get
some fine-grained controls there as well
as with the contrast I usually have to
keep them in the middle but of course
that's entirely up to you I know there
are a couple of different options here
so you can take multiple pictures so for
example if we want to take a picture
here and I can just jump out of the
frame and if we kind of get it lined up
sort of we can take that picture there's
a lot of different cool little things
like that you can take multiple pictures
if we go over here we can actually do
almost like photobooth effects where you
can have for which you're super super
low resolution we can do I have it
stretched we have it you know tilted I
mean it's kind of like photobooth if you
know photobooth was around and you know
1998 a couple of other effects here we
can again take the same pictures like I
was showing you guys or a few more but I
won't go through them all and lastly we
can just do the timer anyway guys that's
it for my review of 8-bit pocket cam uh
it's definitely a novelty app it's not
for everyone but I do like it I
definitely think that a lot of people
will enjoy the really cool kind of
pictures that it takes definitely
getting away from you know the hyper
realistic you know that you know all the
cool effects you know it's really basic
bare bones but it looks cool and you can
take some pretty cool pictures with it
so if you guys are interested
find it in the App Store for $0.99</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
