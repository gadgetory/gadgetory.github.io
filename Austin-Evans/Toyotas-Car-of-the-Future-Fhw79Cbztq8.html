CES we see a lot of tech in cars but no
one really does it better than Toyota so
when Toyota reached out and offered to
sponsor a look at what they've got at
the show I couldn't say no the biggest
shiniest new toy is known as the TR IP 4
this is developed by Toyota's Research
Institute and is built around the Lexus
LS 500 H unlike most autonomous vehicles
this actually looks cool yeah I know
it's a revolutionary concept it's still
heavily modified with things like lidar
camera radar and much more but the most
important thing is that Toyota is
actually taking two approaches here
their Guardian tech is about making
driving safer with the person behind the
wheel whereas chauffeur is all about
full autonomy in almost any scenario now
this is a big deal right autonomous
vehicles are not ready for the
mainstream just yet there's still a lot
of work to do to bring fully driverless
cars to the mainstream but Toyota is
such a huge company and they span across
so many areas that it's really
interesting to take a look at some of
their other investments I got the chance
to co-host the Toyota untold podcast
recently to get a better idea of how
this all plays out
yeah so Toyota AI ventures is Toyota's
first dedicated venture capital fund and
it's focused on investing in early-stage
companies that are focusing on
artificial intelligence data as applied
to autonomous mobility and robotics many
of the startups are defining what
mobility means and so we are investing
in those companies that are defining
mobility another cool company here is
main mobility now this is actually a
company who has autonomous vehicles on
the road right now in Detroit as well as
Columbus and this is their next
generation vehicle so this is a version
that would have absolutely no driver so
you can see in the front seat I'm
actually facing back toward other
passengers and as it has all these
different sensors as the technology
develops you can imagine a fully
autonomous version of this vehicle
unlike a lot of the vehicle stuff here
at CES may mobility actually has these
on the streets right now so it is a
slightly different version and it does
have a driver so in case there's any
kind of issues but the idea is that this
is the final format of what it will
become hopefully in the next few years
something you don't exactly see every
day is a hydrogen powered truck so this
is project portal it's a collaboration
between Kenworth and Toyota it's a well
let's take a look not quite like any
truck you've seen or that I've seen this
is where the magic happens there are six
carbon fiber hydrogen tanks which were
not to use the electric motor right
behind it to pull a ton of cargo this is
actually more powerful than a standard
diesel truck so now I get to explore the
truck it's maybe a questionable idea but
this is really cool
so it's interesting about this is it the
truck chassis itself is not that
different from a lot of others but
there's a lot of special bespoke parts
for this one for example there's MRI
shifter here because why not what's cool
about this is it actually is a proper
truck too there is a full 300 miles of
range and right now the prototype is
actually at the port of LA bringing
cargo back and forth all day so it's a
really interesting idea of getting away
from a standard electric or standard
sort of diesel truck and into something
that's just a little bit more high-tech
by little I mean a lot hydrogen's pretty
clear the days of a car company that
just makes cars that will get you from
point A to point B are quickly ending
technology is rapidly changing things
alternative fuels are rapidly changing
things and the idea that you don't
actually have to drive your car is a big
big selling point so it is super
interesting to see just how a Oda is
taking advantage of this you're really
becoming an all-new company</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
