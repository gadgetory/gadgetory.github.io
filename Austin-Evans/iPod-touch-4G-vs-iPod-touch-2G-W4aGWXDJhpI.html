between the ipod touch 2nd generation
which is on the left and the iPod Touch
4th generation which is on the right and
of course a lot of this stuff does apply
to the iPod Touch 3rd generation as they
are pretty much identical hardware wise
so cuz I'm gonna go ahead and show you
guys everything from the screens I'm
gonna go show you the hardware just
about anything you might want to know
even including the cases and how it
works all kinds of stuff guys so
definitely stay tuned so to begin with
let's go ahead and take a look at how
thin these are so of course iPod Touch
2nd and 3rd generation both were
extremely extremely thin pretty much
thinner than almost any kind of iPod or
phone or media player it means it's very
very very thin however the iPod Touch
4th generation is improved upon that as
you guys can see here there is a pretty
considerable difference in size that's
even more profound to go ahead and just
take it make myself a little iPod
sandwich here as you guys can see there
the iPod Touch 2nd generation is much
thicker now of course is actually it's
actually kind of surprising I didn't
think it was gonna be that big a deal
but really the iPod Touch 2nd generation
I mean I'd rather the iPod Touch 4th
generation feels much better in the hand
because it's thinner I'm not so sure if
you guys can see it's actually tapers
off a little bit more sharply than on
the 2nd generation and I really like how
that the edge almost caught on it like
fits into your hand and I sound a little
bit odd but really the iPod Touch 4th
generation is fantastic to hold and man
I so wished Apple had not went with this
the shiny aluminum because man gets
scratched up as you guys can see here
I've had it for like next to no time at
all and it's already gotten pretty
decently scratched up so I've always
keep my iPods in the case and you
probably should too but man the iPod
Touch 4th generation does feel great in
the hand it's very very thin I'm so go
ahead and just set them on the side I'll
just kind of give you guys a tour of the
devices so you can see here pretty much
everything is the same on the sides
although on the fourth-generation you
actually you can see the volume buttons
are separate whereas on the second
generation they're kind of uh well
they're kind of one button it's kind of
two pieces definitely do like the volume
buttons on the fourth generation they do
work quite well coming around to the top
you guys you see that the sleepweight
buttons have changed so on the iPod
Touch 2nd generation it is on the left
side whereas on the for generation it's
on the right side I now actually prefer
the 2nd generation for a couple reasons
well for why I'm just used to this but
the main thing is you guys can see here
go ahead and my camera decides focus you
can see you're on the second generation
the button class not really focusing I'm
here
pack it up a little bit but as you can
see here on the same generation the
button is uh four truths a little bit
well I'll go ahead and move the fourth
generation up a little bit you see it
kind of is recessed and to be honest
that is kind of a little bit of an issue
because when you're you know you need to
go ahead and hit the sleep/wake button
we actually need to go ahead and grab it
from behind and then try to you know
kind of click it so it's not a huge deal
as far as the hardware goes but it
definitely is kind of an issue now going
ahead and coming over here using the
bonds are actually a little bit
different well the same generation the
speaker kind of came out of this hole I
believe anyway it's always what seemed
like now the fourth generation now the
speaker comes out this hole and again
actually I'm not entirely glad of this
change just because what is on the same
generation no matter how you hold it
like especially like my pinky it usually
goes there it doesn't really block
anything however with the fourth
generation go ahead your pinky just goes
right over there kind of covers up the
speaker it definitely does degrade the
audio quality quite a bit
however again not a huge deal a lot of
these are just nitpicks just because
obviously I've used this I know this
extremely well so um so that's pretty
much it of course on the front you do
have the FaceTime camera where you don't
have it on the iPod touch and flipping
them both over to the back you do have
the the 720p high definition video
camera and a microphone instead of the
Wi-Fi antenna I'm so guys that's pretty
much it for the hardware overview one of
the biggest improvements to the iPod
Touch 4th generation was definitely the
Retina display so guys I actually to go
ahead and take a look the iPod Touch 4th
generation is on the right and the
second is on the left I highly recommend
go ahead and put this video into high
definition 720p and look at it and full
screen to really see the difference I'm
not entirely sure how well the camera
picks this up guys oom bin as I can but
I can really tell and personally there's
a huge difference especially when you
look at text which I'll go ahead and
show you guys in a second but huge
difference the Retina display looks
fantastic a little way to show you some
speed tests as well as just a little bit
more about the Retina display so before
we go we just want to say that both of
these iPods are on iOS 4.1 the most
recent update as of this video as you
can see here the iPod Touch 2nd
generation does not support native
multitasking an iPod Touch 4th
generation most Desmond's cleared out so
this should be a fairly fair fight they
both are connected
via the same Wi-Fi network so I'm going
to show you guys a site show you how the
loading times I'm also going to show you
whether that's Retina display looks like
go ahead and load these at the same time
so ready set go so you guys can see here
I'm pretty sure you guys pretty will be
able to figure it out but yeah there you
go the iPod Touch filtration done and
there you go so iPod Touch moisturize
you definitely won by a mile is no
contest at all and guys I could show you
a bunch of different websites but really
there's no difference iPod Touch 4th
generation much much faster no matter
what now let me go ahead and show you
guys the max application so just in case
you can't tell the iPod Touch 4th
generation is on the right and the iPod
Touch second generation is on the left
so let's go ahead and just zoom in on
Mexico for example so I'm gonna go ahead
and try this at the same time probably
be able to but so look look you can see
there's a huge difference again let's do
it again
actually the iPod Touch 2nd generation
fairly one but a lot of this doesn't do
Wi-Fi so scan just keep zooming in there
we go so this is not an entirely fair
fight I do understand that guys so you
know I know that you can get a ton of
comments saying well it's not fair but
trust me again when I say I mean the
iPod Touch 4th generation is got almost
a twice as fast processor and generally
when it mats mean you can go ahead and
let's just go and just start zooming and
go ahead and scroll I mean there's no
slowdown whereas when I try to do this
on the iPod Touch I mean it's gonna it's
gonna it's gonna do pretty decent but as
you see there's a little bit of
choppiness
and where's that really just does not
exist in the iPod Touch 4th generation
so again pretty much any of my tests
doesn't matter what it was
iPod Touch 4th generation was concern be
faster so obviously it's what you expect
with new hardware by definitely good
news if you're thinking of upgrading so
guys that's just about it for my
comparison between the 2nd and the 4th
generation iPod touches so guys to sum
up I think that the 4th generation is a
fantastic upgrade if you're like me and
you're still using a 2nd generation or
even if you do have a 3rd generation
there is still a lot here for you so
like I said guys there's a ton of stuff
there's you know the Retina display
which is fantastic looking really just
can't say enough about the display you
know I really like that it's got
FaceTime it's got a really nice back
facing camera as well on it is thinner
now not to say that it's perfect I do
think that Apple's actually did kind of
make
couple steps backward for example I
really it's not a deal-breaker by any
means but it really is kind of annoying
the sleep/wake button not really sure
why they they couldn't have just go
ahead and pretty much just stuck with
the same one from the second generation
that's a little bit of an issue as well
as the the dock connector is a little
bit difficult just because the dock
connector is literally the exact same
thickness actually if you guys just kind
of want to gig feel for it grab one of
your standard Apple 30-pin dock
connectors it is identical to the
thickness of the iPod touch um but just
kind of something random but that dock
connector does not fit very well and
does matter what the new or the old
style it doesn't fit very well you kind
of have to kind of force it in which I
don't like but guys those are pretty
minor things and in general I highly
recommend if you're interested in an
iPod Touch or for whatever reason the
four generation is definitely fantastic
as an added bonus which I really don't
recommend you do this but you actually
can use your second generation case for
fourth generations so I'll just show you
it doesn't fit very well it will depend
on the case a lot of stuff won't work so
for example the sleek white buttons over
here the power I mean that the volume
button is a little bit different and it
the iPod Touch 2nd generation it's a
little bit wider than the
fourth-generation but I didn't just want
to kind of mention that you can use in a
minute if you're you know you aren't
able to get a case immediately you can't
use this to protect your iPod a little
bit until you can get a normal case but
guys that's kind of just right there's
kind of something I didn't notice I
didn't see anybody else tell you so
figure out a while go ahead and I
mention that but anyway guys that's
about it for my comparison really very
impressed with the iPod Touch 4th
generation anyway guys thanks for
