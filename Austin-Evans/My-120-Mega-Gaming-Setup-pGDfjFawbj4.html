this is Austin and today we're building
a home theater setup but essentially
we'll have two recliners against this
wall and soundbar and the projector I
think it should look pretty nice if I
can figure out how to plug my cheerin oh
because that's so ridiculous right now
and is extremely comfortable you guys
can build the rest right oh so is this
the projector that's now so it's
actually an ultra short throw so instead
of putting it like on the wall or
something behind this what we're going
to do is we're going to put it on sort
of like that table down here and this is
going to shoot up our projector screen
yeah so we just got the TV stand out of
the box so this is what the fish will
look like I don't know I don't think it
doesn't act like that these are scruples
so this is our LG protein projector dude
this is totally going to fit on this
your should a really good job picking it
out that's so tiny what's really cool
about this is it's a laser projector so
I'm like a normal projector where you'll
have to change the bulbs every thousand
hours or so this guy is going to last
you 20,000 hours so I think we should do
is let's just set it up here and display
it on the wall just to figure out
roughly what size especially I want to
know how far we actually have to have it
away from the wall wow that dark in here
you can totally see it clearly look I
like that is yeah and it's a great wall
so it's not even oh man yeah once we
actually get the projection street huh
so Ken and all of his infinite wisdom
decided to not just get us a projector
screen get the most complicated and
crazy over-the-top one that Amazon sells
because reasons it's cool look nice if
we actually get it together quickly are
you sure this project you can do one
that 20 inches hi my name is completo
and I'm gonna do the math squared
vehicles okay 2020 it's actually yeah no
big deal
minor worry there but we're totally fine
candid the Matt hashtag candid the
matter after a lot of hard work we have
our projector screen you put together so
now that you have to move it back in the
room because it's actually too big to
fit in there we were trying to put it
together can you stick to the door not
like this so cool bana yeah okay and
then like you roll it so that we can get
that side down covers the the chip and
spatch so we're good there
this is our 120 inch projector setup so
it took pretty much all day but I'm
pretty happy with it
so the projector itself is a little hard
to see right now because we have our
giant video light blasting light into
the room but I think this actually looks
really nice and of course it does start
with the pro beam itself what's nice
about this is as an ultra short throw
projector it really simplifies our cable
management so this is all connected to
an Xbox one X and a soundbar and
normally we'd have to rent HDMI cable
from this all the way up to the ceiling
or to the wall behind but instead
because it is so close everything can
just stay here and you get the added
benefit of I'm not gonna accidentally
walk in front of the projector and block
the screen like I did something like
this so we are maxing this guy out right
now it can handle up to a 120 inch
screen and well that's exactly what
we're using so what this means is that
you have to be very specific on where
you actually place the projector so for
example if we move it closer it's
actually going to shrink the image
that's why we have to keep it pretty
much exactly right here now we made a
slight mistake and actually Mountain a
projector screen so if we would have
lowered it a little bit we could
probably have tucked this setup in by a
few inches but considering that took us
like two hours to put that together I
think I can live with this so even in a
full 120 inches we're still getting a
1080p image so if you look up close you
can actually see the individual pixels
once you sit down and kind of lean back
it's really hard to see of course we
have nothing but the finest and Leanback
technology when it comes to a projector
setup the real
is in size so with the 120 inches to
work with that's a bigger than pretty
much any TV that you can get and where
that really comes in handy is for video
whether you're watching a movie or
YouTube it's an immersive experience
especially with the set up the way that
we've got here with the recliner and the
good audio and everything it as soon as
to be able to just sit back and enjoy
whatever you want on this thing
something like this is usable for more
than just movies though so you can game
on a hundred and twenty inch screen now
yes is it kind of overkill absolutely do
I care nope so since this set up is
powered by the Xbox one X we're getting
at 4k image super sample down to 1080
and it looks so so good now I do think
that's maybe not the most practical
thing to play on such a giant display
but it's it's gonna be hard to go back
to a small TV every TVs go through saw
no matter how good the screen is you
have to have good audio to tie it all
together and that is where the LG sj9
sound bar comes in so we actually did a
video on this a few months ago and this
is the setup that's working in the
office right now but I liked it so much
that I bought another one for the house
now of course nothing can replace a full
surround sound setup but I've been
really impressed with the sound that you
can get out of the sj9 not only does it
have the front firing or rather the top
firing dolby atmos speakers but you also
have a pretty big dedicated sub so the
rest of the setup is pretty much the
Xbox one X as well as a bunch of bits
and pieces of you know so I've got some
Playstations we've got the original NES
top loader some games most of this is
really for decoration but we do have a
hue strip that's running underneath
mostly it just looks cool and Ken went
crazy though my video game stuff so on
this side of the room we have the
recliners which are actually really nice
because the screen is so big you kind of
have to lay back to see it
there's also another hue light over here
so right now I'm controlling it from my
pixel but I'm actually probably going to
get a Google home for this side I also
do GLE Wi-Fi tucked underneath and up
top here is the only actual decoration
in the room a signed Game of Thrones
poster from george RR martin now yes the
room is a little bit bare there's not a
ton of stuff in here right now but for
one day I'm really impressed with what
we were able to put together I actually
have an extra LG probing projector to
give a way to you
guys so be sure to check out the link in
the description to head over to Facebook
for all the details I will do my best to
find links to all of the stuff in the
description including of course the pro
beam projector because LG was awesome
enough to sponsor this whole setup now
I'm curious what do you guys think about
the actual setup itself I think there's
definitely a lot more work to do but I'm
pretty happy with how it's come out of
course let me know what you think in the
comments below anyway guys thank you so
much for watching and I'm gonna go watch
this now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
