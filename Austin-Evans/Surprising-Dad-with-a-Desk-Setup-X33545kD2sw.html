doing thank you hey guys lost it so my
dad has been in a few videos but his
tech game is the meat of a serious
upgrade so I teamed up with HP core not
only sponsoring this video but hooking
my dad up with an entire desk setup
starting with the pavilion 24 so first
of all we have the wireless keyboard so
I believe this is actually going to be
using a USB dongle which comes in here
somewhere that we get batteries in both
the keyboard and the mouse
good job HP setup instruction a lot of
instructions oh I know the ascetic
instructions are plug it in pretty sure
I'm qualified to operate a copy of
Windows all right here comes the fun
part of trying to get this out of a box
if this all goes terribly wrong I'm
sorry dad yeah okay we should probably
make sure I've actually got it held down
anyway so we have the actual computer
itself
oh so the webcam is hidden wait why so
this is the civilian 24 it's actually
fairly thin and inside we're getting
some pretty decent specs including a
Core i5 8 gigs of ram and a one terabyte
hard drive so now that we're up and
running there are a few things that jump
out to me and the first is the display
it's actually pretty good
so we're getting a 24 inch 1080p panel
what's really cool about it is the super
thin bezel which in fact is why we have
the pop-up webcam are some of the most
popular ps4 accessories you know what
this isn't bad
not only does the display look nice with
all of viewing angles in color but it
also has Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen speakers down on
the bottom and they sound nice the
Pavilion is going to be more than enough
computer for dad but the nice part is
the trickiest how to get this enjoys all
set up for dad before it gets here
sick awesome is dance move so it is the
night before my dad gets here and we
have a lot of work to do so to test to
set up I don't get hit by this lamp what
we're going to be doing is setting up
the sort of temporary set up in the
office when my dad gets here but then
we're going to basically box everything
up and ship it with him well maybe I'd
the desk we'll see about that
what do we need to do right now we have
a debt to couch over this tell me how
far you wanna go back right there's
gonna be a lot of room because we can
put the speakers on the side yep bomb
like accessories like chargers and style
you like a record player can you get rid
of that yes absolutely feel like it's
been like forever since I've been in the
record shop but uh what do you think
Austin's that would like okay Michael
Jackson do you think he'll like some uh
maroon 5 so it is day 2 and my dad will
be here about two hours we have a lot of
work to do but I think he maybe pull it
off only thing is we're still waiting on
a couple things from Amazon but I think
we should be good
a few moments later right so um we got
mostly everything looks like our record
player wasn't exactly new as advertised
from Amazon yeah I'm just going to
assume that that this will work
so I just landed time for some deaf gain
look like desk teens flex emoji up there
sucking dad's all up in some fresh
thread like usual so this is the new set
wait
oh I don't know is the HP Pavilion 24 so
there's a whole Windows desktop so now I
can you say watch them super cool
awesome edit videos and yeah I may be
saviors Oh Jim Fisher I'm like game PC
would use to customize the ps4 Xone the
Roku is the cool part is now I can you
watch videos which can also listen to
records we looked I listen to a record
40 years ago is it really yeah hey yeah
there's about 30 Elliot and the video is
about to be taken after YouTube but we
got full record player here but that's
not everything right okay so we also
have nazi keyboard here so if you want
to play music on speakers we go into
here and the record player isn't here so
you can basically listen to music watch
videos on the computer but we ready for
record throw it on here something
ultimate guy is a dot so you got the
pickle yeah we're putting into the mood
computer a best way out and everything
you're on on the YouTube deal you're
underneath the deal mom yeah so this is
one chance to say anything to the you
two bodies that you won't say it's
Friday night the big city guys enjoy
yourself
we will mom we will so actually Ken did
most of the work here picking out like
the color snow at the warning moon yeah
so cable management is super clean right
because you figure the speakers are
connected
the computer your phone and all the
stuff we see is the mouse and keyboard
that comes with the pavilion is actually
wireless so even though there's a lot of
stuff going on behind it's pretty clean
thanks for coming out California thanks
for telling out being in the video you
guys want more from my dad subscribe
here you never know when my dad can show
up and ask really fanboy questions on
the Internet there's no remember no</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
