tennis is one of the best phones you can
buy today which makes sense as it's also
one of the most expensive flagship sever
as opposed to doing our normal is it
worth the video this year instead I
think it's a lot more useful if we
answer the most important question with
any new gadgets launched who should buy
the iPhone 10s one big reason to pick up
the 10s for the 10s max is if you're
already in the Apple ecosystem and
you're looking for an upgrade especially
if you're coming from an older device
such as an iPhone 6 or 6s this is a big
step forward take the camera for example
put it side-by-side with the success and
you will notice a big difference now
part of this is because there are
several generations between the phones
which means that things like color
science dynamic range and the video
quality is all been improved but you're
also getting additional functionality
including the second telephoto option
which is especially useful for the
portrait mode which is actually pretty
good on the 10s it's also hard to
overlook the difference in screen size
go on to the days of huge bezels on top
and bottom instead the new iPhone is
basically all screen up front including
the knotch oh yes my friends the knotch
look personally I don't mind the knotch
not only is it on basically every
flagship phone out there but at this
point well sure you might think it looks
ugly almost anyone's going to be able to
get used to it very quickly that notch
houses one of the biggest differences
between the 10s and previous generations
face ID put simply instead of having a
home button with touch ID instead you
use your face to unlock the 10 and the
10s and generally speaking it works
pretty well certainly not perfect as far
as I'm concerned not bad
there are also some software updates
from legacy phones and so which are
pretty substantial one of my favorites
is the gesture based navigation since
you don't have a home button to be able
to exit apps as well as swipe in and out
of multitasking and whatnot this makes
it a lot faster to be able to just swipe
on the bottom of the screen performance
is also a consideration every year the
iPhone does get faster and while the a
series processors have been really
impressive especially in the last couple
years when you pit the 10s compared to
the 10 and especially going back to the
7 and the 6s you're gonna know a pretty
substantial difference sure the camera
is a solid update this year but it is
certainly not worth dropping another
thousand dollars to get same thing goes
for the performance yes on paper the 10s
is faster but realistically there's
almost no real-world difference more
than any phone I've used in years the
iPhone
10 has held up so well over a full year
of use the battery life still lasts all
day long
it still feels fast the camera is great
if you have one and you're not like
rocking a broken screen or something it
is almost impossible for me to recommend
it over the 10 s no no I didn't actually
mean that that's the wrong I flipped
that the 10 still feels every bit as
fast as it did last year and even more
so now that iOS 12 is out speaking up
let's actually talk about iOS 12 for a
second as opposed to most updates which
make your iPhone feel slower twelve
legitimately does make even older
iPhones feel a lot faster I'll be real
if my job wasn't to review the latest
tech I would not have updated my iPhone
10 to a 10 s it's good but the upgrades
are just not worth it
on the other hand one reason why you
might want to pick up the tennis is the
longevity it's really impressive that
Apple is still supporting the iPhone 5s
after five years and honestly this
software support on the iOS side it's
one of the major advantages over Android
in my opinion if the 10s gets that same
level of support it is a serious selling
point sure a thousand dollars for a
phone is expensive when you break that
up over three four or even five years of
usable while use that's pretty cool
there's also the fact that the updated
screen design is the new standard going
forward which is a good sign for app
supports long story short if you want to
pick up a new iPhone today the tennis is
a good shot of being able to last quite
a while on the other hand not everyone
wants to spend $1000 on a new phone sure
the tennis is great but there's a lot of
other things you can do as $1,000 like
pay rent or buy a lot of Subway
sandwiches that's a lot of five-dollar
footlongs that's 100 of them no wait
they're not not only can you pick up a
much cheaper Android phones such as the
poco phone f1 for a lot less than half
the price but there are also other iOS
options that can do a decent job of not
costing $1,000 such as the iPhone 7
which is now 450 bucks sure it's
probably not going to last as long but
you're still getting a solid camera
really reasonable performance and it
costs less than half the price of the
10s one point in favor of the 10s
specifically with the Mac's is if you're
really into media consumption which odds
are if you're watching this video right
now you probably are based in early
numbers it seems like the 10s
is heavily outselling the standard 10s
and that's really only for one reason
the fact that it's got that bigger
display besides that there's actually
really no difference between the 10s and
the 10s max the 6.5 inch OLED display is
about as good as it gets for a
smartphone
not only is the brightness in the color
and especially the contrast terrific but
it does support all the fancy new
display technologies including HDR 10
and Dolby vision the improved speakers
also make a difference now are they
louder but they also have better stereo
separation and that combined with the
screen makes the 10s max an excellent
media consumption device
honestly the main reason to not buy the
iPhone 10s is really simple the iPhone
10 are take everything that's good about
the 10s add a wide variety of colors
remove the telephoto camera while still
keeping the main camera intact and
replace the OLED display for an IPS
panel and boom you've got yourself an
iPhone 10 R which just so happens to be
a full $250 cheaper that's a big
difference compared to past generations
previously Apple would knock about $100
off of the entry-level iPhone but this
year you're getting the 10 R with almost
the exact same spec but with a major
price cut sometimes it's easy to miss is
that while the 10 R does have a lower
pixel density which is on par with the
iPhone 8 but the actual screen size
itself is right in between the 10s and
the 10s max the 10 R won't be out until
late October so I can't give it my full
recommendation just yet but on paper it
really does look like the full package
you just aren't missing much compared to
the 10s and that is my recommendation if
you really want the best and have the
budget for it by all means pick up the
10s it's a great phone for almost
everyone else though I really feel like
waiting for the 10 R is worth it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
