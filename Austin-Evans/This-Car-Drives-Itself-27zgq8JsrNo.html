check out some very very cool cars so
BMW invited us out and want to sponsor
this video on some of the coolest tech
they had at the edge 2017 the first
thing I want to check out was their
autonomous 5 Series up there goes oh
here it goes I'm meditating
hahaha
so right now I am driving in a BMW
5-series I clearly you can see how well
I'm driving the car without any meaning
to look the cars fully driving itself
right now and it's a little weird
I wasn't it but this is awesome just
hanging out no big deal the cars driving
yourself so the thing that really kind
of jumps out to me is how seamless is it
I get on the freeway it's all fine no
big deal I hit the button completely the
cars taking care of everything able to
follow the car in front of me stay in
the lane keep the correct speed if
seamless I think that's a really cool
part of this using the BMW open mobility
cloud which ties in with services such
as Amazon Prime now when it comes time
to pick up Grandma's with chocolate it's
easy enough to order them straight from
the car and be able to pick them up
right along our route you have the
basics on how they disconnected to the
Arctic region and there's augmented to
over top and we're happy now that the
only belief is knowledge and Prime now
they came they deserve it bigger
locations along inside our love is
almost any difference
they are the guitars of the exact rocket
that you were 10 nor is we thing the day
for Grandma yeah no really why are we
getting very much chakra systems we're
really kind considerate or so I better
be happy with our amazing chocolate as
cool as the autonomous driving demo is
NW are kind of known for creating some
performance vehicles so that is what I
want to try next the i8 is a crazy
looking car but my favorite feature is
definitely
so while the BMW i8 looks like an
insanely cool-looking hyper car this is
actually electric and you can drive it
on the street no problem Donal x-mode oh
man that's not bad for full lecture this
is a perfectly civilized car it looks
crazy but right now I can be driving in
anything this it could be like an i3 or
it's just super calm and quiet and
peaceful in here the rides not bad
but when we're ready to go off in sport
mode we've got a full sports car oh so
silence is cool but you know it's nice
to have a little bit of a little bit of
power this is perfect car Vegas it looks
cool everyone's like looking at us as we
drive by his perfect for sending you
traffic this is no one moving anywhere
what I could have cruised down the Vegas
Strip in the i8 for a while luckily PW
had one last thing up their sleeve
all right so that is a lot of fun I
think I got better right so the first
few laps is just kind of hard to really
trust the car click the power between
the electric motors and especially the
gas motor when it's kind of like working
together electric car sure but that is a
lot of fun between the autonomous
driving and the full racecar experience
BMW had a lot of very cool stuff this
year at CES 2017 if you missed it I did
a video on their sculpture interior
which is absolutely the future cars so
be sure to go check that video out if
you missed it and I will catch you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
