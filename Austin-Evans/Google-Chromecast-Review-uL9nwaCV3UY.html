here with the review of the new Google
chromecast this tiny $35 dongle promises
to give you a smart TV at a fraction of
the price but how does it actually work
it comes in a small white box and once
you flip it open you'll immediately see
the chromecast which looks more like a
USB Drive than an Apple TV you'll also
find a few accessories included in the
box including an optional HDMI extender
to improve Wi-Fi signal and help connect
the chromecast to tucked-away HDMI ports
a micro USB cable for power a wall
adapter which you only have to use if
there are no USB ports on your TV a
little bit of info on not doing stupid
things with the product and lastly the
chromecast itself up front is the HDMI
connector which goes into your TV with a
micro USB port for power along with a
button to reset the system if you need
setup isn't difficult just plug it into
a spare HDMI port on your TV and then
connect it to power via USB or the
included adapter getting it working will
require a computer or Android device and
while that's a little flaky once up and
running it's simple you will have to go
into the menu of your TV and make sure
CEC device control is enabled so the
chromecast can turn your TV on and
switch inputs automatically but beyond
that you're good to go so how does the
thing work pretty well load up a YouTube
video in the app or browser on Android
iOS or using Chrome on your computer and
a share icon will appear give it a
second and the chromecast will
automatically pick up the video on the
TV what's really cool is that if you
have multiple people connected to your
Wi-Fi any of them can control what's
playing or add videos to the TV queue
Netflix is another app that's ready to
work and here again it's basically
seamless just select where you want the
video to play and the chromecast takes
care of the rest in full 1080p HD your
mobile device works like the remote you
can pause skip and even change the
volume all from the app more apps should
support chromecast soon but in the
meantime you can also use Chrome on the
computer to cast your tabs for example
even though Spotify doesn't officially
work by streaming a Spotify browser tab
I can get my music sent through to the
TV if I like and this works for any
other side I tried as well all you need
is the Google cast
extension from the Chrome Web Store
which gives you a few basic options to
resize tabs and change the streaming
resolution using my macbook air the
quality was weirdly interlaced where
worked perfectly on Windows so that's
something to keep in mind
overall the Google chromecast is a tiny
cheap way of streaming video like
YouTube and Netflix to your TV
seamlessly being able to control it from
your phone tablet or PC is great and
while having support for more services
would be nice it's by far the best way
to watch a video on your TV I've seen
yet for $35 if you like watching YouTube
especially tech channels like this then
the chromecast is a no-brainer if you're
interested more I've got a giveaway of a
$1500 gaming PC going on right now so
feel free to check it out and I will
catch you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
