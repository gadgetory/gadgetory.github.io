management in your projects and smart
collections of your video and audio
which allows you to group together Clips
based on people in the shot or other
categories Final Cut Pro 10 is also
smart enough to detect what types of
shots you give it and organize them
based on if it's a medium shot close-up
etc the white balance is automatically
adjusted as soon as you import your
Clips all you still retain full manual
control in addition to automatic audio
adjustment to sync your audio and video
sources the program will clean the sound

is automatic color matching which allows
for near-perfect grading with a single
click Final Cut Pro 10 will be shipping

two hundred ninety-nine dollars in a
retail box or you can download it from
the mac app store if you need some
