here with my unboxing of the Apple TV
3rd generation this is the brand new
model it actually comes out tomorrow
however I got mine just a little early
so yeah let's go ahead and just take a
look at it so the box is very plain and
very very small as you can see from the
size of my hand here the most important
thing is the 1080p this now of course
supports 1080p so last one was limited
to 720 which it's alright but if you
have a nice TV you definitely want to
get the best quality some of the little
information about that but nothing all
that exciting so let's go ahead and find
ourselves a little place to open it up
here alright so now that we've got the
plastic wrap off let's go ahead just
open the box up so just kind of slides
out of the way like that and here's the
Apple TV itself so of course this is
really small so if you guys have never
seen one of these I just kind of give
you a comparison this is the size of an
iPhone so I'm very very small well then
take a closer look at that in one second
cousin see what else we get in the box
so of course Apple is stuck with the
same aluminum remote I've always kind of
liked the design of this even though
it's definitely not the most ergonomic
but you know definitely nice that they
do include a remote kind of helpful when
you want it you know do anything at all
I'm go ahead and up this little
cardboard bit up and off to the side and
here it looks like we just got the power
cable so this actually does have the
power supply built in so there's no
brick or anything just plug one into the
Apple TV into your wall and you're good
to go
and lastly it looks like we just have a
little bit of set-up guide so I doubt
there's anything all that important but
we'll just take a quick look so here we
have some nice giant Apple stickers we
can toss on an Apple TV port and product
information guy which is definitely not
important and just a little information
on how to connect it which should be
very simple all right so it's going to
toss all the stuff off to the side and
take a closer look at the Apple TV
itself of course it's all wrapped up in
this plastic that Apple loves so much
but yeah so overall it looks pretty much
identical to the original Apple TV don't
forget some like tape around it and
there we go that's looking much better
yeah like I said this is pretty much
identical to the original Apple or
rather the second generation Apple TV so
the major difference is that it does
have 1080p capability but while I'm here
go ahead give you guys a little tour of
course this is where you plug in the
power you have a full size HDMI a micro
USB which really isn't useful for that
much as in jailbreaking and you know
maybe some service or something you have
optical audio out as well as Ethernet
and on top of that this does support
Wi-Fi so of course if you want you can
plug it into Ethernet but more than
likely you'll probably look up to Wi-Fi
and you'll be good to go the only guys
it's gonna be about it for my unboxing
of the Apple TV 3rd generation
definitely stay tuned to the channel I
will be doing a full review in the
coming week or so on top that I also do
have my iPad new iPad iPad 3 whatever
you want to call it I will have that
unboxings and all kinds of videos on
that starting tomorrow so definitely
stay tuned to the channel guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
