overview of Google Hangouts this is part
of the new Google+ social network in
everybody you can say hi of course I'm
in here with a video chat with a few
other people so Adam you want to ID and
introduce yourself real quick and great
you want to go ahead and say something
and may I say something real quick all
right so uh what we're doing is just
give you guys a little overview of
Google Hangouts as you guys can probably
tell already it is very similar to like
Skype although there's some really cool
features so if you've noticed already it
does kind of change back and forth so
Adam say something real quick and watch
the camera change to you and then if
somebody else wants to say something
it'll pop a review so yeah I mean it
works pretty decently as you guys can
see here there's also a couple of things
so if I wanted to for example just look
over gray or Thai or Adam I can just
click on their little prop or portraits
profiles whatever it'll automatically do
that another a couple of other features
that makes it really cool so there's
also a youtube so for example let's say
all of us wanted to go watch a YouTube
video together we can have it all synced
you can do that unfortunate it's not
quite working right now but I'm sure
they will have that fix before too long
of course we also do have a chat here so
I can say hey guys in the chat and send
stuff across you guys should be able to
see that and so there's also invites so
you can invite various people in here so
it's like you're having a you know a big
hangout and you want to add extra people
you can do that and there's a couple of
things such as settings mute mic and
everything there is one kind of block
yeah exactly
Adam here right here is blocked meter
muting me rather for some reason you can
actually mute other people in the stream
for some reason I don't quite get what
that's all about
okay guys there you go that's a quick
little overview of what Google Hangouts
is all about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
