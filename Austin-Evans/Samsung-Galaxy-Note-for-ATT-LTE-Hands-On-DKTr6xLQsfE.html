reporting live from CES 2012 with these
samsung galaxy note for AT&amp;amp;T so as you
guys can see here it is a 5.3 inch phone
so in fact just to give you guys a
little example of the size here is next
one iphone 4s suggestion see here
absolutely massive in fact i think the
4s would fit inside the screen almost so
i'm going to give you guys a little demo
of it so back out here it does of course
run android is 2.3 the screen is five
point three inches so pretty massive
just you can see suicide my hand this is
almost tablet size some of the other
respects included does have a 1.5
gigahertz dual-core processor does run
android 2.3 gingerbread so it's not
running you know honey comb or ice cream
sandwich just yet but yeah i know one of
the cool things is if I find the S Memo
thing it does have a stylist it's called
the S Memo so what it allows you to do
is draw and it actually has different
variations of pressure so if I want to
do it really lightly now you're a press
harder and lighter you can see here that
actually works really really nicely
impact if you can see right here there
are some different things that have been
you know drawn and I kind of give you a
little idea of you guys should do some
pretty cool stuff so obviously i'm a
noob but yeah so this one is going to be
coming to AT&amp;amp;T it's going to have the 4g
LTE network and it's gonna be pretty
cool so you guys been a quick hands-on
of the samsung galaxy note</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
