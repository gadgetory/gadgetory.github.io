the MacBook sucks because it's only got
a single port coming from basically
every other laptop ever the new MacBook
is almost laughably light on ports what
it does have is a single USB type-c
which if you're only going to put a
single port on a laptop it's kind of the
way to go it's reversible so no more
plugging things in the wrong way
supports powering other devices along
with charging the MacBook has full USB 3
speeds along with DisplayPort or HDMI if
you're using an external monitor not bad
from this tiny little port right now
accessories that use USB C aren't
exactly popular but there are a few like
this flash drive from SanDisk which
sports a USB C port on one side and a
full USB 3.0 on the other for the most
part though you're going to need
adapters like this USB C to full USB
from Apple it works fine you can even
pair it with a USB hub to load up a ton
of devices to the MacBook but it's not
the most elegant solution on the flip
side you can totally use this with your
collection of 3.5 inch floppy drives
which I mean is basically a necessity
for a computer in 2015 right
since USB type-c isn't some proprietary
Apple connector you can pick up
third-party cables like this full-sized
male USB cable from Google this lets you
do cool stuff like connect the MacBook
to a battery backup or power an external
monitor using the DisplayPort cable this
is great except when you realize that
using any of these forces you to be on
battery power since there's no way to
charge while using your only port Apple
does sell an adapter that includes a
full size USB HDMI and another USB C for
charging but will be a much nicer
solution is just including two USB ports
like Google does on the Chromebook pixel
so it's Apple completely insane for only
putting one port on the macbook no but
adding one more would be a nice
improvement you can't game on the
MacBook
on the surface this seems totally
plausible with a famous design that
measures in at just over 13 millimeters
the MacBook has more in common with a
tablet than a gaming laptop under the
hood we're looking at Intel HD 5300
graphics which while not blazing fast
might just have enough power for a bit
of gaming load up a copy of Minecraft
and the MacBook handles that no problem
which actually isn't too bad all things
considered install steam and we've got a
decent selection of games that will work
on OS 10 lighter titles like Super Meat
Boy or no problem at all and even
Counter Strike global Offensive is
totally playable 1280 by 800 well as
long as you bring along a mouse anyway a
gaming PC it definitely is it but for
light gaming it's actually kind of
usable the webcam sucks that would be a
yes so the new MacBook is rocking a 480p
webcam that is straight out of 2006 yes
it is usable on a pinch you can you do a
little bit of video chatting like on
Skype or FaceTime but it definitely
sucks the new MacBook is overpriced
starting at $1,300 there is no doubt
that the MacBook is one expensive
machine looking just at the Mac side of
things the 11 inch air comes in at $400
less but that's not an entirely fair
comparison the base air comes with four
gigs of memory and a 128 gigabyte SSD
which is totally ridiculous for a
premium laptop spec it out to eight gigs
of ram and a 256 gig drive like the
12-inch MacBook and the price dimers
narrows to $100 which is a little more
plausible if only for the better screen
for more apples to apples comparison
there's the Samsung at ebook 9 which is
rocking a similar thin design with a
12-inch high-res screen the same Core M
processor and it comes in at $100 more
than the MacBook the MacBook isn't
insanely expensive it would make a lot
more sense with a couple hundred dollar
price cut you can't do real work on the
MacBook this is another one that sounds
completely rational all it takes is one
look at the spec list to see some major
red flags a 1.1 gigahertz processor
that's captured four-and-a-half watts
with no fan to cool it for perspective
the MacBook Air has 15 watts to work
with and the 13-inch MacBook Pro has 28
watts on tap in regular use the CPU will
boost up to 2.4 gigahertz which isn't
that far
from the others we've got full Mac os10
so running heavier apps like Photoshop
is no problem while it's a little
impractical you can also edit video on
the MacBook as long as you carry around
a couple of doctors I edited this entire
video in Premiere Pro when it handled it
like a champ the export was a little bit
slow but the actual Edit itself was no
problem it does get a little warm on top
of the keyboard but it's really not much
worse than most laptops as a dedicated
video and photo editing laptop it might
not be the greatest choice in the world
but for the occasional bit of work it's
totally usable it might be tiny but the
new MacBook packs a decent punch add
another USB C port and chop the price a
bit and this could be the perfect laptop
for a lot of people</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
