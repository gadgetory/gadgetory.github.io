tutorial on how to jailbreak on iOS 4
using snow breeze before we begin
however if you have an iPhone 3GS be
sure to click on the link on the screen
right now it will lead you to a quick
video showing you how to tell if you
have a new or an old boot long umm now
guys you already know this go ahead and
just keep watching the video but if you
don't go ahead click on the description
if you have a new bootrom then you can't
do this jailbreak currently but if you
have an old boot ROM you're all set so
put the link right now right now ok guys
so before we again there's just a couple
things I'd like to mention first of all
if you have a device that is not
supported by snow breeze or whatever
reason you have a problem don't worry
there are other jail breaks on the way
that should be here for 4.0 such as
spirits should be updated some of you
guys might have heard of that also geo
hot has a new program out he made of
course black rain which is one of the
pest jailbreaking programs ever so guys
don't worry for whatever reason you
can't use snow breeze there are other
options and I of course will make full
tutorials as soon as they're come out
but guys I've had a ton of questions and
ton of people asking me to do a tutorial
on snow breeze so I'm gonna go ahead and
do it now this is not a perfect solution
or a lot of stipulations I'm go ahead
and walk you guys through and help you
make a decision whether snow gates will
work or not for you
so first thing guys is that there are
only a couple of devices that it
supports I mean supports the iPod Touch
second generation it needs to be an MB
model if you don't know how to check
what kind of model it is just go ahead
and go into settings go into general and
go into about and you should see in the
list it should say your model number
it starts with MB you're all set if it
starts with MC you cannot use snow
breeze currently if you have an iPhone
3G you can all do this jailbreak no
problem and if you have an iPhone 3GS
you will need to check if you have a new
or old boot ROM which of course I just
showed the video of so guys now that you
know all that there's one more thing and
this is might be a little bit of a
problem for some people you will need to
be on iphone OS three point one point
two and I have already jailbroken so
guys I know that's a little bit of an
issue for a lot of you so like I said
snow breeze isn't perfect but if you are
maybe like if your jailbroken on black
rain as long as it what your jailbroken
it was and
spirit you should be all set so guys now
that we have all that out of the way
let's go ahead and just get this one
started
so the first thing you will need to do
obviously is download snow breeze so
guys will go ahead and have the page up
here just hit up I hate snow comm I will
have the link in the description just
come down here and download the program
so it's not a big deal you need to do is
just download it and you'll be all set
you also will need your iOS 4 firmware
so you might have it in iTunes or you
might need to go download it doesn't
matter as long as you have it in a place
that you know where it is so guys let's
go ahead and just get this one started
ok so once you open up snow breeze it's
a really simple process I'm just go
ahead and walk you guys through it so we
go ahead and just hit OK and then we'll
go ahead and hit next
you can pick simple or expert mode I'm
gonna show you expert mode I recommend
you guys do that you don't have to but
it's it's pretty simple if you go ahead
and do this so now we're go ahead and
just find your IP SW so I have it right
on my desktop so we can just hit open
just give it a minute to process and
there we go so guys now it's just
repeating all the stuff I just told you
not a big deal just quit hit I
understand and let's continue so there
are a bunch of options I'm gonna give
you guys a brief tour don't want to talk
too long about it on there are some
different things if you have like the
new bootrom which does not currently
support unless you want to go through a
different method you need to go ahead
and do this otherwise just hit you know
background wallpaper battery percentage
native multitasking those are the main
things that I'm using right now because
my ipod is on three point one point two
it's a 2g and yeah so that obviously I
want to be able to get all the great
features in iOS 4 so guys you can go
ahead and check those boxes if you don't
want to whatever reason that's just fine
do it if you want um now you can pick
Cydia and/or rock I just stick with
Cydia guys but if you want to add rock
that's not a big deal now of course one
cool thing in snow breeze is that you
can go ahead and download custom apps
and they will already be pre-installed
on your firmware so for example you want
you want a winter board or something
what and have it already downloaded
personally I don't know it's not a
little that big of a deal you just go
ahead and download it using Cydia later
but if you guys want go ahead and use
that it's kind of nice feature next is
boot logos and yes guys it snow breeze
does support custom boot logos so if you
want you can go ahead and browse for
your own I'm just going to
go ahead and enable for both mode which
is kind of an interesting geeky sort of
thing but you guys could do whatever you
want here and there we go so now guys
all we have to do is hit build IPSW and
next so guys this will take a few
minutes so go ahead and chill out let it
roll through and I'll be right back as
soon as it's done okay guys so now this
next step is really pretty simple we're
going to be putting it not into DFU mode
but into recovery mode so guys this is
pretty simple I'm actually not doing it
right
you really have to take off your case if
you have any kind case on it because you
will need to be hold the home and the
power buttons for roughly 30 seconds or
so but yeah just want just a little tip
guys like this for example this case is
kind of hard to hold it but you know
whatever as long as you can hold it down
for you know 30 seconds whatever without
dropping it so first thing guys just go
ahead what with your device plugged in
hold the power button slide the power
off make sure it's totally off you don't
have to do this guys but that's speed up
considerably so give it just a minute
and there we go okay guys so now it's
really simple with it plugged in hold
the home and power buttons for a little
bit so just hold it mm-hmm so we're just
gonna hold it for too high just gonna
hold it'll start to boot and they'll
kind of shut off that's normal and
they'll start to do one more time and
then it will display a connect to itunes
and just one second so yeah there we go
so the hold it for just one more second
and okay so guys now that is in recovery
mode so don't really touch it just leave
it plugged in and now we're ready to go
ahead and restore the custom firmware on
to our our iPod or iPhone ok guys so as
soon as you go ahead and fire up itunes
this message should pop up and say it's
detected in recovery mode so just hit
click okay I'm ready to go so guys we
need to just go ahead and restore the
firmware so guys if you've never done
this before it's pretty simple I'm you
have a Mac need to hold the option key
and then click restore
if you're on Windows obviously though
because that's what snow breeze is going
to work on we go ahead and do shifting
restores a little hold shift and click
restore so there we go guys and we just
need to come to our desktop and pick out
the snow breeze IPSW so go ahead hit
open and now the guys we have to wait a
little bit longer so again go chill out
you know go do something itunes should
go ahead
look at this IP SW that starts loading
on your iPod Touch or iPhone it yeah
it'll take just a little bit saw come
back when it's done okay guys so I
should just finish packing up my stuff
so it's going to go up and so actually
guys as you can see here and zoom in
just a little more um actually something
funny happened iTunes actually
remembered my my homescreen wallpaper
even though it was jailbroken so I'm not
like sure what's up with that but I'm
not complaining
even put Cydia back down on my dog but
as you can see guys got all my stuff
that was backed up but yeah obviously
that's idiot and go ahead and just open
up settings just show you guys anata no
treaty guys trust me but when did
general about you guys as you can see
right here 4.0 and i do of course have
an mb model so and ignore the spirit
3.1.3 that's just what my backup was
named j guys so guys it's really simple
um yeah i know it's not the it's not
like you just plug it in and you know
run it like spirit or black rain but
still guys hopefully this helps you out
anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
