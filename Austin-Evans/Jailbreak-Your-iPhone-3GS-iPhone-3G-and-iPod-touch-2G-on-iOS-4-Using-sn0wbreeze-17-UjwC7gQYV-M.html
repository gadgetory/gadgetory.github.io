tutorial on how to jailbreak on iOS for
using snowbreeze before we begin however
if you have an iphone 3gs be sure to
click on the link on the screen right
now it will lead you to a quick video
showing you how to tell if you have a
new or an old bootrom um now guys you're
already know this go ahead and just keep
watching the video but if you don't go
ahead click on the description if you
have a new bootrom then you can't do
this jailbreak currently but if you have
an old boot rom you're all set so put
the link right now right now ok guys so
before we again there's just a couple
things I'd like to mention first of all
if you have a device that is not
supported by snowbreeze or whatever
reason you have a problem don't worry
there are other jailbreaks on the way it
should be here for four point oh such as
spirit should be updated some of you
guys might have heard of that also geo
hot has a new program al he made of
course black rain which is one of the
pests jailbreaking programs ever so guys
don't worry for the reason you can't use
snowbreeze there are other options and I
of course will make full tutorials as
soon as they're come out but guys I've
had a ton of questions and ton of people
asking me to do a tutorial on snowbreeze
so I'm gonna go ahead and do it now this
is not a perfect solution or a lot of
stipulations I'm go ahead and walk you
guys through and help you make a
decision whether snowberries will work
or not for you so first thing guys is
that there are only a couple of devices
that it supports I mean supports the
ipod touch 2nd generation it needs to be
an mb model if you don't know how to
check what kind of model it is just go
ahead and go into settings go into
general and go into about and you should
see in the list it should say your model
number it starts with mb you're all set
if it starts with MC you cannot use
snowbreeze currently if you have an
iphone 3g you cannot do this jailbreak
no problem and if you have an iphone 3gs
you will need to check if you have a new
or old bootrom which of course i just
showed the video of so guys now that you
know all that there's one more thing and
this is might be a little bit of a
problem for some people you will need to
be on iphone OS 3.1 point2 and i have
already jailbroken so guys i know that's
a little bit of an issue for a lot of
you so like I said snowbreeze isn't
perfect but if you are maybe like if you
were jailbroken on black rain as long as
it what your jailbroken it wasn't on
spirit you should be all set
so guys now that we have all that out of
the way let's go ahead and just get this
one started so the first thing you will
need to do obviously is download
snowbreeze so guys will go ahead and
have the page up here just hit up I hate
snow com I will have the link in the
description just come down here and
download the program so it's not a big
deal you need to do is just download it
and you'll be all set you also will need
your iOS four firmware so you might have
it in iTunes so you might need to go
download it doesn't matter as long as
you have it in a place to know where it
is so guys let's go ahead and just get
this one started okay so once you open
snowbreeze it's a really simple process
i'm just go ahead and walk you guys
through it so we go ahead and just hit
okay and then we go ahead and hit next
you can pick simple or expert mode i'm
going to show you expert mode i
recommend you guys do that you don't
have to but it's pretty simple if you go
ahead and do this so now we're going to
just find your ipsw so I have it right
on my desktop so let me just hit open
just give it a minute to process and
there we go so guys now it's just
repeating all the stuff I just told you
not a big deal just quit hit I
understand and let's continue so there
are a bunch of options i'm going to give
you guys a brief tour don't want to talk
too long about it on there are some
different things if you have like the
new bootrom which does not currently
support unless you want to go through a
different method you need to go ahead
and do this otherwise just hit you know
background wallpaper battery percentage
native multitasking those are the main
things that i'm using right now because
my ipod is on 3.1 point2 it's a2g and
yeah so obviously i want to be able to
get all the great features in iOS four
so guys you can go ahead and check those
boxes if you don't want to whatever
reason that's just fine do it if you
want um now you can pick cydia and or
rock I just stick with Cydia guys but if
you want to add Rob that's not a big
deal now of course one cool thing in
snowbreeze is that you can go ahead and
download custom apps and they will
already be pre-installed on your
firmware so for example you want you
want a winter board or something you
wouldn't have it already downloaded
personally I don't know it's not a
little that big of a deal you can just
go ahead and download it using Cydia
later but if you guys want to go ahead
and use that it's kind of nice feature
next is boot logos and yes guys
snowbreeze does support custom boot
logos so if you want you can go ahead
and browse for your own I'm just going
to go ahead and enable for both mode
which is kind of an
justing geeky sort of thing but you guys
do whatever you want here and there we
go so now guys all we have to do is hit
build ipsw and next so guys this will
take a few minutes so go ahead and chill
out let it roll through and I'll be
right back as soon as it's done hey guys
so now this next step is really pretty
simple we're going to be putting it not
into dfu mode but into recovery mode so
guys this is pretty simple I'm actually
not doing it right on you really ought
to take off your case if you have any
kind case on it because you will need to
behold the home and the power buttons
for roughly 30 seconds or so um but yeah
it just want just a little tip guys like
for example this case is kind of hard to
hold it but you know whatever as long as
you can hold it down for you know 30
seconds whatever without dropping it so
first thing guys just go ahead what with
your device plugged in hold the power
button slide to power off make sure it's
totally off you don't have to do this
guy's but that speed at considerably so
give it just a minute and there we go ok
guys so now it's real simple with it
plugged in hold the home and power
buttons for a little bit so just hold it
mm-hmm so we're just going to hold it
for a manager to high so you guys just
got to hold the it'll start to boot and
they'll cut off so that's normal and
they'll start to be one more time and
then it will display a connect to itunes
and just one second so yeah there we go
so hold it for just one more second and
okay so guys now it is in recovery mode
so don't really touch it just leave it
plugged in and now we're ready to go
ahead and restore the custom firmware
onto our our iPod or iPhone ok guys so
as soon as you go ahead and fire up
iTunes this message should pop up and
say it's detected in recovery mode so
just get click ok and we're ready to go
so guys we need to just go ahead and
restore the firmware so guys if you've
never done this before it's pretty
simple I'm you have a Mac need to hold
the option key and then click restore if
you're on Windows obviously though
because that's what snowbreeze is going
to work on we go ahead and do shift and
restores will hold shift and click
restore so there we go guys and we just
need to come to our desktop and pick out
the snowbreeze ipsw squaring it open and
now the guys we have to wait a little
bit longer so again go chill out and you
know go do something itunes should go
ahead take a look at this ipsw that
starts loading on your I've
ha touch or iphone it yeah it will take
just a little bit saw come back when
it's done okay guys so I shins just
finished backing up my stuff so go ahead
and take a look and so actually guys as
you can see here and it's a min just a
little more um actually something funny
happened itunes actually remembered my
my home screen wallpaper even though it
was jailbroken so I'm not like sure
what's up with that but I'm not
complaining even put cydia back down on
my dog but as you can see you guys got
all my stuff that was backed up but yeah
obviously had city and go ahead and just
open up settings just show you guys not
now Trudy jazz trust me but when to
general about you guys as you can see
right here four point oh and I do of
course have an mb model so and ignore
the spirit three point one point three
that's just what my backup was named Jay
you guys so guys it's really simple um
yeah I know it's not the it's not like
you just plug it in and you know run it
like spirit or black rain but still guys
hopefully this helps you out anyway guys
