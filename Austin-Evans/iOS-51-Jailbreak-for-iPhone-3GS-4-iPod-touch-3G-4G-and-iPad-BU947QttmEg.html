here with the tutorial showing you how
you can jailbreak your iPhone iPod Touch
your iPad on the latest ios 5.1 firmware
now before we begin there definitely
some things I do want to mention so the
first thing is this is not a jailbreak
for all devices so what this does
support is the iPhone 3GS the iPhone 4
the iPod Touch 3rd generation the iPod
Touch 4th generation as well as the iPad
1 this does not support the iPad 2 the
iPhone 4s or the third generation iPad
in addition this is a tethered jailbreak
so what this means is that anytime you
need to reboot your device you will need
to rerun read snow however there is one
way to make this a little easier and
I'll show you guys at the end of the
video but definitely keep in mind that
it can be a little bit annoying and
finally I just want to give you guys a
warning if you're not already on iOS 5.1
there is really no major reason to
upgrade so like I said of course this
jailbreak will work on 5.1 but
especially if you have a newer device or
it just in general there's not really a
whole lot new on 5.1 so if you're
considering updating I really wouldn't
but if you're already on iOS 5.1 and you
want to jailbreak this is the way to go
once you're ready to begin all you do is
download read snow and I'll have a link
in the description it is available for
both Windows as well as Mac although if
you are using a Windows computer you
will need to run it as an administrator
but beyond that all other steps are
going to be identical so go ahead and
open it up here and then you should see
little information about it but you know
nothing all that exciting the most
important thing is that this step you
need to go ahead and plug your device in
so I'm using an iPod Touch 4th
generation on iOS 5.1 but of course you
know as long as you have any of the
supported devices that all works the
exact same way let's go ahead an plug it
in via USB to your Mac or PC and you can
set off to the side for a second and
make sure red snow does support it so
you can see here it says connected iPod
Touch 4th generation on 5.1 so once you
ready to begin go ahead click jailbreak
and they'll give us a little information
you can or the 4s and iPad 2 all you to
do is plug it of course with your device
plugged in you need to go ahead and shut
it off so this is very simple just need
to go ahead and hold the power button
for a minute and as soon as you see
slide to power off go ahead and slide it
and this is that pinwheel disappears
we're going to get to go here now at
this point we're going to be entering
DFU mode now if you guys have ever
jailbroken before and more than likely
you've done this who ever if you haven't
it's very simple so we do device powered
off and plugged into the computer go
ahead and click Next now at this point
we need to pull the power button for
three seconds and of course it's
counting us down
and then hold the power as well as the
home buttons for 10 seconds make sure I
can get on camera here all right so just
go ahead and continue holding it and of
course it counts you down so okay so now
we're going to release the power button
and just continue holding the home
button it says for 15 seconds but
usually it'll be done in about 5 10
seconds something like that so there we
go so this point we can go ahead and set
our device down and continue holding it
but you can let go of all the buttons
once your device has been processed
you're going to have a couple of options
and the most important thing is to make
sure that install Cydia is checked city
is basically the jailbreak app store so
that's where you get your themes your
tweets your mods all that kind of fun
stuff go beyond that you're gonna have a
couple of extra options very very
optional so you can install custom
bundle we don't know what that is feel
free to ignore it
you can enable battery percentage if you
have an iPod Touch I definitely do this
allows you to you know see the exact
battery percentage you've got you can
also enable multitask gestures if you
like don't you down with that go ahead
and click Next so at this point all you
need to do is give your device a few
minutes you'll see it some lines of code
and it'll take a few minutes to go
through and process all the jailbreak
data but once it's done you'll be good
to go all right so once your device is
rebooted weten slide to unlock and
scroll over to your last page you should
now see Cydia folder if you try to open
it it won't do anything so we do have
one more step to do so what instead our
device off to the side one more time
what you need to do is come over to red
snow click on extras and then go ahead
and click just boot tethered right now
now we're going to the exact same thing
we're going to enter DFU mode in or
reboot so as soon as you do that I'll be
right back alright so once it's done
reboot in for the second time you're
good to go so just go ahead and slide
over to the last page and you should now
see city installed and at this point
Alaska who you are Glen pig developer
although it really doesn't matter all
that much and it will load for the first
time congratulations you're officially
Joe Rokan now at this point you can
simply stop watching the video and start
using your device just as you would like
however there is one more optional step
that I do recommend so like I said this
is a tethered jailbreak which means that
every time you reboot your device you've
got to be able to plug it into a
computer otherwise it will not be
functional at all until you do so
however there isn't a little thing that
you can install called some my tablet
which allows you to use most of your
normal apps
nothing jailbroken but you can still you
know use it as a phone and different
things like that it's not going to be
just a brick until you get to a computer
so to do this go ahead and go over to
the manage tab in Cydia click on sources
edit and then add I want you to add this
source the BigBoss dot org slash the my
tether
once you got that added just go ahead
and hit the Add button once the new repo
has been added come up to the top and
then type in semi tether so sum on each
other you should see it right here so go
ahead and tap on it and once it loads up
click install once you have installed
one tap restart springboard so now you
officially have a semi tethered
jailbreak so you can't still get at some
things even after you need to reboot
your device anyway guys bad any
questions or problems or anything that
feel free to leave them in the comments
