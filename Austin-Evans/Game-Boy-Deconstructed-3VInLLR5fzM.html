Game Boy is probably the most important
handheld console of all time but what I
want to know is what happens when you
deconstruct it all right so it is time
as I do a few more claps for the first
episode of deconstructed and what better
way to start then with the original
Nintendo Gameboy unlike some of the
other things I may be taking apart soon
this is pretty simple just a single
Phillips screwdriver
so the Gameboy used for double-a
batteries which seems kind of crazy
today but some of those old consoles had
crazy terrible battery life you can get
like six or eight double a's and would
last you like two or three hours so
we've got six screws here so we have
four that are exposed and we have two
underneath the battery door like I said
I've actually never opened a gameboy
I've only gained boys since I was six I
mean this console is 25 years old no
what's even older than that
it's 27 years old what was your first
Gameboy of you name would cover there
you go my very first Gameboy I actually
end up saving money which is really hard
when you're 6 years old
so I end up having to say my birthday
money I'd saved allowance for a few
months and I finally had enough to buy
myself a gameboy color but I didn't have
myself enough money to buy an actual
Gameboy
so I remember I still feel bad about
this this day I went to my grandma and I
kind of said oh it's been so hard to be
able to save so much money to be able to
get this Gameboy but I just don't have
enough for a game she handed me $30 to
the next day went and bought pokemon red
still feel bad about that
but you know getting what you got to do
all right number five and so we can get
this oh oh here we go
okay well maybe not the moment of truth
because there's still stuff holding it
together but like it's kind of a part
we've got the display and the speaker
all right so the Gameboy is apart so
we've got actually a fair bit in the
front half so basically this is where
the screen is we've got the main buttons
we've got the contrasts which we've also
got the speaker which is actually pretty
big let's see we can kind of ease this
out up there's more screws of course
there are it's crazy how different
electronics are these days I mean today
this would all be glued into place do be
like maybe a screw or two
just remove and destroy all kinds of
stuff I mean I destroy depends on if
you're me or not I know it's just it's
just something kind of like therapeutic
about it
it's like you spend so much time with
technology but it's nice to be able to
actually take a look and see what
actually makes it work well I've got to
say there are a lot of scripts in here
like every time I think all about
dynasty like five more screws all right
the board is free let's see what we get
all right Wow
that is cool so basically the screen is
kind of come it's all built into one
board we've got all the buttons which
actually come out so there's this little
silicon piece where the buttons a lot
actually it feels like a button I never
actually realized this there's no spring
there's nothing literally the entire
action of what you feel when you press a
gameboy button is just the rubber just
kind of bouncing a little bit so if you
look at the actual circuit board you can
see that all it's doing is making
contact right here you guys tell them
having fun right now so there's a little
daughter board here for the headphone
jack mmm I could probably detach that
but I think it's probably easier to just
unscrew it so one of the things is with
the original Gameboy one of the big
things they touted was it had stereo
sounds extra C dot matrix with stereo
sound which is funny because it actually
had a single speaker so if you ever play
like some of the older gameboy games
some of them would have an option strong
stereo sound but you only actually
really realize that we had headphones
plugged in and that's the rest of it so
these this is actually the guts of the
Gameboy so on this side we can see where
the display connects we also got the
daughter board we've got some of the
connectors if I flip it over this is the
heart of the Gameboy Wow so it's four
point one nine four 304 megahertz
I like how they had to be very specific
we've also got 64 kilobytes of RAM it's
crazy to think what was on these like I
know these Game Boy cartridges they were
so tiny look at the amount of data and
stuff that they actually were able to
pack into such a small cartridge it's
crazy
and speaking of the cartridge we
actually can see this is where it plugs
in so
drop it in right here there we go so
when you think about the boards actually
fairly compact so we've got quite a bit
of stuff we've got the link cable port
we've also got the switch here that's
satisfying
I always appreciate being able to open
up electronics and really kind of
understand what's inside of them and the
Game Boy is it's something special like
it's simple there's not a lot here it's
not even something like literally one
small Phillips screwdriver and you're
through it in like 10 minutes or so but
it's it's a really special thing to be
able to kind of appreciate all the
engineering and all the ingenuity that
went into it especially back you know
over 20 years ago so that's it for this
episode of deconstructed let me know
what you guys think in the comments
below and if you guys want to see me do
more stuff give me your suggestions
whether it's new stuff old stuff
whatever it is let me know and yeah I'm
gonna put this back together and place a
pokemon red see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
