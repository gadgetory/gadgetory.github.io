here with a video showing what's on my
iPhone 4s while there isn't a jailbreak
for the 4s yet I still got some cool
things so let's jump right on n I like
to keep all my apps on one page to
reduce clutter but they help us in
folders it might not be the most elegant
looking way to do it but it works for me
probably my favorite iOS game I've
played this year is jetpack joyride in
this simple side scroller you fly on
your jetpack and see how far you can
make it without dying I also have
GarageBand loaded up I'm pretty awful
with it but when I have some time to
burn I like to pull it out and pretend
I'm dead mouse for a little while to
pass the time moving on I have a
flashlight app if you have an iPhone 4
or 4s I highly recommend picking up one
of these whether for your paid the flash
on the iPhone isn't half bad for using
as a light and a pinch I also have some
icon settings toggles inside a folder
icon settings are a great way to easily
get to system settings like Wi-Fi and
brightness without jailbreaking and if
you want to see how to install them I'll
have a link in the description I also
have a folder with all my favorite games
I won't go into detail on them all but
there are some great ones including me
for Speed hot pursuit real racing 2 e
boys fixed pics gal con and tiny wings
lastly there's filmic Pro which I found
through Matt's Macintosh it's excellent
for taking video with the iPhone 4s when
you really want to turn out the best it
can be and works well alongside iMovie
to edit on the go before I get the
question asked a million times I'll have
a link to my background in the
description of this video so there you
have it everything that's on my iPhone
4s if you enjoyed this video definitely
should leave it a thumbs up and if
