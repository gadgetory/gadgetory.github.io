totally just stepped on this Thunderbolt
cable I still plugged in and slightly
bent it that's okay
you want to fake the video hey guys saw
sting thin and light laptops like this
Dell X just thirteen are great but the
graphics are never going to be the
strong suit that's where this comes in
this is the razor core X and it is the
latest external GPU enclosure from Razer
now external graphics are nothing new I
recently did a video on an Alienware
laptop from 2014 that did have external
graphics as an option and more recently
we did a little gaming on a Mac
comparison where we use the gigabyte
gaming box to be able to actually play
decent games over a Thunderbolt 3
interface on a macbook the only issue is
that doing external graphics over
Thunderbolt 3 can get pricey very very
quickly so first of all you're going to
need a computer with a Thunderbolt 3
port ideally you're going to have one
that does have a full four lanes of PCIe
something that's not always going to be
advertised particularly well by the
manufacturer next you're going to need
an enclosure such as the core X although
there are of course other options but
one of the most expensive parts is
always going to be your GPU put this all
together and well it could be a nice
setup it can get really expensive very
quickly Neuticles to the original razor
core which is still going to be on sale
by the way you're going to be getting a
lot of extra features including USB
ports Ethernet as well as a second
Thunderbolt out but the issue is price
500 ollars
this can be as expensive as a lot of
really high-end GPUs that you would
normally pick up which is where the
Razer cortex comes in well you're going
to be losing most of those features most
importantly you can still fit a full
sized graphics card inside and it's
going to be a full two hundred dollars
less put the 4x side by side with the
original razor core as well as the tiny
little gigabyte gaming box and you'll
see that it is uh well it's a little bit
large however that is going to be for a
reason it is a very generic looking
black box so it is still going to be
made out of aluminum but you're not
going to have any of the bells and
whistles of the core including stuff
like chroma RGB lighting take a look
around back and you'll see it's about as
simple as it gets so you're going to
find a single Thunderbolt 3 port as well
as your power connector
whoever use the coolest mechanism which
is about as easy as it gets to open up
you'll see why this guy is so big it
does not support a full triple slot
graphics card and that's not going to be
super common and however some cards
especially the higher-end one
with giant coolers we'll need a little
bit of extra space and the corex does
provide you're also going to find the
upgraded power supply so we now have a
600 watt unit as opposed to the 500 watt
in the previous core and it's also not
going to be a full ATX power supply
that's going to be mostly useful if you
ever want to upgrade it in the future
although with 600 watts of capacity that
means that the graphics card itself is
going to be able to get 500 watts and
there's going to be a full hundred watts
available for USBC power delivery to
your laptop so it should be good enough
for a while but there is that
flexibility as well as you're also going
to find a 120 millimeter fan for cooling
installing a graphics card is about as
simple as it gets
so what you do is open up your enclosure
and just drop it right into place just
like you would with a standard desktop
and it should clip end so for power you
do have a pair of six plus two pin
connectors the cable management out of
the box is a little bit tight so I had
to undo that just to get a little bit
more slack but you just have to plug
these guys in and then if I can actually
get it into place uh hmm use a little
screw to make sure the whole thing
doesn't come flying out of the slot then
all you do is take the entire assembly
line up into the enclosure slide it into
place pop the handle and you're gonna be
good for some external graphics action
now I am using Vegas 64 for this demo
but you can use the vast majority of
current AMD and NVIDIA graphics cards
Meucci keep in mind that you're going to
be using this on Mac which is now
supported you are going to be needing to
use an AMD graphics card if you want
official support nvidia cards will work
but it worked choirs just a little bit
more work from you it's pretty
straightforward just take the fender
ball three cable and plug it into your
laptop and then you will want to use an
external monitor so I'm just gonna hook
up the DisplayPort cable to the back of
our graphics card you actually don't
have to do this but it will give you
much better gaming performance when
you're not having to fight between the
graphics card sending video back and
forth to the internal laptop display
something like this going out over
DisplayPort is going to give you much
better performance but with that we have
our full Thunderbolt 3 setup ready to
game here when it comes to gaming of
course the graphics card and the actual
CPU is inside your laptop is going to
make a huge difference so something like
Vegas 64 is honestly a little bit
overkill but we are still going to see a
huge huge performance gain over playing
on integrated graphics so using the
Vegas 64 as well as the core i7 8550 you
that's going to be inside this guy we're
getting on full epic settings of 1080
around 70 to 80 frames per second so
you're always going to be giving up some
performance when you're using
Thunderbolt 3 as opposed to an actual
dedicated solution but if you put it
side-by-side with something like
integrated graphics as both - like 720p
on like low settings 30 frames this at
full epic settings is just a totally
different looking game although one of
the slight downsides to most edible
enclosures is that the Thunderbolt 3
cables have to be fairly small which
means that I'm getting like cooked right
now by the graphics card but I guess I
could just do that so again you will
definitely want to use an external
display so right now we're actually
recording it using an HDMI capture card
so we're not affecting the performance
but this is gonna be super playable so
frame rates jumping around a little bit
that is generally in the 70 to 80 frames
per second range know why I didn't have
anything yet why let's try fortnight
round 2 which of course is the game that
I'm playing is that somehow you're
watching this video without knowing that
game fortnight exists no because of
course you do have to have a fundable 3
port it does mean the genetics Act we're
going to be using this with a super
old-school laptop but I actually would
recommend either an eighth gen Core i5
or i7 now the previous dual cores will
be fine but when you have a full
quad-core CPU it actually does make a
pretty big difference to gaming
performance next up we have pub G this
is another game there's absolutely no
problem to run with something as
high-end as a Vegas 64 card at 1080p
with everything maxed out we're
averaging in the 70 to 80 frames per
second range it's really cool when you
consider that with a single Thunderbolt
3 port we're turning a thin and light
ultrabook into a proper gaming PC now
sure you're gonna need some other stuff
like a monitor and a mouse although
technically but it makes you came a lot
better but it's so cool people have a
small thin and light laptop that you can
carry around all day have no problems
with and then when you get home just to
hook it up and turn it into a full
dedicated gaming PC and of course the
reason core is also going to be
supported on Mac OS so support is a
little bit odd right now mostly because
a lot of games aren't going to be
particularly well optimised on the Mac
so we tried fortnight it didn't really
want to load
yeah however rocket League is fearing a
bit better so on full maxed out settings
were somewhere around 70 frames per
second but we're doing this weird text
thing you can game on the Mac but not
super well although you won't know more
about that we did an entire video on why
gaming on a Mac is a questionable idea
but I mean the Razer core does work and
it's mostly just on software to actually
support it if $300 the raise of cortex
actually is going to be pretty
reasonably priced as far as these
Thunderbolt 3 enclosures go I guess you
do need a little bit of extra hardware
but if you do have a Thunderbolt 3
equipped Mac or especially an ultrabook
it's a great way of turning it into a
pretty decent gaming laptop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
