the chance to partner with Microsoft to
create a series on the new services so
let's take a look it's all about
spending a day in the lives of some
really talented people and letting them
experience the service pro for on
surface book to see what they can do
with it I got to take photos with Rob
Evora get into design with Justina
Blakeney playing music with Kyle Landry
and take a look behind the scenes with
corridor digital so let's take a look at
what the new surfaces are all about
starting out we've got the new surface
book crack open the box and you'll find
the laptop itself the included surface
pen and the power adapter this is a
different sort of laptop than you're
probably used to with one button you can
detach the screen and use it as a tablet
it's surprisingly light in the hand with
an awesome 3000 by 2000 resolution
display and once you're done you can
drop it right back on the keyboard it
has a cool hinge to keep everything
balanced and it even works if you attach
it backwards inside the base is a
traditional keyboard and trackpad a pair
of USB 3.0 ports and an SD card reader
the magnetic charging port along with
mini DisplayPort what's cool is that not
only does the keyboard base have an
extra battery but it also houses an
optional NVIDIA GPU when it's attached
the surface book can automatically
switch between integrated and dedicated
graphics depending on what you're doing
it's enough for more casual games like
rocket League as well as for creative
apps like photo and video editing the
pin is cool as well it's pressure
sensitive with low latency which is nice
for note-taking or sketching and you can
even flip it around and use it like an
eraser
next up we have the surface pro for the
unboxing is pretty straightforward
you get the surface pro the surface pin
which is a nice addition a bit of
paperwork and the power adapter you'll
find the same awesome adjustable
kickstand from the pro 3 and the
magnesium body the surface pin
magnetically attaches to the side for
easy storage and you'll find a full
sized USB mini DisplayPort along with
that magnetic charging port you can also
pick up the new type cover it does a ton
to make the service more productive you
get an impressively solid backlit
keyboard with a bigger more usable
trackpad the cover attaches with magnets
to help protect the screen and it folds
out just like a laptop internally you
can get it with everything from a core
m2 Core i7
4 to 16 gigs of RAM and a 128 gigabyte
to one terabyte SSD it also has a great
twelve point three inch display and you
can login with Windows hello
using the front-facing camera which is
not only accurate but impressively fast
there's really no doubt the service pro
is a solid package so what do you guys
think about the new surfaces
let me know in the comments below and
definitely be sure to go check out the
videos I did over on the surface channel
in the link in the description anyway
guys thank you so much for watching and
I will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
