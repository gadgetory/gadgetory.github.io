here's the video going over what should
be a pretty simple question can you
actually game on a Mac if you ever read
the comments you'll realize that if you
ever mention the words gaming and Mac in
the same sense people love to explain
why that's a terrible idea but surely it
can't be that bad the first thing is
actually finding games that work on OS
10 take a look in the Mac App Store and
you'll find a few games including hitman
and sieve five as well as quite a few
classic titles like GTA san andreas and
rollercoaster tycoon but not a huge
variety of Triple A games download open
EMU and you'll find support for quite a
few emulators including Gameboy Genesis
and Super Nintendo but still nothing all
that new jump into origin from Mac and
you'll find SimCity in The Sims 3 along
with a few older games like Batman but
you won't find any battlefield or crisis
here on the other hand when I installed
steam I was actually surprised right out
of the box over half my Steam library
shows up just fine on OS 10 including
some big-name titles like BioShock
Infinite Metro last light and tomb
raider emitted Lee a lot of the games
are anti titles but there's still a
pretty reasonable selection including
basically all valve games to make things
at least somewhat fair I tested with a
late 2013 Mac Pro now all this is by no
means a gaming PC as it's really made
for things like photo and video editing
however it is rocking some pretty decent
specs inside we're looking at a 6 core
Intel Xeon CPU clocked at 3.5 gigahertz
dual AMD FirePro d500 graphics cards 32
gigabytes of RAM and a 256 gigabyte SSD
compare this to a gaming PC and you'd be
looking at something like a core i7 49
30 K along the 2 Radeon r9 280 cards
which would be slightly faster but also
lose out on the workstation features for
the first game we have the Walking Dead
Season 2 while this is hardly an
incredibly demanded game when you crank
up the settings and play it at 4k it
actually looks pretty nice playing
through the latest episode which I
actually won't show to not spoil things
if you guys haven't played it yet I
didn't have any issues at all everything
played perfectly smoothly just as if I
was playing on Windows moving up to
something
just a little more demanding we have
Metro last light I've already taken a
look at this port running on steamos and
it's very similar on Mac you've got the
entire game in DLC however the quality
settings are pared down to an incredibly
simple slider which just dries the
nerded me crazy
gameplay is fine although the way os10
handles mouse acceleration does take a
little getting used to and even with the
graphics mech style it's still not quite
on par with a gaming PC if you take off
your PC master-race hat though it is
completely playable next we have
BioShock Infinite which seems to be a
better port overall basically all of the
settings are intact allowing you to fine
tune the graphics and once you turn on
vsync you will be hard-pressed to notice
a major difference between playing on a
Mac or PC it certainly doesn't hurt that
infinite is a great looking game
regardless of platform even all the way
back to the last generation consoles
probably the most impressive game I've
tried on Mac is Tomb Raider as a fully
functioning port you also get access to
all the settings and the graphics look
great running right up against the 60
frames per second vsync limit which
really helps with a screen tearing that
you'll find otherwise
unlike some DirectX games that have been
ported to OpenGL Tomb Raider hasn't lost
much visual quality with plenty of
detail and correct textures and effects
now of course there's nothing stopping
you from installing Windows via bootcamp
which will immediately get you access to
way more games however forget to say I'm
impressed with how many games actually
work pretty well running natively in OS
10 don't get me wrong though a mac pro
is completely insane as a gaming PC is
you can build something better for much
less if that's all you want to do with
it if you plan on getting a Mac and just
want to do a little gaming with it
though I think it's totally possible so
what do you guys think about gaming on a
Mac let me know in the comments below

if you're new to the channel anyway guys
thank you so much for watching I will
catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
