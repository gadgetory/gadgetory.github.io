unveiled their brand-new eReader the
second generation Nook replacing the
standard L going model the new note
features a more squared off design that
traced the previous dual screen layout
for a single iing touchscreen it has
some impressive specs as well including
up to two months of battery life
dimensions of five inches by six and a
half inches and only a single button on
the device one of the big features they
are pushing with the new Nook is the
simplicity in use it features a six inch
e-ink pearl display just like the Kindle
3 they'll order without a physical
keyboard which allows you to get the
same screen real estate in a much
smaller package all navigation is done
by way of the touch screen including an
on-screen keyboard it will of course
have full access to the nut bookstore
and features two new bytes of on-board
storage that can be expanded out to 32
gigabytes the VI micro SD card it is
powered by an 800 megahertz TI OMAP 3
processor and runs Android 2.1 which you
mean a very speedy experience in using
the nook matching the Kindle 3 you will
be able to pick up the Wi-Fi nook for
$139 on june 10th or you can pre-order
it starting today I have to say the new
Nook looks really quite good with a much
smaller and sleeker design and install
it price tag I can see it winning over a
lot of people who aren't sold on tablets

generation up be sure to let me know in
