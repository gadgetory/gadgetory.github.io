might not officially start for a few
more days but the new tech products are
out in full force from the newest and
smartphones to processors to laptops and
literally everything in between CES
always brings great announcements and
this year has been no exception let's
get this one started
one look in spring designs new ereader
the Alex and you'll swear it's a clone
of the Barnes &amp;amp; Noble no that's a bit of
a sore subject it seems both companies
think and the other copy the idea from
each other
but regardless the alex is one slick
piece of hardware it sports a nicely
sized color touchscreen below the
standard e-ink display but instead of
using a fully skinned an unrecognizable
operating system you'll have no problem
figuring out that the Alex runs Android
as the UI looks practically unchanged
from any normal Android phone seeing as
it runs a very close to stock version of
Android that means it has many features
that you would expect on a smart phone
such as a browser email client music app
and of course ebooks
the Alex seems to leverage the fact that
it has to screams much better than on
the nookie instead of walling content
into one screen or the other it's fairly
open for example you can be reading a
web page on the bottom color touchscreen
and have a refresh after a short pause
on the e-ink display another major
problem of the Nook speed doesn't seem
to be an issue in the Alex it zips
between pages with decent speed although
of course nothing compared to a powerful
smartphone by literally it's not bad the
e-reader is also very thin which is
always good the Alex looks like a
fantastic reader at first glance but
there are still details that need to be
worked out will come with free 3G like
that Kindle and the Nook what kind of
battery life will get and most
importantly how much will it cost are
questions that will be answered before
too long
assuming no bad surprises are on the way
the Alex will god it could be the next
big new eater
one of the most exciting things to come
out of CES so far is lenovo's new laptop
prototype the IdeaPad u1 at first glance
it looks like a standard small laptop or
even netbook with average specs that
include an 11 inch display and a low
powered Core 2 Duo processor but then
comes the twist the screen detaches and
morphs into a full touchscreen tablet
you aren't right simply unclip the
screen from the laptop and the tablet
portion of the computer will kick in
inside the screen is a 1 gigahertz
Snapdragon processor that runs a custom
tablet version of Linux no complicated
switching process is necessary either
just pull the screen loose and the
laptop portion goes to sleep and the
tablet turns on one of the best parts is
that if you're browsing the web the
tablet will jump straight to whatever
website you were looking at
as you would expect considering that the
screen conceals the guts of a computer
it does add a bit of heft to the laptop
considering that you have a full tablet
built-in it's certainly not a bad
trade-off the tablet utilizes a full
multi-touch screen that while a bit
finicky right now gives you access to
several panels for accessing different
functions for example there's already a
built-in Gmail application along with
one for YouTube as well as Facebook
what's more likely on the way by the
time the idea of head launches there are
quite a few questions at this point but
one of the most important ones price
looks to be one of the computer
strongest points lenovo plans to sell
the idea that you one will right around
$1,000 which looks great considering
that the Apple tablet is expected to go
for upwards of seven to eight hundred
dollars and obviously won't come bundled
for the MacBook in the deal the computer
is planned to be on sale by June by
which time the kinks should be worked
out personally I think this is a
fantastic solution to the problem of
tablet computing but we'll see once they
get it in a bit more sorted before
for now though it looks like the
surprise hit at CES 2010 and that's it
