here at the gaming PC bill for $750 this
is a very powerful system that's really
focused on giving you some really good
1080p gaming performance to give you an
example I loaded up a few graphically
intensive games such as battlefield 3
which is $750 PC was easily able to run
even on full Ultra settings next up we
have Far Cry 3 which is still a
fantastic looking game so for this one I
did have to turn the anti-aliasing down
just a bit but beyond that all settings
are set to ultra and it still looks
absolutely awesome moving on we have
Crysis 3 which in my opinion is one of
the best-looking PC games yet so for
this one we were able to run on high
settings with a bit of anti-aliasing
definitely not totally maxed out however
even on high this game looks absolutely
phenomenal last but not least we have
BioShock Infinite now this isn't an
incredibly demanding game however the
art style the colors everything
absolutely looks awesome and with this
one we are able to run it completely
maxed out with Ultra settings at 1080p
to kick the build off we're going to be
using an Intel Core i5 3470 processor so
this is a great choice for a gaming
build like this so it has a quad core
design with for proper cores as opposed
to hyper threading or anything else like
that and also is able to turbo all the
way up to 3.6 biga Hertz on top of that
since it is a core i5 that means you're
gonna have plenty of performance for not
only games but on top of that you can
also do things such as video editing all
for about $185 for a motherboard we're
going to be using an MSI B 75 m AP 45 so
I've used this one before in a previous
build and I liked it quite a bit is
there gives you pretty much everything
that you need so it does support up to
32 gigabytes of RAM so if you ever want
to upgrade that you can feel free and it
also does have both USB 3.0 support as
well as say 2 3.0 support so if you'd
like you can always grab an SSD toss it
in there you're going to be good to go
for a pretty awesome upgrade to your
computer as well of course since it is a
b75 board it does support the Intel Core
i5 so you're gonna be good to go they're
all for about $65 for a graphics card we
wouldn't be using an XFX Radeon 7870 now
this is an awesome choice for a 1080p
card like I showed you guys in the
benchmarks will pretty much handle any
game you throw at it on high or even
ultra settings without breaking a sweat
on top of that since it is outfitted
with 2 gigabytes of memory it's
definitely gonna be able to handle some
of the newer games such as BioShock
which really do need a lot of memory to
run nice and
without any problems at all with all
this for about two hundred forty dollars
is a great choice for our build for
memory we're going to be using a
gigabyte of Corsair Vengeance ddr3 RAM
now I've been using this stuff in a lot
of my builds these days and that's for a
good reason it's fast so it is clocked
at 1600 megahertz which is in my opinion
the sweet spot for an Ivy Bridge based
system and on top of that with eight
gigabytes of this stuff you're gonna
have plenty of extra memory for all
kinds of multitasking gaming all that
kind of fun stuff for about $60 for a
hard drive or one to be using a one
terabyte Western Digital caviar black
now this is a great choice for a gaming
build like this it's going to deliver a
lot of performance not quite as much as
an SSD however of course it's much
cheaper than a one terabyte SSD and on
top of that it's also going to be very
reliable as it does have a good warranty
and of course Western Digital make some
great hard drives now I will say that if
you guys want more less storage you can
get that so I chose the one terabyte
version for this one however you can
also pick this up and a 500 gigabyte
version as well as a two terabyte
version and I'll have both those links
in the description of this video anyway
though if you do want to go with the one
terabyte version it's going to run you
about $90 for a case we're going to be
using the NZXT source 220 now I like
this for several reasons for starters
you do have pretty good airflow
considering the fact that it does have
both eight 120 as well as a 140
millimeter fan to keep things nice and
cool as well as it does have USB 3.0
support and most importantly of all at
least for a budget build like this is
that's easy to work in so a lot of times
when you get a budget case it's gonna be
a lot of rough edges and it's really not
easy to put anything together however
with this one everything is nicely laid
out you have plenty of room all for
about fifty dollars for the power supply
we won't be using a 500 watt Corsair CX
500 now this is a great choice for this
build with 500 watts of capacity that's
gonna be more than enough to handle
everything we have in there now as well
as some future upgrades and on top of
that since it is an 80 plus bronze
certified power supply that means that
it's not going to be high quality but
also to deliver some pretty solid
efficiency all for about 58 dollars so
there you have it an awesome $750 gaming
PC build now of course prices are always
changing so I'll have links to
everything I mentioned in the
description of this video as well as
some additional options so if you guys
want to do some upgrades like a DVD
driver and SSD they will also be in the
description of this video if you're
interested in more feel free to check
out my last bill where I went over 8500
ollar gaming
PC if you enjoyed definitely be sure to
leave this video a thumbs up if you're
interested in more videos like this be
sure to subscribe anyway guys I will
catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
