today I'm here with an unboxing of my
new Sanyo exacty CG 10 handheld
camcorder I've been looking for one for
a little while
actually I got a four again I gotta give
a huge shout out mkbhd or you guys might
know him as marques Brownlee
it's totally if he hadn't made a he
bought this a month or so ago and that
was about perfect timing because I had
just been started looking for a
camcorder I looked at a flap I looked at
a Kodak I looked at several ones
basically I was looking to get a small
handheld high-definition camcorder that
you know didn't cost me a ton of money
so I saw his video he got one of these
heater if you want everything and I was
really impressed so I went ahead and got
one for myself so yeah let's get
something started so did you see it's a
very small box I mean it's a very small
saw and surprised that they actually
don't even have a tape on here of course
I did order it off the bestbuy.com
and in case you're curious this cost me
one hundred and fifty nine dollars and I
think it was like just few dollars tax I
don't remember what okay so
Wow this is the instructions and that's
a lot to see what we got guide big thick
guide Wow okay and then more paperwork
that's a QuickStart guide wow that's a
lot of paperwork out at her okay
all right okay so first we have the
camcorder but let's just do that Matt
what's the left leg gave us so I'll let
the complainant cable see here is that -
that looks like just some proprietary
USB that's nice they put a component
cable so you can plug that straight into
your TV it's very cool I didn't know
that was coming
great we've got lanyard it's always good
we've got shut the USB cable and if I'm
not mistaken this section does not
charge via USB you'll see here in a
minute
actually yeah here it is right here you
actually have to take the battery out
and put it into here and just be a very
small battery small thing um yeah I
don't know that's okay I guess I would
have Peart charge the USB and everything
and be able to use it but I guess that's
not bad this cameras the same way where
it won't let you I can't I can't be
recording unless the battery's full
because as soon as you plug in it kind
of goes into a weird mode where so cool
must we have here now we have the sexy
lens cap it's actually pretty big lens
doesn't look like it but and let's see
what else we have the power cable so
we'll just plug that one end into this
so good that they put a power cable in I
guess and what's this oh is this the
battery wow that is a very small battery
all that mean see compared to my hand
that's a very small battery seat here
see what is that says no this came on
focus well mmm
700 million watt hours wow that's I
should I mean that's it's such a small
battery I didn't think great mmm
so you're nothing else in the box so
let's take out camcorder push that to
the side so ah nice very nice as you can
see here is pretty much marketed as a
dual camera and it can take 720p
high-definition video which is the main
reason that got it it also can take 10
megapixel stills uh-huh
I don't know I don't want to take a
whole lot of pictures to be honest but
you know it's not bad so yeah let's go
through it so you see here I think this
probably snaps off something Wow I'll
explore later I've imagined that's where
the battery goes so from the front you
can see that it's a really nice size of
it it's pretty uh it's a small camera I
mean in my hand it it's very small but
that lens is a really nice size I'm
really liking that especially if you've
ever seen like a flip or something he's
got little tiny little lens so that
that's cool and then we have a flash I
don't think that flash is only for
pictures though but that's nice to have
see here we have our High Definition
thing and if you see here right here and
here we have the microphones and it's
dual microphones so that's what's great
should have some pretty good audio in
the back we have a bunch of buttons I
guess this is for video for picking
pictures I got zoom you see here I can't
really just why I need this so here we
have a play or a cord and have a little
joystick and a mini button so practice
open okay that is wow that is a nice ice
cream see if I can hold it out here I
believe this is a three inch 16 by 9
that is a nice sized screen you see here
actually here's a speaker there -
actually a pretty decent sized speaker -
huh
and then actually that's like hmm it's
you don't know if you guys can tell but
that's actually like a leather grain
it's pretty cool I'll guess it says
right there 16 digital zoom which and
I'm not sure I priced it off to the
digital zoom but we have a power button
and then see here we've got a slot for
the SD card okay yeah
always afraid when I first grabbed just
about this because I think it's gonna
break
see yeah there we go we just slot the SD
card in there yes it does not have flash
memory which is probably one of the
major things that's not as good as the
flip but have an SD cards and if I'm not
mistaken you can put yeah it's SDHC you
can put a 32 gigabyte card in there so
it's pretty good
mm-hmm very cool so yeah guys that is my
unboxing of the Sanyo exact d.c g10 dual
camera I'm definitely gonna be starting
using this in my videos it looks very
cool I really like it looks like a
really nice in the hand it fits perfect
and just see just being able to film
like that oh yeah forgot one more thing
see here we got the USB and yeah the
tripod mount which is good I'll just
grab that anyway guys so yeah that's it
thanks for watching and yeah definitely
stay tuned I will have more review and
sample footage and all that stuff anyway
guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
