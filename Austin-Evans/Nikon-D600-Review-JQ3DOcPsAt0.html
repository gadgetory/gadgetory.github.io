here with a review of the Nikon d600
with a full-frame 24 megapixel sensor
excellent ergonomics and a price tag of
thousand dollars or less than its rivals
let's take a look at what it's all about
at first glance the d600 looks just like
every other reasonably high-end DSLR out
there big bulky and filled with buttons
start shooting with it however and the
ergonomics quickly fall into place just
like the d7000 I've got a few little
issues like the button to change ISO is
on the back of the camera but for the
most part it's solid and significantly
lighter than the d800 and d4 there are
some nice features with the d600
in addition to your standard modes you
can also program presets and save them
to u1 and u2 which can be a huge help
for example you can have one mode for
shooting macro and instantly switch to
shooting portraits without having to
dial all of your settings and again
having a pair of SD card slots is also
convenient as SD cards really are good
enough to replace CF for most people I
shoot a lot of video everyday so most of
the time I use the d600 in my studio
with a full frame sensor and manual
control over your video you can get some
really excellent looking results out of
the d600 it shoots in 1080p at 30 frames
per second and 720p at up to 60 with a
bit rate of 21 megabits per second at
1080p file stay nice and clean even at
higher ISO and you have manual control
over everything but aperture and live
view if you're upgrading from a crop
sensor camera one nice thing is that DX
lenses work fine with video still record
at 1080p and just pulled off a cropped
portion of the sensor you'll find both
microphone in and headphone out for
monitoring which is a big help but
what's a bit disappointing is the HDMI
output Nikon advertises it as
uncompressed HDMI out but some people
find it's only 95 percent coverage I
record to the camera so it's nothing
that bothers me but hopefully it's
something that can be resolved via
firmware update speaking of an update
there are some issues software can fix
for example the excellent new one in
YouTube modes are mostly ignored when a
movie live you where they work perfectly
for stills image quality is fantastic as
you would expect from a full-frame Nikon
with 24 megapixels to work with it hits
a nice sweet spot between the d4 and
d800 and it's honestly way more than
most people need you can easily crop
shots down to 10 megapixels and still
have plenty of resolution to work with
color is very good however you may need
to do some tweaking to get it perfect as
it tends to be a bit greener than I like
low light performance is absolutely
top-notch comparing well with even the
d800 I had no problem shooting an ISO
3200 with
perfectly acceptable amount of noise
even 6400 is entirely usable although
there is a fair bit of noise if you look
closely and it's expandable out to
twenty five thousand six hundred you'll
also find a time lapse mode built-in
which works very well it's easy to set
up and the results can be very very
impressive the d600 will shoot at five
point five frames per second a
significant jump over the d800 well
that's nothing on the d4 it's perfectly
respectable and good enough for all but
the most series of action shooters the
viewfinder has 100 percent coverage and
is a massive improvement over DX cameras
one thing that isn't for thick is the
autofocus it's got 39 points which work
perfectly fine but all the points are
clustered in the center of the frame it
isn't something all that out of the
ordinary on full-frame cameras however
so I don't mind too much
overall the Nikon d600 is an incredible
camera well it's not targeted at pros I
can see it replacing ad700 or d800
thanks to its lighter weight excellent
ergonomics and almost perfect megapixel
count it works well for video as is and
provides image quality that's on par
with even the d4 which cost nearly three
times as much for a camera aimed at
enthusiasts Nikon absolutely nailed it
with the d600 if you enjoyed be sure to
leave this video a thumbs up and if
