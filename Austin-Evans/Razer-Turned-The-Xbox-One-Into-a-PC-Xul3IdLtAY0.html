razor has a special treat for the Xbox
this is the razor turret for the Xbox
one the Xbox just got full support for a
mouse and keyboard and this is one of
the very first official options for it
then you can plug in a normal wired
mouse and keyboard and it will work fine
what's cool about this is specifically
meant to the Xbox and it is fully
wireless on the keyboard side we do have
Razer green mechanical switches as well
as chroma support so it's very similar
to what you would find on their standard
PC keyboards and this actually does work
on the PC although it's meant for the
Xbox what's cool about this is it also
doesn't have a magnetic mouse pad
magnetic mouse pad so you're not using
it it has a slightly stronger magnet on
the edge but if you move it away it's
very lightly magnetized and when you're
sitting on a couch this is actually a
really nice setup so of course it's nice
to have those full mechanical key
switches what's cool about this entire
setup is it does use a single dongle to
connect to the Xbox or your PC the idea
here is that this is something which is
meant for very high-end PC gaming which
you can also use for the Xbox and vice
versa it even does have a specific Xbox
button on the keyboard so if you want to
build your own ultimate Xbox one this is
a little bit on the pricey side it is
going to be shipping soon for a full two
hundred two dollars so I mean you're
getting a high-end keyboard you're
getting the high-end Mouse it is of
course all wireless but it's a not
exactly cheap when that's about the same
price an Xbox one is next up we have
razors very first gaming monitor the
Razer Raptor which is all the way over
there because Ken said that the shot
would be ugly if I stood in front of it
so what you're looking at here is a
27-inch monitor with a 1440p resolution
as well as a 144 Hearts refresh rate but
it goes a lot beyond that so razor being
razor it actually is built really well
and of course razor being razor there's
plenty of RGB look everyone can agree
with that statement right that's that's
a pretty reasonable it's built well
that's RGB is the quality components so
you get all the rest of the specs you
would expect including HDR 400 as well
as it is a free sync monitor although
potentially there also might be a g-sync
version coming soon what I really look
at when I see this monitor especially
considering that we just play with the
turret is that this could be really cool
for the ultimate Xbox think about right
so you've got 1440p resolution which
would work well to 1x and you've also
got free sync so part two of this video
maybe Ken's trying to stop me from
shooting over here but I don't care I
have my ghost lamp so it's cool but this
is actually really built well so if you
want I'm going to carefully do this you
actually can flip the monitor all the
way up and what you get here is some
actually really nice kill management so
it's cool about this is that all these
cables come with the monitor so you got
USB see USB a HDMI I mean it's really
nice to have all this stuff that all
comes with it and part of that is
because this little channel here is
specifically meant for these cables now
the base itself is actually forged
aluminum and while I'm sure it's
incredibly expensive it does mean this
is a really nice looking monitor front
and back there's also the chroma
underglow however the downside here is
it's a little bit on the pricey side by
little I mean it's $700 so it's a super
high-end gaming monitor and I'm excited
to see it when it comes a little bit
later this year we also have one more
thing to talk about as I walk back to
the spot that ken has approved with
actual lighting so this is the new Razer
Blade 15 advanced so as you would expect
it has been upgraded with r-tx
so it starts with an art text 2060 but
you can also upgrade it with an art TX
2070 max Q or 2080 max Q so in addition
to the big graphics bump there is also
now a Windows hello webcam what's cool
about this is that while all these
configurations will be available on
January 29th 2016 2017 2018
there are also some upgraded versions
they'll be coming a little bit later
including this which has a full 240
Hertz display I mean I can't see the
difference my eyes can feel like 90
Hertz but uh it's super smooth so this
is still technically a concept although
razer said that it should be coming out
hopefully this year what's cool about it
oh well I almost pulled a wise again I'm
gonna actually set this down the table
before I accidentally break a prototype
here so it's really hard to show on
camera but the actual responsiveness
here is crazy
now not to say the 144 Hertz looks bad
but this is super super responsive and
this should be coming soon
on top of that this this is what I'm
really excited about this is a blade
with a 4k OLED panel so the exact
configuration of this is still to be
determined the idea that you can get a
4k touchscreen oh let on a blade is a
seriously big deal now I don't have the
exact specs they're still calibrating
and figuring out exactly what it will
look like but the demo here I mean look
this is not a bad looking screen but the
OLED just completely blows it away right
I mean just the actual level of not only
brightness and Khan
fast but especially you look like the
black levels I mean it's so bright so
vivid you tell that I like a lid I want
over on my next laptop don't mind me I'm
just gonna enjoy it over LED on a laptop
oh you gotta be judgmental man oh that
looks nice dude seriously
so obviously the high refresh rate is
nice and this will not be like some 144
Hertz panel it's 4k but the idea that
you can get such a high quality screen
on a laptop the screen is so
unbelievably bright that the camera
can't handle it can you just stop down
and show people how bright it is look
how dark everything has to be just to be
able to see just how bright the screen
is so that is what razor has at CES 2019
so a lot of cool upgrades to the blade a
lot of cool upgrades for Xbox and a lot
of downgrades for my wallet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
