pocket now as one of the world's
smallest laptops with a 7-inch display
it's kind of crazy what you're able to
get in such a small form-factor
but today today it's time for an update
so inside this slightly
suspicious-looking box is a
pre-production version of the brand-new
pocket - you know an IndieGoGo this just
went live and it's already way way past
its goal so with some much nicer retail
packaging we have the pocket itself now
what made the original pocket pretty
cool was that it is a full Windows
laptop and a tiny form factor and this
this is actually going to be even
smaller and almost more important than
that it's going to be more powerful so
it's actually got a little bit more of a
taper now so I put it side-by-side with
the original
you'll see that that one was a little
bit on the thicker and chunkier side but
now is this going to be a little bit
thinner but it even has more ports so
unlike something like the 12-inch
MacBook which has a single USBC port
this tiny 7 inch laptop has not only a
pair of USB a ports but also a microSD
headphone jack and a full USB C port one
thing the pocket definitely has down is
build quality the entire thing is going
to be made out of aluminum and it feels
incredibly sturdy typically speaking
when you're talking about something
that's this small you would expect it to
feel kind of plastic a or cheap that is
definitely not the case that even comes
across to the hinge seriously this thing
is built incredibly incredibly well as
opposed to the Atom processor in the
original version this guy is rocking a
full core m3 that's gonna make a big
difference to performance and while
that's typically going to be found in
fanless designs because this guy is
going to be so small it does have a
somewhat loud spin so it's kind of
helpful if there is going to be a little
button which can mostly mute the fan on
the keyboard probably because they know
that it gets a little bit annoying but
the nice thing is that you're actually
going to be getting some pretty serious
performance out of such a tiny and
laptop this model is paired with four
gigabytes of RAM and a 128 gigabyte SSD
now if you take a look at the IndieGoGo
page it's clear that a lot more people
are opting for the 8 gig model but if
you're more basic use 4 gig is actually
going to be ok but again I think most
people who are really hardcore about
these things are gonna want the Mac spec
that you can get now the 128 gigabyte
SSD is going to be a little bit on the
lower end but again it's a 7 inch laptop
sure it's not going to be the fastest
thing in the world but it's totally fine
for normal use this guy is going to be
running a full version of Windows 10
don't let the looks fool you it is going
to be a proper little laptop which of
course means only one thing it's time to
play some fortnight yeah of course it is
what do you mean it's fortnight times
don't you don't you want views Ken don't
you want to see how for night runs on a
7-inch laptop on the world's smallest
laptop I thought so well too bad because
I've already got four night loaded and
you can't stop me do we get dare go down
to potato mode do we do full 360 P hey
first let's it um can run the loading
screen wait a minute this is actually
this works I mean I made like 28 frames
per second I'd buy that now as you might
imagine where the laptops is this small
you definitely definitely need a mouse
the keyboard actually does kind of work
though it's not ideal as long as I have
a mouse it actually doesn't feel so bad
all right support Knight playable on the
seven-inch if you don't enjoy your own
sanity the screen isn't bad so it's a 7
inch panel with a 1920 by 1200
resolution which is going to be plenty
sharp on a display this size now this is
going to be pre-production Hardware so
you can't judge it too harshly but my
main issue is going to be the brightness
it just isn't all that bright well it's
going to be somewhat color accurate it
does leave a little bit on the cooler
side hopefully by the time this actually
ships to everyone who's buying it on
IndieGoGo went on Amazon later this year
they will be able to get a little bit of
a brighter panel in this guy compared to
the original pocket the keyboard has
been tweaked and definitely for the
better so not only is going to be a
little bit taller so before there was
going to be some wasted space but
they've also gotten rid of this little
nub instead there's going to be this
tiny little touch pad which is not only
going to be used as a tiny tiny little
cursor but you can also click it it's a
little bit weird but the biggest
difference is definitely going to be in
the better keyboard layout though going
to be small and hard to get used to but
it is a big improvement the real way to
use this is going to be to take
advantage of the touchscreen now it is
going to be pretty accurate the biggest
issue is just because it is so small a
lot of the windows touch targets are
tiny but once you get some scaling on
this guy it's not going to be too bad
sixty watts that's a lot of watts my
friends
the speaker is not exactly going to be
all that great it gets pretty loud but
the issue is its I think it's kind of
hidden underneath the keyboard there's
no obvious sort of spot where it's
actually going to be exhausting sound
you can use all sound that's not a thing
at all ready $600 on IndieGoGo for the
higher-end model and it's going to be
even more expensive when it's available
on retail sale later this year the GPD
pocket 2 is not going to be for everyone
well it's a dope little laptop and well
there's always going to be more and more
different thin light laptops that are
going to be going for that world's
thinnest title I've got to say going for
the world's smallest laptop actually has
a lot of value to it I mean come on this
thing actually fits in your pocket</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
