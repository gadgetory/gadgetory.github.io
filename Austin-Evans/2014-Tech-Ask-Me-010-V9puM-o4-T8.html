here with ask me we're going over all
kinds of questions straight from you
guys what are you excited to see it's
CES this year CES is always filled with
lots of awesome stuff and in fact this
will actually be my fourth year going
but as far as things that really jump
out at me
bow should be there and they'll be
showing off their own steam machine
which would be cool so that'll be the
actual box that you can buy directly
from valve as well as the guys from
oculus trip should also be there
possibly showing off a new version of
the rift and if they do I'm going to be
all over that so if you guys should
definitely keep an eye out early January
I'll be doing lots and lots of coverage
from CES so watch it please how many
pounds of hair gel do you use every day
well the bottle says 9 ounces so I use
about 2 or 3 of those a day so you can
kind of do the math for yourself what's
the biggest tech disaster to ever happen
to you so this actually happened a few
years ago at CES so this was the very
first time I had ever had the
opportunity to actually travel and go
grab some videos for my channel if you
guys don't know CES is the big Consumer
Electronics Show that happens every
January in Las Vegas so I was super
excited super pumped so I went out there
and I filmed a ton of videos I mean I
think during the for show days it
probably filmed like 30 or 40 videos
just totally an insane amount and I
posted some of them while I was there
but I had to go back home so got on the
plane flew back but the problem was I
really hadn't flown all that often up
until that point so I didn't realize
that you really aren't supposed to put
your laptop like in your normal luggage
and above you you know and like the
overhead bins so I got home I turned on
my laptop and it was dead so at some
point with getting on the plane taking
it off and throwing it in like luggage
cars everything the laptop hard drive
had died so I lost a huge chunk of my
footage from CES which was a really
really big bummer but yeah that just
goes to show you have backups lots of
backups what our Google+ comments
there's a brand new youtube comment
systems that everyone absolutely loves
even though most people just don't
comment anymore but it totally an
improvement will you be picking up a
Moto G I know I am to add to the
Motorola family actually I've been using
the Moto G as my main phone lately so
I'll have a full review up here in the
next week or two but spoiler alert
it's actually a really good little phone
do you even lift do I left watch this
show got the iPad air what is the best
cooling is where the way to go or is it
a waste of time and money it depends on
your build I'd say for the majority of
pcs air cooling is just fine it's all
you need however if you do want to get a
little bit of extra performance you
don't mind spending a little bit more
money getting something like a
closed-loop cooler or so something like
a courser h 110 or even a full water
cooling loop can absolutely get you more
performance but a lot of the times it's
really not going to be worth it unless
you do have some very high end parts
what's your advice for being successful
on YouTube and how are you recognized by
other companies to give you free review
units it really boils down to lots of
hard work and constantly being able to
improve yourself so it's not going to
happen overnight so expect to give it a
month two months six months a year two
years however long it takes but the big
thing is just be able to put a lot of
time energy and effort into it to make
it happen as far as being able to get
free review units free in review units
are not always the same thing so a lot
of times when a company sends me a phone
or a computer or whatever it's just a
loaner so they'll give it to me I'll do
a video on it and when I'm done and ship
it back so as far as how I actually get
this kind of stuff you really need to be
able to show value to the company so
send them an email say hey look this is
who I am this is what I do I have this
many subscribers this me views etc etc
and show them why if they do take a
chance and send you something that you
will make it worth it for them if
someone is phobophobia
fear or phobias does that mean they are
afraid of the fact that they are afraid
of being afraid yes is the answer I
think do you prefer Android or Apple
since the iPhone 5s and Nexus 5 recently
came out I've switched back and forth
between iOS and Android quite a few
times so for the last year and a half
I've been on Android however since the
iPhone 5s came out I've actually
switched over to it so I did give the
Nexus 5 a shot and I used it for about a
week or two but the problem was the
battery life was just off
I couldn't even come close to being able
to make it through a full day whereas
with the iPhone that's not really a big
problem so I like the Nexus 5 I know a
lot of people don't really have any
battery issues but for me I was charging
it like twice a day just not good why is
your hair up I feel like we've already
been over this
lots and lots and lots of hair gel you
don't know how many takes I just had to
do with that my hair is like dripping
right now so if you guys have any
questions you'd like me to go over next
time on ask me feel free to let me know
over on Twitter Facebook and Google+ and
all those links will be in the
description of this video
also I want to give a big shout out to
my friends over H H Greg who are giving
