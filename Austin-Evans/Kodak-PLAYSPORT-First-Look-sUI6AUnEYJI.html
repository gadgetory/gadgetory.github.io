camcorder market dominated by flip the
zi8 was a universally well liked little
camera
it featured 1080p high-definition video
in a reasonably sized package the beat
out the competition nearly across the
board as far as image quality was
concerned now Kodak has come up with a
waterproof smaller and cheaper version
of the camera the play sport let's get
this one started
the kodak play sport is a fully
waterproof camcorder up to ten feet
underwater to prove it kodak kept demo
unit submerged in a fish tank it's also
a moderately drop and shockproof which
makes it one of the first really rugged
pocket camcorders on the market if you
own a zi8 then the camera will seem very
familiar to you at the lens and camera
assembly has been pulled right out of it
for the play sport that means full 1080p
video shooting at 30 frames per second
as well as 720p video in 30 or 60 frames
per second it also means that the
overall solid shooting performance of
the zi8 has been retained
especially in outdoor lighting which is
obviously perfect for a rugged camcorder
one thing that is a slight change for
the worst in the place board is its 2
inch LCD screen that's down a half inch
from its predecessor but the play sport
makes up for it by shrinking by a
considerable amount no longer one of the
bulkiest pocket cameras around
especially as it is one of the most
rugged the play sport also fits really
nicely in the hand storage comes by way
of SD or SDHC memory cards and it also
features a rechargeable lithium-ion
battery while it's all fairly solid the
real clincher is price where most
companies charge more for their rugged
devices kodak is charging less the play
sport will be on sale in April for one
hundred and fifty dollars which looks to
make it the best deal on a small
high-def camcorder around
if you're going to be in the market for
one I would definitely recommend holding
off for a bit and checking out the Kodak
place for</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
