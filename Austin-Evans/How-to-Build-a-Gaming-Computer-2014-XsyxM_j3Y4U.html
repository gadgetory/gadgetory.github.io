here with my 2014 gaming PC build guy
ready to build yourself a computer this
guide is based on my most recent $500
gaming PC build you guys can check that
out in the description or I go over all
the parts that are used in this build
but for the most part this tutorial
flies to basically any gaming computer
you want to build sure you will find a
few little differences here and there
but for the most part this will show you
how to build basically any gaming
computer you want before we get started
there are a couple things you need first
of all find yourself a table to work on
away from carpet or rugs anything that
could help build up static the only tool
we need for the build is a Phillips
screwdriver although a pair of
needlenose pliers can sometimes be
helpful let's jump right in start by
unscrewing the thumb screws on the back
of the case so we can open up things to
work on once you've got them free the
side panel should slide right off just
set it aside for now flip the case
around and undo the thumb screws on this
side as well then pop the panel off
inside you'll find a few accessories for
the case including cable ties PCIe
brackets screws and other hardware along
with the manual I like to start builds
with installing the power supply so grab
this first you'll see a ton of cables
but we'll go over what to do with these
a bit later for now slide the supply
into the case either on bottom or top
depending on which case you're using
making sure the fan is free and clear
and pointing downward included with the
power supply should be four screws like
this pick them out and let's get this
installed a power supply has four screw
holes on each corner which should line
up with the corresponding holes in your
case a good rule of thumb is to put the
first screw in and then go across the
opposite side and screw that next help
make sure that nothing gets misaligned
then put the other screws in and once
you're done go back around once more to
make sure everything is nice and tight
while we're here let's remove the PCIe
covers so we can install our graphics
card a bit later for this build we're
removing the top tube and usually these
run screwed however with this case you
need to bend them backward until they
snap off now set the case aside and grab
your motherboard box now the board is a
bit fragile especially to static so when
taking it out of the bag try to touch it
only by the plastic bits and set it down
on the box to work on before we start
installing hardware into it let's take a
quick look around with the motherboard
is all
about this gray bit in the center is
your CPU socket which is where we'll be
installing the processor over to the
right of it are these long black dim
sockets which is where your ddr3 RAM
goes just past this is your 20+4 pin
motherboard power connector which is
where we plug in the power supply below
this on the edge of the board are our
six SATA ports these are what you use to
connect drives and for this bill we'll
be using just a single hard drive but
you can also use these to hook up SSDs
optical drives or more hard drives right
behind all your ports you should see the
four pin CPU power connector pretty
self-explanatory but you'll plug a cable
from your power supply into here towards
the bottom of the card are your PCI
Express connectors to drop in your
graphics card generally you want to use
the highest full-sized slot which in
this case is the blue one however some
things like sounding capture cards can
also go into the smaller PCIe one
connectors finally around back or all of
your ports these will be sticking out
the back of your case and are how you'll
connect keyboards mice Ethernet etc
alright time to get to the fun stuff
starting with installing the CPU inside
the box you'll find the processor itself
wrapped in plastic along with the
heatsink and fan with pre applied
thermal paste when handling the CPU only
touch it by the edges and be very
careful with the pins on the back bend
any of these badboys and you're in
trouble come over to your motherboard
and pull the retention arm back to open
up the socket on the bottom of the CPU
you'll see a small gold arrow on the
corner line this up with the matching
arrow on the board to make sure it's
going in the right way
gently rest the processor into the
socket don't use any force as it should
sit by itself now close the arm back
down using a little pressure and that's
it the CPU is installed now grab your
cooler and set it down over the
processor making sure the thermal paste
makes a good solid seal AMD CPUs are a
little fiddly when it comes to locking
the stock cooler down but make sure the
metal arms hook into the mounts on the
motherboard and pull them down to
tighten next let's plug in the CPU fan
if it's a bit too long to reach the
header on the motherboard just tie it in
on itself to get rid of some of the
slack you should see a four pin CPU fan
header near the socket just plug the fan
into here there are two notches on it so
it only goes in one way
now that that's out of the way let's
install the RAM if you take a look at it
you'll see a notch about two-thirds of
the way down you want to align this with
the matching notch on the motherboard
pull the clips on either side back and
slide the dim in and then press firmly
on either side until it clicks into
place at this point our motherboard is
basically fully assembled with the CPU
heatsink and fan along with memory next
up let's install everything into the
case flip the case on its side and make
sure the cables are set out of the way
the motherboard is mounted on brass
standoffs and it's important to make
sure it's secure on these otherwise it
could ground out on the steel case this
case has all the standoffs we need
already installed but if not you'll need
to take a look at the manual and install
the standoffs you need for your
motherboard grab the i/o shield that
came with your board and pop it into the
back of the case making sure you've got
it flipped right-side up
it's a pain to get in correctly so don't
be afraid to use a little force to pop
it in now lower your motherboard into
place over the standoffs and make sure
it's flush with the i/o shield and that
the ports are sticking through grab your
screws and start tightening the board
down one by one again making sure that
all the holes line up with the standoffs
as well as all the ports are fully
accessible on the back of the case now
flip the case back up and while we've
got easy access to them let's plug in
the fans grab the lead from the rear fan
and connect it to the fan header on the
board right above the PCIe slot come to
the front and do the same thing with the
front fan connect it to the four pin
header just behind your RAM next up
let's install the graphics card which is
super easy just line it up with the main
PCIe connector and slide it in until it
clicks into place
make sure that all of the ports are
clearly accessible from the back of the
case and then screw it in to make sure
it stays nice and secure there you go
the graphics card is installed the last
major thing we need to install is the
hard drive every case does this a little
differently but with the line in it's as
simple as sliding it into a free drive
cage making sure that the screw holes
line up once it's all set screw the
drive into place with four screws to
facing forward and two in the back
now that our hardware is installed time
for the fun part
wiring except this is not fun at all
grab the bundle of wires from the front
of the case and start with the big blue
USB 3.0 connector plug this into the
bottom of the motherboard there's a
notch on the connector and cable so it
only goes in one way but be careful the
pins are a bit easy to bend next grab
the smaller USB 2.0 connector and plug
this in here
there's a pin knocked out of it so again
it only goes in one way
to connect the front panel audio you
should see two leads AC 97 and HD audio
connect the HD audio connector into the
bottom left of the board although this
can be in different places depending on
the motherboard
there are several smaller front panel
connectors now for these you'll need to
check your motherboard manual to see
what goes where the important thing to
note is that the colored wires are
positive so that shows you which way to
plug everything in don't worry too much
about getting something wrong here if
it's not right just go back and
double-check at this point your cable
should look something like this
we're almost there along with the
hardware that came with your case you
should see a small speaker this connects
either with the front panel connectors
or on this build right beside them come
over to your motherboard box and find
your SATA cables these are to connect
your hard drive and have a clip and
notch to make sure that they go in
correctly first attach it to the back of
the hard drive with the smaller data
connector and then run the other end
into a SATA port on your motherboard now
we just need to hook the power supply up
to everything start with grabbing the
big 20+4 pin connector this goes in
right behind the RAM and like basically
every other cable only clips in one way
now grab the four plus four pin CPU
power cable depending on the supply you
may have to snap these apart as for this
bill we only need four of the pins hook
it up on the top left of the motherboard
and that's all for this one come back to
your power supply leads and find a
harness with these long thinner
connectors these are four SATA and power
your hard drive optical drive or SSD
unlike the data cables these don't click
into place so you'll have to use a
little force to make sure it's inserted
all the way last but not least grab a
PCIe lead this is a 6 pin connector with
an additional 2 on the side and are
usually used for graphics cards just
plug it into your GPU depending on your
build some cards don't need any extra
power but many need to 6 + 2 pin
connectors now it's time for a test to
see if everything is working flip the
power switch on the back of the power
supply and hook it up to a monitor and
keyboard then hit the power button all
the lights and fans should power up and
you should see video on your screen this
is a good time to go inside your BIOS to
check that everything is showing up
properly this MSI board has a helpful
Explorer option that lets you check your
processor power connections memory and
all the rest of your hard
to make sure it's installed properly if
everything looks good
unplug the PC and it's time to clean up
some of our cables generally you want to
route what you can behind the
motherboard and use electrical ties to
tidy up the rest
but this case is tricky to get neat
cable management with so just tuck
unused cables out of the way and clean
it out the best you can once you're done
slide the side panels back on and we are
done with the hardware at this point you
can install any operating system you
want so if you'd like to feel the steam
of West round I have created a tutorial
and in fact I use this build to do it so
if you guys want to go that way I will
have that linked in the description to
check that out however more likely
you're probably going to want to install
windows so let's show you how to do that
right now
hop back into the BIOS and make sure the
boot order is set to either your USB
Drive or optical drive first depending
on how you plan on installing windows
hook up your installation media and the
setup should begin it's pretty
straightforward just hit next then
install now and after a minute it will
ask for your product key punch that in
and it will ask what type of
installation you want since this is a
new PC pick custom select your hard
drive and choose new hit apply and let
windows create your partitions and then
click Next now windows will begin
installing this will take a while so sit
back and let it work its magic after a
couple restarts it will have you
personalize and create your account do
this and it will take you into Windows
finally we're done except that now we
have to install our drivers so we're
actually not done if you can't connect
to the internet out of the box you'll
have to use the driver CD that came with
your motherboard or use another computer
to download the ethernet driver onto a
USB Drive and then bring it over to your
new PC once you're online first thing is
to get your graphics card driver for
Nvidia just search the name of your
graphics card on their site and download
and install the driver it's the same
thing if you have AMD or Intel graphics
just download the latest drivers
available from their site most things
should be working now but it's still a
good idea to search the name of your
motherboard and head to the driver
section of the site to get the rest of
what you need generally I don't bother
with the utilities but things like
chipset and audio drivers are very
helpful from here feel free to install
all the rest of the programs you need
such as steam or origin another web
browser etc now all that's left is to
let windows update this will probably
take a while and a few restarts but once
that's done
you're up and running congratulations on
