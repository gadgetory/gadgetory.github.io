date her call Lisa Lisa I don't know any
Lisa
is this something we need to talk about
Siri turn on airplane mode airplane mode
you could just put me on mute fine I
took a wrong turn
you please get us directions to the
restaurant of course now you're asking
for directions 20 minutes later do I
have time to make my four o'clock I
don't know why don't you ask Lisa Siri I
don't think this is going to work out
searching for I don't think this is
going to work out okay
how long do you think this console
generation will last streaming of games
is just around the corner so do we
really need new consoles it is really
hard to look into your magic crystal
ball and see where we're going to be
five or ten years from now I mean
something that really blows my mind is
that YouTube and the Xbox 360 both came
out in the same month back in 2005 it's
just a very very bizarre thing to think
about so personally I think these
consoles are gonna be here to stay for a
while but I'm not totally sold they're
just gonna completely become extinct
hereafter this generation is over now on
the streaming game side it kind of
depends on what you're talking about I
mean things like in-home streaming like
with steam boxes so you know you take a
steam box you throw it in your closet
and play a game on your TV
I think that's here to stay I think they
actually work surprisingly well just
already not having to wait for anything
however as far as like streaming games
over the internet that is pretty much
entirely reliant on how good the
internet can get and that is something
that does not move anywhere near as fast
as things like YouTube or consoles or
anything like that so it might be
possible for some games especially if
you have a really good internet
connection but I'm not sold that
streaming is gonna be replacing normal
consoles or pcs any time soon what
camera and Mike do you use for YouTube
for the camera I've now upgraded to a
Canon c100 so I wanted one of these for
a long time so when my buddy Jon from
TLD was selling his I could not pass it
up so super happy with the image quality
and just all the features that come with
a proper video camera so very very happy
with the C 104 audio I'm using a zoom
h4n so this is a great microphone it
just kind of sits on a tripod right
below my shot underneath the camera so I
can record audio and to really solid it
has a good mic kind of built in so I can
kind of use it just for normal recording
like I do for my typical videos but also
has things like XLR inputs as well as
normal mic jacks to really make it very
useful for all kinds of things what are
your impressions on the LG g3 I'm
surprisingly impressed
so I've typically not been a big fan of
LG phones mostly because I don't really
like the skins they use but the g3
Hardware looks awesome
so it's got that huge screen with the
tiny bezels it has laser autofocus on
the camera which is just awesome and it
also has a kind of metal slash plastic
build which probably won't quite match
up things like the HTC One and the
iPhone but
definitely an improvement so if they
have a Google Play edition sign me up
are you going to be doing more budget TC
builds anytime soon really interested in
that part of the channel absolutely so
I'm not stupid I know the budget gaming
PC builds are a huge part of why a lot
of you guys watch my channel and yeah
I've been doing the monthly for the last
little while I know I had a couple
months earlier in the year where I was a
little bit behind but yeah pretty much
gotten into a monthly schedule of a new
kind of gaming PC build not all of our
budget some of them including one that
probably will be coming up next month
will be very expensive but I like to
kind of mix it up and just do some fun
cool builds are you marques Brownlee in
disguise
just disguise what mmm no of course no
of course not
what wallpaper do you use for your
background on most of your computers I
think it this question asked all the
time but my wallpaper is called the
vision - it's made by Justin malar so I
have a link in the description if you
guys want to check it out is not only
does he have this wallpaper but tons and
tons of other awesome choices if you
could raise one pokemon in real life
which one would you choose and why so my
first instinct would be going with
something like a magic harp so you know
magic carp school you know we splash it
around and stuff however when he
involves he's a 20-foot long dragon
unfortunately then I have a 20 foot long
dragon so what am I supposed to do with
that although as someone with a 20 foot
long dragon why would I care because I
have a 20 foot long dragon never mind
that's such a really simple question
magic harp how do you feel about liquid
cooling graphics cards for the most part
I don't think liquid cooling is
necessary however in certain cases like
for example the r9 295x2 that card could
not have existed the way it does without
liquid cooling so if you guys want to
actually see a little bit more on me
talking about this alright should
already done a video with Paul from
halls hardware you guys will probably
know him from Newegg but I did a video
with him a couple months ago sitting now
and just talking all about looking cool
in graphics cards and whether it's worth
it and all that kind of stuff so I'll
have that linked in the description if
you want to hear us talk about liquid
cooling for like 10 minutes what do you
think of an iPhone 6 with a sub foliage
D display with a qHD LG g3
galaxy s5 in m8 arriving I don't think
it's going to be a big deal so right now
the iPhone 6 is remembered to have a 4.7
inch display with a resolution of 1704
by 960
now if you compare that to something
like the Moto X which also has a 4.7
inch screen but with a lower 720p
resolution I thought that was totally
fine
so I mean sure would be nice to have
1080p or 1440p but in the end I don't
really think it's going to be necessary
what are your thoughts on Google's
self-driving car so I totally understand
the driverless cars are a thing they're
going to be a thing that that's okay
with me
but this is not really selling me on the
whole idea right like okay yeah that has
anyone from Google take a look at a
Tesla
that's a futuristic electric car it's
awesome and it looks nice this uh not so
much so uh I'm sure the tech is awesome
I'm sure the car is really cool but as
long as it looks like this then yeah
this is unrelated to tech but what is
your favorite food Pizza why is that
even a question like is there a food
that's actually better than Pizza
because if there is there isn't if you
guys have any more questions feel free
to hit me up on Twitter Facebook and
Google+ and of course all those links as
well as everything else I talked about
will be in the description of this video
anyway guys thank you so much for
watching and I will catch you in the
next one you're going out in that
seriously</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
