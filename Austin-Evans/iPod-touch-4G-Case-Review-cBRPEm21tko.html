something a little bit different from my
normal videos I'm going to be reviewing
an iPod Touch 4th generation case so
basically this is the case I have you
guys can see here it's actually it's
practically the exact same as from my
second generation iPod Touch I'm
actually yeah I still have it right here
I've had that case for a long time and
so when it came time to go ahead and buy
this new one definitely wanted to get
another one of the same because I was
very impressed with it so this is going
to be a really simple reviews and I'm
gonna be a really a real review I'm just
gonna talk about it for a minute but uh
yeah so let's go ahead just give you
guys a little tour around it so it is a
very well-built case it's raw it's kind
of rubberized on the exact term for it
but it feels pretty much like you know
kind of firm rubber of course it does
have a nice hole for your camera as well
as your microphone um one thing I really
like about this case I was really
pleased when I got it was you guys might
not be able to see there but there's a
little bit of our Ridge over the
sleep/wake button I was one of my big
problems with the iPod Touch 4th
generation it's kind of hard to get over
there but from now you can go ahead and
actually press it from the top there so
it definitely does work pretty well same
goes for the volume buttons there it's
kinda hard to show on camera maybe you
guys can see that but they're raised up
so you can go ahead and press them very
nicely I do like this case a lot just as
much as I liked I use the one for my 2nd
generation for like almost a year so I'm
definitely very glad that I do have this
one all the cutouts are great it's all
good another thing about this case
though is it's actually a little bit uh
well it's not one of these name-brand
cases I can't stand paying a lot of
money for cases I mean just it just kind
of just really makes me mad
so this is one of these kind of no-name
cases you know different websites will
have it listed as different names but
however I will have a link to where i
bought it from on amazon.com in the
description you know I bought that I
picked up this case for like five
dollars in like thirty cents or
something absolutely I'm loving it so
far it gives a lot of protection it's
billed practically the exact same as my
other case which I like I said I use for
quite a while so definitely very
impressed with it I love the look where
you know you still see the metal you can
still see the iPod and everything like
that and however it does get plenty of
protection trust me guys on this one
this one's built exactly the same and I
dropped my second generation quite a few
different signs case always took care of
no problem so again guys go ahead check
it out in the description I'll have a
link where you can go ahead and check it
out you can't find it in different
places but that's probably just the best
way to do it so if you guys are still if
you got your iPod Touch 4th generation
you still don't have a case for it this
is definitely a fantastic way to go I'm
really enjoying this case and yeah so
definitely go ahead and check it out if
you're interested anyway guys thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
