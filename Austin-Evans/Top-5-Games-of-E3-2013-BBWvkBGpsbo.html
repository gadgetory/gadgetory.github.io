here with the top five games of e320
what crazy new cheer hey guys this is
Austin and today use the top five games
at e3
don't start so today I'm here joined by
Lamarr Wilson so we both spent pre-much
all week at e3 check out all the new
games the new xbox new playstation so
we're going to take a look at the top 5
best games of the show number 5 we have
new super Luigi u so you definitely
spend a lot of time playing this one
what you think man I loved it was first
almost nice too for Luigi to finally get
his own game as they pour a guy they
this is like this de stepchild but he
gotta get his own game is very Mario I'm
Mike you know the power-ups and you run
it through you know through the maze
whatnot through the maze but through the
land I I thoroughly enjoyed it I think
was just super fun it looks like a lot
of fun
yeah and they even with two-player like
like say you know Louie just bought to
follow the other person you have a pant
that could draw like a block to stop you
from falling yeah yeah I can guide you
long ways like it was just fun like it
requires you have friends and since I
don't have any I'm not sure what I'm
gonna do yeah yeah and number four we
have watchdogs now this is one of the
most main games I actually really wanted
to see what movie here so you guys
haven't seen it it's kind of like Grand
Theft Auto open in the future so it's a
big open world game with vehicles on
like little girl but she plays a guy who
can pretty much hack anything and
everything so you see him like walking
by you like steal people's bank account
information like hack ATMs security
camera and I want to be pretty much
anything else all kinds of just awesome
stuff did you actually get much I guess
see it a little bit I'm glad that it's a
biggest basis Chicago would yeah yeah
exactly which is awesome because you can
hack the heck out of Chicago that's why
I left I think I need to do with that
yeah and number three we have Ryse son
of Rome now this was such a cool looking
game I mean it's going to get you an
Xbox one exclusive and it's made by the
guys who make Crysis 3 which is how
that's still one of the best-looking PCM
and they're and they're they're great so
you know yes this looks great
yeah so basically the kind of the idea
is that you're going to be a Roman
general and you're leading your troops
up and the demo they show was their cat
storming a castle or some kind of four
or whatever and it was such a cool thing
is it unlike a whole bunch of enemies
coming at you exactly yeah and that's
actually one of the cool things about
the new Xbox one and PlayStation is that
they can have massive open well not
necessarily
Oakland worlds but huge worlds lots of
stuff going on tons and tons of enemies
jumps everywhere you go yeah it looked
like a ton of fun and not only that but
it's also going to be a launch title for
the Xbox one that's probably the number
one game I'm gonna be getting cuz the
other way you gotta buy it yeah exactly
there's a lot of other games that you
know be coming out on PC whatever but as
far as like actual exclusives for the
Xbox Quon rice in a room definitely one
of the best games and number two we have
Mario Kart 8 now this is another Wii U
game and you you really love this this
was man I first of all the graphics yeah
seriously the graphics are just they
clean everything up it is it is aren't
comparable with any HD console that's
out now or even the Xbox one and ps4
which do we use way less powerful yeah
records so Nintendo was able to pull
something up and even with dual screens
when you're when you're challenging
someone the quality stays there and it's
really fun I really like the part when
you when you're running you can even
write on the wall I guess anti-gravity
mmm-hmm and you even have a glider pop
out where you're going to you know
trying to get across
yeah what is it like jumping yeah Joe
get you gotta go all that all the way
back yeah waiting step back and man it
is it is just fun I had a chance to play
what I just seen we played a best of
three cuz she said she could beat me I
said I could be her and the end there
she beat me a glider didn't work nobody
did I was there I watched that's what I
heard did not malfunction she gave me
the wheel she took the pair was no it's
not my fault I can't get beat well I did
yesterday hey number one we have
battlefield 4 now this game really
surprised me so I was just expecting
that battlefield 3 like HD version
whatever but this thing looks awesome
dude I saw people shooting down a
skyscraper yeah seriously live guns and
missiles don't like and it was crashing
down I was like what yeah that's one of
the things I like about battlefield
really is that you can you can't do that
I call it dude you destroy pretty much
well not anything but a ton of a ton of
stuff in there and it just it just makes
the game that much more fun you can run
different vehicles and the graphics the
graphics the graphics have always been
better than call of duty and most people
think at least it was awesome and
there's
a lot of other cool stuff like obviously
battlefield has always had big Maps but
on the Xbox one PlayStation 4 PC a lot
of maps even bigger there's like stuff
like like you were saying skyscrapers
that fall it was just a lot of stuff
going on a lot of players supported it
looks awesome I can't wait you get to
kill lots of people
lots of people well I'll be able to kill
lots of people
I mean take to the week yeah there was
some other games that while they weren't
quite playable on the show floor there
definitely get some honorable mentions
so there's a new Halo game so that was
kind of a bit of a surprise yeah it was
kind of showed a trailer yeah yeah we
were in the middle of Xbox event and no
one knew what this game was you see some
guy with a cloak walking through a
desert all sudden is uh you know top
thing when you call it the hood hood
back I'll say this Master Chief room
it's like what it's like halo 2014 name
we don't anything except Master Chief is
in a desert and you find some giant
relic thing but you know cool Xbox game
yeah I think it will be coming for the
Xbox one
which makes it exclusive yeah yeah so
another one is going to be Mirror's Edge
2 I was uh I got a little excited yeah I
saw this one you got a little more than
low side and I almost walked away with a
little too excited it's awesome
you're such one I still think it's one
of the best looking you know current gen
consoles it look great looks really hard
for me to play though cuz yeah I just
failed at it miserably but it's a great
game that's definitely the new Super
Smash Brothers game yeah now I sucked at
that game I'm very open about it I I
cannot play to save my life people put
million dollars on the table good now
man but I like playing it just for the
just to get beat really bad it's such a
it's such a fun game fun usually really
big into fighting games but like brawl
was probably the that's literally the
only game I really own for the week yeah
I'm definitely picking it up it's only
going to be coming to the Wii U but also
the three years oh okay I'm just cool
eggs I think like cartoony graphics for
the 3ds it's not just like a downgrade
version like it actually looks kind of
like a little bit like a fist exactly
