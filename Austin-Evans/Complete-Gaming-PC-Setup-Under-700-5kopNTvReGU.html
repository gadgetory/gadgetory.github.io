own computer is one thing what if you
want an entire set up for $700 not only
can you get a solid pc but pretty much
all the accessories you need kicking
things off is the aoc i 2367 monitor
this used to be my main display and for
$130 you're actually getting a lot it's
rocking a 23 inch 1080p IPS display this
force totally respectable color on
contrast while it might not be the most
high red screen in the world 1080p is
still a good sweet spot for gaming
viewing angles aren't bad and while it
does like speakers i usually don't find
much use for monitor speakers anyway it
absolutely looks the part too with a
thin bezel and dual HDMI inputs which is
connected to the boson 3.0 this is one
of my PC builds that comes in at $350
and can handle most games on at least
medium at 1080p with an SSD along with
the decent graphics card I've already
done a video on all the parts and a more
detailed look at performance as well as
a full tutorial on how to put it
together if you guys want to check that
out but this is absolutely the heart of
the set up next up we've got the Tomoko
MMC Oh 23 keyboard well there are plenty
of cheap membrane keyboards out there
moving up to mechanical makes a huge
difference it has the same satisfying
sound and feel of a mechanical switch
with a more compact 87 key design which
I usually prefer over options with a
number-pad
it's solidly built and while you won't
find flashy LEDs you do have blue key
switches which are fairly similar to the
corresponding MX blues you'll find a
more expensive keyboards for less than
$40 it's an easy choice to go with over
a normal membrane option to go along
with it we have the Logitech g600 Mouse
well usually wired is the way to go for
a gaming mouse the G 602 works
surprisingly well Wireless it comes with
a USB dongle to keep latency to a
minimum and importantly it's also
comfortable in the hand
like most Logitech mice it might not be
pretty but it gets the job done with a
series of programmable buttons along the
left side along with a switch to adjust
dpi which goes up to 2500 the tracking
is smooth and reliable and Logitech
quotes around 250 hours of battery life
with the included double-a batteries for
$55 the G 602 is a solid choice to go
along with the mouse and keyboard we've
got a giant gaming pad from the glorious
pc gaming race because they know who
they're selling to this is the extended
version which is easily big enough to
fit everything with plenty of room to
spare as a desk mat but you can also get
a smaller version that's dedicated for
just your mouse well you can absolutely
get away without a mouse pad with the G
602 this goes a long way toward rounding
out the
set up for audio we've got one of my
absolute favorites right now the status
cb1 headphones these have been living in
my bag everywhere I go for a few weeks
now and they pack some serious sound
they reminds me a lot of the audio
technica ath in 50s but I actually
prefer the CB ones they deliver richer
audio with better soundstage I'm by no
means an audiophile but there's
something special about the sound out of
the CB ones it doesn't hurt that they're
well built and have nice soft padding to
make them comfortable for longer
listening periods along with a
detachable coil cable that locks into
place
for $80 I've got to say I'm a big fan to
go along with the CB ones we've got a
satochi headphone stand on top of being
a nice place to keep your headphones
they're solidly built out of aluminium
and come in a few different colors you
can also plug your headphones straight
into the stand to get audio over USB
Meli does this keep your cables a bit
cleaner but it also works as a USB hub
you get three USB 3.0 ports on the base
of the stand which is handy to plug a
few accessories and easily at $35 it
might be a bit pricey but it goes a long
way toward making the setup pop as
always you can mix and match pieces of
the setup and I'll have all the links
you need in the description but for $700
including the gaming PC I think this is
a killer way to get into PC gaming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
