the demo of Siri voice dictation for the
new iPad so this is a feature that's
been on the iPhone 4s for a little while
now however this is the first time the
Syria has been ported in any way shape
or form at least officially to any other
Apple device so before I show you it on
the iPad let me just give you a little
demo of how it works on the iPhone this
is a test of Siri voice dictation so as
you guys can see here it only takes
maybe a second or two and there we go
this is a test of Siri voice dictation
let's go and try that exact same thing
on the iPad and see how well it picks it
up so go ahead and create a new note
here and again just like you can see on
the iPhone there is a little microphone
button here this is a test of Siri voice
dictation and actually I think it works
a little bit faster on the iPad but you
guys can see here it's totally identical
and of course let's say well you know do
we want to do something a little bit
more complicated I am now using Siri
voice dictation on the new iPad period
this is a test and hopefully you should
show everyone how well it does or
doesn't work period so again very very
quick you can see here it went really
quickly how well it does yeah everything
seems to be perfect but let's say it's
something isn't quite right so let's say
I said anyone instead everyone which
actually is not the case but couldn't do
that so we can actually just type it out
so if there's any little typos or any
problem like that you can simply fix it
up and it's no big deal so you know guys
it's a quick little demo of Siri voice
dictation now this is not the full
series so you can you know ask you
questions or anything like that
there definitely is helpful if you do
have a Wi-Fi 3G or 4G connection you can
go ahead and have it you know really
accurately dictate your voice if you
enjoyed definitely be sure to leave this
video a thumbs up and if you're
interested in more videos on the new
iPad be sure to head up this playlist
where you can see all of my other new
iPad videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
