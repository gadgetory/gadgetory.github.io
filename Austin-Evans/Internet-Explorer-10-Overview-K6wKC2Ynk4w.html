Internet Explorer 10 so you guys heard
me right this is already Internet
Explorer 10 explored mine just was
released not too long ago however
Microsoft is already hard at work at the
next iteration of their browser so let
me give you guys a quick little overview
of what all is new now before we begin
anything I want to point this out this
is a platform preview this is not a beta
this is not an alpha this is really
really early in the development and as
such they are not using any UI at all as
you guys can see this is just a super
super basic UI don't worry this is not
going to what this is not going to be
what the final version of Internet
Explorer 10 looks like at all this is
just purely for testing the browser I'm
sure they'll have a nice shiny UI with
tabs and a back button and all that kind
of good stuff a little bit later on so
there are a couple of key things that
are brand new and explore chin let me
demo them both for you so the first one
is a support for css3 now this is a
pretty big deal of course a couple of
the other major browsers such as Firefox
and Chrome now do support this as you
can see here in Explorer 10 does as well
so purely using css3 we can go ahead and
take a look at a couple of different
gradients if you're not really
technically inclined you probably I kind
of know or care about what this means
whoever drew web developers definitely
really nice to hear that Internet
Explorer 10 is really saying ride up
along with everyone else it's not
falling behind like they have done in
the past another benchmark I'd like to
show you is the fishbowl now again these
are all in an Explorer 10 specific
benchmarks however they do work in other
browsers as you can see here this works
really quite nicely
this dish Bowl is basically an html5 so
this is all done html5 there's no flash
or Java or anything like that it's all
running in html5 it's being accelerated
by the GPU this is something that
Internet Explorer has been really while
lather Microsoft has been pushing with
Internet Explorer since the version 9
and they've improved the compatibility
and all that kind of stuff in Internet
Explorer 10 now my screen recorder might
show this looking a little bit laggy but
as you guys can see here it's running
nice and buttery smooth about 50 frames
per second really quite nice now as far
as speed tests and all that kind of
stuff this has only come out this
morning so I haven't had my time to run
all the tests I would like to hilber in
my you know I spent about an hour so
testing it against a couple of
as well as an explorer 9 and overall
I've got to say it's actually really
impressively fast now I wasn't expecting
too much of this obviously an explorer 9
just finished out they haven't had a
whole lot of time to work on it but what
the tweaks and mods and all that kind of
stuff that they've done have it
substantially increased the speed it
seems to be a decent bit faster than in
explorer 9 and even in some tests it is
approaching or even surpassing chrome 10
which is pretty much the fastest browser
around so definitely very good news
looks like that Microsoft's going to
continue to keep the eye on the speed
not let internet explorer fall behind
the pack like they have done in the past
anyway guys that's it for my first look
at Internet Explorer 10 if you're
interested in learning more
feel free to download it for yourself
I'll have a link in the description of
this video you can download it it is
available for both of Microsoft Windows
Vista and Windows 7 so download it give
it a shot and let me know what you think
