here with the speed test between the
brand-new iPad Mini and full-sized iPad
4 with two very different screen sizes
and internals let's take a look to see
how the new iPad stack up my first test
is Geekbench
and that that measures the overall
performance of everything from
smartphones to PCs the iPad 4 is rockin
and newer and more powerful Apple a6
chip which is clocked higher and has
twice as much RAM as the iPad Mini which
gives it a big advantage here with a
final score of 1765 compared to 753 on
the mini next up we have SunSpider which
will give you a good idea of how each
tablet will handle a complicated website
using Safari this doesn't take into
account the different screen sizes which
definitely favors the iPad 4 for giving
you more screen real estate to work with
but the numbers don't lie here again the
iPad smokes the mini being nearly twice
as fast to test gaming performance I use
geo benchmark which is a great way to
test the graphical horsepower it runs to
a complex Egypt scene which stress tests
even the most powerful of tablets as you
can see here this is really where the
iPad 4 shines with its quad core
graphics able to punch our awesome
results even while pushing all the
pixels on that Retina display the iPad
Mini is no slouch here either with the
results on par with most tablets out
today to make things a bit fairer I took
the screen size out of the equation and
ran it again in the off screen mode the
iPad 4 averaged 50 frames per second
while the iPad Mini pulls in just 14
while on paper the iPad 4 is faster I'm
practically always the iPad Mini does
need less power to work with a smaller
screen and of course you're paying quite
a bit less if you're interested in
winning an iPad Mini be sure to check
out my giveaway here and if you enjoyed
don't forget to hit that like button
anyway I will catch you guys in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
