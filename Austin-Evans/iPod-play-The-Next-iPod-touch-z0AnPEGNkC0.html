video little something different I'm
going to be talking about an idea I had
I figured i would share with you guys
see what you all thought now of course
as you all probably know the iphone the
ipod touch you really just tremendous I
mean they're just taking off apples just
breaking in the cache mean they just
sell some of them it's not even funny
I'm however one thing that I really see
there is an opportunity with is the ipod
touching gaming now if you take a look
at perhaps you know like a DS or PSP and
indeed the only three DS in the PSP two
which will be coming soon you'll see
that you know the ipod touch is actually
getting fairly close to actually being
able to match them you know especially
when you consider the App Store which
with Chaz near very very very cheap
games as compared to you know I'll take
for example recently the EA put a lot of
their games on sale and you know I
picked up need for speed for a dollar
whereas that same title probably 30 35
years forty dollars on some of the other
hand held so you see here the value is
there and the idea of just downloading
everything really is going for the ipod
touch however in my opinion there is one
major downside which is the fact that
there are no physical buttons now first
of all don't get me wrong I'm a big fan
of the touchscreen a lot of games such
as you know angry birds and many many
others that use the touchscreen controls
are really really fun you know there's a
lot of really innovative stuff however a
lot of other apps i would say probably
the majority would you be well much
better served if they actually had
physical buttons so i'm looking at
racing games first-person shooters
sports games or the list goes on and on
but if you actually had you know a d-pad
a couple of you know side buttons maybe
you know some joysticks whatever
shoulder ones i don't know how those
said but if they could get that on the
ipod touch i think it would be really
really cool so in my kind of theory and
of course do keep mind this is not you
know based on rumors or anything I this
is just kind of my idea just wanted to
bounce off you guys in this idea what
would you guys think of you there was an
ipod touch me called the ipod play or
something like that that was separate
from the ipod touch so you go ahead and
buy yourself with standard ipod touch or
you get an ipod play and though i just
want to work with it has somewhat
similar to the PSP go you can quit and
slide it down you have more button maybe
a couple
joysticks or something of course keeping
all the standard features such as the
touchscreen everything just in addition
as well as better battery life so maybe
perhaps they could use some extra space
for a more more battery larger battery
how do they wanted to do it you know
that's one thing I've noticed with the
ipod touch like recently I did I was
doing some gaming I do keep in mind this
is Athena the brightness up bluetooth on
you know playing a very intense game but
I was almost able to drain the entire
battery down to about twenty five
percent from fully charged about an
hour's so you know the battery life is
pretty good normally but when you really
get into intense games especially over
Wi-Fi now let's kind of stuff it can
drain the battery fairly quickly so if
they were able to go ahead and you know
just do the same Mountain fog when
you're the same specs same touch screen
everything with some slight out controls
and a bigger battery for probably a
little bit more what are you going to be
interested now personally I think it
would be great i think that if it had
physical controls and better battery
life it could absolutely compete against
you know the psp2 and the 3ds but would
you guys be really interested in that
you know if you had to pay a little bit
more to go ahead and get that would you
be interested would that be a good idea
that idea definitely let me know in the
comments on personally I think it'll be
pretty cool but of course that's why I'm
making this video to kind of discuss it
with you guys so anyway guys thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
