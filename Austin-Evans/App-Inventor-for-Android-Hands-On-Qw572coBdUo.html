give you a full hands-on of app inventor
for android so this is a really really
cool tool that allows you to create your
own android applications from inside
your browser you and you don't even need
to know code absolutely just glad just
jump right in so I'm going to go ahead
and create a new and just create a
project named let's say this will be a
project really I know a great name but
so we go ahead and start it up and as
you guys can see it's really really
pretty interesting as it's not all that
difficult to understand so the main
thing is just go ahead and create it so
as you can see here you have all kinds
of different things so for example we
can go ahead and grab a button drag it
over here and now have a button you can
do a lot of different things such as an
image a text box we're just going I'm
just gonna drag a couple things in here
just to kind of give you guys a sense
for how it works you can go down here
and go media so you can actually go
ahead and add like sound or video player
you can go ahead and add animations you
can actually even had this drop it in
here and actually make a phone call so
you guys should just hit a button from
inside your app and make a phone call on
your android phone it's really cool
let's go ahead just clear out some of
this stuff here and I second actually
show you guys how it works I'm such this
go ahead just let this button so let's
say we want to customize the button oh
you're on the right side we'll see
properties and there are actually quite
a few things and go ahead and do the
alignment actually make a custom image
background color there are a lot of
things do the font go ahead and pick the
width I mean yeah the width and
everything so let's go ahead just let's
just do something random let's do 130
let's make a giant button so let's do 1
30 by 1 30 scroll down just a little bit
so we go now we have a giant button now
we can go ahead and do all kinds of
stuff let's go ahead and do a phone call
so let's drag that in here and let's
just call a number say 155 555 555 555
hopefully nobody has that number so we
can go ahead just do that and there we
go so if you click that button right now
it will go ahead and give a call that
number and you can do a lot of other
things you can actually go ahead
so let's go and come back over here to
the button I mean I should go ahead and
do an image so let's say let's say this
was you want to create your own custom
app just to go ahead and take all your
best friend okay so you can go ahead and
take this image and you go ahead and add
an image of your best friend click the
button and it will just call him using
your phone I know it's really it's not
all it's not all that useful it's kind
of it's not a little stupid but I mean
this just kind of goes to show you there
are a lot of different things I'm so did
you go ahead and go through a couple
others can go ahead and actually
activate the accelerometer location even
the Orient orientation so there's a lot
of things that you can actually go ahead
it's not just like you know a little bit
of text this and that so let me go ahead
and just do one thing in here let's go
ahead and delete all this stuff right
here and let's just do one thing so
let's go ahead and jump over here and
let's grab a video players let's drop it
in here and then let's go ahead and just
choose a file so I already have one of
my videos so let's what and just drag
and drop that in there and it would give
it just a second so I'm going to create
a little bit of an app to actually go
ahead and play a video so we're going to
go ahead and play a video and while it's
uploading let's come over here and let's
add a text box so we're gonna go ahead
and have a text box down here honestly
pretty much everything alone except it's
going to say I type here okay so really
simple so go ahead and do that and there
we go so this is our appt this is going
to be a video player and a little text
box so once we're ready we can come up
here and hit package phone and go ahead
and go ahead and download actually to
your connected android phone or you can
go ahead and download the computer so
i'm going to go ahead and do this now be
right back okay so let's just go ahead
and show you guys my hat so go ahead
just open it up here and there it is so
it's nothing all that exciting I'm
finish quickly I can show you the type
here so we can say hello in this box and
up here if we want to click on me I
should go ahead and watch the video so
nothing all that exciting like i said
but there is a lot more you can do with
this especially there's i didn't even
show you the block editor which is
pretty in depth where you can actually
go a lot farther than you know
dragon dropping a few UI elements so
it's really cool so guys I definitely
recommend go ahead check it out if
you're interested in making an Android
apps it's not all that difficult and
it's a really really cool deal anyway
guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
