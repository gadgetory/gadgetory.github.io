the video going over the Windows 8
release preview with the latest version
of Windows getting closer and closer to
a final release the OS is getting much
better but is it going to be a solid
upgrade if you tried the consumer
preview a few months ago you'll see that
much of Windows 8 is the same the Metro
UI is very much still here and basically
unchanged which means that you'll have
an interface which works very well for
tablets and touchscreens
surprisingly good on a laptop with a
multi-touch trackpad and a bit awkwardly
with just a mouse and keyboard the
standard Windows classic interface is
also still included right now it looks
just like Windows 7 with the start
button removed and a new more Metro
reskin however Microsoft is already
showing off screenshots of what it will
look like when Windows 8 shifts later
this year and it does entirely away with
Aero in favour of a much more basic
style there are some new features in the
release preview for starters the Metro
version of Internet Explorer 10 now has
a stripped-down version of Flash it only
works on sites Microsoft is whitelisted
but it is nice if you want to watch
YouTube in Metro full flash is still
available in the classic version of IE
10 and in standard browsers there are
also some new Metro apps such as the
Bing News app it works similarly to
Flipboard with a variety of stories that
expand out into full-screen mode when
viewing them there's also a new
wikipedia app that allows you to view
everything in a very nice Metro
interface something that continuously
impresses me is just how great Metro
apps can look especially when you
consider that these apps are designed
with everything from a tablet to a
desktop in mind probably the biggest
improvement in the preview is speed
Windows 7 was a major improvement over
Vista as far as responsiveness went and
Windows 8 looks to be another leap
especially if you're rocking a system
with an SSD that to happen very quickly
and the entire OS just seems to respond
immediately even when switching between
Metro and the classic desktop ever since
Microsoft showed off the Metro UI and
the approach they've taken with Windows
8 I've been firmly on the fence until I
was able to try the whole picture for
myself with this new release preview I
had to say that I'm finally impressed
for tablets and laptops this seems like
a very innovative and new OS and even on
a desktop you can use it like a faster
more responsive Windows 7 Microsoft is
still promising more new features and
surprises between now and the release
likely in October but in the meantime
you can feel free to download the
release preview for yourself and give it
a shot you might just be surprised if
you enjoyed this video definitely be
sure to leave it a thumbs up and if
