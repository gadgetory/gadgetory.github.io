very well might be the most overkill
gaming monitor of all time this is the
49 inch samsung q leg gaming monitor do
not open here open opposite side I have
to descend a whole thing again now I
just thought there's a little label on
the side of the box that this is Samsung
decks compatible you of course what else
would you want to connect your Galaxy s8
to other than a 49 inch gaming monitor
I'm gonna have to set this down for
second man oh that's better so we get
what looks like a bracket to mount it as
well as a ton of cables Wow all right I
think you should really say something
when the monitors stand is bigger than
most other monitors by themselves dude
so heavy it's like everything about this
monitor is what you expect to see except
twice as big and twice as ridiculous
this is a curved monitor what are we
doing wait huh hold on hold on hold on
how are you supposed to do this I don't
even have enough room here and now we've
got the full 32 by 9q LED gaming minor
out of the packaging this I feel like
I'm just repeating myself but this is
the most ridiculous thing ever I mean
look at that oh oh this is a wall
bracket you know when you want to mount
your 49 inch gaming monitor to the wall
hey Jimmy can I borrow you for a second
are we securing now is this going to
break my try to pick it up all right
Jimmy certified this is actually the
first time that a product has broken our
filming area it's literally just too big
like it just doesn't fit anywhere so
around back not only are you getting a
pair of HDMI ports but you're also
getting DisplayPort may DisplayPort
audio end audio out as well as two more
USB 3.0 ports but the real start of the
show is well this side so with
everything set up you can see this is uh
this is something special so the
resolution of this guy is 3840 by 1080
so you can essentially think of this as
two 1080p monitors so take a couple of
Windows here I easily have enough room
for say that throw up a web browser over
on this side there's just so much room
for activities okay well so one of my
questions with this would be do any
games actually support this ridiculous
32 by 9 aspect ratio as you can see csgo
kind of does I don't know why it's
slowly expanding out here but we got it
for the most part this is ridiculous so
in a game like csgo you're seeing that
especially on the edges it actually
looks like it's almost a bit of a
fisheye effect but that is so trippy I
feel like the moles playing this in VR
just because it completely takes out my
peripheral vision making things even
better is that not only does it support
a hundred and forty four Hertz refresh
rate which really this sort of add to
the immersion but it also is a free sync
enable display so right now I'm playing
on a little bit of a lower-end system
with an RX 480
but I'm still getting like 140 150
frames per second definitely enough to
saturate the monitor and it's so cool
especially in csgo you can see it some
things are a little bit oddly shaped
for example the map and some of the the
HUD elements look a little bit warps
just because they're so stretched across
such a giant monitor but that's a small
price to pay for having something that
looks this awesome next you have pop G
however there's a problem
Meli is his head slightly cut off but
the the settings menu doesn't exactly
work on this monitor so let's see if
this actually will work
all right so in the game it seems like
everything is running reasonably well I
will say though that it is very obvious
that this is a crop so even though we're
running at the full resolution you can
see that like a lot of the bottom and
the top of the screen have been cut off
so instead of getting something that's
wider we're actually just getting
something that's been
sort of chopped I'm curious to see how
that actually affects gameplay that crop
is actually really serious I'm basically
only singing from his shoulders up now
for a game like pub G yeah it's probably
gonna be the end of the world it is nice
to be able to kind of see little bit of
a wider field of view but it's not quite
that same experience without being able
to pull out the POV I get it they don't
want to give people an unfair advantage
by having a super wide monitor but I
also don't like the idea of having so
much as this cropped performance wise
though it's not too bad with this system
we did crank it down to low settings but
because we have free sync everything is
pretty smooth even though we're around
40 to 50 frames per second I can't get
away from the idea that this looks
really cool oh yeah so now we have GTA 5
and actually again this is a game that
does seem to support that full aspect
ratio I'm actually kind of impressed by
how old games are supported by this so
not only is it kind of cool to be able
to get that wider field of view which
you also have to keep in mind that it's
not going to be that crazy to drive sure
is a very very large monitor but it's
only a 38 40 by 1080 display that's
going to be wide bits we're not going to
be that much more than someone like say
a 1440p monitor and of course with free
sync if you do have an AMD graphics card
you're going to be getting those extra
smooth frame rates next up we have dirt
for now I feel like a racing game is
really perfect for something like this
to get that full widescreen experience
now the menus don't support the full
resolution but I'm hoping the game does
know I'm really disappointed yeah this
is so cool yeah this is totally perfect
I mean honestly I keep making the
comparison with a VR headset but it does
kind of feel like that obviously it's
not that fully immersive experience but
you're getting something that is pretty
much taking up your whole field of view
you look I'm gonna give Samsung props
this is a ridiculous monitor very very
few people are probably going to buy it
but it's just cool I'm just glad that
someone just decided hey let's take a
pair of super high refresh rate monitors
glue them together and make some giant
monstrosity that actually is kind of
cool now scratch that it's really cool
so does anyone actually need a 49 inch
gaming lighter of course not but I will
say it's actually not as impractical as
I thought it would be yeah it's gonna be
a little bit unwieldy and you do have to
have a pretty decent PC to drive it but
it's actually really pretty well done
so as always the link to check this guy
out will be in the description I'm
curious what do you think about this
overkill monster let me know in the
comments below and I will catch you on
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
