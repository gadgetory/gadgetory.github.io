homes are surprisingly old-school I
think it's about time to do something
like that welcome to the ultimate smart
home this is a project I've been wanting
to do for a long time there's just so
much cool home tech out there first is
the nest smart thermostat the nest helps
to save on your power bill by learning
your habits to keep from running your
air and heat while you're away but you
can also control it via Wi-Fi installing
the nest is pretty straightforward it
comes with all the accessories you need
and the instructions are very helpful
using the nest is pretty easy so the
metal ring around it will allow you to
adjust things like temperature as well
as go through menus when you want to
make a selection you just press the
entire thermostat in you can also
control the nest from an app on your
phone so it works on Android and iOS and
it basically allows you do all the same
things you could do if your action in
front of the thermostat however because
it's based on Wi-Fi you can do pretty
much anywhere you can quickly set the
temperature using the app along with
checking the current status of your home
set a schedule and even check your
energy history so this is really cool
but now let's check out a Piper Piper NV
is a customizable security system that
includes a camera that you can access
from anywhere with no monthly fee
installing the Piper and B is going to
be pretty easy all we need to do are put
in the included batteries as a backup
plug Piper in and connect it to your
Wi-Fi and you're good to go you can
mount it basically anywhere but I have
mine on a floating shelf in my studio
basically everything on Piper can be
controlled using the app my favorite
feature is the ability to monitor the
camera from anywhere you can pan around
and see basically the entire room and
even have Piper automatically record
when it detects motion or a loud noise
in addition to the built-in sensors for
things like temperature and humidity
there are also door and window sensors
that connect a piper along with a smart
light dimmer not only can you use Piper
to hear what's going on in the room but
you can also use it as a two-way
intercom so you're looking at me through
Piper right now in addition to having a
massive 180 degree field of view there's
also a night vision mode that
automatically comes on when it gets dark
okay so Piper is armed if it detects any
motion it should set it off so I'm gonna
try to sneak in the air use my super
stealthy ninja skills and try to steal
the box that's right in front of it I
don't like my chances
scale
so the guys over Piper were cool enough
to give me one extra Piper and V to give
away to you guys so all you do is check
out the link in the description of this
video for your chance to win so that's
it for this first episode of the
ultimate smart home but what products do
you guys want to see next definitely be
sure to let me know in the comments
below anyway guys thank you so much for
watching and I will catch you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
