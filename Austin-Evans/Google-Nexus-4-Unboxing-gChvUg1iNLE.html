here with an unboxing of the google
nexus 4 with android 4.2 a quad-core
processor and a purely stock google
experience it has a lot to offer so
let's take a look the box comes with a
sleeve over it but it slides up easily
enough there are a couple pieces of tape
holding it close but a knife makes quick
work of them pop the lid and we have the
nexus for itself at first glance it's
very similar to the Galaxy Nexus but
we'll take a closer to look in one
minute continuing on with the unboxing
you'll find the safety info along with a
quick start guide micro USB cable for
charging and syncing USB power adapter
for juicing up the phone and a tiny sim
eject tool to get at the SEM tray peel
off the protective plastic you'll find
the almost all Gorilla Glass Nexus 4
it's a bit hard to catch on video but
the back is covered in tiny dots that
appear and disappear depending on the
lighting which looks really cool over on
the left side you'll see the volume
rocker and a tray which houses your
micro Sam up top is a microphone for
noise cancellation in your headphone
jack the right is mostly blank with the
exception of your log button and on the
bottom there's the primary microphone
and microUSB port around back is where
you'll find the 8 megapixel camera
capable of 1080p video and the LED flash
and finally on the top right of the
phone you'll see the 1.3 megapixel
front-facing camera and the speaker
grill the star is definitely the 4.7
inch IPS display with a resolution of
1280 by 768 the Nexus 4 is running
Android 4.2 jelly bean which is
incredibly smooth thanks to the
quad-core Snapdragon s4 pro processor
the phone is slightly shorter and wider
than other phones of a similar size as
you can see here compared to the samsung
galaxy s3 and galaxy note 2 so there you
have it my unboxing of the brand new
google nexus 4 if you're interested more
