another episode d3 live and actually
it's going to be a little bit different
today so today we're going to be talking
all about Google Chrome OS as well as
the cr-48 so if you missed it I was
actually fortunate enough to receive one
of these from google and of course I'm
going to be doing a lot more videos
about it and i'll be doing review and
everything but for today on d3 live it's
going to be all about questions chrome
OS is a very different animal than what
you might find in your windows or mac or
linux so i want to go ahead and take
this opportunity to talk a little bat it
answer some questions because like i
said it's very different and you know a
lot of people don't quite understand the
whole premise behind chrome OS so we're
should when take a bunch of questions
today and hopefully help you guys
understand Chrome OS a little bit better
oh yeah guys so can Chrome OS play
starcraft 2 no can't the thing with
chrome OS and not you'll find these came
as quite a few times is that it is a
browser it's not like a typical computer
that you're used to there's no desktop
there's no menu there's no programs when
we turn on the computer you log in and
you're in chrome there's no minimize it
doesn't go away you're the whole OS is
chrome so you know you're not able to
install any programs or anything like
that now there are some workarounds with
this you do have web apps such as Gmail
grooveshark a wide variety of actually
some really good web apps that can
replace a lot of stuff for example
Google Docs but there is no real gaming
besides what you can get on the internet
so um pretty much to answer your
question no you can't play starcraft 2
or any other major game like that chrome
OS will games with high requirements run
if you're talking about the this far as
the online games go no actually i think
that it should be no problem the white
horses there are quite a few obviously
flash games as well as other various
games based on html5 as far as those
games go i'm pretty sure all these
developers or keeping the chrome OS in
mind as far as you know how they develop
a one cool thing about Chrome OS because
it is a fourth based on the Internet is
that you know if you make something it's
just like a website that you go to so
it's not like I just only going to work
for Chrome OS or whatever it's going to
work on any computer with a web browser
which is definitely a very nice thing so
um as far as the system requirements go
most of that won't be an issue at all um
what does chrome have over windows I
think that's a question a lot of people
going to be asking um one of the biggest
things about it is the it's the speed no
this is going to be compared mostly to
like a netbook so you're not going to be
comparing you know chrome OS computer to
you know a really powerful desktop or
I'm accident like that you're gonna be
comparing this to perhaps a tablet or a
netbook or a lightweight laptop not
going to be comparing to something major
so as far as that goes what you're going
to be wanting to pick up chrome was for
is for the browsing so you know this
whole the whole computer is designed
around getting you on the internet
browsing quickly and you know very
simply so it's really quite fast boot of
time it takes about 10 seconds to boot
as far as putting it to sleep and waking
it up almost instant you know you close
the lid you open it you're already back
on just like you can what let it be in a
sleep mode for five minutes or five
hours or five days you're going to be
right back to where you where almost
immediately that's going to be one of
the major things and that thing is going
to be security Chrome OS is again
because it's very different from a
standard operating system like windows
it's going to be very virus proof well
okay I don't want to say firefighters
proof anything can get a virus but it's
going to be really quite good against
viruses you know it's got a lot of
security features in mind for example if
there's any kind of issue with the
operating system it will automatically
reinstall itself when you turn it on and
of course it's got a lot of really cool
things as far as the screw to go so
probably the two biggest things about is
it just going to be that you're going to
have pretty good security it's going to
be really good for browsing internet
this Chrome OS required Java no it
doesn't and that's actually a minor
negative no Chrome OS does not support
java or required or anything so for
online games such as minecraft or pretty
much anything that uses Java chrome
gloss does not currently support it now
if you want to keep in mind it does not
currently support it now chroma list is
a board in progress it is not done it's
not released you can't go buy a computer
with yet on so there's a very good
chance that new computers and as they
continue to build out chrome West they
might add features such as Java bad
however at the moment there is no java
support what happens if you plug a USB
device into it
um it depends for example i'm actually
using a mouse right now it does have the
cr-48 does have a single USB port you
can go ahead and plug in a mouse and you
know that will work just fine now as far
as other things you can plug in as far
as us being there's not a whole lot you
can go ahead and plug in USB flash
drives and USB hard drives it kind of
supports it right now it's not one
hundred percent complete but you will
probably be able to do your mouse
keyboard or may not keyboard and I want
to say that but you can't go ahead and
put mouse and its various USB drives
begins i did think that they were
planning on extending that out to a few
other things but for now just mouse and
just you know hard drive adobe flash
player run on chrome OS yes it does
chrome does have full support for both
html5 as well as flash player now on the
cr-48 that i have here flash works it's
not hardware accelerated though so
because this is only based on intel atom
chip flash can kind of get a little bit
laggy for example you really don't want
to watch any more than you know i got
360 p youtube video you're watching
videos on hulu is kind of well it is
choppy no matter what you do however
that's more of a software thing i do
believe that before chrome OS goes you
know final the flash player will be
updated with hardware acceleration would
you make all other videos and other
games run a lot smoother can you add
more storage to the notebook and install
mac OS 10 or windows as far as any
storage goes not particularly on the
this one itself does have a 16 gigabyte
solid-state drive which is not much
compared to no windows or OS 10 however
because you know chroma westerly doesn't
store anything on their 16 gigabytes is
fine this sort of the cr-48 goes yeah
you can actually hate this as much as
you want there's a little switch
underneath the battery that you will go
ahead and just you know install windows
linux OS 10 you can do whatever you want
with it so the thing is though is that
most of the chrome OS computers once
they're actually available we're not
going to be able to let you do anything
like what are the advantages against
tablets well that's i think it's going
to be one of the biggest questions about
chrome west because it's not going to be
competing with windows or OS 10 rating
which we are going to be competing with
is as a secondary device to get on the
intern
at perhaps against a tattle or make even
your smartphone such as the iphone or a
droid I'm just going to be a secondary
way to get on the internet really
quickly now as far as that goes I wish I
had the answer to that that's really
going to depend on a lot of different
factors you know one thing i do see
tablets of course this year's gonna be
big with tablets that they have a
touchscreen which Chrome OS does not now
they're very well actually might be
prone West tablets and as well as for
chrome West netbooks with a touchscreen
but for now it's just going to be you
know just like a standard netbook and so
temples do have a big advantage new you
can download apps you know play games
you know do a lot of different things
whereas Chrome OS is a lot more than
you're limited in scope so um it's it's
it's kind of a hard thing I can't just
say one's better than the other but
tablets do give you a lot more you know
different features and more things that
you can do with it in you stream online
videos faster than firefox or safari
with chrome OS well that's one thing
chrome OS is basically the chrome
browser if you get down to the technical
technical bits it's a stripped-down
version of linux that runs chrome so
pretty much what you expect is the same
performance of your chrome on the pc or
mac whatever enemies chrome is a very
fast browser i would say probably the
fastest browser available maybe not in
all tests and everything but very fast
and so here you're going to be able to
browse the internet you know really
quite quickly probably a little faster
than what you if you had safari or
firefox if it was possible to install
which it is not you do have to keep
chrome but so far as online video
streaming goes that's probably going to
be more up to your internet so i think
that will make a big difference but as
far as you know just browsing chrome OS
is going to be pretty fast it's from the
West good with a dual core I wish I
could answer that the cr-48 is only a
single core intel atom processor so it's
not particularly powerful i do believe
that they actually will have dual core
atom chips and prepped even more
powerful in the future which I would
love to see this it's pretty good i mean
for example i had about 28 or 29 tabs
open the other day just cut testing it
out and it was able to open them i mean
of course it was very laggy but no
it's powerful enough where I can you
know do quite a bit but with the dual
core processor I definitely think that
would be a big step up and I would
absolutely love to see that in future
chrome West notebooks do you think the
Apple would make an itunes web app or
wet a jailbreak web app for iphone um
that's actually a pretty good thing on
this pork because this doesn't have
local storage you can't do itunes
whatever if you want to listen to music
you're going to pretty much have to find
something like grooveshark or some other
online streaming that's pretty much the
only way you're going to be able to do
it I personally not a big fan of
grooveshark I've you know I listen to
grooveshark anyway so it's no big deal
additionally I listen to it on the cr-48
now add as far as apple and iTunes goes
there have been a lot of rumors for
quite a while about you know are they
gonna have some kind of online streaming
and do you think that will eventually
happen but if it does I doubt they're
making it just for the Chrome OS I think
they're going to be doing it just for a
wide variety of things but I'm if it
does come I wouldn't be surprised
whatsoever I don't see any reason why
you couldn't do that with the cr-48 so
how long does the battery last of course
it's going to vary because the cr-48
what I have here is not going to be on
sale you're not gonna be able to buy one
of these I'm you're probably going to be
able to buy you know netbooks just like
you know what you're gonna expect to get
with windows today just with chrome OS
on them so the battery life is going to
be you know totally dependent on the
different hardware as far as let's see
our 48 goes though it's pretty good um
the official rate of battery life is
about eight hours and eight days on
standby now I haven't actually been a
whole eight hours testing it I have
tested it brought it down from about 100
since about thirty percent battery which
took me about four and a half to five
hours but do keep in mind that that was
continuously having me tabs open running
flash watching videos and everything so
I would say that eight hours does seem
pretty uh oh say that's about right um
will it have an ultra keyboard yes
unfortunately can't show you guys that
of course I'm actually stringing on the
cr-48 if you guys are well if you're in
the cheddar into that but I'm actually
string on the cr-48 so I can't quite
show you but the keyboard is actually
different and in a really good way so
some of the differences I've done is
they've actually remove the caps lock
key so now it's a search key
opens up a new tab which I love you guys
know I hate cash lock the top rope
function keys has also been removed it's
a replaced with a variety of different
buttons so you had this skate button as
you have a dedicated to go back and
forth their back and forward and the
browser refresh you can change Windows
you can go turn change the brightness of
the screen as well as the the the volume
of you your speakers in your headphones
so the keyboard yet it is changed for
Chrome OS and i gotta say absolutely
love it the cr-48 keyboard is really
nice it's got a nice Island style what
you guys I'll show you I'll talk all
about that in the review but yeah Chrome
OS will have a new keyboard and from
what I've seen so far I'm gonna let it's
a really nice keyboard if you have
multiple Ted open while they all run at
an equally fast speed no this does kind
of choked up a little bit when you start
open up a lot of tabs but again I do
want to stress that's hardware that
doesn't have anything to do with chrome
OS I know it's just got an intel atom
chip and two gigabytes of RAM so you
know when you're opening a lot of you
know multiple tabs at the same time I
think it will kind of get a little slow
down laggy little glitches both nayak
glitches but it'll be a little bit slow
but that can be totally change depending
on what kind of computers we actually
see Chrome OS I kind of them guessing
the wolf see just like a nest and what
netbook running Chrome OS but for all we
know they might be more powerful so
let's just go to depend on once it comes
out and you're what we see is there a
music player in chrome Wes not not uh
not directly la pretty much the only way
to listen to music is going to be to
actually go online to find some store
like grooveshark or something like that
there's no file browser or anything like
that then there's a rudimentary file
browser you can kind of take a look at
it but I got that's actually going to be
available when chrome OS is actually
fully done I think it's mostly just this
year are 48 and even though you can take
a look at the files there's not a whole
lot you can do with them so I do they do
plan on supporting SD cards and you know
hard drives and stuff and this does have
an SD card reader although it doesn't
actually work just yet so it will have a
file browser probably able to open you
know like images and your
PS and a few things like that but for
the most part you're not going to be
able to take a look at music and that
kind of thing when will it come out ah
you actually that's a good question it
was really original II supposed to be
out by the end of last year they had to
push that forward instead they've been
sending out a lot of these cr-48 stew
various reviewers and people to go ahead
and test them out now I have said it
will be out this year and I don't
actually know when it will be out
hopefully in the next few months front
of using Chrome for the past a little
while it seemed to be pretty stable I
definitely noticed there are some
glitches it's not a constant done but I
do believe that they're getting closer
so i would guess maybe three four five
months before it is released anyway guys
that's it for my google chrome OS
questions video hopefully this answer
all of your questions if you have any
more questions about Chrome OS or the
cr-48 feel free to leave them in a
comment below what you just check my
channel where I have a wide variety of
other Chrome OS videos anyway guys
