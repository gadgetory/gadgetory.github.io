tutorial showing you how to clear up
extra harddrive space on your Windows
computer so actually if I'll go ahead
and show you guys here I'll notice this
morning that my hard drive is
practically full right now so figured
it'd be a good idea to clear it up and
while I'm doing it make a video and show
you guys some of the methods I like to
do we know you're getting full you don't
have to start deleting all your files so
there's the first thing I'm going to be
doing is disabling hibernation mode now
hibernation mode is a sort of in-between
between shutting it off and putting it
to sleep that stores all the data on
your RAM to the hard drive now this is
nice it will allow you to boot up a
little bit faster so you need to you
know have your computer totally off you
need to remove the battery or something
like that but in my opinion it's really
not super necessary and of course
because of that you know it stores all
your data from your RAM typically
however however much RAM you have on
your computer is how much of a block on
the hard drive it takes so my case I
have four gigabytes of RAM and I'd love
to have that four gigabytes back so it's
going to be really simple so the first
thing is is go ahead and open up your
search and type in CMD now once you find
that you should have cmd.exe right click
it and click run as administrator we'll
go ahead and click yes here and then
we'll pull up the command prompt now at
this point you're going to need to put
one thing in now of course we'll have it
in the description so what you need to
do is type in power CFG all one word
space dash H space off so as you guys
can see there just type it in like that
or of course I'll have it in the
description click enter give it a second
and we're good to go now all we need to
is close it down if we check our hard
drive one more time it will show now we
have six gigs left as opposed to that
three so just that simply we did disable
hibernation mode we can't use it anymore
but I think it's a fair trade for
getting a couple of gigabytes back on a
hard drive the second method that I like
to use to keep my computer nice and
clean is to download CCleaner now
CCleaner is a fantastic application I
made many videos on before there really
keeps your computer nice and clean now
if you'd like to download it I will have
link in the description I will take you
to this page now I do want to mention
one thing you'll see this Buy in down
buy online and download you can ignore
that that and it's only if you need
priority support you scroll down here
there are going to be two links click on
either these and it is entirely free so
just
want to clear this up this is a free
program there's an option to buy it but
you don't have to do that whatsoever so
anyway once you have the computer the
program rather downloaded you'll see it
should look very similar to this now
there are two ways to clutter off stuff
from your hard drive now the first is to
run the cleaner now what this does is it
clears out extra junk on your hard drive
so for example Internet Explorer has
temporary Internet files etc etc I don't
either there's a huge thumbnail cache on
Windows and I have stuff in your recycle
bin temporary files there's a lot of
stuff that can just you know just extra
jump files that can be sitting around on
your computer edition CCleaner also will
clear up extra third-party applications
so if you have Firefox installed it
might be some junk on there you can
clear off well I do recommend like for
example Firefox is your main browser
don't have it clear your internet
history if you don't want that but I'll
just go through here and delete what you
want of course as you guys can see here
it does cover quite a few applications
and then once you're ready to see what
it's going to do you click analyze and
it will take just a minute to go through
as you can see here I run this quite
often so all you have 85 megabytes but I
want to do that so we'll run cleaner it
should delete it really quickly here and
there you go I removed eighty six
megabytes that's not a big deal but like
I said I run this quite often so more
than likely than that you'll have a lot
more than that I know the last thing and
this is a little bit obvious but I do
want to show you guys is just uninstall
programs now you'd be surprised how
often you might have some old program
that you don't need or for whatever
reason you know that you didn't realize
that you had then another program
installed it so for example I like I
said I've keep this pretty clean but you
guys might have something like perhaps
you don't want QuickTime anymore or
maybe you download Safari once and you
don't use anymore
there's a lot of things that you can do
and using C cleaner you can just pick
out whatever you like click run an
uninstaller and it should clear it up
and save a little bit more harddrive
space so anyway guys that's about it I
hope you guys enjoyed this video and
helped you to get a little bit of hard
drive space back
