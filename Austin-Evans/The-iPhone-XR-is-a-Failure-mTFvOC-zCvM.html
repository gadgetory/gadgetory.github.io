ago I did a video talking about why I
switch to the iPhone ten are a big part
of that is because so many people are
hating on this phone I thought surely it
can't be that bad so when my personal 10
s broke I figured why not give the 10r a
shot after three months of using this as
my daily I have a lot of thoughts since
I did my last video there have been a
lot of headlines that the iPhone 10 are
is a failure take one look at the Apple
website and they are seriously pushing
the ten are not like does it get front
page space but on top of that they're
really pushing a promotion that is all
about getting it for a little bit
cheaper with a phone trade in something
the Apple very rarely advertises this is
all for good reason the price of the 10r
was recently slashed by 20% in China and
there have been carriers here in the
u.s. such as t-mobile who have regularly
been doing a buy one get one free or
even a free phone when you sign up for a
new line that is not something that you
traditionally see with iPhones and it's
all indicative of the fact this is just
not selling as well as they had hoped
Apple even had to revise their earnings
report for the first time in nearly 20
years almost entirely on the back of i
phone demand being weaker than they
expected now it's not exactly this
clear-cut is that Tim Cook has gone on
record as saying that the iPhone 10 R is
the best-selling iPhone right now but
that does really mean a lot and you're
comparing it to things like the 10s and
10's Mac's
both of which are significantly more
expensive phones if you were to stack
the iPhone 10 hour side by side with say
and I like an iPhone 6s or seven my
assumption is that this is not selling
quite as well and that's a big problem
here's the thing though the iPhone 10 R
is my favorite iPhone you can buy today
and that's not even counting the price
so let's just run through what you can
get with the 10r
first of all one of the most important
components is that Apple a12 processor
this is something that's easy to
overlook but it is a big deal having a
fast SOC that's also efficient makes a
big difference in pretty much all
aspects of a phone's performance it also
has the same front and rear facing
cameras and you are losing the telephoto
option from the 10 s and the 10 s max
but if I'm going to be completely real
with you I really don't miss it now if
you have really good lighting it is a
nice thing to have and the portrait mode
can work out pretty well sometimes but
about 95% of the time I'm using the
wide-angle camera and here the iPhone 10
R is completely identical to the much
much more expensive options aka
Tenace and the x max the issue with
telephoto is that you have a smaller
sensor with an inferior lens it
generally just doesn't look quite as
good as when you shoot it on the main
shooter and while yes portrait mode on
the iPhone 10 R is not as good as
something like the pixel it's decent
enough that I really don't have any
major complaints that is the next step
up is to go to that pixel beyond that
the 10s and the 10s max don't make a big
difference to me and compared to the 10s
you've got those same great speakers you
have the same wireless charging you also
have a ton of what I think are pretty
cool colors the biggest difference
really is the display whereas the 10s
and the test max have OLED something
that's very common across the industry
right now the 10r has to make do with a
lowly IPS panel but you know what it is
really not bad no yes it should be
higher resolution it's not even quite
1080p but the important thing is is that
to my eye unless you're really pixel
peeping it does not look bad and we take
all of this and combine it with the fact
that the iPhone 10 R is a full $250 less
than the 10 as it starts to seem almost
reasonably priced the 10 s wasn't $1000
however my favorite feature by far is
the battery life compared to the 10s Max
and especially the 10s it is a night and
day difference wishing to the 10r it
just lasts so much longer when I daily
the iPhone 10 eyes I was really lucky to
make it through a full day without
hitting the charger and yet with the 10r
most nights I don't even bother to
charge it a few minutes here and there
at my desk or in the car is all I need
to make it through a day and the next
day this is especially important when
I'm traveling so I recently spent a week
in Vegas for CES and now once I need to
plug in the iPhone 10 throughout the day
in fact my best day was I pulled the
phone off the charger two o'clock in the
morning and 16 hours later with six
hours of screen on and two hours of
screen off I still had like 16% left
this thing is an endurance champ in a
world where Android phones are getting
bigger and bigger batteries the iPhone
10 R is the only iPhone that you can buy
today that has good enough battery life
as far as I'm concerned now the 8 plus
last year is probably the closest to
something like that
but realistically a lot of phones can
get you through a day of medium use or
light use but the 10r is the first time
they've been able to make it through a
full day of proper use I think it's
something that people are seriously
overlooking when they take a look at the
10r it is by far my favorite features
the phone I really feel like the iPhone
10 R doesn't deserve the
bad rap that it's gotten as far as I'm
concerned this is the only iPhone in
2019 so far that I recommend buying it's
got the right blend of performance
camera and importantly it's got that
battery life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
