was the video talking a little bit about
the Canon EOS 6d the nikon d600 and what
exactly is a full-frame camera anyway
take a look around you wasn't likely
you're going to find some kind of camera
so whether it's going to be a webcam the
phone in your camera maybe a compact
camera or even something like a
ten-thousand-dollar DSLR what all these
do is use the lens to gather in light
and turn it into something you can
actually use such as a picture or video
say you have a point and shoot camera
and pull out the sensor what you're
going to find is something that's almost
ten times smaller than even what you
will find in a micro four thirds camera
the same comparison is valid if you take
a look at a full-frame camera compared
to even a normal DSLR what you're going
to find is the sensor is almost going to
be twice as big on a so-called
full-frame camera but what does all this
mean we'll put quite simply size matters
generally the bigger the service area of
the sensor the more light it can gather
so this can be great for low-light
photography but it also has other
benefits and neither is depth of field
this is a very popular effect which will
get most of an image out of focus but
only a certain amount of it in for
example my face is in focus but the wall
behind me isn't there are other factors
to keep in mind for example the lens is
very important however in general if you
want the best depth of field you're
going to need to get a big sensor DSLR
which brings us back to the nikon d600
and canon 6d the reason these are such a
big deal is that they do have full-frame
sensors crop sensor DSLR cameras that
have sensors roughly half the size of
full front cameras are actually fairly
affordable general you can find them for
as low as 500 dollars before now if you
want full frame it was going to cost you
so for example the nikon d800 is going
to run you three thousand dollars it
only goes up from there so that's what
are the d600 and the 60 come in both of
these are going to be starting at 2100
dollars still a lot of money but a lot
better than paying three thousand
dollars plus on paper both of these
cameras have what it takes so the DC
extender is going to be rocking 24
megapixels and the 60 has 20.2 both have
some cool features as well so for
example the d600 seems to be focused
just a little bit more on video so for
example of course you have 1080p video
but you also do have uncompressed HDMI
out which can be a big deal if you're
actually wanting to use it
professionally and on top of that you
also have microphone and headphone out
for monitoring again a huge deal the 60
also has some cool features so in
addition to movie mode which is pretty
much standard for DSLRs these days this
has Wi-Fi and GPS built in a first for a
DSLR both cameras look solid but I shoot
an icon so I definitely got my eye on
the d600 and in fact if you guys are
interested more I'll have it
a little bit later on this week anyway
guys hopefully you learned something
about cameras and also you like the new
style of video not sure if it is
actually going to stick or not but I
figured hey it's worth a shot anyway if
you enjoy definitely be sure to leave
this video a thumbs up if you're
interested in my nikon d600 coverage be
sure to click on right over here anyway
guys I will catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
