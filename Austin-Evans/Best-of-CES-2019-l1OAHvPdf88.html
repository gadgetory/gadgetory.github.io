time for the best of CES first we have
the Royal flex PI this is the first
commercially available foldable
smartphone so you actually can buy one
of these right now and the entire thing
is built around a super thin OLED panel
so the actual display itself is a seven
point eight inch OLED with a 1920 by
1440 resolution it's not exactly the
sharpest or crispiest thing in the world
but can saying that it is a flexible
phone I can give it just a little bit of
props there for you know actually
working even though the display is so
thin it actually feels reasonably sturdy
a big part of that is the hinge actually
does have a lot of strength to it and on
top of that it does have magnet so when
you close up the phone it does stay flat
now it is actually kind of fit in a
pocket although just like the surface
book it doesn't actually go completely
flat you do have a little bit of a book
shape what's cool about this is this is
actually on sale right now now at $1,300
letters probably not a lot of people are
on board but it is really cool to see
something like this which even though
it's a little bit of a rough state right
now it's actually coming out I feel like
this a couple years is going to be super
cool
red hydrogen really yeah yeah look it's
cool the main issue is is that doesn't
quite have that level of polish right
the hardware is decent but especially
the software has a lot of bugs and of
course it's an early unit this is
something that shipping right now it
tries to detect sort of like you know if
I'm using it from one side or the other
but in my experience it just wasn't
particularly smooth or worked well
next up is the honor view 20 now this
bypasses the standard notch of 2018 for
what is known as a hole punch display
the front facing camera is literally
right in the middle of the screen or I
guess in the corner of the string
personally I don't really mind notches
all that much unless it's something like
the pixel 3xl but I will say that
something like u1 plus 60 is probably
closer to what a lot of people will
appreciate now this does have a little
bit of a cutout which means that stuff
like the status bar does come down a
little bit so in reality it's actually
not a huge difference than having a
notch but you still get to get rid of
the bezels as far as like watching video
content it's not quite as much of an
obstruction there is a lot more going
for the view 20 than just the display
though first of all it has a really cool
laser etched finish on the back which I
personally think looks cool on top of
that it has some serious specs around
back you have a 48 megapixel camera and
that is augmented by a 24 megapixel
camera up front that my friends is a lot
of pixels so if it is in the same 500
price range as its predecessor you're
getting a lot here four thousand
milliamp hour battery you've got that
curing 980 and the headphone jack now
when you talk about CES especially this
year there are so many displays so first
of all we took a look at some of the
stuff that LG has cooking up so now I do
it have a fully rollable OLED so when
you're not using it it can just
disappear and on top of that they have a
killer looking 88 inch 8k OLED what's
also impressive is the Samsung Hewlett
8k so 8k is actually a little bit of a
buzzy thing this year at CES there's
quite a few TVs around but the Samsung
one is seriously impressive it is a
massive ninety eight inches even if you
look past the size what you're getting
is such a bright and clear picture the
dynamic range especially some of the
really bright areas was super super
impressive I've got to say I've seen a
lot of cool TVs here at CES
some of these 8k units from both LG as
well as Samsung are way way better than
I expected
last year's Samsung showed off the wall
their first foray into micro LED but
this year it's pretty much ready for
primetime all it is is a series of
panels that you can put together and
what's really nice about this is it does
give you a lot of flexibility so yes
it's not quite as nice looking as
something like that 8kq LED but
especially when you have a giant giant
display of them it looks really
impressive now if you haven't had enough
of 8k yet well how about a camera to
shoot it that doesn't cost $50,000 well
that's what sharp has so this is a
mirrorless camera that has a micro 4/3
sensor depth a little bit on the small
side the idea here is that for less than
five thousand dollars you have a
consumer ish camera that can shoot that
full 8k video now sharp says they will
be able to do this onto an SD card so if
you want to light your SD card on fire
with 8k footage I guess that'll be nice
but the important thing about this is
that it is still slightly a concept they
will be showing a more final version a
little bit later in the year but this is
something that should be on sale this
year my main concern though is it
because it has that Micro Four Thirds
sensor what kind of lenses are you going
to be able to put on it that will be
able to resolve full 8k detail I mean
that's something like well north of 30
megapixels and that's that's a lot let's
charge so ice its sharp sorry
next up NVIDIA has the BFG D :
Imperium X 65 it stands for big format
okay
it stands for big format gaming display
get your minds out of the gutter now
when you're talking about specs this
thing has it all 65 inch HDR display
it's a full 4k it runs at 144 Hertz it
has G sync and it costs five thousand
dollars so it's a cool idea is
essentially this is a giant gaming TV
which is a little bit more on the
monitor side it does have an Nvidia
shield built in but I mean if you really
want the ultimate gaming this place it's
probably it or you can buy a car coming
back down to earth we have the Samsung
space fighter now there are two sizes a
27-inch 1440p as well as a 32 inch 4k
what's really cool about these is not
necessarily the displays but the stands
so what's cool about it is that it's
super flexible you can drop it all the
way down you can pull it forward you can
push it back there's a lot of
stability here which is nice to see
monitors have been kind of boring lately
the space monitor is actually available
on Amazon right now for pre-order I'll
have a link in the description but what
is not available just yet is the Razer
Raptor now we did cover this in our
Razer video but essentially to catch you
up this is a 27-inch 1440p high refresh
rate free sync display with a really
cool stand and some interesting
functions but it's also $700
so yeah LG also had a brand new
ultrawide monitor with a massive 49 inch
size now the name of it is the LG 49 WL
95 C 49 inch ultra wide monitor what's
cool about this though is is not only a
giant giant screen but importantly it's
basically a pair of 2560 by 1440 P
monitors stuck together so with a 5k by
1440 resolution this is going to be
awesome for gaming it's not going to be
out just quite yet would you better
believe I'm gonna get my hands on one to
take a video of Nvidia took CES is a
great opportunity to finally announce
our CX for laptops so there are a few
options right now there's our CX 2080
2070 as well as 2060 as well as the
various max Q implementations and there
are a ton of laptops or updated the show
if it's time for you to maybe consider
upgrading a gaming laptop this is
probably a really good time to do so
there are way too many designs for me to
go over in one video but some of my
highlights we're definitely the razor
blade which can go all the way up to a
20 80 max q also side note the razor
blade is getting a full 240 Hertz
display option soon as well as a 4k OLED
touchscreen I'm excited about that but
on top of that a su showed off the
ridiculous rog mothership concept now I
say concept but this is actually
something we'll be shipping very shortly
in the next few months what you're
getting here is essentially the ultimate
gaming grade surface pro so it has a
kickstand it has a keyboard which pops
out and is detachable but inside it has
the specs of the most ridiculous
over-the-top gaming laptop you can
imagine there's a lot more graphics
action than that though so on top of the
r-tx 2060 which is filing on sale 350
dollars is a little bit expensive but it
is roughly equivalent to something like
a 1070 TI and on top of that AMD
surprised everyone with the announcement
of Radeon 7
now this is essentially an upgraded
version of the current Vega architecture
on a 7a meter process and it's $700 it
is meant to go head-to-head with that
RTX 2080 so we'll see exactly how it
performs when it comes out early next
month but it is really cool to see all
of this momentum you know it's a little
bit of a honestly boring year last year
for the most part but it's nice to see
all of these different graphics cards
and all these different options showing
up in the market it is a good thing for
everyone
third generation Rison also made an
appearance so it brings a lot of power
into a 7 nanometer process should be
roughly equivalent to a cry 9 with lots
power which is exciting and on top of
that digital storm had one of these
smallest gaming computers I have ever
seen I mean I guess there's like laptops
and stuff but oh hi that is definitely
me this guy's a legend right here
excellent thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
