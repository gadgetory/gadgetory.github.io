reporting live from CES 2013 with a
first look at the new steam box
so of course valve is been rumored to be
making a console for quite a while and
they're here at CES 2013 was a lot of
new hardware so let's take a look
steam is kind of touched back here in
South Hall and they're only meeting with
partners so we're not allowed in but you
guys can definitely see behind me
there's a lot of stuff set up so there
are some normal-looking gaming computers
are also some kind of interesting
looking console it's hard to tell
exactly what they are if they're our
future steam boxes or whatever but if
lis some of the stuff looks really
interesting but again we're not allowed
in so it's kinda hard to say exactly
what's back there driving by the xi3
booth however we were able to get a
little bit more information on what
valve is cooking up so xi3 is a company
that makes modular computers they've
been around for a couple years they make
some pretty cool stuff
Monday night valve announced that
they're going to be investing in xi3 and
the exact same time Exeter announced
that they are going to be making the
very first steam box which is going to
be the piston now we don't have a lot of
information about that it's going to
look fairly similar to their current
lineup of devices of course but it is
going to be specifically tailored to run
all kinds of different steam games of
course using the new steam for Linux
operating system between big picture
mode which is steam that's really
condensed down to work well on a TV and
the fact that steam does network on
Linux it's going to be really
interesting to see exactly what they're
going to be doing with steam boxes in
the next six months year all that kind
of good stuff something be sure to stay
tuned to the channel if you guys enjoy

subscribe to see all kinds more CES 2013
coverage alright guys I will catch you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
