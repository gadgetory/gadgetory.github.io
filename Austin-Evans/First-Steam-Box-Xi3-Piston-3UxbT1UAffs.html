reporting live from CES 2013 with a
first look at the new steam box so of
course valves been rumored to be making
a console for quite a while and they're
here at CES 2013 was a lot of new
hardware so let's take a look steam is
kind of touched back here in south hall
and their only meeting with partners so
we're not allowed in but you guys can
definitely see behind me there's a lot
of stuff set up so there are some normal
looking gaming computers also some kind
of interesting looking consoles hard to
tell exactly what they are if they're
our future steam boxes or whatever but
if Lee some of the stuff looks really
interesting but again we're not allowed
in so it's kinda hard to say exactly
what's back there driving by the xi3
booth however we were able to get a
little bit more information on what
valve is cooking up so xi3 is a company
that makes modular computers they've
been around for a couple years they make
some pretty cool stuff monday night
valve announced that they're going to be
investing in xi3 and its exact same time
Exeter announced that they are going to
be making the very first steam box which
is going to be the piston now we don't
have a lot of information about that
it's going to look fairly similar to
their current lineup of devices of
course but it is going to be
specifically tailored to run all kinds
of different Steam games of course using
the new steam for Linux operating system
between big picture mode which is steam
that's really condensed down to work
well on a TV and the fact that it's teen
does network on linux it's going to be
really interesting to see exactly what
they're going to be doing with steam
boxes in the next six months year all
that kind of good stuff something be
sure to stay tuned to the channel if you
guys enjoy be sure to hit that like
button and subscribe to see all kinds
more CES 2013 coverage anyway guys I
will catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
