coolest gaming tech under $100 kicking
off the list is the Nintendo 2ds while
this was in the very first is it were
that episode a couple years ago it's
recently seen a big price cut down to
$80 and that includes Mario Kart 7 for
this kind of money the 2d s is a
surprisingly solid choice but less than
half the price of the 3dsxl you really
aren't losing much it still plays all
3ds games and with a library 5 years
deep you are not going to be lacking
quality games Super Smash 4 the 3ds is
easily one of the most impressive games
for the handheld it's been optimized
massively to be able to run on
comparatively weak hardware but you
wouldn't know it by playing not only
does it stay smooth with responsive
controls but it's a surprisingly full
version of the game Pokemon alpha
sapphire is the latest edition in the
series and it looks better than ever on
the 2d s while playing on the 3ds XL
gives you a bigger screen there's really
not a massive difference you can also
play DS games on the 2d S which opens up
even more awesome options in addition to
the virtual console titles like Game Boy
games on with NES and Super Nintendo
games of course there are a few things
you're giving up the 2d s is lacking any
kind of 3d screen which is why it's
called the 2d s Kleber this really is a
huge drawback most games either don't do
much with a 3d effect or don't really
take advantage of it at all and
basically all games work fine in 2d mode
you've also got the slightly odd shape
which drops the clamshell design for a
flatter look you're losing some
portability but it feels comfortable
even if you've got larger hands and
while the build is definitely on the
plastic side it's totally usable one of
the biggest things you're giving up is
audio quality with only a single small
speaker it's fine but you'll probably
want to use headphones for $80 though if
you've never gotten into the 3ds line
this is the perfect time to jump in
continuing down the world of price cuts
is the PlayStation TV at $100 this was
an interesting micro console but you can
easily pick these up for $40 now for the
price of a single game you're getting
what's essentially a PS Vita without a
screen that you connect to a TV this
means in addition to digital titles you
can use physical Vita games but you'll
want to make sure they're compatible
since there's no touchscreen some titles
won't work the PS TV is a straight up
Vita once you turn it on the interface
is nearly unchanged which isn't an
entirely bad thing it's downright quick
to navigate and easy to understand but
it can be a bit overblown on a large TV
one of the bigger downsides is the
resolution it tops out at 720p or 1080i
which just looks dated it's not a
deal-breaker but don't expect to use the
PlayStation TV - what
Netflix or YouTube you do have a fair
few options for games though in addition
to video titles you can play PSP games
which will definitely not intended to be
played on a giant TV work fine you can
also play PSone classics along with
PlayStation now this is reliant on
having a solid internet connection which
can be an issue on the TV since it has
fairly weak Wi-Fi so you'll probably
want to consider using Ethernet
however this opens up the library of ps3
titles you can stream and being limited
to 720p really doesn't hurt it at all
here even though the $40 price tag is
hard to argue with there are a few
things you want to keep in mind the base
model only comes with a power adapter
and an HDMI cable which means you'll
need to supply your own DualShock 3 or 4
which probably won't be an issue
you'll also need to spring for a PS Vita
memory card though which can get pricey
PlayStation TV has a little bit of
internal memory but you'll almost
definitely need to pick up a memory card
for all but the most basic use the
PlayStation TV is being phased out soon
but while it's still available for so
cheap it is absolutely worth it changing
gears a little we have the valve steam
link for $50 you're getting a streaming
box that allows you to play games from
your PC across your network it's a
simple little box that gives you HDMI to
a TV three USB ports and an Ethernet
jack
it also has fairly solid AC Wireless
built in but you should use wired if you
can as long as you have a gaming PC with
steam installed on the same network the
link should be able to find it and
mirror your display in big picture mode
it works with a mouse and keyboard along
with normal USB controllers like from
the Xbox one get into a game and things
work pretty well for my setup both the
PC and steam link are on Wi-Fi so
there's a bit of latency but it's pretty
manageable
the biggest issue is the occasional
dropped frame it can stream @ 1080p at
60 frames and the picture quality is
solid if you look closely there are a
few compression artifacts but overall
it's impressive since everything is
handled over your home network this is a
surprisingly cool way to play PC games
on your couch without having to move
your computer as always I'll have links
to everything I talked about in the
description of this video if you guys
enjoyed definitely be sure to hit that
thumbs up button anyway guys thank you
so much for watching and I will catch
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
