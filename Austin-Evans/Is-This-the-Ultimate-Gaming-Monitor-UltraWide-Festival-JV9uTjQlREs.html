ultimate gaming monitor big show that's
the LG for sponsoring this video so
we're actually doing something really
cool together soon but I'll talk about
that later so because I've been watching
the channel for a while you know I do a
lot of gaming PC videos but I don't do
is cover a lot of monitors which is
where this comes in the LG 34 you see 89
G because product name now comes the fun
part of trying to unbox a monitor that's
as big as I am you know what I'm
actually let's just tear it open that
sounds like a way better idea just
really drop the monitors trying to be
careful with it you actually this is a
lot lighter than I thought it was going
to be I'll put a lot of trust in this
not fall and break right now this isn't
right at all what am I do I just saw my
life flash before my eyes
I probably screw it in with these screws
on the bottom of this probably a good
idea I'm gonna put a Linus on that one
so with one disaster averted we have the
display itself now this is going to be a
34 inch display especially one of the
best reasons why I like to use ultra
wide monitors for gaming with such a big
panel especially when it's curved like
this one it does really give you a nice
immersive experience so let's just show
forts real quick in the roll call hmm
how bad was it ah all right cool um
reports around back we have a display
ports HDMI as well as two USB 3.0 which
can be used at the hub this guy is
rocking a 34 inch IPS display with the
resolution of 2560 by 1080
now that resolution isn't too crazy what
you're getting here is some seriously
high refresh rate out of the box it's
running in 144 Hertz
however you can actually over pocket
u-166 here
now that combined with g-sync support
means that this is going to be a really
smooth experience but if you're running
AMD graphics there's also going to be a
free sync version of this monitor which
happens to also be a fair bit cheaper
the panel supports 99% of the sRGB color
space which makes it suitable for stuff
like photo and video editing however for
me the resolution is going to be a
little bit low for this it is really
meant as a gaming monitor before we get
started we might as well overclock the
monitor because it literally takes like
10 seconds all you do is reach
underneath pull up the menu and it's all
LG monitors make this pretty simple with
a little nub on the bottom and when you
do is turn the overclock LT modernise
reboot and then it should be good then
all you do is go into the Nvidia control
panel make sure g-sync is enabled and
select your refresh rate and a crispy
166 hurt so first you have dirt for MLE
is this a really fun game but I think
one of the nice things about it is that
with this cockpit view it really does
make the ultra wide look nice so on
Ultra settings here we're getting
anywhere between like 90 to 100 frames
per second right now and with G think it
looks super super smooth well the
resolution of the display is a little
bit low it is difficult to run even 2560
by 1080 and a super high frame rate so
right now with a core i7 and a gtx 980ti
I'm slowly getting about 90 frames per
second personally for me I prefer a
smoother frame rate with slightly lower
graphics versus something that might
look a little bit better there's not
going to run anywhere near as smoothly
HD have a game that can definitely take
advantage of a high frame rate yes go
now here with everything cranked up
we're getting between 2 to 300 frames
per second which is definitely enough to
fully keep this monitor running at 166
Hertz and yeah it looks pretty good now
I in by no means any good at csgo but
even I can tell how much of a difference
it makes having such a high refresh rate
now I know a lot of people like to play
this game at a super high frame rate
even though the monitor can't handle it
to keep input latency down but
especially when you
with 166 Hertz it looks nice although
it's probably not enough to keep me from
getting killed or maybe this now there
are some special features with the
monitor and one of them is black
stabilizer so once you go into the
options and turn this on so same in the
dark area and I can't quite see someone
hiding in the shadows
especially what this is doing is it's
bringing up all the contrast so it's
making it a lot easier to see anyone
who's hiding but it still doesn't affect
the rest of the image if you want to get
a little sneaky you can also enable a
crosshair in the monitor so if you say
want to do that and not pull up your
scope it makes that a little bit easier
oh oh you see that ha if you guys want a
chance to potentially win not only one
of these monitors but also a whole lot
more oh gee is doing their third ultra
wide festival and this year Linus and I
are going to be hosting it for 2017 it's
all focused around this ultrawide
monitor but the grand prize is going to
get a gaming set of worth $10,000 to
enter submitted videos that's a 100
point for seconds or less explaining why
you need the new ultra wide display now
in the video make sure to now include
your face but also your current gaming
PC's then just post your video on
YouTube Facebook or Instagram using
these hashtag and then submitted at the
link in the description 50 finalists
will win a $50 steam gift card and the
chance to come up to Canada hang out
with Linus and I and potentially win
that giant set up the contest will be
running from August 14th to 23rd so good
luck so what do you guys think about the
ultra wide display let me know in the
comments below and I will catch you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
