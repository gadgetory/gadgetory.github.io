AB chat and I'm here with my friend
Austin from Duncan 330 303 on YouTube
and we just got done a few hours ago
watching the Apple event where they
announced the iPhone 4s not a5 and I as
an Australian got up just for the hell
of it at 3 a.m. to uh to watch the
events good times that was yeah very
disappointing for me because I wanted it
to be a 5 just looking forward to the
redesign what about you Austin
what are you disappointed so wanting the
5 now I was like ready for the 5 me I
was it's not so much that the 4s is that
big of a disappointment because it is
mostly the same as the 5 but I was
hoping for that tear shape teardrop
design tear shape my tears for the
iPhone 5 not being here I the teardrop
shape with the as long as the big the
bigger for a 4-inch screen get all these
words yeah I definitely I mean I can't
believe they didn't even make the screen
larger I thought that at least if they
were gonna keep that for design after
they announced it that it was gonna have
some kind of larger screen or something
but no well if there's an upside all
this and that is we can start our iPhone
5 rumors that will be out in the next
couple of months we can start it right
now I mean we'll be ready be good it
kind of that month we already have
plenty of those right about that we were
right about that if you guys if you guys
have our collab we mentioned that how
the iPhone 5 would have the post office
edition where you could print out
letters and mail them they announced
that they have a card application where
for like $3 or $5 where you can actually
Apple will print your greeting cards and
send them we were right yeah the most
random chance ever succeed blaze it
didn't stand up this new iPhone for
probably an hour I couldn't believe that
when I looked up and they finally
announced it it was about for me I was
like the hell it was like that forever
about like they just like repeated
everything we knew for an hour I'm like
yeah so they basically just talked about
iOS 5 for ages there now some you the
card application where you can get real
life cards and print them and send them
I don't know yes
what are you for us I mean it looks good
so what they upgraded it with better
battery which of course we expected what
else nothing no nothing yes that's right
the a the i5 processor we knew we were
yes we are waiting for that anyway ah
gosh and of course they didn't put that
in the new iPod Touch which there it is
you they just gave us a white iPod touch
huzzah I I guess that that I had a
couple people I talked to I guessed that
like about a few weeks ago months ago I
was never hoping that was more wrong but
I unfortunately was right and it's just
just this right here except you spray
paint white I'll call it an iPod Touch 5
which it's just such a shame that they
couldn't upgrade the iPod Touch because
I mean what what can you do to the
bloody thing it's practically an iphone
without the phones no I guess yeah hey a
white one buy more and on top of that it
doesn't have Siri which i think is kind
of a big deal that's like they're you
know like they didn't announce they did
not Siri for the iPad 2 either did they
and that kind of surprised me because
the iPad 2 they were saying how it needs
the dual-core processor you know the
extra power and like on stuff and
there's two reasons for that though for
one the iPad 2 has the same processor so
she had just as much power and to it
requires a data connection so it's I
don't even think it's doing really all
that much heavy lifting it's you know on
some Apple servers from with it's really
doing the work so that's that's dodgy on
a couple of different levels from me
yeah I was just waiting while they were
announcing all the new things and when
you see that they're going to bring out
like Siri and stuff they of course don't
add it to the iPod touch because I mean
otherwise why the hell would you buy an
iPhone 4s I mean the Siri thing with the
voice recognition if you guys have been
following it is amazing like you can be
like hey do I have a meeting um on the
on Friday I'm just copying that example
I'm meeting on Friday at noon and Siri
says yes no and then you know
can you please book a meeting for me and
it'll happen then it was amazing but if
I mean besides Siri the battery faster
it's
not a lot different but it matters
faster yes the batteries that disappears
bastards that's that's a new Apple
feature that's a phone chat feature
we'll see yeah well that was my mate my
two big things with Siri I think that is
awesome there's a couple like like how
they're only putting on the four asses I
don't I honestly believe that we'll see
it on jailbroken phones like you know
you know in a week yeah it'll be there
like immediately I don't think why
probably that and two was the camera the
iPhone 4s camera is really awesome eight
megapixels backlit illumination just
better
that's what f2 points that's pretty good
for a phone so that is one thing with
1080p anything I'm really looking
forward at the camera that's probably my
number one thing serious primer ah yeah
definitely I mean they they just put
enough into the new 4s to make it you
know you want to buy it like just get it
across the line because otherwise I mean
you can pretty much get away with
sticking with the for oh yeah you're
sweet you're up to date but yeah I don't
see a lot of people operate go ahead
yeah I agree
um yeah I mean I'm looking at them going
okay let's get the iPhone 4 for a few
hundred dollars cheaper yeah yeah once
Siri came out was like oh yeah that's
that's gonna be a big thing like yeah I
honestly see the 4s I think it'll do
well it's an it's got an Apple logo on I
mean it's gonna do well but I think a
lot of people who have an iPhone 4 who
may have if there was an iPhone 5 may
have like you know paid the extra to
upgrade since they were already on a
contract I think a lot of those people
are not going to really get the for ass
I think a lot of people like who are on
a 3G a source cool who are waiting to
get an iPhone who don't have one
especially if they want to get on Sprint
or I know others a ton of people when
you know when Verizon iPhone came out
weights was you know January whatever a
lot of people were wanting to come over
to it but they knew that that iPhone 5
it was coming now that they know that
there's nothing else coming I think a
lot of people it will do well so maybe
it's just a bunch of us geeks and nerds
just complaining that it doesn't have a
bigger screen but I don't know yeah it's
just yeah it was crazy with all the
rumors like so
almost evidence to say there's gonna be
a whole new phone and I mean hey maybe
they are they already you know started
working on the five and it they just
decided now it's not going to happen so
we'll just make you wait and I don't
know we gotta use up all the old parts
and all in those cases we bought we
bought an iPhone 5 cases we both did and
what we're going to do with those I
don't know we got fellow cheap Chinese
websites selling some iPhone 5 cases
about a few weeks ago what you want to
do on that one
I trust your now and I like I put vibes
coming and so now we're waiting for that
but that would be interesting we'll make
it well make a video I mean if we get
them yeah all right well I guess it's
gonna be about it so yes when I go check
our channels out of course I am
Austin aka Duncan three three three oh
three and who are you again
I am Ellie the Australian chick and
definitely tell us what you guys think
we just wanted to discuss it and I guess
like you guys join in on the
conversation you're gonna get it
are you disappointed I'm kind of
disappointed but I mean it still looks
good I think it's gonna be a hit of
course Apple has a massive following but
I mean another year with just a 4s will
things like the samsung galaxy and stuff
takeover because that's a nice nice
exactly
we'll see all right all right guys yeah
you're taking away else's Lauren just go
