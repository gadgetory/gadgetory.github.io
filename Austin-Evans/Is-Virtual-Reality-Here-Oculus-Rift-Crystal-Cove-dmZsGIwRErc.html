here with what I think is the coolest
thing of CES 2014 the new oculus rift
Crystal Cove prototype if you're not
familiar oculus rift is a virtual
reality headset that gives you a full 3d
immersive view into the game I've had my
own oculus dev kit for a while but here
see yes they were showing the latest and
greatest version so the difference
between the dev kit and the HD prototype
was 720p resolution to 1080p resolution
with this prototype we're actually
showing a new display panel
this is animaux LED HD 1080p panel since
the display is literally right on your
face while 1080p is a big improvement
you could go as high as 4k or even 6k
and still be able to see the difference
the demo I was able to try is Eve
Valkyrie which is a space flight
simulator based in the EVE Online
universe I was able to try this demo at
e3 but with the newer screen it looked
much much better so we have
sub-millisecond pixel switching time
with this which allows us to do what we
call low persistence low persistence
means that all of the motion blur and
judder effects that people had seen
previously and that they still see with
the standard definition defecate are
eliminated oh you definitely look like a
nerd playing the oculus this latest dev
kit is incredibly immersive your vision
is entirely taken up by the headset and
as long as you're playing at games it's
actually designed for VR issues like
getting sick or disoriented really
aren't a problem one reason this latest
prototype is a bit tighter is the new
way it tracks you and positional
tracking we've actually been talking
about for a long time people have been
expecting it and finally we're showing
it it adds to the orientation only
tracking it used to be you could only
rotate you know roll pitch yaw and your
camera or your head in the game was or a
piece of content doesn't have to be a
game would just be stuck in space so as
I moved the camera would just stay there
and as a result if I was looking at this
as a 3d object in a vr space I would try
and get closer to it and it would just
move away from me with a special webcam
and a series of LEDs all over the oculus
it's now very accurate attracting your
head movement which is really important
because the display is so immersive if
the motion when you move your head isn't
right it's easy to get disoriented or
even sick these are micro LEDs
and we have a camera here which is a
which can read that IR signal so the
infrared LEDs that you see on here
create a different pattern in space in
3d space and that's how we know exactly
where your position is well right now
oculus support is mostly limited to tech
demos indie titles and a few standard
games like AI racing and Team Fortress 2
it's based on HDMI and USB so in theory
it can work not only with your PC but
also a console or even your phone that's
the key message here at CES is that VR
is becoming comfortable right there's
going to be a lot less conversation
about oh well I heard it makes you sick
once people start to experience the
positional tracking and the low
persistence all of these things together
add to make a really magical experience
and there's additional things that we're
gonna be doing between now and consumer
release to make sure that the experience
is just flawless I really am excited
about oculus and being able to see them
cranked out prototype after prototype
and making these huge leaps along the
last year so it has been really
impressive but what do you guys think is
oculus rift something that's on your
radar definitely be sure to let me know
what you think in the comments below
anyway before we get out of here I got
to give a big shout out to Squarespace
