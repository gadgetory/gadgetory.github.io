application review on a really simple
yet very effective application called
simple drive so simple drive as the name
suggests is a very simple way to go
ahead and get files so if you have like
documents you have images whatever it is
you can go ahead and take it from your
computer put onto your iphone your ipod
touch or your iPad and go ahead and aqua
it at a later date so basically it does
turn your device into basically what's
you know a flash drive that you just a
wireless flash drive so I'm used it for
a little while I really like it so go
ahead just give you guys a tour so it's
really simple ugh I just open it up here
is just one site to load and then you
actually will see there we go so you'll
see that the interface is extremely
simple very clean and I like it a lot
because well it really is not a whole
lot to it so up top you'll see the IP
address she'll explain that in just a
second and then you'll see right down
here which is actually kind of nice
thing you'll say how much space you have
on your device so for example on my iPod
I have five gate five and a half
gigabytes of space left you know to fill
up with files whatever now I have to do
is it start so soon as I hit start there
we go so you can see up top it gives me
an IP address now all I have to do to
access files to put them either on my
ipod or take them off on tues put that
IP address in my web browser now one
thing I will mention though is that you
do need to have your device as well as
your computer on the same network okay
so long as it catches the same Wi-Fi
network you should be good to go anyway
all i have to do is go ahead and
punching the IP address in your browser
so once you punch it in and give justice
a blown you'll see it's a very simple
interface so as you see here actually
doesn't understand perfectly in Opera
but to be honest it's not a big deal the
buttons are just a little bit sideways
but like I said not a big deal it was
still one hundred percent fun so as you
can see here i do have just one file on
my ipod right now so go ahead and click
on it there we go so as you can see you
this is the image I have which I know
it's a very small image but this is just
a test you know obviously it could be as
big or small as you like I know you can
also go ahead and delete them so you
know it's not like it's just hung there
for ever you go ahead and delete them
and clean it up whenever you're done
with it let's go ahead and just upload
something to my ipod sums go ahead and
grab this logo and go ahead and hit
upload so even just a second and there
we go so now as you see you there's a
second dimension if I click on that I
can see I can go ahead and see the logo
so guys it's a very simple
application it works really well and to
be honest I think it's really really
handy so guys if you're interested it is
available in the iTunes App Store for 99
cents and then go ahead and check out
the description I do have a link it'll
just send you straight there in addition
to that guys I also do have a single

code you're supposed to comment below

ahead and rent go through randomly pick

codes go ahead and try this out a pal
