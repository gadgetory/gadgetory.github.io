software I run on my computer so get a
lot of questions about my setup and this
and that so I figured that we go ahead
and give you guys a quick tour of the
kind of stuff I use from day to day on
my computer so the number one thing and
probably sure you guys have noticed by
now is that I run Windows 7 or most
specifically Windows 7 home premium
64-bit I know I get a lot of questions
about why don't you run Mac why don't
you run Linux so this is that and this
and that
um and the major reason is I'm just
familiar with Windows I just don't
really have any reason to switch over to
Mac or switch over to Linux I mean I
like to play steam games and all that
kind of stuff and like I said I just
have never really had a reason I've used
Windows 4 pretty much forever it's just
something I know is just something that
works and Windows 7 is definitely
definitely the best version of Windows
ever so uh that's just what I like to
use now moving on I do have a couple of
kind of odd things I get questions about
usually when I do my screencasts so up
here on the right you guys can see
there's a CPU usage little meter I like
to keep my desktop really clean I've
messed around with you know doing
different themes and a lot of stuff I
just kind of keep coming back to the the
really simple kind of way to do it just
can see here it just has my CPU so it
kinda tells me about my RAM usage the
temperature of my CPU and all that kind
of stuff it's just kind of nice to be
able to look at at a glance some things
you know I wonder if it's like slowing
down I wonder where's my CPU or
something it's definitely open up task
manager' everything I can just really
quickly look over at my desktop see that
no problem likewise you guys take a look
down here on the bottom left there's a
little program called super bar monitor
this is really cool kind of just allows
you to take a look it does the exact
same thing as a CPU meter does it's just
a little bit simpler and so I don't even
have to read anything I can just look
down at a glance anytime I'm on the
computer just look down you know if I
see my CPUs pegged or something I know
something might be wrong so it's just
kind of something I like to do a lot of
this kind of stuff stemmed from when I
had like really slow and you know like
single core laptops and you know stuff
that I did not have any power so I
really need you know a lot of new
monitoring to see what was you know
eating up all my CPU which within my new
computer is not as big of a deal but it
still it keeps around as it is pretty
convenient so as far as the browser goes
I do use to my maton browser is Google
Chrome um I just like Google Chrome I've
used it for a long time probably two
years or so now it's just a really solid
browser overall I like it
it's got all the syncing
you know everything it's just I just
like it because it's constantly getting
great new features and everything and so
yeah I pretty much had no real reason to
change from chrome excrete although I do
have a secondary browser and that is
going to be opera opera is the same way
it I really do like opera if you guys
haven't seen my browser test you can
definitely tell you know just look at
the numbers it is very very close to
Chrome a lot of time but I just kind of
like opera just because it's got a lot
of really nice features I mean some
versions I like eleven point five or
something right now and there's a lot of
really cool things that you can do with
opera so when I need a secondary browser
you know I need to be logged into one
web site on browsers or anything like
that opera is what I use moving on from
here is pretty much the only piece of
paper software that I have on my
computer and that is choral VideoStudio
Pro X for now this is what I've used to
edit my videos for quite a while in fact
good year year and a half or so but I've
used it for quite a while and it's just
a really solid editor so um it's not
something like you know Sony Vegas or
final cut or anything like that but what
it does do is that it's you know it's a
mid-range editor it's fairly cheap and
it's pretty simple so for me what I do
pretty much every single one of my
videos is edited here and I don't really
have any problems you know doing
anything so guys looking for solid
mid-range or definitely recommend video
studio there's about forty or fifty
dollars or so although I'm not really
actually do entirely sure pleasure to
look that up before I did the video so
moving on I do have Skype of course you
know Skype is pretty much always on
there and just kind of close down click
didn't watch you guys all my contacts
and all that kind of stuff but yeah I'm
pretty much always on skype now the next
you guys will see here is audacity now
audacity is my audio recorder of choice
so you know I'm in fact I'm using right
now as you can see what audacity is
really good at is it allows you to just
take a look at your audio and be able to
record it in high quality with all kinds
of filters and effects and you can you
know clean it up everything and it works
really quite well and it is free it's
not the best it definitely isn't
interface is kind of new and it used to
be used to be a little bit glitchy and
laggy and stuff it's not so bad anymore
but yeah audacity is pretty good free
open source all by kind of good jazz
speaking of free and open source
programs I do have the GIMP
GIMP is if you guys aren't familiar it's
very similar to photoshop or something
it's not
grew quite as good as Photoshop but for
you know 95% of what I do it's just fine
you know making thumbnails when you're
doing any kind of image manipulation
which is cool word you can do that with
yem so yeah that's what I like to use it
works just fine and it is of course also
free now the last program I have is many
cam so many cam is what I use when I'm
streaming and I know it's not the
greatest xsplit is definitely a lot
better but it just kind of goes around -
I've used xsplit before it's not bad but
it's not it's an its it doesn't really
replace many cam so much for maybe just
because I need some very simple things
so example few guys come to d3 live or
any of my live streams you I've pretty
much been using mandy cam to record I
can use my webcam I can also show my
desktop when I'm streaming minecraft I
can do some effects and stuff which I
don't really ever mess with yes so
that's guys that's gonna be about it for
the kind of things I used about the only
other thing would be fraps
fraps is what I'm recording with right
now I'd show you guys but I can't really
do that it would break time and space
and stuff and all that kind of nasty
stuff but yeah I do use fraps for pretty
much all of my screencasts that's really
made for recording games I'm do that
from something from time to time however
it does work for your Windows desktop
and you know any editing I need to do I
just do in videos to you so it works out
pretty well anyway guys that's gonna be
about it for my tour of the kind of
software and all kind of stuff I have on
my computer nothing amazing or you know
Pauline you guys are probably heard of
nine action of these programs but just a
question I get asked a lot and I figured
you guys might be interested in taking a
look anyway guys if you have any
questions or comments about my tour you
want to see you know office to her all
that kind of stuff I definitely sure to
let me know in the comments section
below and yeah catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
