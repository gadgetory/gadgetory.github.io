the electron the most powerful computer
I've ever built with 8 cores 2 graphics
cards and 5 terabytes of storage the
electron is made to max out just about
any game out there even at 4k with a
white case power supply motherboard and
even bands
it's definitely got the strong Tripper
look going on with just a bit of green
on the graphics card and CPU cooler you
can individually control all the fans
from inside windows to make sure the
electron is nearly silent when you're
not pushing it hard and there are nice
touches like LEDs to light up the rear
connections and your graphics cards
considering how much time I spend trying
to shave a few dollars off of my normal
budget build it was definitely nice to
have a little fun with this one our get
into gaming the electron is all business
with BioShock Infinite we're essentially
maxing out the built in 1440p benchmark
with a cool 113 point 6 frames per
second even on ultra step up to 4k
inside grid Autosport and that even
ultra settings can bring the electron
below 60fps keep the settings max at 4k
and battlefield 4 is able to get the
framerate into the mid 50s where a Metro
Last Light Redux we're getting around 48
FPS at 4k getting performance like this
out of the box is awesome however one of
the nice things about the electron is
that there are some serious games to be
had if you do a little overclocking on
the CPU side I tried the asou ki sweet
to automatically overclock the CPU to
4.4 gigahertz and while I usually don't
use tools like this the AI suite is
surprisingly solid with a conservative
1.3 gigahertz core clock and 300
megahertz memory bump on the graphics
cards metro picks up a solid 8 frames
per second we're in 3d mark firestrike
we're looking at 17% more performance
with about 10 minutes of work I usually
don't overclock on my build videos it's
not for everyone and you won't always
get that same level of performance
however here it took almost no effort to
get some serious performance gains if
you decide to build the electron spend
just a few minutes overclocking it it's
going to be well worth it at the heart
of the build is an Intel Core i7 59 60 X
this is an 8 core haswell-e monster of a
processor with 40 PCI lanes and a
whopping 20 megabytes of l3 cache this
is straight up the best gaming CPU you
can buy now out of the box it might not
seem too impressive with a
three gears clock speed however don't
let that fool you my chip was able to
hit 4.4 gigahertz at one point three
volts no problem which is a massive jump
in clocks and with some extra voltage it
was stable at 4.7 gigahertz to put it in
perspective this is essentially what you
would get if you took two core i7 4770k
s and fuse them together this thing is
an absolute monster cooling things is an
NZXT kraken x61 considering how much
heat the cpu can put off having a dual
140 millimeter closed-loop cooler like
this is a huge help in getting a solid
overclock keeping the 59 60 X powered is
the Asus x99 deluxe motherboard not only
does it look awesome with its white heat
sinks but it's also packed with features
you get 10 SATA 3 ports dulce to Express
along with an m2 slot and a whopping 10
USB 3.0 ports on the back panel one
thing about these new x99 processors is
that they like a lot of power
so what's stock is going to be a home 40
watt CPU however start overclocking and
you're going to get that number well
over 200 watts in no time which makes
the solid vrm and heatsink on the X 99
deluxe a huge help for overclocking for
graphics we have a pair of Nvidia's new
GTX 980 s with four gigabytes of memory
each these are as good as it gets for
gaming cards right now with the new
Maxwell 2.0 architecture you're also
getting a lot of overclocking headroom
enough to push these cards to 1.3
gigahertz and beyond like the CPU the
GTX 980 is a killer card and when you
put two of them together in sli you're
getting some serious performance so the
biggest problem is actually just trying
to get your hands on them so they're
sold out basically everywhere at the
moment so I was actually able to get
these from my friend al work over ticket
tomorrow so big shout out to Al right
Phil ahem you borrow his cards to make
this build happen however I will have a
link in the description to the 980 s
which hopefully are in stock by the time
you watch this on the memory side we
have 16 bytes of Corsair Vengeance lpx
not only is this brand new ddr4 Ram but
it's also clocked at a whopping two
thousand six hundred and sixty six
megahertz in quad-channel mode since
ddr4 is brand new it's expensive however
it's also very very fast
now with this x99 deluxe board that were
using it supports up to eight Dems which
means that if you want you can upgrade
and go even more overkill for storage
we're using a pair of 512 gigabyte
crucial MX 100 SSDs throw these together
and raid and you'll have a full terabyte
of superfast storage that can easily
hidden around the back of the case I
really like these new MX 100's not only
they sell out SSDs but you can get a
terabyte worth of them for about the
same price as a single 500 gig 850 Pro
of course we can't just have a single
terabyte of storage so the electron also
sports a four terabyte Western Digital
black drive these are rock-solid when it
comes to performance for a spinning hard
drive and with 4 terabytes of capacity
you can load one seriously giant Steam
library on here powering the entire
build is in NZXT Hale 91 thousand watt
power supply not only is this an 80 plus
gold rated supply with modular
connectors which is more than enough to
handle even our overclocked CPU and
graphics cards but it also comes in a
matching white with the rest of our
components my only real complaint is
that the 20 plus 4 pin connector isn't
fully slave like the rest of the cables
otherwise it's a solid supplied putting
it all together is the NZXT h6 30
this is hands-down one of my favorite
cases out right now not only is it more
than big enough to handle an SLI build
like this but there are nice little
features all over the place
I pulled the top drive cages and use the
bottom one it's a mount for an
additional fan to direct some airflow
right onto the graphics cards by default
it comes with a normal painted side
panel which still looks nice but I was
able to get my hands on the optional
windowed side panel which nicely adds to
the look of the case while it's
expensive if you really want to max out
games even at 4k the electron is the way
to do it as always I'll have links to
all the parts I used in the description
of this video over on my website so what
do you guys think it's been a long time
since I've done a high-end build like
the electron so do you want to see more
like this definitely be sure to let me
know in the comments below anyway I've
got to give a huge shout-out to audible
for making this video possible
audible.com is a leading provider of
audiobooks with more than 150,000

literature including fiction nonfiction
and periodicals right now audible is

what if by Randall Munroe written by the
guy who does xkcd what if is all about
answering crazy theoretical questions
with real science to download what if or
another audiobook for free just head
over to audible.com slash Austin like
always audible is a huge part of the
reason why I can do builds like this for
you guys so definitely be sure to check
them out anyway guys thank you so much
for watching and I will catch you in the
