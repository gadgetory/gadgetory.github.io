overview of the recent Google Chrome
event then talked about a lot of things
let me go ahead and tell you a little
bit about what all they unveiled so the
met one of the bigger things was the
chrome webstore now the chrome webstore
will be live later today and I will have
a video to look on the screen for an
annotation as soon as I get that video a
hands-on showing exactly what it is but
the chrome webstore does look very cool
you can go ahead and purchase apps as
well as just go ahead and just download
them for free there are a lot of really
interesting ones so I'm definitely
looking forward to seeing more on that
however the major focus of the event was
certainly Google Chrome OS I know we've
been hearing about this for quite a
while however this we've got a lot more
details on it release dates all that
kind of good stuff so it's not done yet
so if you were looking for a chrome OS
release date you know today or soon no
it's actually going to be the first
notebooks were going to be launching
sometime in the middle of next year
however we do know a lot more
information and they actually are going
to do a pilot program so basically what
this pilot program is all about is that
they have that's called the cr-48 the
first very first Chrome OS laptop now
basically they're going to be
distributing this through the pilot
program which I'll have a link to in the
description if you're interested in
trying to apply basically it's going to
be like a public beta where some people
will actually go ahead and get one of
these chrome OS laptops and you test it
and you know talk about it and all that
kind of stuff which is definitely going
to be very very cool and I won't really
get into the laptop as it's not going to
be the actual thing that you'll be able
to buy of course this is just the early
adopters
I'm however let me go ahead and talk
just a bit more about Chrome OS so
everything we've heard about Chrome OS
before all that remains you know it's
going to be an instant-on not instant on
but very very close it's going to go
ahead and boot very very fast they
talked a lot about the security features
the sandbox and all that kind of stuff
however there's some really cool things
I want to go ahead and discuss one thing
that we didn't know before was that
every Chrome OS netbook is going to have
built-in 3G there's going to be great
and in addition if you're in the United
States all of them will actually come
with two years worth of free 3G from
Verizon Wireless so basically what the
way it will work is that it's kind of
similar to on the iPads that
my pain or you can go ahead and you get
100 megabytes of free data every single
month for the next two years so if I
bought one today I would have two years
100 Meg's every month in addition to
that you with no contract you can go
ahead and buy pay-as-you-go so you can
get a day pass for unwith unlimited or
you can go ahead and get perhaps a
gigabyte or however you want to do it
it's all activated on the Chrome OS
notebook itself so very very cool stuff
right there anyway guys that's it for my
overview of all what they talked about
now of course there's a lot more but
most of the stuff is kind of just
repeating we've already seen a lot of it
you know a couple of the key things I
really liked was the fact that how fast
and simple it is to set up and use I'm
so actually they actually showed and I
took a brand new chrome OS notebook
they turned I turned it on for the first
time and literally all you need to do is
accept the terms these go ahead and take
you know set up a profile picture plug
in your Google account details and it
was already set up so it was really
really fantastic you know anyone can
attest to if you buy you know a brand
new Windows or Mac here you turn on you
set it up all this kind of stuff but
with the Google Chrome OS it took less
than a minute to have it fully set up
with all your bookmarks and all that
kind of stuff which are of course
imported from your Google account so
there's really cool things I'm excited
to go ahead and get my hands on a chrome
OS notebook and give you guys more
information anyway guys thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
