show you how to downgrade the firmware
on your iPod touch your iPhone as well
as on your iPad so guys this is a very
very simple tutorial process shouldn't
take you any time at all it's very very
simple but I've had a ton of requests a
lot of people asking how to do it so I'm
going to show you before we do begin
however there's just one thing I do want
to mention now to do this you will have
either needed to saved your sh sh bobs
manually in the past so basically if
maybe fuse firmware umbrella or
something similar if you already have
your as a just blob site on the computer
so if you had that you're all set
otherwise you will have had to have
jailbroken on some earlier version of
iOS so odds are if you've jailbroken
city went ahead if you hit the make my
life easier button when you first got
the city in the first job room odds are
the city already has your sh sh blob so
guys i'm gonna go ahead and show you how
to do both methods both is very simple
and if you're not sure if city did say
but again i'll show you how to even
check for that tube so let's going to
show you how to do it okay so to begin
with all we need to do is download a
very simple program called the firmware
umbrella I'm a big fan of this program
it's very lightweight you don't need to
install anything and works really quite
well so let's go ahead and show you how
it works
I'm so the BMS let's go ahead just
download it just come to the firmware
umbrella blog spot.com and I of course
will have the link to in the description
right below this video obviously just
come right down here and there are some
links right here on the right side so
you can go ahead and download for Mac
Windows as well as Linux so then just
download it to whatever you want and
then it's going to show you how it works
okay so now that you have the program go
ahead and just open it up and plug in
your iPod iPhone or iPad whatever you're
looking to downgrade okay so this is a
very simple process let me just go ahead
walk you through it basically there are
two different ways now if you've used
this program before you've already saved
your sh sh blobs then it should be no
problem i need to do is just to make
sure that you know what you have just
click display sh shs okay so as you can
see here these are the ones I already
have on my computer so odds are if
you've used this program before you'll
at least see a couple of firmwares in
here so for example I can safely down
rate to any of these no problem okay now
if you've never used this program for
this will be blank so it's no big deal
okay so now let's say I'm go ahead
pick something right now let's say
you're you have an iphone 3gs and the
last time you jailbroke was on iOS for
just just 4.0 okay so the white and
check all you do is click Advanced
Options then it's request version okay
so all you need to do is just go through
here and pick out whatever device you
have with iPad iPhone whatever so of
course I do have the iPhone to Jean and
then I can go ahead and just look
through here and the last time I would
jailbroken was on 4.0 and 4.0 point two
so basically what you do is let's say we
go by four point oh point two so now you
hit save my sh-sh and it will go ahead
and give it just a minute and it will
check city if it has it now if it does
that will download and you'll be all set
if it doesn't for whatever reason all
you do is just go back and find a
different version of the firmware so
example 4.0 and C and keep going until
six idiot has saved that blob so I know
this can be a little bit complicated and
I know this is where a lot of you guys
do run into trouble but it's not that
big a deal just go ahead pick out your
device and then go ahead and go to
whatever firmware you were laughs
jailbroken on so like I said odds are
most of you guys it's going to be 4.0 or
4.0 point one so just pick out that
firmware and there's a pretty good
chance that the city will have it to
make sure I need to do is come over here
to display sh shs and then after you're
done saving it should pop up saying you
know 4.0 or whatever you just saved okay
so it's pretty done with that then we're
pretty much done so all you do is just
come over here click start TSS server so
as soon as you've done this you're all
set up to go ahead and restore your
device to whatever sort of firmware that
you were looking for okay so now all you
need to do is just go ahead and open up
iTunes so obviously with your device
still plugged in you should get the
screen now telling you everything about
it so at this point it's very very
simple all I need to do is go ahead and
restore to whatever firmware that you
have the sh-sh so for this example I'm
gonna go ahead and pick 4.0 points too
although obviously whatever you
downloaded do you'll have that so with a
Mac you go ahead and hit option and you
hold you hold option key and click and
left click restore for a Windows
computer you hope you hold the shift key
and hit restore I'm glad to do this
instead of just restoring out an applet
we'll go ahead and open up a thing
search and pick out your own firmware so
let's go ahead and go through here and
pick the four point
they're a four-point 0.2 so go ahead and
click open and now it'll go ahead and
let's go ahead and just hit restore so
now as you can see here Oh give just a
minute and they'll actually instead of
asking Apple if that's okay to do it
it'll use tiny umbrella so instead of
you know having any issues or any errors
it should work just fine so hang on go
ahead give this a minute to go ahead and
load and I'll be right back the students
done there you go guys that took about
10 15 minutes to go ahead and sink all
my stuff over but after that no problem
at all so guys hopefully that helped you
out now about the only thing I was not
able to show is downloading the actual
firmware files now for that it's very
very simple just cleanse you Google
whatever you need so you know you need I
pod touch site generation 4.0.2 whatever
you need you can go ahead and just just
google it and it'd be no big deal so
guys I hope this helped you out and of
course if you're still on Pokemon
twelve-inch and you were not able to go
ahead and do this maybe your city didn't
have your sh sh blobs or you never
jailbroken before don't worry there will
be a 4.1 jailbreak in the furling near
future maybe you know it within OS in a
little while so you know you're not
gonna be stuck on 4.1 and not being able
to jailbreak forever so anyway guys
