android 2.3 the new slide uses the
Mobile BRAVIA Engine which gives us the
super bright display there's a very one
eighty-five percent more efficient than
your Amma let's also much much better
display when you get it out in direct
sunlight so better battery life
comfortable display it's all season on
the camera side an export our processor
which is great for low-light shooting
it's the same stuff we use on our our
DSLRs and our cyber shot so on the phone
you've got your main menu here all your
apps that you use and you'll notice more
home screens because it is 23 a lot of
homescreens a lot of which is really
cool feature that we've put on the phone
I pinched in very and it gives me an
overview of all my widgets on all my
home screens and then from here if I
want to go to one of them I simply push
the widget it takes me to that page so
very cool the other thing you notice as
I slide across the bottom pane stays so
i take my most commonly use ok i'll
leave them there no matter where I'm at
see you later night I could always get
to my messaging or whatever you can
change those to whatever you want so
standard Android notifications from the
top apps here you know the new facebook
app off this is on it but we're not
going to look at my facebook but the new
facebook outlook which is really kind of
cool for the mobile let you do your
pitches and all that stuff right there
8.1 megapixel camera LED flash HD video
720p HD video hdmi output here a mini
HDMI for that many are micro USB for
charging which is obviously standard now
and the camera so when you go to your
camera mode when you go to your camera
here hold the button down it will take
you straight into camera mode from here
you can switch from still to video the
Simple Touch move on you got all your
settings over here
if seven point your photo light and it
has all your features that you would
have on frankly the standard point shoot
camera now what about the battery life
I don't have the official numbers but I
can tell you from my personal use I came
from the x10 which was our old phone to
this I am getting easily a day and a
half out of this under relatively heavy
music said your corporate email at your
personal email Twitter Facebook I have
rssp done so and again because of the
screen reusing it be more efficient and
being writer we're definitely getting
more about it plus it's 23 which is also
more efficient is in what processes
which is run by choosing the Snapdragon
or the 8255 so it's the newest latest
one I think very important that it's
dated 250 yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
