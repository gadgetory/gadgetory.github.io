means another iPhone but what does Apple
have in store for the iPhone 7 probably
the biggest rumor is that the next
iPhone will drop the headphone jack this
seems a bit ridiculous at first glance
but it's worth considering that the
connector itself is pretty ancient the
quarter-inch jack has been in use since
1878 and the smaller 3.5 millimeter
version is still over 50 years old
considering there really hasn't been
much to improve on sense should say a
lot but Apple has another idea using the
Lightning port this has been in the
works for a while and you can actually
already buy a pair of Lightning
headphones today the philips Fidelio
headphones work by integrating a lot of
the parts you would usually find inside
the iPhone over to the headphones
instead of relying on the DAC inside the
phone to create a signal that can drive
headphones the Lightning port simply
moves the raw data to the headphones
where all the processing happens the
problem is that with all of this
Hardware built into the headphones they
aren't cheap it's not the end of the
world for audiophile grade hardware like
this but good luck picking up an
affordable pair of lightning headphones
anytime soon the advantage is that this
really does improve audio quality not
only is there no hiss in the background
but even compressed mp3 sound really
nice parry this with bluetooth
headphones getting better and better and
the removal of the headphone jack and
DAC means there's extra room inside the
iPhone for a better speaker or bigger
battery this being Apple they'll
probably sell an adapter to be able to
use normal 3.5 millimeter headphone with
the iPhone 7 but as crazy as it might
sound the days of the headphone jack
might be numbered another big
possibility is the return of a four inch
iPhone for most of the lifespan of the
iPhone and had a relatively small 3.5 or
4 inch screen but with the iPhone 6
things got much bigger this is a smart
move for most people the larger size is
a better option but there are still a
lot of people who prefer a smaller phone
rumors started picking up when a leaked
China Mobile slide mentioned an iPhone 7
C and have since blown up all over the
Internet Apple still sells the 4-inch
iPhone 5s so releasing an updated
version of that bone with a tweaked
design and additions like Apple pay and
faster internals could make a lot of
sense especially when you consider just
how good more budget phones have gotten
it makes sense for Apple to get more
competitive in the mid-range unlike the
normal iPhone 7 which is expected to
come out in September like always this
new smaller iPhone is like they come out
much sooner somewhere in the March to
April time frame
another interesting rumor is that the
iPhone 7 will feature two rear-facing
cameras this isn't crazy not only have
there been apple patents describing how
something like this could work but it's
done before HTC launched the dual camera
on the One m8 back in 2014 which
featured a main camera along with a
smaller sensor there works together to
give you interesting effects like
changing the perspective of your photos
on the iPhone this could be used to let
you take a wide and tight picture at the
same time letting you take full res
pictures while recording video and more
if this happens it'll probably be
exclusive to the iPhone 7 plus but it
could be really interesting another
feature that people have been talking
about is the addition of waterproofing
this is something Apple has been slowly
working on in the background with the
addition of a gasket on the 6s which
makes the current iPhone remarkably
waterproof already and legit
waterproofing is something you can find
a lot of other phones like this $200
Sony Xperia aqua it's nice to be able to
get a phone a little bit wet without
having to worry about a giant bulky case
one of the more interesting rumors is
the addition of wireless charging yet
again this is something that has been in
other phones for quite a while including
the samsung galaxy note 5 it works by
using a charging pad plugged into the
wall
which is able to send power a short
distance wirelessly the glass back and
into a coil wire above the battery this
is undoubtedly cool but in reality it's
not massively faster than just dropping
your phone on a dock Bloomberg recently
posted an article that Apple is working
on wireless charging they can work at a
distance Apple has already patented ways
of integrating a wireless charger into
something like an iMac it wouldn't be
fast but imagine your phone wirelessly
charging just as seamlessly as it gets
on Wi-Fi this is likely another year or
two out but they can have a massive
impact on battery life so what do you
guys want to see on the iPhone 7 let me
know in the comments below and I will
catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
