something very very special this is the
Oppo find X and not only were they
awesome enough to sponsor this video but
they also hooked us up with an early
unit before it's actually even been
announced what's really cool with this
guy is that not only does it ship with a
vessel this design but on top of that
it's got some features I've never even
seen on another phone before I'm also
really excited cuz this has been sitting
on my desk all morning and I've not
opened it up yet dude look at that
purple finish so it's only on the edges
but it's sort of tapers off into black
in the middle Wow now technically this
color is known as Bordeaux red although
I've got to say pretty sure it's purple
just throw that one out there it's
pretty purple did you see that wait wait
wait wait what hold on hold on I gotta
do that again that is so insane look at
that camera so the whole top of the
phone pops out so part of the reason
that they're actually able to make a
bezel this display is because the camera
is fully hidden I mean look at that so
not only is the front-facing camera
going to be hidden but you're also going
to be able to get your dual rear facing
cameras that is this is the future I
cannot believe how cool this is I mean
it looks awesome the screen is really
nice we basically got no bezel but
there's no real trade-off there I'm
sorry I'm too excited right now
I'll bring it back a notch but get it
bring it back a notch because there's no
notch so I knew a little bit about this
foam but I purposely wanted to sort of
say here for the video and I knew there
was gonna be some kind of pop-out camera
but the idea that the entire front of
the foam pops in and comes back down I
mean look at that
that's insane like okay I know I need to
calm down but I mean it's the whole pack
to me it's even got the curved AMOLED
display there's no bezel the camera
the killer color it's really hard it's
really hard for me to like take this
seriously right now it's so cool I mean
I generally did not expect this to be a
thing that you get by in 2018
I mean sure as sort of the future gets
closer and closer as sort of screen tech
gets better there's a lot of interesting
ideas but the fact that this is going to
be a phone that you can buy very very
soon
I don't think I've ever touched a piece
of hardware that has gotten me this
excited about a phone straight up I have
never been this amped try any kind of
phone hardware I feel like things have
gotten so stale so boring these days
that this is something that's so
different
I mean smelly just the notch I mean I'm
not a huge fan of the notch but I can
kind of live with it but the fact that
you've got a fully bezel let's display I
mean if i unlock it here and use my
super cool face unlock you'll see if
there's gonna be a tiny little bit of
bezel on bottom and basically nothing on
the top and sides but I mean that's so
close I don't think it counts as a chin
Jimmy yes ooh
so I saw it in the Box off but I didn't
see the back don't you like that finish
that's awesome this is like what they
wanted next victim
this is the find X okay the sad thing is
you actually have to give this back but
I'm totally just gonna buy one for
myself this is too cool to not have
before I get too carried away as if that
hasn't already happened yet there are a
fair few accessories in the box we've
got a little bit of paperwork we've also
got the USB c2 headphone jack adapter no
this does not have a 3.5 ml headphone
jack but I think I can live with that so
with the fast charging you should be
able to get somewhere in the
neighborhood of two hours of talktime
for about five minutes of a charge and
considering the size of it it looks
about right but some little exciting
stuff is actually going to be on the
actual phone itself that's still cool
inside this guy's about as high-end as
it gets
we're going to be getting a snapdragon
845 eight gigabytes of ram as well as
128 gigs of storage it's also got the
basically bezel as designed so they 94%
screen to body ratio yes if you look on
the bottom it's going to be a tiny tiny
bezel but honestly as far as I'm
concerned this is the closest to a fully
bezels phone we've seen especially
saying that there's going to be no
knotch you're also going to be getting a
full six point four inch twenty three
forty by 1080p display and that eyes are
going to look nice but it's also going
to be a Samsung AMOLED panel which gives
you nine nice contrast good color but
it's also going to give you the ability
of having that curved edge on left and
right now there is no fingerprint sensor
however the face unlock is supposed to
be much more accurate and it's pretty
quick too
so if I hit the button swipe off it pops
off scans and closes pretty quickly sure
not quite as fast as something like just
dropping your finger on a fingerprint
sensor but as far as I'm concerned
that's worth the trade-off
I mean software wise this is running
Android 8.1 with color OS on top now
it's going to be a little bit of a
heavier scan but you do get some nice
additions including some multitasking
gestures so you swipe up and go between
your apps you don't have to use the
standard Android navigation keys the
only issue here is that because this is
a Chinese market phone there's currently
no Google Play Store on my unit although
you could probably figure that out
yourself now camera wise around back
you're going to find a 16-megapixel
camera pair with a 20 megapixel sensor
and around front you're actually going
to be getting a full twenty five
megapixels for that selfie action cuz I
see a lot of detail here that's not bad
at all so there's going to be some AI
trickery to be able to optimize your
photos at least based on first glance
again keep in mind pre-production
they're still working on it
looks pretty nice I didn't want to wait
for the final software and hardware
before fully judging the camera but at
first glance it seems to be decent at
the very least so Yuna's been a long
time since I've seen a piece of hardware
come in here that is just this cool now
I don't have price I don't have a
release date just yet but it should be
on sale this year I got to say I'm sad I
have to give it back I'm actually
legitimately gonna buy one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
