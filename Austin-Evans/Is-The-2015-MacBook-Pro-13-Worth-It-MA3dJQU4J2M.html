Intel Broadwell processors and a faster
SSD the 2015 MacBook Pro has seen a
pretty decent update but is it worth it
take one look around and you'll see the
design hasn't changed much that's not
really a complaint though the retina
MacBook Pro has been one of the best
built laptops for a few years now and
the 2015 model is no exception it's a
solid aluminum chassis with some of the
tightest tolerances out there and subtle
touches like a nicely weighted hinge so
you can open up the lid without picking
up the entire laptop it's got a pair of
decent speakers hidden on the edges by
the ports the SS intakes for the fan the
MacBook vens above the keyboard which
can still breathe even with a lid closed
the keyboard is still about as good as
it gets for a laptop they could add just
a touch more key travel in my opinion
but it's nicely spaced and keeps the
adjustable backlighting which
automatically kicks on in darker
environments something shared from the
new MacBook is the force touch trackpad
it looks the same however instead of
being a normal click pad there's a
tactic engine which vibrates the
trackpad when you click it sounds
bizarre but it actually works you can
notice the lack of travel compared with
a normal MacBook but it does feel like
you're clicking turn off the laptop it's
really trippy it moves a tiny amount but
nowhere near as much as it feels like
when it's actually on it's also pressure
sensitive which lets you use the new
force touch gesture in OS 10
for example the harder you press the
more you fast forward in quick time with
the slight bit of feedback as you go
through each of the speeds the coolest
way to use this is in Safari where you
can force click on a link to preview
before actually opening it it took me a
few days to get used to it but the new
try pad is a nice addition reports
you've got an SDXC card reader HDMI and
USB 3.0 on the right side along with
MagSafe 2 for charging a pair of
Thunderbolt 2 ports along with one more
USB and a combo headphone microphone
jack the Thunderbolt ports are the most
interesting having that much bandwidth
is mostly useful for high-end raid
arrays and docks to give you things like
extra USB ports Ethernet an HDMI off a
single cable
they also double as many display ports
with the ability to drive 4k monitors at
60 Hertz it won't be buttery smooth but
it is totally possible speaking of that
screen the MacBook Pro is sporting a
eighteen point three inch IPS display
with a resolution of 2560 by 1600 while
this has been passed by Windows laptops
pushing resolutions up to 4k and
practice the MacBook is more than sharp
enough it's got solid viewing angles a
far cry from the MacBook Air which
washes out almost immediately OS 10
scaling is quite a bit better than on
Windows 2 it scales the resolution by
double giving you the same screen real
estate as a 1280 by 800 displayed by
default you can adjust this up to 1680
by 1050 but for me the sweet spot was
1440 by 900 giving you a decent amount
of resolution without making things too
tiny there are also apps like set res X
that will drop the retina scaling
altogether if you really need every
single pixel which I use for some apps
like speed grade things like the design
and screen are important but a laptop is
basically a paperweight without some
decent specs the base configuration
comes with a Broadwell Core i5 with iris
6100 graphics 8 gigabytes of RAM and I
128 gigabyte SSD compare this with the
new MacBook and for the same price you
get a 256 gigabyte drive but a much less
powerful Core M processor we'll see how
they actually compare soon so be sure to
subscribe to catch my video on the new
MacBook but the pro is looking pretty
solid right now the 13-inch Pro I've got
here is upgraded with the core i7 16
gigabytes of memory and a 512 gigabyte
SSD one of the big behind-the-scenes
upgrades on the new MacBook is a faster
PCIe based SSD it's fast like the
fastest SSD I've ever tested with read
and write speeds over 1,300 megabytes
per second things get a little as
exciting when you look at the CPU though
we're still looking at a dual-core chip
across the board on the 13-inch MacBook
if you want quad-core you'll have to
take the step up to the 15-inch the new
14 nanometer Broadwell chips to keep the
clocks relatively high even the base 13
inch starts at 2.7 gigahertz and goes up
to 3.4 gigahertz with the core i7 still
though we've only got two cores and the
Geekbench numbers top out at just about
half of what the 15-inch MacBook can
muster on the graphics side things are a
bit better
the iris graphics are able to keep OS 10
running nice and smooth and it posts a
solid improvement over the MacBook Air
and last gen pro and Cinebench no one
should buy a Mac for gaming but that
graphics performance does make some
light gaming possible minecraft runs no
problem here with everything turned up
and even
of your title like Tomb Raider is
playable as long as you don't mind
turning down the settings a bit one of
the biggest questions I've had was how
the 13-inch pro handles video I've
edited my last three videos with Adobe
Premiere CC on MacBook and I've been
pleasantly surprised it's able to keep
up with editing 1080p AVC HD clips just
fine only slowing down when I'm working
with complicated effects where I really
miss a quad-core CPU is when exporting
but for the actual edit the 13-inch
MacBook Pro is absolutely usable battery
life isn't too bad either with wider use
like listening to music and web browsing
you should expect around 9 hours of
longevity where things like gaming and
video editing will bring that closer to
3 hours the MacBook Pro is an expensive
laptop you do get a solid build
excellent screen and press a new track
pad and a blisteringly fast SSD the lack
of dedicated graphics is a slight
disappointment but not having a
quad-core CPU option it's a big problem
for a laptop at this price 95% of the
time you won't notice but I would
happily trade a couple hours of battery
life to have the extra power when I need
it if you're looking at a macbook the 13
pro is the best trade-off between power
and portability but you're going to have
to pay for it so what do you guys think
about the new MacBook Pro let me know in
the comments below if you enjoyed want
to see more videos like this definitely
be sure to subscribe to the channel
anyway guys thank you so much for
watching and I will catch you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
