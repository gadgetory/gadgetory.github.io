with a review of the iPhone 5 with a
larger screen LTE and some of the best
Hardware period is the new iPhone for
you to start with we have to go over the
design in pictures it looks just like
the iPhone 4 and 4s but in person it's a
huge change the first thing I noticed
was just how light it is even though
it's larger it weighs 20% less
build quality is also absolutely
top-notch with incredibly fine
tolerances and more importantly an
excellent feel take the rear for example
it's now mostly aluminum with glass on
top and bottom which works really nicely
in the hand
I think Druce ended up nicely as it
really is slimmer lighter and sleeker in
a major way on bottom you'll see the new
Lightning port which is much smaller and
reversible however if you've got 30-pin
docks and cables you're going to need
adapters the headphone jack has also
been moved to the bottom of the iPhone 5
not a big deal to me but it's something
not everyone is a fan of up front you'll
find a larger 4-inch display with a
resolution of 11 36 by 640 and
immediately you'll notice it makes a big
difference the added height gives you
more screen real estate to work with
which is something the iPhone has been
needing for quite a while it's not all
perfect however apps need to be updated
to work with the iPhone 5s larger screen
if not they revert to a smaller size
with letterboxing something I found
strange is that iOS really doesn't take
advantage of the larger screen
notifications still cover up the top of
whatever you're doing and the experience
feels like Apple just stretched iOS to
fit rather than tailor to really use the
larger size iOS 6 comes pre-installed on
the iPhone 5 and is honestly my biggest
letdown
technically it's faster than ever and
there are numerous bits of Polish edit
but the improvements are minor Alcona
puts it best I think the hardware is
great but the software lets it down
Google Maps and YouTube were removed in
exchange for Apple maps there are a few
improvements like turn-by-turn
directions and a new 3d view but for the
most part it doesn't match up with
Google Maps app select passbook are
meant to make it easy to use your iPhone
for boarding passes tickets and more but
without NFC it's more of a novelty iOS 6
isn't broken but it's absolutely lacking
innovation compared to Windows Phone and
Android internally you'll find a new
Apple a6 dual-core processor clocked at
1.2 gigahertz paired with 1 gigabyte of
RAM here I have to say I'm impressed
this is the fastest system on a chip
you'll find in any photo tablet out
right now with a GPU on par with the
iPad 3 gaming is impressive with enough
horsepower to run even the most
demanding games without breaking a sweat
once games like Real Racing 3 come out
you can
expect near console quality graphics on
your phone in day-to-day use there's
definitely a difference although
opinions vary on how much most people
feel it's not a massive improvement over
the already fast iPhone 4s
although upgrades from the iPhone 4
tended to be much more rest from the 3GS
it's really no contest one of the big
additions is LTE which unlike on the
iPhone 4s is true for G speeds here are
really impressive as the better the most
home connections and I can see LTE being
worth the upgrade alone for a lot of
people with the bigger screen more
powerful specs in LTE battery life is
actually quite a bit better even with
fairly heavy usage including calls
shooting video and gaming and was easily
able to get through a day and I don't
think it's a stretch at all to get two
days out of a charge with more average
use the rear camera is mostly unchanged
with the same eight megapixel camera
with 1080p video recording
there have been upgrades in the optics
but for the most part it's the same
quality from the iPhone 4s it's one of
the best smartphone cameras out there
but probably not for long with phones
like the Nokia Lumia 920 on the horizon
video is also still solid but nothing
spectacular as it still doesn't
autofocus on its own unless you tap to
focus one nice improvement is that you
can take pictures while recording video
and the camera will take pictures about
as fast as you can hit the shutter
button panorama mode is also included
although it's hardly a groundbreaking
feature the bigger change is with the
front-facing camera which has been
upgraded to 1.2 megapixels and shoots in
720p it's nothing on the rear camera but
for video chatting or recording a quick
clip it's really not bad like Tim said I
think it will make a nice improvement
for vloggers the iPhone 5 is a solid
upgrade and easily the best one yet with
LTE a bigger screen improved battery
life and an outstanding design I don't
have a problem recommending this at all
what it doesn't do is present a great
case to switch from Android or Windows
Phone while the hardware is top-notch
iOS is in serious need of an overhaul as
it feels clunky and intuitive much of
the time put simply the iPhone 5 is one
of the best phones out there and an easy
choice for a lot of people but it's not
the best phone for everyone if you
enjoyed and really appreciate if you
could leave this video a thumbs up and
