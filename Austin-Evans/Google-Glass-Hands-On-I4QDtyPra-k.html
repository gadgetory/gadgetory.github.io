glass here at VidCon thanks to my good
buddy Lamar which you guys should all
know him already
definite so I stole his glass and we're
actually in the hotel room because it's
clearly the most professional place on
earth to film of this and the Quietus
because we're here at VidCon yeah
there's not like not a concert behind
this or Disney like doing fireworks or
anything else totally both of those
things that exact right now video
there's Google glass
cool yes so you want to tell everybody
what Google glass is and how you got it
and why I have stole it from you yes so
Google is basically in some you know
wearable technology you know for
computers and you can take pictures with
it record yeah as voice commands as
touch commands you could drive with this
sort of navigational beat this little
window right up here that shows the map
whether you're walking or driving or
even riding a bike and and you could do
Google searches like hey Google why is
Lamar's voice so scratchy because that's
because I'm a lesson oh look at that
he's doing it right now stop it
okay didn't work quick okay yeah so and
so you can do Google searches I can have
a such a call certain favorite friends
of mine my phone is connected or
actually call I can say hey call mom
okay class call my mom I should transfer
having everything you say right now it's
kind of I knows my voice okay I've got
to say though like as far as like
actually wearing the class because there
are no lenses you know you think like
glasses but like there's no lenses there
are like sunglasses and stuff that you
like pop in but like just I know me
standing here it's just like the little
bit of the windows like up on top right
but it's not like it's like totally
coverage of vision or anything like that
just like something that's off to the
side all right so there's actually quite
a few things you can do with glass it's
still kind of a beta so you can't
I'm sure they'll add some more features
but basically the way to use it is
pretty simple so like we were saying
earlier if I want to turn it on I can
just kind of tell my head up or I can
just tap on and it'll kind of light it
up so I think you guys should be able to
see so from right here I can say okay
glass take a picture and bam just took a
picture of the camera so you can also do
some other things so I'll go ahead and
just let it come back on so I can
actually swipe from left to right and
actually pull up like here's traffic I
know you guys can't see this it's kind
of hard to film this but traffic is like
calendar notifications so this movie so
I can tap on that so it's going to show
some movies that
playing nearby so I can kind of scroll
through those it's actually really
interesting because you figure like
obviously don't have a phone or anything
to actually use like you know real
controls whatever but just being able to
swipe back and forth and just do the
gesture there we go type it down to go
back actually seems to be really cool so
now go ahead and go back over here okay
glass record a video okay so now it's
recording so you guys can see hello hi
so that's one thing as you guys can see
it's very small in bytes just wearing it
here it's not really heavy or anything
like that but doesn't have a ton of
battery life I actually don't know how
to really be able to fix that until like
they get like some magic batteries
because if you get like a giant battery
it probably kind of look a little silly
cuz you can see right here there's
really nothing here's the lens and I'm
sure like most of the stuff isn't here
and I feel like I was probably the
battery is that about right yeah so I
mean I've got to say though just like
being able to wear them for a few
minutes just be able to play around with
it it's actually really really cool
alright so after trying Google glass
I've got a same actually a lot more
excited about it than I was before I was
I don't you know I thought about is like
I looks kind of cool but actually after
trying it I see how it could definitely
be kind of useful day-to-day you've had
it for a little while how's it been for
you yeah better for about a week and you
know I've tested it a couple hours a day
and noting up to it and I really find it
quite fascinating I loved it
sometimes I forget is even on I you know
I see that yeah yeah I use of mine here
at VidCon and it was and I was just
naturally tilting my head to get the
time first popped up right as I did that
yeah or just take pictures so I think
it's gonna be cool does any work of
course it's a beta but I think it's
awesome I think the driving navigation
will be brilliant it's better look this
way then just look down it's really not
distracting like a lot of people think
it's gonna be like this giant thing over
here it's a very small little thing on
the top so it's all good anyway thank
you so much for letting me borrow your
glass okay so go check out Lamar is
youtube.com slash Lamarr Wilson what can
they find in your channel which I can
find Tecna comedy lifestyle stuff and
I'm supposedly the world's funniest tech
reporter it's what he's not supposedly
