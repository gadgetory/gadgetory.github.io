inside tech today we will be taking a
look at the release date and possible
price as well of the HTC evo 4g a really
solid phone guys is looking pretty good
in addition we also have a very cool
tutorial on how to turn your normal sim
card into a micro sim for using your
ipad 3g very handy if you have one of
those and lastly we want to take them
locate I Android for the iphone 3g this
is something i'm really excited about
guys I'm kind of an Android nerd and
android running on the iphone just
really new excitement that's not weird
is it anyway let's give this one start
okay guys so to begin with let's take a
look at the HTC evo 4g really promising
new smartphone is going to be coming to
sprint soon or more specifically looks
like june six now i won't go into all
the details I'm sure you guys heard
about it a million times already but
I'll just go with it really basics it's
a very very cool looking HTC android
smartphone I mean the main claim to fame
it's got a lot of cool things like a
Snapdragon processor a very high
resolution screen a lot of cool stuff
like that but the main claim to fame
it's going to be the first for once
she's phone on sprint now sprint is i'm
not i don't know the exact numbers but I
know the Sprint is really heavily
advertised school G and they really seem
to be I believe that made people who
actually built it out and actually have
a decent porgy network again I don't
know the exact numbers are noticing oh
good cities but so it's pretty cool deal
that they're actually going to be
getting the evo 4g because this phone is
looks like I mean it's going to be just
fantastic sand all kinds of great
features and in fact this one be running
on a really high speed 4G network and of
course it can come down to 3G network if
you know you'll have to get 4G in your
area most people don't but some people
do that's a very cool thing so yeah best
today and of course the price we've only
heard this one before that the day gene
States several times the price we've
only heard months but it seems like on
contracts 2200 ollar sounds fantastic
about the norm for cell phones these
days and we're not sure but it looks
like might be on without a contract
might be six hundred dollars okay this
is all kind of speculation as far as the
price is concerned that's just from you
know one person who supposedly heard
this from radioshack so it wouldn't
totally trust it but two hundred two
hundred dollars on contract and six
hundred dollars off contract sounds
pretty reasonable to me so I wouldn't be
surprised that's what we end up sitting
ok guys so now for a little bit of news
if you have an ipad 3g this is going to
be pretty handy there is a tutorial I
so have it linked below there is a
tutorial on how to turn your normal sim
card into a micro sim card now if you
don't know what this means basically
it's very simple their ipad 3g news with
a micro sim card which is literally
identical to a normal sim card except
it's just been cut down and basically
that's all you have to do to get your
normal sim card down to a microcenter
they might be wondering what i would you
want to do this well didn't know already
the ipad 3g comes unlocked already so
when you buy it's not a problem at all
you to just take out your AT&amp;amp;T micro sim
and either by one by a micro sim maybe
like t-mobile or somewhere else although
I will help it you really can't do that
right now or you can just take your
existing sim card and just cut it down
very carefully to around the contacts
put it in and should work just fine I'm
force a bit of warning you know you guys
keep one small cut that goes wrong
whatever and you could lose your simple
but as long as you're careful it looks
like it'd be pretty good so if you're
interested maybe I'm getting it onto
mobile or some other carrier just cut
down your sim card definitely take a
look at the tutorial and what we taking
a look at today is a very very cool
thing guys I'm really kind of got
android nerd but I planet being a member
of the iphone dev team has just posted a
video showing that he's got android
running on the iphone 3g neck if you
remember a couple expect they had he was
able to port it over to the iphone 2g
which is just fantastic basically
working perfectly just you know live
it's slow but now he has brought it over
to the iphone 3g and it's basically done
only main things is it sound is not
working in multi touches a little bit
off but both these things are going to
be easily fixed i think she's already
welcomed on load might be down here with
a few days it's really fantastic horses
still those bugs and glitches it's not
hunterson perfect with all the main
things for
you know like sending calls works if the
sound is at work but everything like
that water shooting internet a lot of
really cool stuff I mean it's it's
really fantastic and of course it's dual
boot too so you all you have to do is
just going to shut off your iPhone it
just goes to an open eye boot menu and
then you just select you either do you
want you on the iphone or less is more
and really really cool thing so I'm
going to looking forward to this okay
what more it's just getting better and
better and I'm really going to look for
two once Android hits all ipods and
iphones and hopefully an ipad and that's
it for this episode of Inside thing

liked feel free to subscribe I
continuously do all kinds of videos
about you ipods iphones jailbreaking as
well as just general techniques so
