of face time running on the iPod Touch
4th generation so it works really quite
well pretty much identical to the way it
works on the iPhone 4 so I'm glad to
show you so go ahead just opened the
FaceTime application now I mean go ahead
go through contacts favorites and all
that kind of stuff I'll go ahead just
call my friend Adam or take tech man TVs
you guys probably know him hey man hey
so anyway guys this is of course tech
tech man TV I'm sure most of you guys
know him I'm say hello man this is gonna
be awkward so hey what do you think of
the picture quality I hear ya I mean you
can't actually think I'm go ahead and
switch to the back camera and as you can
see switch to your back camera see it's
a if it looks any better there you go
so as you guys can see it does look a
little bit better for my and it actually
does look clearer on the back but I mean
obviously it'd be kind of a little bit
weird to go ahead and have it you know
facing backward well I don't know I
think over Wi-Fi uh it looks pretty
decent I mean I'd say it's about that's
it's better than most of Skype what do
you think yeah exactly which is one of
the cool things in the iPod touch
well you can do it with anything but
with iPod touch you don't have to do
phone number anything you just have to
get your email set up I'm I set up just
a bit ago and it was really simple you
just you know punch your email in you
should have to go and you have to back
it up on your email yep that should go
on the computer and hit that just say
yes all that kind of stuff but I mean it
was really simple I like hell I mean it
pretty much does turn your iPod Touch
into a phone you know yeah and there are
a lot of cool things hanging on that
second you can go ahead and flip it over
this way letting really do anything we
also go ahead yeah there you go I'm
gonna go ahead and move this all the way
around it's pretty much just lit pretty
much locks but do ever you want you can
flip it over and of course you go ahead
and do this or you can go ahead and mute
so I muted right now and on mute so it's
pretty cool of course
go ahead and hit end so what do you
think about the new iPod Touch so far
you guys yours longer than I have oh
yeah oh yeah I I've I haven't had an
iPhone 4 I've only used it a little bit
when I got that Retina display I really
got into it I mean I was just so
impressed I still am it's well I was
looking at mine
um I know it doesn't supposedly have as
good viewing angles I don't have an
iPhone 4 here to do it but looking at it
I thought that the viewing angles were
pretty good especially from directly to
the left into the right I thought it was
pretty much great it did get a little
washed out when you get like tilted like
this actually you can go out and see
that on the camera right now but I think
it's pretty good
I think it's pretty good for you know
being you know a couple hundred dollars
mm-hmm I mean all in all I'm really
impressed especially with how thin it is
I think that's just fantastic it's it's
so much thinner than anything else I
mean you thinking break it yeah oh yes
yeah that's it that's that's that's what
I was saying I mean tried the headphone
I don't even there is a headphone the
same way yeah I was afraid I started to
plug my old one in I've got the old one
from the iPod I started to plug it in
and it was not going I was a president
break it tried to try the unwrap the new
one hmm yeah and literally I actually
laid it down and it is the iPod is
identical the exact same thickness as
the dock connector have you noticed that
yeah it's same so actually I don't know
what they're gonna do I don't I don't
think it's even possible for it to get
any thinner do nothing get a new dock
connector anyway hey man thanks for the
call and thanks for helping me demo
FaceTime okay thanks man so yeah guys
that is FaceTime on the iPod touch I
like it I think it's really cool I'm
definitely one of the headlining
features of the iPod Touch 4th
generation
anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
