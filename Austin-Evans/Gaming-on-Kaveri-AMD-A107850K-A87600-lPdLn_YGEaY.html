here to see if you can run your entire
gaming PC off of one of these little
guys after months of hype the new AMD
Kaveri a fuse have finally dropped and
they were nice enough to send along a
couple for me to test the new a 8 7600
and the a 10 7850 k if you guys don't
know what an APU is it's essentially an
AMD Radeon graphics card that just
happens to be built alongside a CPU all
in one package both the new a 8 and a 10
have a quad core processor built in
clocked it up to 3.8 or 4 gigahertz
along with those GC and base Radeon
graphics cores which is essentially a
cut-down version of what you would find
in the r9 290x they also come with
support for things like mantle as well
as trueaudio but the real question is
can they handle actual gaming so because
the most common question and I build
videos is well it run minecraft
even with a $120 APU the answer is a
definite yes this is at 1080p with the
render distance and graphics completely
maxed out and as you can see the vanilla
game is no problem at all the handle on
the 78 50k moving on to something a
little more taxing we have battlefield 4
if you don't mind turning the graphics
down to low at 1080p you can get
entirely playable frame rates in the 30s
running on the integrated r7 graphics
something to keep in mind is that this
is with standard battlefield once the
mantle patch drops I expect a decent
performance increase next up is BioShock
Infinite this is definitely one of my
favorite games of 2013 and even on low
settings at 1080p it's still not bad
looking at all like the rest of these
games if you're willing to drop the
resolution a bit you can bump up the
graphics but as is it's pretty
impressive for an APU grid 2 is another
new game that you can handle no problem
on Kaveri here we're looking at frame
rates in the 40s on medium settings
again a 1080p while I personally prefer
the gameplay of the original grid this
latest version does look nicer and as
you can see it runs absolutely no
problem at all still the best-looking PC
game out right now in my opinion Crysis
3 was one of the few games that was
unplayable on earlier ap use armed with
the 78 50 K and some fast 21 33
megahertz memory it's finally playable
albeit on most
at 720p since it is such a demanding
game though the fact that runs it all
here is impressive so now that you can
see that yes you actually can't play
games on Kaveri let's take a closer look
to see how the new a10 and a8 stack up
with the previous generation a few use
kaveri is a solid step board for gaming
but my choice would probably be the a8
7,600 provide $120 when it goes on sale
in the next month or two I was very
impressed with the performance what do
you guys think would you pick an APU for
your next gaming build let me know in
the comments below anyway thank you guys
so much for watching if you enjoyed you
want to see more videos like this
definitely be sure to subscribe to the
channel and I will catch you guys in the
next one what minecraft is totally like
challenging and demanding for calculator
I mean for you see minecraft running on
a iPad that's a lot of power</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
