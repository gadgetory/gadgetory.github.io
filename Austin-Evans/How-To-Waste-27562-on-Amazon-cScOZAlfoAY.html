meeting lunch how is this mystery tech
Oh
what the happy pork eat slowly cut
calories and improved digestion I
thought a smart fork was a sport eh I
asked how much this was $65 least I'd
get a delicious salad either deal so I
can't really argue too much the fork has
a USB port on the bottom because
naturally should I clean this before I
eat with it
like since it came out the package yeah
alright so I would like to start eating
so I'm gonna go have a nice bite salad
here mmm
great timing all right oh you're
vibrating
and it happened I'm wait five more
seconds
huh good I can't really test the happy
part cuz it takes so long to chew salad
let's see if I can trick the happy pork
oh look at that it's that she's not
falling for it what if I actually grab
something though I have something on the
fort oh wow I'm really impressed I
thought it's gonna be total bull wow
that's quite loud this my friends is the
smartphone magnifier wait what oh wow
that's that's a magnifier wait so this
whole thing is cardboard I mean I
appreciate that they're trying to make
it look all cool but this retro TV
definitely didn't have asked video in
how much was this $30 oh wait
stuffs falling out oh oh that's pretty
cool alright I'll give them props
they've got the retro vibe totally on
point so I guess what you do is you put
your smartphone in the tray and then
just drop it in there's also going to be
a little rubber mat maybe okay so if I
slide it in like this there we go that's
the look right there as far as actually
using it you can see absolutely nothing
until you're looking at it directly on
point besides that it gets very sort of
warped and you're sort of looking at the
top of the bottom but it doesn't sound
that bad - cool I gotta say like it is a
lot better than I expected
that's the total novelty but it kind of
sounds alright I mean there's some holes
for the speaker to come out alright
oh man what can why do you just have a
giant pillow I think actually know what
this is though this is one of those
sequin pillows where like if you move it
Oh yep yep it like create something oh
no oh I don't like where this is going
is this a pattern what is this
it just all looks Brown oh no wait a
minute oh wait no it's NIC cages face
Wow where did you find this
oh well let me guess Amazon yes of
course it is so you've got your Nick
Cage face when it's party time when it's
not party time don't know Nic Cage here
now you see him there you go
now you see him now you don't if Jake
does not own this pillow we need to give
him this pillow
Jake Roper my friends has multiple Nic
Cage shirts I've seen him wear at least
two of them I don't even want to know
how much this is cuz it's just come at
me upset that the money was wasted but
also $10 okay I feel much less bad about
this yeah not really feeling it come on
kind of hard but it is nice to know that
I'm laying on NIC cages face so come on
now headphones okay wait what's
headphones that have a detachable cable
like earbuds how much honey fifty
dollars not a lot for Kimberly dough
don't worry about it so these are the
final four thousand hi fight earphones I
take a wild guess and that you are going
to be the proud owner of these
headphones as soon as the video is over
that's what I thought they're very
lightweight they don't feel particularly
premium the cable the actual headphones
themselves but if you have this kind of
weird shape why did my phone just slide
off the table a little just low okay
okay that's fine okay base it's there
damn so it is going to be a little bit
more optimized for hip-hop so if you
have something that does have an
accentuated bass it's really going to
punch here but I've never heard
headphones that have this kind of bass
that are so small and they also have
such a wide soundstage you're not
getting it back these are these are mine
now you realize piggy probe the premium
phone stand it's a razor thin and
infinitely adjustable why is it called
pain Pro there's a mirror on the inside
so if your phone stand also wants to
function as a mirror to see like a
postage size stamp of your face
postage eyes stamp
postage post stamp size postage no
weight just stamp size yeah the postage
is probably necessary is it stamped is
postage
it's maybe not the most color matching
thing in the world but let's see how
this actually works as a stand oh look
my phone stands up nerf the zombie
strike crossbow this isn't tech I know a
pillow wasn't tech but this definitely
isn't tech oh so I just get to shoot you
with Nerf darts no that's okay I mean
this is not a normal mystery tech item
why I gotta say at least it's not a
robot dinosaur I can't really complain
about that we're after my nemesis has
arrived we actually should be shooting
rule Raptor
I feel like Robo Raptor should be my
ally in this particular fight Robo
Raptor are you ready yeah you are so
going on this okay high-five Wes would
not be happy cookies let me do that are
us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
