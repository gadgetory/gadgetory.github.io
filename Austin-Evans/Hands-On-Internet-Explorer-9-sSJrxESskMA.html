today I'm here with a video on some
hands-on time of the preview of internet
explorer 9 this is just they've just
released the preview and of course this
is by no means a complete browser
they've released the preview of internet
explorer 9 and it brings with a lot of
really cool things such as html5 support
as well as hardware acceleration and I
will get to that in just a minute so
yeah guys just hang around now go ahead
and show you guys a little bit about it
and show you guys buy it actually could
be a pretty cool browser anyway let's
get this one started ok guys so before
we begin let me go ahead and just show
you guys a few of the benchmarks that
Microsoft is run and I will note that
yeah don't think these are faked I've
actually tried most of them and they all
are a hundred snack here so no worries
so on the sunspider test as you can see
internet explorer 9 not amazing it still
behind safari in chrome and opera but i
will note that like they said its Sun
spiders really made for web kit which is
what they run so for internet explorer 9
it's a little bit different it's not
quite made for internet explorer 9 but
still as you can see here and explore a
got like 37,000 I mean 3700 and explore
9 got 600 so you know that's a pretty
big jump so go ahead and show you guys
acid 3 and of course I've run it too it
only gets 55 not amazing pretty much
every browser beats that but considering
that you know Internet Explorer 8
usually failed the test not too terrible
so now let's go ahead and show you guys
a couple of the cool features so they
have a cool test page that had shows a
little bit of the hardware acceleration
so i'll go ahead and show you guys one
are now so there's a really cool thing
called flying images now of course my
screen recording might not be quite
right then you see up on the top left it
shows the frames per second so basically
this is just using javascript and
basically in this is a little bit
different where
actually tapping into my computer
graphics card so instead of you know
just entirely using the processor it s
actually using the graphics card so you
know to help the computer you know not
quite use up so much system resources
and run a little bit better so you can
see here it runs really nice and smooth
we're averaging about 50 frames per
second and of course you can go ahead
and add more go ahead and have another
hour of 64 images and it's still running
pretty nice and smooth so let's go ahead
and speed up some and it's still holding
steady about 53 frames per second so
just using this test of course it's made
for internet explorer 9 but you're just
using this test I'll show you guys it
and a couple of other browsers okay guys
so this is the exact same test that just
shows you running in an explorer 9 which
is averaging about 50 frames per second
and now I'm you're running Chrome 5 or
I'm sorry chrome 4.1 beta as you can see
your it is barely crawling long it's
running at about two frames per second
so obviously this kind of gives you an
idea of what the hardware acceleration
and explore 9 and this this is pretty
cool because it's about the first test
I've seen a long time the Internet's and
explore actually is doing good so but
now let me go ahead and show you guys
opera where it's just a little bit of a
different story okay guys so this is the
exact same test running in opera 10.5
now here it's actually not too bad it's
running about 41 42 frames per second
and it looks really quite smooth so it
goes to show you that you know this this
is a very specific test and yeah chrome
did not do very good but offer did and
obviously internet explorer 9 did so it
gives you an idea of how important
hardware acceleration is although it's
definitely not the most important thing
hey guys so let me go ahead and show you
guys just opening up some random web
pages so let's first start with gizmodo
com which is a pretty heavy website so
i'll see how internet explorer 9 runs it
and right off the bat you can definitely
see that it runs pretty well I mean
especially compared to Internet Explorer
8 it runs much much snappier see here
it's not perfect but obviously this is
not a it's not by any means a complete
browsers just preview so
it seems to run really nice and smooth
you know this is the pretty view so it
doesn't really have any kind of you I
obviously this is just a this is just a
placeholder basically all this is is
just to test it but it runs pretty nice
and smooth and you can go ahead and
click on just the Internet Explorer 9
page I guess there we go maybe massy
that and that's kind of a little bit of
thing it's not it's obviously a preview
there we go and it doesn't like to work
a lot of the times but of course you can
see that obviously it does work fairly
well sometimes and you know smoothing
everything is nice and smooth so yeah
guys it looks pretty solid ok guys so
that is a first look at the preview of
internet explorer 9 I'm pretty impressed
with it um normal a little bit of
browsing it can kind of have a few
hang-ups like you just saw so that kind
of doesn't you know Bo too well but it's
a preview very very very early and of
course you know I'm sure they will you
know smooth it out a lot but what I'm
really excited about is the results and
a lot of the JavaScript and acid tests
or anything they're not amazing but
they're actually pretty solid but what I
really like is the fact that it includes
hardware acceleration now if you guys
can see here there are a lot of
different tests and I've tried them all
and they are all very very cool you know
there's a lot of really graphically
intense ones that pretty much all the
browsers you know Chrome Opera Safari
Firefox they're all choking on them and
internet explorer 9 is running them
great obviously I know that that are
made specifically for internet explorer
9 but still the fact that developers and
you know you could have a website that's
totally coated for that and it would
work already without any kind of you
know special modifications for an
Internet Explorer 9 it's pretty cool so
yeah guys that is a first look at
internet explorer 9 I'm pretty impressed
with it I gotta say this is the first
time I've been you know impressed with
internet explorer 9 or an explorer in
general for a while but we'll go ahead
and keep taking a look at it if you're
interested go ahead check out the side
bar or the underbar more info or
whatever the cost these days check it
out you can go ahead and download and
try this for yourself anyway guys thanks
