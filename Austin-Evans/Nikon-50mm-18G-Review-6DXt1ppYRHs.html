of the Nikon 50 millimeter 1.8 G lens
this is the lightest 50 millimeter Nick
or prime lens and features quite a few
of the latest technologies little
compatibility for crop sensor DSLRs such
as the D 3100 and D 5100 let's take a
look at what all it has to offer when
you pick up the 1.8 G you'll find that
it comes with a pouch for storing the
lens HP 47 lens hood along with the lens
itself taking a closer look you see the
lenses built quite well a bite out of
plastic up front you will find the front
element with a rather beefy 58
millimeter filter size and on top there
is the focus ring as well as an
integrated window to see focus distance
over on the left side there is the
switch for autofocus or manual focus a
nice feature is that even in autofocus
mode you can still manually override the
focus yourself to get the shot just
right the performance with the 1.8 G is
outstanding even at the maximum aperture
of f-18 images and video are very sharp
and colors are strong while stopping
things down a bit helps even more
especially in the corners the bouquet
aka the depth of field is also very nice
and soft
never distracting from the subject of
your image much of this performance is
due to the single a spherical element
which is a first for a Nikon 50
millimeter prime lens it's also fairly
quiet when focusing in video mode
although it is not silent
there is a trade-off for all this and it
is the barrel distortion while not
noticeable under most circumstances it
is there especially if you like taking
pictures of brick walls I mean come on
who doesn't overall for the roughly $220
price I have no problems recommending
this to any Nikon user who likes a
similar lens the performance is
absolutely there the build quality is
just fine and the price is spot-on
providing much of the performance of the
1.4 G for less than half the price if
you enjoyed the video definitely be sure
to leave a thumbs up and if you're
interested in more be sure to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
