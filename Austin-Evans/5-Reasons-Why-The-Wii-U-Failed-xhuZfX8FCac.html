this is Austin the WiiU was the biggest
flop in Nintendo history they're sure
they had weird experiments like the
Virtual Boy but coming off of the
massively successful Wii there's a real
sense that Nintendo could do no wrong
and yet we have this reason number one
is a simple one the name was just not a
good idea
now don't get me wrong we was not a bad
console but a lot of people first of all
didn't realize there was even a separate
console by itself lots lots of people
just thought that it was a tablet add-on
for the original Wii and I mean with ads
like this can you blame them and did we
mention togetherness should check out
the simulation don't get me wrong a ton
of people made fun of the name of the
original Wii at least until it wasn't
basically every living room on the face
of the planet the problem is that six
years after the launch of the original
Wii Nintendo brought this out and a lot
of people just asked what exactly wasn't
it is a big problem when tons of people
don't realize that your shiny brand-new
console is an actual shiny new console
and that's some add-on for the original
Wii especially when you consider that
after a hundred million sales of the
original Wii and merely 13 million with
the Wii U Nintendo had a major branding
problem that honestly could have been
solved by just calling this the Wii 2 or
you know the Wii
he wants you to buy our console edition
reason number two why the Wii U was
sales challenged had to do with the
tablet that served as its controller the
gamepad it's easy to forget the back of
2012 tablets were touted as the next big
thing
unfortunately what was not the next big
thing was a giant unwieldy tablet that
was completely useless if it was not
connected to its base station that's the
beauty of a console like the switch it
has pretty much none of the same
downsides as the Wii U so you're going
to be getting a more powerful system
that's going to be a lot smaller a lot
more portable and to top it all off you
can take it with you anywhere as opposed
to the Wii U where you can take this
anywhere as long as this is no more than
20 to 25 feet away with the Wii U the
gamepad relied on a local wireless
connection and well that was fine for
the most part get you far away and it
completely falls apart however once
you're actually close to the Wii U
console it does work pretty well in
theory you could never plug this into a
TV and just use the gamepad for all of
your gameplay it launched the gamepad
also had another problem not very good
battery life so the first models would
last somewhere in the neighborhood of
three to three-and-a-half hours on a
charge which really isn't great for a
controller thankfully later models did
bump that up to something closer to 6 to
7 but if you're one of those early
adopters of the Wii U you would better
not stay too far from a charger with
this guy now this might sound like a
little bit of a nitpick but one of the
issues especially with games like Super
Smash Brothers is that while this is
always going to be one of your
controllers you can only ever have one
gamepad pair with the Wii U at the same
time meaning that if everyone comes over
for a game of Smash Brothers someone's
always gonna get stuck with the giant
controller however don't get me wrong
this is not all fatted by any means so
first of all the idea this has a lot of
interesting tech that was legitimately
new for the time is cool stuff like NFC
support for amiibos which would come a
little bit later really was the first
time this has ever shown in a Nintendo
console and the idea that you do have a
camera you do have decent controls even
though it's a little bit big touchscreen
there's a lot to like here but this was
a major hurdle for the Wii U to overcome
a lot of people just straight-up thought
that it was an accessory for the
original Wii kinda hard to get over that
one before we move on I want to give a
huge shout out to me vote for sponsoring
this video so what you're looking at
right now is being shot on aim
evil camera it's basically the next best
thing to having your own ken what's so
cool about the Nebo is that it as a
small pocketable 4k camera there's full
capabilities of turning itself into a
live-streaming control room so basically
once you pair it with the app you can
use that to be able to pan around the
shot do zooms do punch ends and all this
stuff is going to be completely digital
thanks to that 4k sensor what makes them
evil unique is that this single camera
can live stream to a variety of sources
including YouTube Facebook as well as
periscope and what's cool is because
it's so small and it does have a tripod
mount in the box
you could easily set this up on the go
so in addition to be able to work over
Wi-Fi you can also connect it to your
phone and use it over LTE to livestream
something like a concert or in my case I
can livestream a super cool match of
Mario Kart well my favorite parts really
is how the app works so really simply I
can say zoom out on the shot I can tap
on my face I can tap on the screen I can
sort of punch and punch out there's
really so many different options to be
able to kind of get a more studio
quality experience out of a camera that
is really going to fit in your pocket so
if you want to up your livestream game
totally be sure to go check out the
amiibo at the link in the description
and while you're there you can check out
my coupon code which will get you like
$50 off anyway huge ads me vote for
sponsoring this video
reason number three has to do with power
it's easy to forget but the Wii U
actually came out only a year before the
Xbox one and the ps4 whether we was
essentially just a faster GameCube the
way you did some legitimately
interesting stuff of course one of the
biggest bleeps was the leap ship HD
something that the Xbox 360 bh2 by like
seven years however there was more to it
than just that as opposed to the anemic
single core CPU that was found in both
the Gamecube and the Wii instead that we
use depth all the way up to a triple
core PowerPC processor although this was
hardly cutting-edge even back in 2012
Nintendo also included a dual AMD GPU
setup well technically at least so in
addition to the standard GPU which is
what the Wii U uses to run its normal
games you're also going to be getting a
copy of the Wii GPU now this is for
backwards compatibility and it does work
really well here although interestingly
you actually can't unlock GameCube
backwards compatibility as well although
that is definitely not going to be fully
supported at least if you ask Nintendo
two gigs of RAM the way you does have a
healthy advantage over both the Xbox 360
as well as the ps3 and in a lot of ways
the Wii U is going to be more powerful
unfortunately the way you came out in
2012 and again being only a year away
from both the Xbox one and ps4 this
really had a difficult time competing
with the current generation of consoles
just like the Wii it had a lot of
interesting capabilities but high
performance definitely wasn't one of
them reason number four has to do with
price so the way you first came out
there were two models
first of all a basic white version which
looks very very similar to the original
Wii and then there's the black deluxe
edition which is a little bit more
expensive at least didn't look quite so
much like the consoles that it was
replacing considering that you were
getting a console with roughly the same
power as the outgoing Xbox 360 and ps3
prices weren't exactly cheap so the
basic model came with only a gigabytes
of storage for $300 and even stepping up
to the deluxe model was still and gets
you 32 gigs of storage at a $350 price
tag
maybe be fair it wasn't all bad from the
start the first couple of months of the
Wii being on sale
Nintendo sold over three million units
unfortunately after that
well sales kind of fell off of a cliff
and they really never recovered due to
the high cost of the gamepad which had
to be included with every single Wii U
Nintendo really didn't have a lot of
options to be able to boost the liking
sales so after about a year they were
able to drop the price on the deluxe
model from $350 to 300 the day but it
really was not a lot of room for them to
do anything besides hope the people
would finally buy this
misunderstood wonderful console now that
was the only problem with the Wii U they
probably would have been just fine
however with problems quickly mounting
the Wii U having only been on sale for
less than a year the real challenges
were coming up very quickly ps4 Xbox one
as you might imagine very quickly
outsold the Wii U and never looked back
and that brings us to reason number five
why the Wii U was a failure third-party
support or more specifically the almost
complete lack thereof no let's be real
the original we did have a lot of
third-party games the problem was most
of them were a complete garbage
however with a hundred million consoles
in the wild a lot of developers in fact
pretty much all developers really didn't
have a lot of choice you had to make a
weak game and when it comes to Wii U
they didn't really have that constraint
which means they really didn't have to
actually make Wii U games and so it to
be fair there were some third-party
games on the Wii U most specifically
Ubisoft actions did support it for the
first few years however the issue was is
that with so few consoles in the wild
and such a huge disparity between the
performance of the Wii U and the
brand-new Xbox one and ps4 it was very
difficult for developers to justify
spending the time and money to bringing
on actually decent Wii U game to the
platform maybe these more complicated
was the promise of the gamepad and of
course most first parties didn't take
great advantage of this so it comes to
third-party support yeah that really
wasn't a thing didn't really put things
in context the final tally here in the
US for third-party games released under
Wii U was a mere 118 titles that is far
less than any other main Nintendo
console by a lot don't get me wrong
there were some amazing Nintendo titles
for the Wii U but at this point almost
all of them have been ported to the
switch and are oftentimes even better
than their original versions and the
ones that haven't been ported are pretty
much already on the way it was a cool
console there's a lot they did right but
the games either weren't there or just
better on switch today anyway it's kind
of ironic to think that the switch
really is just a Wii U 2.0 with the tech
that actually supports the original
vision sometimes it just goes to show
success and failure it can be two
different sides of the same coin that's
how it's done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
