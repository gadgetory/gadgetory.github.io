between the iPhone 4s and the iPod Touch
4th generation now to be clear even
though this iPod is about a year or so
old is identical to the one that you
would pick up today so you know a 2011
model even a1 and white while it might
look different is going to be the exact
same as far as the specs the build
quality all that kind of stuff so to
start with let's go ahead and do a quick
size comparison so we'll go ahead and
make ourselves a little sandwich here
and as you guys can see of course the
iPod Touch is going to be considerably
thinner and now not to say the iPhone 4s
is you know particularly thick but it
does have to have additional things such
as you know a cellular radio this bigger
beef your antenna all that kind of stuff
but that said if you're going for the
maximum thinness the iPod Touch is
certainly going to went there and then
moving on to the specs the iPhone 4s all
does definitely win this one no
competition so you guys not familiar
with some of the specs down here the
iPhone 4s does have a 1 gigahertz
dual-core Apple a5 processor so beats
the single core 1 gigahertz in the iPod
touch it also does have double the
amount of RAM so you can go ahead and
pick this up with 512 megabytes of RAM
as opposed to 256 and if we flip them
over onto the back guess I see here the
camera on the iPhone 4s far surpasses
the iPod Touch this is an 8 megapixel
shooter that shoots 1080p video as
opposed to eight point seven megapixel
camera which only shoots about 720p
video so as far as the camera goes to go
by far the iPhone 4 just absolutely
trounces it there's more to something
than just a camera or some satar's aside
so let's go ahead and boot these up and
go ahead and get a little quick
comparison with the speeds so go ahead
and turn them both on here and I do want
to mention that the iPod touch is
currently jailbroken and it will be
slightly slower however on the whole of
it
iPod touch I mean there's not a whole
lot as far as the jailbreaking stuff
goes so I do take these results with a
grain of salt but overall it's not
really particularly that much slower so
the first thing is let's go ahead and
open up a web page alright so I'm now
going to load a website neither of these
devices have ever been on and to make
sure that the test is fair they're both
on the same
Wi-Fi networks let's go ahead and click
go so of course we expect the iPod I
mean the rather the iPhone 4s to win but
I know that was actually not too well
pretty close and now I have to time to
watch the video but I'd say there was
only about maybe a second or two
difference so let's go ahead and try
another test all right so now we're
going to go ahead and open up an app in
this case Angry Birds on both devices so
if neither of them have been opened and
you know that all the memories close out
so let's go ahead and open at the same
time sir let's let the iPod might have
gotten a slider slightly better start
however I think it's pretty obvious that
the 4s is much much quicker you're going
through all the menus so what and just
let them run through we'll go ahead and
turn that volume down but I think it was
pretty obvious that the iPhone 4s was
definitely much faster at opening an app
or at least opening Angry Birds okay so
I am now recording using the rear facing
cameras on both the iPod Touch 4th
generation as well as the iPhone 4s so
I'm gonna go ahead and just walk around
a little bit here
of course the 4s does shoot in 1080p as
opposed to 720p but yeah so I'll do a
little bit of walking so you guys can
see exactly what the you know the motion
capture and how well it does all that
kind of stuff but so you guys can see it
a good close-up now the iPod Touch does
not really have any kind of like auto
focus whereas iPhone 4s does but yeah so
that guy's been a quick video test of
the rear-facing cameras on both the
iPhone 4s as well as the iPod Touch 4th
generation
anyway guys it's going to be about it
for my comparison now while obviously
there can be no winner you know this is
the phone this is not so you know kind
of kind of makes things a little bit
difficult however I will say that the
iPod Touch does fare surprisingly well
well sure it's not going to be as fast
that's obvious I mean the camera is not
even in the same world as the iPhone 4s
camera
it still is a competent device and for
the price I had no problem recommending
it if you're interested in something
like this you have to pay the extra for
the iPhone and the data plans and all
that kind of stuff
anyway guys if you enjoyed this video
definitely be sure to leave the thumbs
up really does help me out and if you're
interested in more videos on both the
iPod Touch and the iPhone 4s be sure to
