here with part three of my tutorial on
building a gaming PC the last two parts
went over putting the computer together
so now let's get windows installed and
see how it performs there are several
ways to install windows 7 or 8 whichever
you prefer the first step is to buy the
windows system builder DVD which I have
linked into the description as well as
in the full bill guide where I go over
all the parts in this build the easiest
way is if you chose to install an
optical drive in your build but you can
also use a USB DVD drive if you don't
have either of these you can download
and install the windows ISO on a USB
Drive and just use the activation code
from your physical DVD turn on the
computer and hit the delete key to enter
the BIOS every motherboard manufacturer
sets this up slightly differently but
while you're here take a look to make
sure everything is displaying correctly
do you see all of your RAM listed is it
at the correct speed how about your hard
drive and CPU once you're sure
everything is correct go to advanced
mode and set your boot order to either
the optical drive USB optical drive or
USB hard drive depending on how you're
installing windows make sure the optical
drive or USB drive is connected and then
click the override to boot from your
installation media from here windows
will begin installing just plug in your
activation code when it asks for it and
follow the prompts if you have more than
one hard drive choose custom
installation and then pick whichever
Drive you want windows on typically your
SSD if you have one now just let windows
install and you're good to go
time for a demo of gameplay the first
game is Far Cry 3 which is not only a
ton of fun but it's also among the best
looking games to date the settings are
at 1080p with DirectX 11 turned on 2
times anti-aliasing and the graphics set
to high you can see the framerate in the
top left corner stays in the 40s for the
most part occasionally dipping into the
30s which is still perfectly playable
train your body and your mind will
follow but that hour will bring you
closer
next we have battlefield 3 which is
another game that delivers some
excellent graphics here again we're
playing at 1080p with two times
anti-aliasing and all graphics settings
set to high and we could probably turn
things up just a bit especially in the
campaign the computer is able to pull
between 40 and 50 frames per second for
the most part while still keeping well
over 30 and multiplayer
so there you have it the full tutorial a
demo of performance of the $600 gaming
PC if you guys are interested in
building one of these for yourself check
out the full build guide here as well as
part 1 and part 2 of the tutorial to see
how to put it all together if you
enjoyed be sure to hit up that like
button and subscribe anyway I'll catch
you guys in the next one for i3 for only
about $120 for a graphics card we're
going to be using a gigabyte Radeon HD
7850 set the cover back down and push
the arm down to hold it into place
you'll have to put a lot of pressure on
it but don't worry this is normal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
