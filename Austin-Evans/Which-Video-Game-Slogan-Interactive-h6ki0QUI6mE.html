fun interactive video so the whole idea
behind this started a couple months back
when I was looking at in NES box I was
reading some of the kind of you know the
marketing speak the slogans that they
have on the box and I got to thinking
because this is exactly quite what you
would read on Xbox 360 or Playstation 3
box so the whole idea behind this video
the way it's going to work is really
simple I'm going to be comparing two
products so I will read a slogan from
one of the two boxes and then you get to
decide is it from an old console like an
NES or just from something brand new
like an Xbox 360 so the way this kind of
work is very simple you will need
annotations on and of course annotations
is just things where you can click on
the video in different parts so if
you're on like a mobile device or
something without annotations go find
yourself a computer and if you're on a
computer just be sure that annotations
are turned on now the way it will work
is whenever I say it just click on
whichever one you want and you will be
taken to the next video where I'll tell
you if you're right or wrong
and we will just continue on for a few
of the slogans so hopefully you guys
enjoy and let's go ahead and begin right
now you'll see sharp edges vibrant
colors and clever animation and
synthesized music and sound effects and
you've got an on screen showcase now
which console is this slogan from the
Sega Master System or the Nintendo Wii
be sure to click on whichever one you
think it is to go to the next video
you
anyway that's it so how did you do did
you get them all right you get some of
them right
none of them right no I'm just kidding

time to put this video together and get
all the you know the facts cross-checked

whatnot but I hope you guys enjoyed and
