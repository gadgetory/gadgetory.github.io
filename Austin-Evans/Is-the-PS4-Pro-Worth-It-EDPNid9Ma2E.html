worth it what we're getting is kind of
like a half generation bump so unlike
something like a PS 5 which I'm sure
will be a much bigger upgrade sorry I
could get the PS by valve without joking
alright to start with we've course have
our Quick Start Guide you know we do
with QuickStart guides right that's
right
moving on looks like some accessories
here so we have the power cable so just
like every other ps4 we have an internal
power supply so this is all we have to
worry about I also have a micro USB
cable to charge the controller the same
kind of terrible mono headset for the
ps4 you also have the slightly
redesigned ps4 controller so just like
what you get in the box with the slim
it's basically the same thing but there
a couple little tweaks like for example
the light bar has not been changed
there's a little strip on the touchpad
but basically the same controller and we
also get an HDMI cable in the Box now
comes the fun parts this oh it's big
this is the ps4 pro so unlike the ps4
slim which is legitimately a lot smaller
than the original ps4 this guy is a
little beefy so the design the peaceful
pro is kind of a rockin that sort of
like triple stack Oreo look so for
comparison's sake this is a ps4 slim and
uh yeah that's a lot smaller it looks
kind of ridiculous this is uh about this
so taking a closer look at the ps4 Pro
you know I do we have these giant power
and eject buttons which are just kind of
they just feel nice weight it's got a
whole LED strip that's what you kind of
cool upfront we still had the two USB
3.0 ports as well as the blu-ray drive
so unlike the Xbox 1s which supports
Ultra HD blu-ray this still has to make
do with standard HD blu-ray which is
kind of weird because you know Sony make
blu-ray so
and around back we have the power cable
HDMI you have the port for the
PlayStation camera as well as we have
optical audio out something you won't
find on the ps4 slam a third USB 3 port
and the Ethernet jack so now comes the
fun part how do I tear into this so
basically all ps3 and ps4 that matter
have had a removable hard drive oh wait
that looks like screw hey there we go so
you actually don't unscrew this part you
pull it out and now we have our hard
drive so it's still 5400 rpm so it
shouldn't be any faster or slower than
the regular ps4 however just like every
other ps4 out there you could swap this
out with an SSD the ps4 Pro is the first
PlayStation to support say 2/3 which
actually should make a noticeable
difference if you do decide to upgrade
it with an SSD so what exactly is the
point of the ps4 Pro for $100 more than
the slim you're getting a 1 terabyte
hard drive versus 500 gigabytes however
the bigger upgrade is in the spec
department well it has a little bit of a
faster CPU on the graphics side this
thing is rocking 2.3 times the power and
what you can do with that is game at 4k
in theory so while the ps4 is definitely
targeting 1080p for the most part this
guy can handle resolutions all the way
up to 4k now it definitely depends on
the game so some games are running at
native 4k and we're going to take a look
at that in a second
but some are somewhere between 1080 and
4k and upscaling
and still other games have a specific
1080p mode so for example you might be
getting higher frame rates here better
graphics there's a lot that the ps4 Pro
can actually do one important thing to
know about the ps4 Pro is that all ps4
games will work on the pro and all
future games will still work on the
standard ps4 the way those games work is
that it will have multiple modes so if
you put the game into a ps4 it'll run it
normal 1080p however if you jump over to
the pro you will get additional options
but you don't have to worry about your
ps4 being obsolete any time soon oh that
was nice that was cool that was cool all
right so we have titanfall 2 now this is
actually not a native 4k game so right
now we're playing at 1440p which is
being up scaled hello oh yeah she looks
nice you can definitely notice the extra
detail over its like guy that's not good
that's not good
you can notice the extra detail over
something like 1080p it's at a massive
difference however it is noticeable for
sure next we have rise of the Tomb
Raider now this is already a great
looking game even going all the way back
to the Xbox 360 however it has been
updated with support for the ps4 Pro so
one of the options is you actually can
select different graphics settings so
here we have it on high frame rate which
is going to stay at 1080 to give you a
uncapped frame rate around 60 however
you can also switch to 1080p 30 on
higher settings or you can go all the
way up to 4k this is actually really
cool you usually don't get any kind of
graphics options on console however here
if you have a 1080p TV you can choose
between unlocked frame rates and higher
graphics or if you're a 4k TV you can
also throw in a higher resolution that
makes it's actually really cool next up
we have the Last of Us remastered now
this is a game that originally came out
on the ps3 however it's been updated now
in food ps4 but also for the ps4 pro so
we have support for HDR as well as
different graphics settings so just like
Rises the Tomb Raider if you jump into
the settings you can not only enable a
full 4k output which is actually fairly
rare most games are upscaling at least a
little bit but on top of that you can
also enable a 60 frames per second
option so depending on how you want to
play the game if you want the absolute
best graphics you can do that or if you
want to smooth the frame rate you can
switch between that to the extra prop
the ps4 Pro also comes in handy when it
comes to virtual reality so while the
normal ps4 actually doesn't surprisingly
sell a job of handling psvr the extra
power here should in theory help a lot
especially because the ps4 pro is much
closer to something like a gaming PC as
far as performance goes now the main
issue is that most PS VR games such as
driveclub here aren't really optimized
that well for the ps4 pro now it
definitely does support it and it works
fine however I really can't tell any
kind of major difference at all between
this and the normal ps4 however that
extra power is definitely going to
enable some much higher resolution
experiences which is pretty much exactly
what psvr needs now with all that
horsepower the ps4 Pro does get a little
bit warm the top can get as hot as 45
degrees Celsius under load and the
exhaust is over 50 degrees it's not
going to be the end of the world but you
definitely wanna make sure the ps4 has
plenty of access to cool air something
actually impressive is that the ps4 Pro
even though is over twice as powerful as
the launch ps4 only requires about the
same
power allows you if you compare it to
the slam share this is going to be a
little bit harder on your electricity
bill
however the ps4 Pro is surprisingly
efficient one thing you will notice is
that the ps4 Pro can actually get a
little bit loud under gameplay now mind
you it is very similar to the original
ps4 however it's going to be louder than
something that the ps4 slam and
especially the Xbox one so is the ps4
Pro worth it it kind of is actually for
$400 you are not going to find a more
powerful system out there for the same
money if you already have a ps4 this
isn't a must-have update however if you
have a 4k TV you really will be able to
notice the difference and if you don't
already have a ps4 at all this is a
serious upgrade in performance for only
$100 more as always if you guys want to
check out the ps4 Pro I'll have a link
in the description you can also check
out some of the other is it worth it
episodes including on the ps4 slim and
PlayStation VR anyway guys thank you so
much for watching and I will catch you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
