doing here
I'm gonna go ahead and feel this
question okay us and actually cut know
actually if you could feel and I don't
even know what state were in right now
well what are we doing I don't know what
we're doing the answer always looking
for we're going to a mountain where are
we where we going right now
look at my in school get your hands low
like with bananas go over fast em trees
and get yourself to the top of the
mountain we are climbing Mount Elbert
and we're going to have a land party at
hopefully the top why because we're
partially insane and also because we
want a break a Guinness World Record we
have all the documentation so as long as
we do it for legit so as long as we go
and play a game up on the top we're
world record holders for the highest
elevation terrestrial land party yes sir

sucka are you guys it wasn't a big one
probably vote less than a gram of
protein
we were all the way down there you see
those trees we were way below those
trees so we've actually made some pretty
good progress so we're still way ahead
of everybody and you just made a great
observation
so we've climbed a long way but if you
look all the way down there you'll see a
little silver speck that was where we
started in a parking lot
hey how you doing I'm autumn better I'm
on a mountain out of breath we're
getting there
we've come a long way but we go past
that it's pretty much snow it's now I
got boots on but it's not the most
secure thing to climb on we're made it
it's so many I don't think anyone really
guess I do

thousand four nine meters we've
officially made it I got a great
