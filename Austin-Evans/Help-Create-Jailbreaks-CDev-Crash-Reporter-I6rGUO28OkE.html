here with a little bit of a different
video but hopefully it's something that
you guys will find interesting so
recently the chronic dev team released a
new program now let's not green poison
with an untethered jailbreak and
everything which we were hoping for it
is something that will help us get to
that point so if you guys are not
familiar with the way jailbreaks work
let me just be very brief because this
program will help them make jailbreaks
so basically the way jailbreak works is
just down to the core the basics of it's
very simple there's some kind of exploit
bug glitch whatever you wanna call it
but there's some kind of problem on the
iphone ipod touch or ipad they exploit
it they load up cydia and of course
you're jailbroken and that's a very very
simple way of putting it but that's the
basics of how it works now there is one
way that apple is able to combat this
and that is vehicle error reporting so
let's say that there's some kind of
crash on my iphone and i just ran this
and they're like 212 crash report
sitting on the phone now every time
there's some kind of bug or glitch or
error or whatever it makes a log of it
and it sends it to apple and what Apple
does they look through these and that
they see there's others are crash
there's a bug they fix it and they could
very well close up a jailbreaking hole
now what this program allows us to do is
instead of sending all these reports to
apple and letting them fix all these
jailbreaks instead they send it to
chronic dev team and they actually look
at them and they go hey look this is a
you know I glitch an error above
whatever you wanna call it they are able
to take a look at it and then create a
jailbreak off of that so while this does
not jailbreak your phone it doesn't do
anything like that instead of helping
Apple fix jailbreaks instead it helps
chronic dev and make them so yeah so go
ahead and just give you guys a little
tutorial on how to do it first thing is
you need to download I'll have a link in
the description it is employed
greenpoison combigan link in the
description currently it's only for Mac
but they should have the windows version
up in the next 24 hours or so so if it's
not up by the time you watch this video
just check back a little bit later so
once you've downloaded it it's a very
very simple program nothing exciting or
anything like that but it's very very
simple so what you need to do is you
take your iPhone iPod Touch or iPad plug
it in via USB you also need to make sure
if it has a passcode lock just on market
and we just need to plug it in like that
so as soon as you do that it will say
iphone 4s or whatever device you have
detected all you do is click do it it
would take just a moment to take all the
crash reports find them on the phone
pull them off and it also knew your
itunes so make sure that itunes won't
accidentally send any crash reports kind
of mess it all up so you go so it has
210 crash reports for me using my phone
for about a month or so so not that long
at all and of course if you've had your
device for lung be very well have a have
even more so it's very simple just going
to upload them all to the chronic dev
server this is not stealing any of your
information or anything like that all it
is doing is all that data that was sent
to iTunes and apple and they would fix
these jailbreaks instead it's sending to
them so they can actually make some
jailbreaks for us anyway guys it's going
to be about it so like I said a little
bit of a different video you don't have
to do this it's totally optional but if
you have a few minutes I really
recommend that you do that it really
could help us out with getting a new
jailbreak and I definitely could be
worth it who knows you could be the one
who found the next exploit for a new
jailbreak anyway guys if you enjoyed
this video definitely sure to leave it a
thumbs up and if you're interested in
