Ken-less and on my own.
But, it's time to drive the Model 3.
Hey guys, this is Austin.
The Tesla Model 3 is a big deal.
So, this promises to be one of the first
mass market electric
cars and I spent tonight
at the launch event here in Fremont.
First of all, huge shout out to Dan.
He's the only reason I'm
actually here right now,
'cause he gave me a call
like a few days ago,
he's like, &quot;Yo, do you want to come
&quot;and check out the Model 3 event?&quot;
- I needed somebody that
has a good tech background.
- And somebody who can vlog?
- Somebody that can vlog, that's
a good hand, holding that.
- [Austin] It's easy to forget
just how big of a deal this is.
So, unlike something like the Model S,
which starts at around $70,000,
you can pick up a Model
3 for about $35,000.
And that's before the tax breaks
which can bring it down even cheaper.
They announced two models today.
The Standard, as well
as a Long Range option.
So, the Standard model will get you
about 220 miles of range,
where the Long Range
gives you a pretty impressive 310 miles.
So, what's interesting is,
they're no longer branding it
just like the Model S with
the actual kilowatt hours,
but most people are
guessing that the base model
is going to be around 50 kilowatt hours
and about 70 for the Long Range,
quite a bit smaller than the Model S,
but this is also a
smaller and lighter car.
- 'Cause like Model S, is already
and Tesla's made it clear,
a superior car.
So, there's almost no
reason for someone to go
from a Model S to a Model 3.
- Right, the Model 3 is the lower end,
entry level version.
- It's the entry level for
people who wanted a Model S
couldn't quite get there, but
now have this $35,000 option.
- It does however look very, very similar
to the Model S.
Personally, I like the look.
It's sort of like a mix
between a shrunken Model S,
mixed with a little bit
of Porsche Panamera.
It's a little bit awkward
in photos and even video
doesn't totally do it justice,
but in person, I've got to say,
especially from the rear
sort of three quarter view,
it is a really nice looking car.
I only wish it was maybe
dropped like an inch or so,
but we'll see.
Inside things are fairly basic.
So, my test drive was
about 10 o'clock at night,
so, it was kind of hard to see everything.
But one thing you can very easily see,
is the fact that the dash is basically
just a single 15 inch screen.
Now, don't get me wrong,
it's a nice looking display
and you do get pretty
much all the information,
like your speedometer, you get your nav,
all your climate controls
but that's pretty much it.
There is no speedometer or
anything in front of the driver.
Now on stage, Elon was
talking about the idea
that as things become
more and more autonomous,
that it doesn't really matter
if you're actually looking
at all your gauges and
stuff because the car
will be driving itself.
But as of right now,
I'm not so sure how
well that's going work.
You got to drive the Model?
- I did.
- I unfortunately just got a ride.
What'd you think?
- I really liked it.
I got really used to
comparing all these cars
I've been trying the last
couple months to my car
and they're all super different.
- Yeah.
- Model 3, I've sat in it
and it felt like a Tesla.
It felt very familiar.
- It is so quiet, I feel like
it's quieter than the Model S
and the Model S is super, super silent.
- They're both very quiet
and these have smaller wheels
so the rides a little
smoother, a little quieter.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- I unfortunately did 19 miles an hour
in my test drive, so.
- I think I hit 65?
- So you drove it?
- I drove it.
- It's obviously not
as fast as the Model S.
- Right, it's not as quick but like,
the weird thing is, when
you stomp on that pedal,
you still get that lurch forward,
that immediate torque of an electric car,
because it's electric,
that's the benefit you get.
So, it still feels quick.
- [Austin] We don't have an exact spec
on how much power it provides,
but essentially they're quoting somewhere
between 5.2 to 5.6 seconds
to 60, which is quick.
At launch, they're only
selling two wheel drive cars
but in the not too distance future,
you should be able to get a dual motor car
with all wheel drive, which I would assume
is going to be a lot faster.
However, don't expect this to be able
to out run a Model S anytime soon.
That is still going to be
over the double the price
and I'm sure that they do
not want it to get too close.
The Model 3 does support autopilot,
just like the Model S
as well as the Model X,
which means that essentially right now,
it can drive itself on the highway.
But in the future, you
should be able to upgrade it
to nearly fully autonomous experience.
They weren't showing off autopilot tonight
and the full autonomous
version is definitely
going to be a little ways out.
But in theory, a Model
3 that you buy today
has all the hardware that you need
that you can drive from point-to-point
without even having to
touch any of the controls.
- Sitting behind the wheel you see more.
Like the nose gets down
and out of the way.
Where in Model S, the nose is very much
in your frontal peripheral.
- And this is way smaller than a Model S,
way smaller.
- It feels like 25%
smaller on the outside.
But on the inside,
- It's not so bad
- It's not that bad.
- Not that bad.
- Not so bad.
- [Austin] I only got to
spend a little bit of time
with the Model 3 tonight,
but they are well on the
way to shipping them.
So, Elon Musk claims
that they're going to be
shipping about 20,000 Model 3s a month
by the end of the year.
So, if you've got that pre-order in,
they're actually going
to be coming fairly soon.
So, what do you guys think
about the Tesla Model 3?
Let me know in the comments below
and I will catch you in the next one.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
