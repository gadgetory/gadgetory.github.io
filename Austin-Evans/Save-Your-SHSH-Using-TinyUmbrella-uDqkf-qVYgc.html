tutorial show you how to backup your
SHSH blobs using tinyumbrella so tiny
umbrella is pretty much the best way to
go ahead and save your SHSH blobs on
your ipod touch your iphone as well as
on your ipad now it has recently been
updated with a new UI as well as a few
new features so I think it's about time
to go ahead and give you guys a tutorial
on how to use it so before we begin
anything you will need to end download
the program I of course will have the
link in the description it is available
for Windows Mac and Linux so no matter
what operating system you have you will
be covered so go ahead and download it
and i'll show you how to use it ok so
once you have downloaded tinyumbrella
it's really pretty simple so once you
have it downloaded go ahead and just
plug in your ipod touch your iPhone or
your iPad to your computer as soon as
you do this you should see up here on
the top left under the connected devices
your device pop up so I need to do is go
ahead and click on it and then you will
see a lot of different information about
your device now this really matters all
you need to do is look for the save SHSH
button on the bottom right so as soon as
you see this go ahead and click on it
now will take a couple of minutes
usually we'll go ahead and find the SHSH
blobs for your device so it's pretty
much as simple as that now the thing is
though is that you will not be able to
always get every SHSH blobs that you
might want so take for example if you're
on an older firmware the only way to get
your sh sh blob is if it is saved
through cydia so if you never jailbroke
on that particular firmware you're not
going to be able to get it however it
doesn't hurt to go ahead and try it you
might have you know you might already
have jailbroken or whatever reason you
might already have your SHSH blobs saved
so it works like that otherwise go ahead
and update to the latest firmware it's
get your club that way now there's only
one other thing i do want to mention and
it is how to use these SHSH blobs so is
again it's very simple all you need to
do is go ahead and come down here to the
Start tss server button and go ahead and
click on it so steep as you see here as
soon as you opened up it will say you
know it will turn to stop TSS server so
soon as you've done this you know that
you're all set up and now
go ahead and you know maybe you're
downgrading to you know an earlier
firmware whatever it is all you need to
do is go ahead and go to iTunes pick out
your device and then hold shift and
click restore now by doing this you can
go ahead and select whatever firmware
that you do have your SHSH blobs saved
for and you're all set itunes should
have no problems going ahead and
downgrading your device so there you go
guys that's it that's my tutorial on how
to use tinyumbrella to both save your
SHSH blobs so that you can always
downgrade as well as to go ahead and use
those SHSH blobs to go ahead and
downgrade your device so guys if you
have any questions any problems feel
free to leave them in the comment
section below and I'll do my best to
help you out anyway guys thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
