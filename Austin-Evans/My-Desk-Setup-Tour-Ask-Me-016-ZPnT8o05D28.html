your house has been burned down so what
is your setup now alright let me do a
quick little tour so I'll go a little
bit more in depth at some point but for
the monitors I have a 32 inch sharp 4k
display as well as a 27-inch Dell 1440p
monitor both are great choices great
color plenty of detail for when I'm
editing and speaking of editing powering
this whole view I have a late 2013 Apple
Mac Pro so say what you want about Mac's
but this thing tears through video which
is nice because I happen to go through a
lot of it for the speakers I have a set
of Harman Kardon sound sticks so again
this is something I'm gonna be doing a
more in-depth video on soon as well as
the mouse but you guys can hang around
for that I use an Apple wireless
keyboard not really that great
however for editing it works well just
as long as you don't try to gain mind
it's alright now something that is great
for game basically everything else is
the Corsair Vengeance m95 melts again
something I go more in depth on soon but
this is a killer Mouse I mean it's just
rock solid made of metal on the back so
it tracks well really really great Mouse
I have a USB 3 card reader as well as a
1 terabyte hard drive over here I have
some stuff I'm working on reviews with
so this is the PS Vita mm the slim model
it's okay but I'm having a lot of
problems with getting it to work with
Wi-Fi or my network so holding on review
until I figure out what's the problem
with that I have my old-school 3ds which
I prefer over the XL just because it's
smaller for cameras I have this beast
which is the Canon c100 so it's actually
not mine I'm just renting it at the
moment to see if I actually do want to
buy it but so far I've been pretty
impressed
my usual camera is right here so this is
the canon 70d I've talked a little bit
about this before this is a perfect
camera for when I'm filming myself
the flip out screen the autofocus the
whole deal really nice and something the
hell have you guys been asking about is
this mysterious thing inside the box so
this is an iPod Touch 4th generation
that I was able to retrieve from my fire
so wasn't my original iPod however it
was one of the iPods that kind of helped
me kickstart the channel and so I have
it in this kind of protective box too
well make it look cool because why else
what are your opinions on the new Moto e
do you plan to do a review on it as far
as budget phones go it looks really
impressive
so I've already reviewed both the Moto X
as well as the Moto G you guys can find
both of those videos on my channel and
the Moto e definitely looks to be kind
of following along that same trend of
being a cool little phone so I'm that I
aren't sure if I want to do a 4 if you
want it yet although if you guys do want
to see that let me know what I can make
it happen what's your favorite part
about being a youtuber this is gonna
sound stupid but it's you guys so after
spending hours and days working on a
video and then being able to get
immediate feedback from you guys it's
just such a rewarding thing to do so of
course it's awesome when you guys love
it but even when you have constructive
criticism like hey I should have done
this or should have included that or
whatever all that is super helpful for
me as I make videos and try to make them
better so yeah absolutely you guys
Austin can you share your thoughts on
Microsoft removing the Kinect from its
console offering you expect boosted
sales or is it too little too late I
don't think it's too late I mean the
Xbox has only been out for less than a
year now ah so I didn't think it's a
good idea I think was pretty much
inevitable that they would have to
remove the Kinect at one point so I
won't say that I actually don't really
think the Kinect is all that bad right
like I mean it does add some cool things
especially the voice recognition stuff
which I actually find kind of useful
however as far as like the gaming side
of it Kinect is just not that useful so
I totally understand why Microsoft
removed it from the bundle I mean I do
believe that they're going to continue
selling it there might be a few Kinect
games like there were for the 360 but I
think it's a solid move for Microsoft
definitely kind of gets the Xbox and
Playstation 4 on the same price footing
what would you do in the zombie
apocalypse
all right let's be honest with ourselves
for a second if there is a zombie
apocalypse do you think you would
actually make it I think for me the
answer entirely depends on whether slow
zombies or fast zombies if there
best I don't really think I've got much
of a chance but if they're slow zombies
run just just run all the time like
you're faster than them just take off at
a brisk walk totally safe
I hope why did you decide to make ask me
a weekly thing it's great but doesn't
waste your time I don't really think so
ask me use a lot simpler to make them my
usual videos so it doesn't take anywhere
near as much time it's just a lot of fun
I mean you're sitting here chatting with
you guys so I like doing them especially
because you know after I spend 3 or 4 or
5 days on a single video it's nice to do
something a little bit more simple a
little bit more fun if you guys have any
more questions feel free to hit me up on
Twitter Facebook or Google+ and all
those links will be in the description
of this video
speaking of I also have an awesome
giveaway just for you guys so a couple
months ago I did a video going over the
proton an awesome little gaming PC that
