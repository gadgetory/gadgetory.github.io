some deconstruction so this is the new
Xbox 1s so if we compare with the
original Xbox one you'll see this is a
lot smaller so I'm curious about is with
it being a little bit more powerful and
with it being smaller what's going on
inside this thing so the first step is
to remove the warranty void sticker
hello sweet sweet sounds of success ish
getting a little a little inappropriate
right now like I'm definitely able to
get in the Xbox my only worry is just I
don't want to break off the connectors
for the ports oh no come on Xbox give it
up I can already tell that this is a lot
more like the ps4 than the original Xbox
one the first xbox had tons and tons of
space inside it was very much like
working with a desktop and that I think
should be all the screws that sounds so
tempting I'm like ah so close but yeah
nothing is really holding the sides in
it all right now or the back it's purely
the ports so I feel like if we work out
like that
and there we go the fan number one the
thermal system disk optical disc drive
internal power supply hard to strived
actually went through a lot of hassle to
actually make this all look cool dude
there's a little master tape here okay
you what I can give Microsoft mad props
for this the power supply the cables are
nice and neat the hard drive is nice and
compact almost no one is ever going to
look at what the inside of an Xbox 1's
looks like so in front here we have the
still slot-loading blu-ray drive over
this now supports 4k blu-rays getting at
the hard drive is actually probably not
gonna be that crazy yeah there's just
four screws holding in this little caddy
so this is the two terabyte hard drive I
actually wouldn't be surprised if you
could actually upgrade this with
something like an SSD or a different
sized hard drive if you could get the
firmware and everything on here which
I'm not sure how easy it is but
technically speaking it's fairly easy to
get the hard drive so here remove the
power there we go and the drive is out
man I've got to say this is actually
really easy to get into all you're
really to do is be a little aggressive
with pull actually prying the top and
bottom off so this purse place hi
and it's just connected with a single
connector on the board so if we look at
the new power supply compared to the old
one we can see how they shrink some
things down and we're able to fit it
into the original case I think part of
the reason why they were able to use a
smaller power supply is because this is
supposed to be more power efficient so
it just needs us power thus a smaller
power supply but this is this is tiny
this is about as far as you can
deconstruct an Xbox one but we have one
step left means so careful right now I
feel like if I break it at this point
after making it all this way I'm so sad
oh it might not look like anything crazy
if you're used to like serious PC stuff
but for a console this is no joke we've
got a couple copper heat pipes it's
actually a fairly decent-sized I say
it's probably a 120 millimeter fan so
now you can see the heart of the Xbox 1s
which is that APU so this is very
similar to what you would find the
original Xbox one now it is based on a
newer process which allows it to not
only be about 30% smaller but it also
takes up less power which helps a lot of
things it makes the cooling easier it
makes the power supply less powerful I
guess a lot of things in there that
allow the Xbox 1s to be smaller I would
say that is deconstructing hopefully you
guys enjoy definitely sure to subscribe
to the channel if you want to see more
videos like this you can also check out
the first episode of deconstructed where
I checked out the original game board
anyway guys thank you so much for
watching and I will catch you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
