Forgotten Nintendo console the other day
my friend Armando from pixel of all
games hit me up and told me he had
something special coming to his shop the
Panasonic Q this was based on the
Gamecube but it was a little different
that came out only in Japan it was a
limited run that they actually had it's
funny you look at the front it says
panasonic DVD game player and just down
on the side you actually see game it
does have all that and it is also a CD
player so it has the buttons at the top
right there - oh so you got all the
dedicated button it plays DVDs which is
something that GameCube didn't do here
exactly yeah because a game can use the
mini DVDs it's a weird story how this
came to be the Gamecube was the first
main Nintendo console to drop cartridges
for optical discs but we're at piracy
they opted to go with a slightly unusual
mini DVD this worked fine but it meant
that I could only hold 1.5 gigs which
was a far cry from the 8 gigabyte DVDs
on the ps2 and Xbox Panasonic made the
optical drive on the Gamecube but in
return
Nintendo agreed to let them make their
own version of the GameCube that could
play DVDs which resulted in this bizarre
Frankenstein of a console oh wow so this
is way bigger than a Gamecube and you
know how the Gamecube has a handle of
the handle all this has the house handle
top handle and like I said it is a
limited run I've never seen this no
nether fight yeah I feel like they come
up every once while on eBay with like
three for 500 bucks
yeah upwards to that exactly costing the
equivalent of $440 back in 2001 compared
to $200 for a normal Gamecube it was a
huge price premium especially
considering that both the ps2 and Xbox
could play DVDs right out of the box oh
dude it works yeah Wow
so it's just like the straight-up
GameCube interface so it's a full sized
DVD so I guess the GameCube discs would
just fit right in the middle yeah it's
probably not gonna read it probably not
what do we put a DVD okay so we get the
Gamecube splash screen come up no disc
oh well hello DVD here hey maybe I saw
you you can't play that guess it wasn't
a big fan of Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles to be a game mode yep then
reboot into GameCube OS so it really is
like two completely different pieces of
hardware built into one
all right well I feel like that's that's
a thing right there all right so it's a
couple days later and we've come
prepared this time so first of all we
have a very Japanese DVD courtesy of my
good buddy Ken and we also have a
Japanese Nintendo GameCube game so this
is mr. drillers drill and dreamed
adventure and underground I mean with a
name like that we're clearly gonna have
a good time
so if I remember correctly we need to
there yeah so restarts into DVD mode
oh come on work with me here hey hey
okay so it does work doesn't believe the
GameCube controllers being recognized
but we can still use these top buttons
to actually still do our normal DVD
commands now for the real test can we
play a game q game oh the second I
switch to game mode this bans kick up
like crazy for japan-only sure it is Hey
alright time to introduce this this is
working surprising the well I've got a
symphony Oh what does that mean
according to Google Translate I did not
read the disc the manual please read ah
there it is like what it's gonna say oh
right it says exactly what I think it's
gonna say I do actually worry a little
bit about the drive here it was able to
play the DVD alright but like the actual
tree itself is really getting stuck it
doesn't want to come in and out it's
being really inconsistent I'm afraid uh
the disc itself looks fine that's trying
to see if we can get any kind of better
result with Luigi's Mansion which for
the record should actually not work but
I'm just curious to see if it's the same
air or we're gonna get something else oh
look at that we did get a different
error what's weird is is that it knows
that mr. drillers drill land is in there
and it gives us a narrative when we try
to take it out like hey put the game
back in but we actually try to load the
game it doesn't work this is not happy
with me right now it is just like
walking up and freaking out like crazy
I'm getting it I'm really disappointed
right now I was so hoping that we're
gonna be able to get this guy up and
running I mean to be fair we were able
to play a DVD with it it does output so
at least it works somewhat however I
think there's still some more kinks that
we would have to work out but who knows
maybe we'll have a part two or we get
this guy fully back up and running</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
