computer you may find compatibility
issues with the following parts list
today I'm here with the latest my
computer build series focusing on a
computer that is aimed at entry-level
1080p gaming performance at the five
hundred fifty dollar price point you
won't be able to play every game max to
1080p but you will get reasonable
performance in any game you throw at it
to start with we'll be using an intel
pentium c840 as one of the new Sandy
Bridge Pentium chips you'll find it has
solid performance with a dual core
design clocked at 2.8 gigahertz in
normal gaming the pentam GD 8 40
outperforms any AMD chip for the price
and is only just behind the core i3 for
$85 this is a great start next we have a
new Sousse p8 h 61 by the board this is
a fairly basic aged 61 board but has
everything you need to get you built up
and running for sixty eight dollars for
the graphics card will be using a
sapphire radeon 6770 this is one of the
best price to performance GPUs you can
buy and it will run practically any game
you throw at it on medium to high
settings with DVI hdmi and displayport
connectors to support most monitors this
is a great card for like 100 dollars
after rebate moving on to the RAM we
have a full eight gigabytes of course
there xms3 memory clocked at 1333
megahertz having a full eight gigabytes
of RAM on the system can be helpful down
the road and for only twenty-four
dollars after rebate it's hard to pass
up for the hard drive we have a western
digital caviar blue 500 gigabyte drive
500 gigabytes should be more than enough
to store lots of games and as it's a
7200 RPM drive your system should be
running nicely for a hundred dollars as
always this asuste DVD burner is
optional but I like to include it as it
simplifies a Windows installation unless
you use optical media for twenty dollars
the case is a thermaltake v 4 Black
Edition for a budget case you get a lot
including a 120-millimeter blue LED fan
and lots of room for expansions for
extra drives couple with an extra 120
millimeter fan for better cooling this
will ring you thirty seven dollars for a
power supply we have a cooler master
elite four hundred sixty watt spline 460
watts is more than enough to power the
system so this will work great for
thirty four dollars lastly we have the
operating system windows 7 home premium
64-bit if you want to run Linux or
already have an operating system ready
you can skip this but otherwise it will
run you a cool $80 so what's the damage
as of November
9 2011 on amazon com the entire bill
will run 548 dot 72 cents for just over
five hundred dollars you'll get a solid
gaming PC capable of handling this
year's great games do keep in mind that
prices are constantly fluctuating and
that it's a custom pc that you can of
course feel free to customize to your
own liking if you found this video
