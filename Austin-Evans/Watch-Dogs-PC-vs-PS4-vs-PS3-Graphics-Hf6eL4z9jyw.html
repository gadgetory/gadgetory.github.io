lynda.com hey guys this is Austin
so watchdogs came out today so I say it
would be a good idea to do a comparison
to see which version of the game looks
best to start we have watchdogs running
on the PlayStation 3 considering this is
a nearly eight year old console it's
definitely at a disadvantage
but the results aren't terrible it
reminds me in some ways of grand theft
auto 5 is watchdogs really pushes the
console to the limit and you'll notice
that quite a bit for the most part the
game stays around 30 frames per second
but jump into a car and things take a
bit of a nose dive into choppiness
you're also dealing with fairly long
loading times especially with fast
travel which only takes a few seconds on
the ps4 and PC but can take a minute or
more on the ps3 jump over to the ps4 and
things look much better textures are a
lot cleaner and there's just more detail
everywhere you look one of the big
differences is in frame rate as the ps4
is able to keep watchdogs locked at
30fps for the most part every once in a
while it'll dip below usually when
there's a lot of action on screen but
the performance is miles better than on
the ps3 watchdogs on the PC is a little
different if you have a computer that
can handle the game on ultra the
graphics do look notice will be better
than on the consoles although it's an
atom azov difference there's significant
popping of textures especially with cars
on both the PC and ps3 but oddly not
really on the ps4 frame rate on a GTX
780 generally hovered around 60 FPS on
Ultra at 1080p but sometimes it dips
quite noticeably down okay we got a
bunch of dead bodies right we got 40,000
people above us we need a distraction
I called the cops but the ps3 and ps4
side by side and you can really see
there's a big difference in the level of
detail while Aiden is fairly similar on
both consoles things like grass and
trees are either non-existent or much
less impressive looking on the ps3
compare the ps4 with the PC though and
things are very close if you look at the
road the difference between 900p on the
ps4 and 1080p on the PC is easy to spot
if you put all three together only the
ps3 really stands out as the other
versions are very similar pick a scene
with a little more detail and again the
ps3 shows its age against the much more
powerful ps4
however the PC looks significantly
better here when you look at details
like the fence where the extra
anti-aliasing and resolution come into
play jump into a car and if you put
aside the FPS issues the ps3 doesn't do
too badly with similar physics and
shadows mostly just giving up on the
detail side the PC has some subtle
improvements like better reflections and
again more detail especially in faraway
objects nighttime is where watchdogs
shines impressively the ps3 doesn't fall
too far behind here if you look past the
slightly overblown rain effect
especially when you look at Aiden soaked
jacket set the ps4 against the PC and
the to look almost identical as the
darkness hides a lot of the little
details that might have given the PC an
advantage if you have a ps3 or xbox 360
watchdogs is surprisingly solid you will
have a few framerate issues and it won't
look as nice as on a newer console or
gaming PC but it's totally playable and
looks fantastic considering what it's
running on move up to the ps4 or Xbox
one though and you're going to find the
sweet spot it seems pretty clear to me
that UV soft really optimized watchdogs
for the new consoles and it shows with
the ps4 delivering good graphics without
giving up performance watchdogs for PC
improves a few things but it's not
perfect
considering just how much more powerful
a high-end PC is compared to a console
even on Ultra there isn't a huge
difference put that together with issues
like pop in and how poorly it runs on a
and B cards and I'm a little
disappointed so what do you guys think
