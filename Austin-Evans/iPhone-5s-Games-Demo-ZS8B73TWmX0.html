here with the demo of the gaming
performance of the iPhone 5s first off
we have Infinity Blade 3 this is a
specially optimized game for the Apple
a7 inside the iPhone 5s and it's easily
one of the best-looking mobile games
I've seen yet if you've never played
Infinity Blade it's a hack and slash
game there works well with a touchscreen
with several different attacks along
with blocking and dodging the gameplay
mostly boils down to a series of boss
battles that it's a fun challenge and it
really does look impressive on the 5s
with nice lighting effects reflections
and high resolution textures everywhere
with near console quality graphics
Infinity Blade 3 is a great game to test
the horsepower of the iPhone 5s Real
Racing 3 is another top-notch game for
iOS this is a more serious racing game
with real-world cars and tracks and very
tight controls by default it'll new
steering which works well it also uses
automatic throttle and brake which takes
a lot of the challenge away however you
can turn on as much manual control as
you want graphically it's excellent with
real-time reflections and lens flares
along with car damage there's also a
cockpit view if you want to go for full
realism and to top it off Real Racing 3
is free-to-play
the brand-new Angry Birds Star Wars -
just came out and as someone who's never
been much of a fan of Angry Birds it's
actually pretty fun
it's hardly going to blow your mind with
insane graphics but it does look nice
and the gameplay is rock solid
like always you launch birds to take out
the pigs however everything is Star Wars
theme so you'll get birds with
lightsabers the force and more asphalt 8
airborne is a much more arcade-style
racing game like real racing you get
licensed cars with tracks based on real
places but the similarities in their put
simply everything is ridiculously
over-the-top and that makes it a lot of
fun
you've got nitro which can be picked up
along the track and a big part of the
game is wrecking out your opponents and
will sometimes getting yourself wrecked
out
it's got multiplayer as well as a great
soundtrack making this latest asphalt
game quite a bit of fun
of course we can't talk about gaming on
the iPhone without mentioning Minecraft
Pocket Edition it runs smoothly even
with the graphics turned up on the
iPhone 5s and the controls have steadily
improved lately with multiplayer and a
never-ending amount of new content being
added all the time anyway thank you so
much for watching if you're interested
more I have an iPhone 5c giveaway going
on my channel right now which you guys
can check out right over here so if you
want to possibly win one of the new
iPhone 5 C's definitely be sure to go
check it out
