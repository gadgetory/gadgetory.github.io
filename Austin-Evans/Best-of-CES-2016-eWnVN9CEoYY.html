coolest things from CES 2016 kicking
things off is one of the big surprises
of this year's show the razor blade
stealth razor has been making solid
laptops and accessories for years now
but the stealth is different in a few
ways this is a 12.5 inch ultra book with
some serious style it's all aluminum
coming in at just over half an inch then
with an individually backlit keyboard
that's fully adjustable depending on
what you're doing
the base model comes with a qHD display
but you can upgrade it to full 4k which
looks fantastic on a 12-inch screen
driving all those pixels is a dual core
skylight core i7 processor and eight
gigs of RAM but along the side is a USBC
based Thunderbolt 3 port for expanding
your graphics horsepower the razor core
is an add-on that supports a full
desktop graphics card that turns your
thin Ultrabook into a full-fledged
gaming PC it has its own power supply
for a dual slot card up to 375 watts
which means it should work with nearly
any card out there and it also features
Gigabit Ethernet and four USB ports this
has been tried before but the idea of
plugging a single Thunderbolt cable in
to both charge your laptop and gave you
some serious graphics is awesome better
yet while the pricing for the core
hasn't been announced the Razer Blade
stealth starts at $1,000 which is really
awesome for what you get something
that's not reasonably priced are the
Sennheiser Orpheus headphones these aim
to be the best headphones you can buy
period with a price tag of over $50,000
to get better the presentation really is
next-level the components are housed
inside a solid block of marble with
motorized knobs and tube amps which is
really an entire show on its own look at
the headphones themselves and they're
solidly built but nothing crazy to look
at it's only when you put them on do you
realise just how insane they sound each
instrument is absurdly clear with a
soundstage so wide it sounds like you've
stuck your head in the studio you can
probably get 90% of this experience at a
fraction of the price but what's an
either have done to go the last 10% is
incredible another over-the-top piece of
tech at CES this year was the LG 98 inch
8k TV while 4k is becoming fairly
mainstream at this point 8k is an
entirely different animal
LG focused on photos for the demo which
makes sense while 4k comes in at 8
megapixels 8k is a massive 33 mega
pixels per frame and almost no video
camera can handle that just yet to be
fair if this was on a smaller TV the
difference would be hard to spot but at
98 inches there is a noticeable
difference if this isn't crispy I don't
know what is another big product is the
riffed unlike the last few years where
we've seen prototypes this is the
consumer version that you can order
today not only does it have some of the
best optics and screens in a VR headset
but it also comes with a positional
tracker to place you in a 3d space a
remote for navigating the space along
with an Xbox one controller for gaming
later in the year they also have an
oculus touch controller which is
designed specifically for VR at six
hundred dollars the rift isn't cheap but
I'm looking forward to testing it in
depth soon something I wasn't expecting
was the Royal ex head mounted display
unlike the oculus which requires a
powerful PC and is aimed more at gaming
the Royal has everything you need built
into a small unit including a processor
memory and battery inside are a pair of
super thin displays and built-in
headphones they give you a personal
screen for watching video and movies it
works well although the screens don't
take up your full field of view they're
sharp and vibrant and it also has an
HDMI port so they will work with a
display for basically anything including
a game console if you want to bring the
reality up a notch though you could get
a full vehicle rig from sigma integral
well I might not fit in your living room
these simulators mount an actual car on
a series of platforms which are
controlled by the game you're playing it
uses the steering pedals and gauges of a
car which paired with a triple screen
setup in a game PC makes for one crazy
rig something a little outside the box
is the Mercedes concept IAEA this is
definitely a future thing rather than
something that's going to be on sale
anytime soon but not only does it look
crazy but it's designed to be one of the
most aerodynamic cars out there it's
filled with tech which actually isn't
too far off for production but seriously
just look at this damn coming right down
to earth for a minute we've got some
retro action with the kodak super 8 film
camera while digital is essentially made
film obsolete it's still stuck around
for movies and kodak hopes that are more
reasonably priced camera might just
stick this is a prototype but it's close
to what will be on sale later this year
you'll purchase the film from kodak
shoot on it then send it back to be
developed and you'll get a 4k video file
uploaded to the cloud it might not be
all that practical but at around $400 it
might just be worth checking out
something that absolutely is practical
is the LG gram 15 this is a thin and
superlight laptop weighing in at just
over a kilogram not including the cable
it's got a 15 inch 1080p screen which
while not crazy high resolution is
sporting super thin bezels the force the
webcam to be located on the bottom
playing around with it for a few minutes
it's clear that it's plastic but the
specs are solid including a Core i5 or
i7 all SSD story
and a USBC port along the side between
the surface iPad pro and pixel see
there's been no shortage of high-end
tablets and now Samsung has jumped in
with the memorably named galaxy tabpro s
this is most similar to the surface with
an Intel Core M processor in full
Windows 10 but it does include the
keyboard cover in the box which is an
almost mandatory accessory on the
surface and Samsung has a nice
implementation here with a solid
keyboard and trackpad it also has a
fantastic looking 12-inch 1440p AMOLED
display that a quick glance is going to
be hard to compete with it's also
sporting a USB C port which works with a
Samsung dock along with the new t3
portable SSD on top of all this
awesomeness my buddy John took a look at
the weirdest Tech of CES so if you want
to see us explore the show definitely be
sure to go check out his video anyway
guys thank you so much for watching and
I will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
