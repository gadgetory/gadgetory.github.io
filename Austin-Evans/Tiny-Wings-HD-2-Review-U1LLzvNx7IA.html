here with a review of tiny Winx - in
tiny Winx HD the original game was one
of my favorites and it's now that in a
major upgrade as well as an iPad version
so let's take a look the first thing
you'll notice is that the excellent
cartoon light graphics have been updated
with retina support which makes
everything pop even more if you've never
played tiny wings the premise is simple
your control bird which has to build up
momentum by sliding down hills and then
soaring into the air in the main mode
you're still racing to cover as much
ground as possible before night falls so
timing your jumps perfectly is key
what's new is flight school mode here
you can pick one of four birds to play
and then race to see who can make it to
the end of the level first this adds a
very different style of gameplay in the
normal mode it's a much more relaxed
experience but in this new mode you have
three other birds to race against and
you have to at least finish third or you
have to do the level again there are 15
islands to go through and you can always
play them over with different birds to
improve your time the fantastic music
and sound effects are still here as well
another new addition is iCloud save
support which not only keeps everything
backed up via iCloud but also syncs
between the different versions so you
can start the game on your phone and
pick it up on your iPad best of all tiny
links to is a free update if you bought
the original game and still only 99
cents to buy if you haven't you'll also
find tiny wings HD which is a separate
app in the App Store for three dollars
this has all the same game modes from
the iPhone version including the classic
day trip mode in flight school I find
the game plays slightly better on the
iPad with the added screen real estate
and more room to use the incredibly
complicated OneTouch controls the main
new feature on the iPad version is Hill
party which is split-screen multiplayer
the way it works is the iPad goes into
split-screen mode and you and your
friend race on any of the 15 new islands
as great is online multiplayer is
there's definitely something to be said
about playing together with someone if
you've played tiny wings before you'll
know exactly what you're getting a
Polish game with excellent music great
gameplay and experience that everyone
from kids to adults can enjoy for $0.99
the iPhone version is absolutely worth a
download of you haven't grabbed it
already and the iPad version is just as
good if not better there's a lot you can
say about tiny wings but I think it can
be summed up pretty easily just go
download it if you enjoyed this video
definitely be sure to leave it a thumbs
up and if you're interested in more
