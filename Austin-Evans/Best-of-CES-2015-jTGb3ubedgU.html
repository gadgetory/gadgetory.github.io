here at CES 2015 taking a look at some
of them actually this is Luke and today
we checked out not only oculus but some
stuff from Origen and razor as well I've
been checking out a whole bunch of eer
stuff this ve our VR stuff this year at
CES 2015
so ascended to the video the real video
now CES is always filled with TVs but
this year saw cool screens of all types
at the sharp booth they had freeform
displays that can be made into almost
any shape right now they're mostly used
for things like gauges and cars but
since there's basically no bezel these
can be used in all kinds of gadgets they
also should offer a wraparound 60 inch
LCD display for putting screens on
pillars that might not be all that
practical but it's still cool tech
nonetheless there was also a massive 120
inch 4k TV concept that would probably
be ludicrously expensive and then the
holy grail of TVs an 85 inch 8k panel
yeah 8k panel considering there are only
a handful of 8k video cameras in the
world right now this won't be coming out
anytime soon but on such a huge TV there
is a slight but noticeable difference in
quality compared to 4k resolutions it's
not night and day but the amount of
detail you get on a 33 mega pixel screen
is crazy over at Sony they were showing
off a monster pair of 4k projectors
which each can go up to 147 inches they
had a serious back to the future setup
with four 1080p TV shows and a 4k video
all playing at once and if you need to
shoot some 4k videos then the new Sony
AX 33 handycam might just be for you
this shoots 4k video for $1000 half the
price of the sony 4k camcorder they
announced last year it also has some
completely crazy stabilization which is
handy if you want to get some awesome
aerial shots DJI has been cranking out
some awesome drones lately and that
includes the inspire one supporting
carbon-fiber legs and a built in 4k
camera this is the full package that can
be monitored on an iPad up to two
kilometers away of course this being CES
there are also a few phones announced
and the biggest was the LG G flex 2 this
improved on a lot of my problems with
the original including a smaller
high-resolution screen and the new
Snapdragon 810 with it being the G flex
after all my buddy Lou from unbox
therapy put it to the Ben test right in
the middle of the LG booth it made an
awesome video while he was at it it
might see minor
one of the biggest things at CES is USB
type-c this is about the same size as
micro USB but it supports up to 100
watts of power USB 3.1 speeds along with
this play port for video all with one
cable it's reversible like lightning so
you can plug it in either way meaning
that this single cable could charge your
laptop connect all your accessories and
run a display another way of powering
your display is with the Alienware
graphics amplifier this is a dr. can
handle a full sized graphics card when
you connect it to your new Alienware
laptop it's a very cool idea to have
portability when you need it while still
having all the horsepower you want once
you get home one of the coolest things I
saw was outside over at BMW they had an
i3 that would drive up by itself when
you call it with your SmartWatch along
with one that doesn't let you crash you
can drive straight toward an obstacle
and the cloud will automatically break
even if you keep your foot on the
accelerator there was also a Tesla Model
X in the Panasonic booth and this was
straight-up awesome the Model X is a
fully electric crossover that should be
joining the Model S later this year and
not only does it look better in person
than I expected but it also has some
awesome going rear doors and a sweet
interior so what's your favorite thing
you saw at CES 2015 definitely be sure
to let me know in the comments below I
will catch you guys in the next one
hopefully</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
