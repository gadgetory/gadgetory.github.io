worth it with a larger screen and shiny
pro badge
the new iPad is a departure from
previous iPads slide open the blocks and
you'll find the iPad pro itself lift it
out of the way and underneath of your
accessories you'll find a 2 meter
lightning cable for charging and syncing
a 12 watt USB power adapter and
paperwork with Apple stickers tucked
inside unwrap the probe and you'll see
it's big it's even a fair bit larger
than the 12 inch macbook the design is
similar to the smaller ipads with a
lightning port along with a pair of
speakers on bottom another pair of
speakers on top along with the headphone
jack volume buttons rear camera and
sleeve button and three small connectors
along the left side for accessories like
the smart Keyboard it's one thing to see
it in pictures and video but it's
another thing to actually try it the
iPad pro is huge that's not necessarily
a bad thing having extra screen real
estate can be nice but at the end of the
day it's a big iPad it is then in
Lightford size and while you'll probably
want to use two hands with it it's
comfortable to hold and use
well the twelve point nine inch display
the screen looks fantastic I can easily
see watching an entire movie on this
especially with the solid speakers on
all four corners it's rocking a
resolution of 2732 by 2048 which is
enough to run two iPad apps side-by-side
on a 13-inch screen this is enough
detail to even show up most laptops
where things get really interesting is
performance the iPad pro is rocking a
dual-core Apple a 9 X 4 gigs of memory
and either 32 or 128 gigabytes of
storage this is no joke it easily
handles any game available on the App
Store like Lara Croft go and geometry
Wars and gaming on such a large tablet
is a pretty cool experience get into
benchmarks that it's even more
impressive its competitive with the core
i5 equipped surface pro 4 on the CPU
side and in graphics it absolutely
destroys every other tablet out there
this isn't just a powerful tablet this
is a powerful computer that puts a lot
of laptops to shame
unfortunately iOS really isn't up to
taking advantage of all that power it
excels at things like web browsing with
buttery smooth performance and there are
some cool creative apps like paper for
sketching ideas and you make which
creates full 3d models out of your
drawings apps like iMovie allow you to
edit basic 4k video far better than you
would expect out of an iPad and you'll
find Microsoft apps like Word
PowerPoint and Excel addition to the
Apple equivalents to get real work done
apps like these really show off the
potential that's mostly it for now there
are a ton of pro level apps that just
aren't available for iOS there are some
accessories available like the Logitech
create keyboard which is what I use to
write this review and while it does work
if you really rely on a keyboard you're
probably better off just buying a
MacBook the same holds true for the
smart Keyboard for $170 it's just
ridiculous
ridiculous it's just ridiculous the
Apple pencil is a little cooler as it
allows you to sketch a lot better than a
traditional stylus and while it's nicely
designed as a 100 add-on it really only
makes sense if you're serious about
design there's a lot to like about the
iPad pro while I feel it's slightly too
big having a huge tablet has advantages
it's got solid battery life with a great
screen and speakers and near overkill
levels of performance my biggest problem
is that at the end of the day it really
is just a big expensive iPad for some
that's going to be worth it but for most
people you're better off getting a
MacBook or a surface do you guys think
the iPad pro is worth it let me know in
the comments below and I will catch you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
