here with ask me so if you guys never
seen this this is where I answer all
kinds of awesome questions straight from
you guys so let's do it
yo should I buy PC parts at separate
times or all at the same time I would
say buy all of your parts at once I know
it's really tempting as you're saving
your money to bow and go buy a part here
and buy a part there however generally
PC parts are always either getting
better or cheaper so if you buy a part
today but you're not going to be doing
your bill for another six months if you
woulda waited you probably would've got
something that's faster or better or you
might have been able to get that exact
same part for cheaper so if you can you
just save your money up and buy
everything at once it'll make things a
lot easier for you I'm planning to build
a new gaming PC should I go with Windows
8 or should I stick with Windows 7 this
has been a debate for almost a year now
but in my opinion if you're building a
new computer I would go with Windows 8
so technically it is quite a bit better
than Windows 7 so it boots a lot faster
it seems to be a lot more snappy and it
actually is better if you have for
example like an AMD 8 core processor and
actually will take better advantage of
multiple cores in Windows 8 as opposed
to 7 for gaming now yeah there are
problems with Windows 8 especially the
metro or modern UI but when does 8.1
will be coming soon and it will fix a
lot of that stuff so if you're building
a new computer today you could go with
Windows 7 but in my opinion go with
Windows 8 and before you know month or
two we'll actually have Windows 8.1 and
you're going to be golden what are you
most looking forward to being revealed
this year I would probably have to say
the Galaxy Note 3 now I actually was a
big fan of the note 2 I used it for
quite a while
and I really can't wait in fact I was
actually picked up my note 2 the other
day as really nice to kind of go back so
even if the note 3 is literally just a
giant galaxy s4 I'm gonna be all over
that I can't wait to have the big screen
again and have that awesome battery as
YouTube helped your way with the girls
all the time all the guys do is come up
and say hello ladies I've got a lot of
subscribers on YouTube and it
immediately well I'm still it's still a
work in progress I mean I haven't got to
technique totally and now it hasn't
helped will you be playing GTA 5 on the
PC or console I'll be playing it on my
xbox 360 I'm sure that there will be a
PC version of GTA 5
five however they haven't announced it
yet and it pretty much almost definitely
won't be coming out on release so I'm
not going to wait six months to play GTA
5 I would like to play it on the PC and
maybe when it does come out I'll pick it
up but the Sega that comes out for Xbox
I'm going to be all over it what are
your impressions regarding the Moto X to
be totally honest kind of underwhelmed
before the Moto X was actually announced
properly there was so much hype it's
going to be a crazy awesome phone now
that we've seen it it looks decent it
looks okay but really nothing all that
spectacular I mean definitely Google
Motorola they've done some cool stuff
with it but for me not really interested
what's your favorite music artist ah I
would probably say deadmau5 he made so
much awesome music that I just
absolutely loved but right up there
alongside him there's going to be Daft
Punk
we've got glitch mob Wolfgang Gardner
all absolutely top-notch what social
networking site do you find yourself
using the most definitely Twitter one of
the big things for me is that's very
quick and simple to use
so whereas if I'm talking to maybe one
of you guys on Facebook or something I
love to do that but a lot of times I'll
get these giant messages they'll take me
forever to go through and read it all
and reply and all that kind of stuff
whereas on Twitter you send 140
characters I can reply to you super fast
and it's a lot easier for me to keep up
with not only like you know I'm talking
to you guys but also keeping up with
news my friends all that kind of stuff
so Twitter definitely for the win I'm
literally like always on there what is
your favorite company for PC parts that
is a really tough question I mean I
would say like companies like Intel are
great I mean they make amazing CPUs for
graphics cards AMD and NVIDIA are great
for a lot of cases and coolers and
whatnot Corsair makes good stuff a soos
and gigabyte both make great graphics
cards as well as like motherboards and
stuff I really don't think I could pick
one how much pressure is there when
trying to keep up with news and to
continue putting all the work you do
into your videos wow you're really gonna
make me think on this one um I mean yeah
there's definitely pressure I mean a lot
of times I'm working with companies so I
have very strict deadlines I have to
meet with particular videos or maybe
when I'm reviewing a product that isn't
out yet that kind of stuff
I mean a lot of times my videos can just
take too long like my review videos
especially those things can take days
and when I try to get a video out every
couple days
and it takes like three or four days to
make a single review that can get
definitely you know very stressful but
for the most part it's something that I
enjoy doing any sure yeah I have a bad
day every once in a while and I'm stuck
in front of the computer editing a video
for eight hours I just don't want to be
doing that but for the most part all the
good definitely outweighs the bad thank
you so much for watching if you guys
have any other questions you like to ask
me feel free to drop them in the
comments below you know so always hit me
up on Twitter Facebook and Google+ and
those links will be in the description
of this video anyway guys I will catch
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
