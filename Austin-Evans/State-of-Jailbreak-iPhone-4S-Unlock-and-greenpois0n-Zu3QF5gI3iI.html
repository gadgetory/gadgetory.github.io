the new iphone for us unlock as well as
what is going on with the green poison
untethered jailbreak last night muscle
nerd from the iphone dev team tweet a
very interesting picture of what looks
to be an iphone for us unlock in the
making if you guys haven't been keeping
up with unlocking lightly well there
hasn't been a lot to talk about the last
real unlock was nearly a year ago and
was for the iphone 4 however this is
very promising if you do have an iphone
4s and you want to be unlocked i do want
to be very clear that this unlock will
be only for the iphone 4s it doesn't
look like it will work for the 3gs or
the iphone 4 we don't have any word on
when it will be released however if
you've got your heart set on iphone for
us unlock definitely sure to keep an eye
out for a new ultrasnow update last
night was busy in more than one way
posix ninja from the chronic dev team
and now so they have had some problems
with the green poison jailbreak for iOS
5 and the blog post they explained that
they had did actually have some exploits
however it looks like Apple patch them
at the last second however this is not
the end of the road for the green poison
jailbreak they still do have major parts
of it ready and as soon as they can find
a new exploit they will get an
untethered jailbreak for iOS 5 hopefully
that will work on the iphone 4s and the
ipad 2 as well if you want to help the
chronic dev team find the next jailbreak
definitely sure to hit the link in the
description as well as on the top left
of the screen that will allow you to
download a crash reporter and it will be
able to pull all kinds of bugs and
whatnot off of your iphone ipod touch or
ipad and allow them to take a look and
see exactly how they can use them in
jail breaks and as always if there's any
new information on the unlock as well as
green poison coming out i will update
the annotations on the top left of the
screen the tweak of the week is blurry
and see background this tweak doesn't
serve any practical purpose gives
Notification Center an awesome blurred
background instead of having a generic
Apple gray behind your notifications
this gives a great out of focus effect
flurried NC background is free in cydia
anyway guys it's going to be about it
for this week's episode of state of
jailbreak if you enjoyed this video
definitely sure to leave it a thumbs up
and if you're interested in keeping up
to date with all the latest jail
