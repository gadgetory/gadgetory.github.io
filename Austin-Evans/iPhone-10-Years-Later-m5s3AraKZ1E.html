iPhone is ten years old today
but how have things changed over the
last decade take a look at the original
iPhone today what jumps out to me is it
actually doesn't seem to have changed
that much over the years
so it still made out of aluminum it
still has the same sort of general shape
of the current iPhone yeah it's a lot
smaller but actually did get a lot of
stuff right the first time
side-by-side with the iPhone 7 there is
a very clear evolution here the design
and build quality really do hold up
today and that is not something you can
say about other smart phones from the
time there were definitely some issues
with the original iPhone though one of
the big ones was an orange supported 2g
network which was weird at a time that
3G was becoming a lot more popular
because of that when AT&amp;amp;T shut up their
2g network earlier this year it meant
that the original iPhone sort of trying
to unlock it is no longer usable as a
phone
there are also some weird quirks like
the recessed headphone jack so because
of the way the phone was designed with
this taper a normal pair of headphones
actually will not fit in you're going to
need some kind of extender the biggest
issue with the original iPhone though
was price when this came out back in
2007 it cost $600 and that was on
contract that's pretty much unheard of
today doesn't be fair a couple months
later Apple did drop the price to $400
as well as discontinuing the skimpy
little four gigabyte model but still
this was an incredibly expensive phone
back in this day all this makes a lot
more sense though when you look at it
compared to other smartphones at the
time so the iPhone looks pretty clean
and toriana is not that different from
phone for today very sleek it's very
minimal where something like the
sidekick which is a popular smartphone
one of the day looks a lot more busy
it's eating to forget just how big of a
deal phone foot the sidekick or back in
the day the way yeah it actually did
have the super cool sliding mechanism
almost like a modern-day fidget spinner
nicely times Ken but when you look at it
it's such a different design it really
does feel a lot older than the iPhone
another major competitor was the note
kit in 95 and well this does definitely
look like it's straight out of 2007
there are actually a lot of cool things
that this could do the iPhone couldn't
well the main ones was actually the
camera no the iPhone did have a camera
but this actually has that proof solid 5
megapixel autofocus camera it also has a
little shutter thing which is kind of
cool I also had a front-facing camera
which the iPhone didn't get until the
iPhone or it supported 3G and to top it
all off it had now like t9 when you
slide it up when
down if she had media controls selfie
time
alright a little crunchy blood focus
here and that actually doesn't look bad
honestly this is probably a little bit
better than some budget smart phones
I've tried recently move over to the
iPhone and hella we do we get the
awesome old-school slide to unlock but
there is a slightly less impressive 2
megapixel camera here wow it's not that
bad but iPhones have definitely come a
long way as far as cameras go what
really set the iphone apart though was
its software the hardware itself was
fairly underpowered but what they're
able to really nail with iPhone OS there
was a lot missing when this first launch
though not only was there no
multitasking but it didn't even have an
app store until the second year but what
really saved it with the fundamentals
were absolutely there
stuff like scrolling felt way more
natural than pretty much any other phone
on the market and suddenly multi-touch
was really cool
keep in mind back in the day most phones
didn't even have touchscreens
and the ones that did typically use the
stylus the iPhone and iPhone OS was a
huge leap but that's not all
inside this slightly suspicious-looking
black box is a prototype for the
original iPhone now the hardware itself
is basically unchanged compared to
current iPhones that actually ended up
shipping what is different about this is
the actual software experience there was
a ton of secrecy around the original
iPhone so much so they create a super
basic UI so that if something did leak
no one would really know what they were
up to we're also hopeful for testing as
you can see we have all kinds of
different options what's cool is the
little pink phone Easter Egg on the
bottom all the basic functions of the
phone are here so not only can you get
received sms's but there's also a bunch
of pre-programmed test messages which
sadly don't work since it isn't on a
network there's also the phone dialer
you can get to the camera which in
theory will work although it might not
be the prettiest thing in the world but
this really was meant for testing
there's also a full diagnostic menu
which can show everything from the Wi-Fi
the Bluetooth accelerometer if the
touchscreen is working you can see the
camera button there's a lot of very
interesting stuff with this but yes it's
a prototype
and it was really meant more for
avoiding leaks than anything else that's
a cool piece of Apple history after 10
years it's hard to argue with just how
important this iPhone
was pretty much any mario smartphone
today owes at least something to the og
so what do you guys think about the
original iPhone let me know in the
comments below and I will catch you on
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
