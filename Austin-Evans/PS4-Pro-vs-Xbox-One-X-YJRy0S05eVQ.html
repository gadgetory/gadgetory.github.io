here at e3 2017 with a simple question
px4 pro or xbox 1x the big story here at
e3 is definitely the Xbox one X
previously known as Project Scorpio this
is a souped-up version of the current
Xbox one I've spent the last couple days
not only using the hardware but also
playing some games on it however I feel
like we're in the slightly wrong place
to talk a lot Xbox stop hey get in here
big Dom big Dom showing up to crash yet
another video what do you think about
the Xbox one X versus T s4 pro Xbox one
x all the way I mean we're talking about
real 4k right real 4k get out of my
video get on my video Dom for the last
four years since the ps4 came out and
it's been the most powerful console on
the market so while a lot of games on
the Xbox one would run at 720p or 900p
most ps4 games run at 1080p however with
the Xbox one X things that definitely
been upgraded it's on behind me a group
it's like just like the CES video all
over again kiss for pro vs. xbox one X
Games versus hardware excellent answer
for mister your average consumer but
more serious answer though I don't know
it really is that's what it comes down
to that guy's so we're way more times
you're right they're way more titles for
the ps4 is index plus one it's a more
powerful console but still an Xbox one
right so I mean I like the Xbox one
honestly cuz I'm gonna connect lover and
you're not going to get that wait wait
you still need to connect I still use it
voice controls man I like to control my
videos and whatnot through voice control
alright I can respect that
Xbox one EXO's has a well Xbox one
always has my love because of that well
both the ps4 pro and Xbox 1x are big
jumps over the base version the Xbox one
is an even bigger jump so with the kids
for you're going from 1.8 to 4.2
teraflops of power it's a big jump but
on the Xbox one X you're going from 1.3
to a full 6 teraflops of GPU performance
teraflop jokes aside the Xbox 1x is a
huge jump over the original Xbox on top
of that GPU power the Xbox one X also
has a 50% faster a hard drive faster CPU
and a full 12 gigabytes of memory as
opposed to 8 gigabytes on the ps4 pro
first time the Xbox is now the most
powerful console of this generation so
how is this going to change things well
for one I do think that this is going to
bring consoles a lot closer to the PC
market sure a high-end gaming PC is more
powerful than either of these consoles
but what most people are using is not
going to be that far off from something
like the Xbox one xav the ps4 pro so I'm
doing everyone a lot closer together and
that can only be a good thing and having
the ps4 Pro and 1x together actually
does bring things a lot closer to the PC
model so all games that come out for ps4
are going to work on ps4 Pro and vice
versa and same thing for the Xbox one
and Xbox one X it's very similar to a PC
game is going to be the exact same game
across different pcs the difference is
just going to be what quality says
you're going to be playing at and here
almost more importantly what resolution
so while the ps4 pro runs a few games at
native 4k most titles are running is
something closer to either 1440p or
something in the middle and using
upscaling to make it all the way up to
4k now this isn't necessarily a bad
thing especially some of the upscaling
options look pretty close unless you're
really pixel peeping on the other hand
the Xbox one X has the power to run most
games at a full 4k resolution melling's
is going to be simpler for developers to
just set the 4k and forget it even
though it might be a slight
simplification but more importantly it's
going to give you a cleaner crisper
image across the board
well most games run pretty well on the
ps4 pro and 4k there are a few titles
that have some framerate issues the Xbox
one X on the other hand has a lot of
extra raw power so hopefully these
things can be eliminated so how do these
consoles compare it to a PC and the word
pretty well you know that's two words in
two words okay two words oh look it's a
wild Kevin Kenton
while Kevin Kent is due to roster yes it
is okay so ps4 pro or xbox 1x go I did a
view on this you should go watch it
shameless plug youtube.com slash Ralphy
put simply it is really hard to imagine
building a gaming PC with this level of
performance for five hundred dollars
unless you know you cheated scrapyard
wars' or something dual power supply's
where the correct answer by the way Sony
and Microsoft have a big advantage in
being able to order custom hardware to
build these consoles so yes the PC will
definitely catch up as far as price
performance in a couple years just like
it did when the ps4 and Xbox first came
out right now four to five hundred
dollars for this level of performance is
pretty reasonable my big takeaway here
is that both the ps4 pro and Xbox 1x
have
similar levels of performance to a lot
of gaming PCs which could only be a good
thing all this means is that we all get
better games and we can all live happily
ever after the ps4 Pro has a big head
start though not only is it going to be
on the market for a full year before the
Xbox one X comes out but more
importantly than that there are lots and
lots of great ps4 games and to top it
all off it is $100 left don't get me
wrong the Xbox one X is the more
powerful console but at the end of the
day it's still an Xbox one if that's not
something that's interesting to you the
one X really isn't going to change that
so what do you guys think about the ps4
pro vs Xbox one x let me know in the
comments below and I will catch you on
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
