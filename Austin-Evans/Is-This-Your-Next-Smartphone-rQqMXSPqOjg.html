fingerprint sensor a bezel is display
and a headphone jack and a smartphone in
2017 hey guys this is Austin went on and
reached out and wanted to sponsor a
video on their brand new 7x all I needed
was the word headphone jack and I was in
now the first thing I noticed is that
that blue is actually pretty nice so
something I really liked with the
original pixel was the very blue color
well this isn't quite so vibrant it is
definitely unique there's not exactly a
lot of other stuff in the box so there's
a european-style power plug as well as a
micro USB cable the idea here is that
you're getting a lot of what you would
expect on a 20-17 flagship but at a much
lower price so the actual official
announcement of this phone will be on
December 5th but from what I've heard
it's going to be under 300 euros
considering the price this feels good so
the design actually reminds me a little
bit of the iPhone 7 so it has very
rounded corners it's a bit of like a
seamless design but when you flip it
around front the screen is a lot bigger
while it would be nice to see USBC on
the bottom instead of the microUSB port
we do however get the headphone jack
I will say that the bottom firing
speaker on this is maybe not quite as
loud as I'd like but intership of the
headphone jack kind of evens that out
for me there's also a fingerprint sensor
on board and it's fast
I mean basically as soon as you put your
finger on the button the phone wakes
right up inside it's powered by a Kirin
659 octa-core processor 4 gigabytes of
RAM and 64 gigs of storage Kieran is
hallway and honors SOC manufacturer so
unlike pretty much every other phone out
there that has a Snapdragon chip this is
going to be something a little different
and honor claims this should be able to
hold up better under longer periods of
use such as gaming when you get into a
game like modern combat 5 they'll see
that actually holds up pretty well and
it does take advantage of the 18 by 9
display so well yes this is not going to
have the same power or something like a
flagship it looks a presently good and
for pretty much any game that's
available on Android it should be able
to handle it and with a 30 340 million
power battery you should be able to get
some pretty good gaming in on this guy
on our claims this should last up to a
day and a half of normal usage software
wise we have Android 7.0 with mui 5.1 on
top now this is a bit of a heavier skin
however you can customize it by Rhian
abling the app drawer
which is what I've done here and there
are some cool features like being able
to pull down and get something very
similar to spotlight a big selling point
of the auto 7x is the bezel less display
so it's rocking a 6-inch 2160 by 1080
max view panel when you look at it up
front it's pretty much all screen so it
has a similar screen to body ratio just
something I could Galaxy Note 8 and
while yes the panel itself maybe is not
the most color accurate thing in the
world at this kind of price there's not
much to complain about plus that wider
18 by 9 aspect ratio does a really good
job of showing you more widescreen
videos such as our iPhone 10 is it worth
it it fills out a lot more of the screen
one of my favorite budget phones of this
year is the Moto e 4 plus with a 5.5
inch screen it's actually a fairly
similar size to the honor however you
can see it just how much less screen
real estate you actually have to work
with here have you said your big display
is also helpful when it comes to split
screen so you tap and hold on the
multitasking you can pull up say like
another app if you want you can be
watching a video at the same time as
you're scrolling to a web page replying
to a message whatever around back we
have two cameras a 16 megapixel main
shooter backed up with a 2 megapixel
secondary camera for stuff like portrait
mode wow that's so stylized let's go
crazy town on this you can tell they're
really sort of like pushing the shadows
and the highlights but with this sort of
wide aperture mode that's an interesting
look I mean it's different a little bit
of HDR action see what the dynamic range
is like so bad I mean do you fear it
helps a little bit cloudy right now but
it's pretty much keeping everything in
the shot you can also enable a simulated
bouquet for the front-facing camera
the front-facing portrait actually
doesn't look bad so it does lose a
little bit of the side of my face and
especially the glasses which a lot of
phones have a problem with but consider
you this doing this purely in software
whereas at least on the rear facing
cameras you do have that secondary
camera to sort of figure out the depth
this isn't bad and this is what the
1080p video looks like from the honor 7x
so while it would be nice to have 4k the
stabilization is actually not too bad
and even when I'm kind of trying to move
around and change exposure stuff it
holds up pretty well the honor 7x is an
interesting phone so considering the
price there's a lot to like stuff like
the bezel is display the dual cameras
the good build quality saw battery life
but the question is what this thing
actually costs honor will be announcing
the full price of the 7x
a launch event on December 5th and I'm
very curious to see exactly where this
lines up because if the price is right
it's a really compelling phone so what
do you guys think about the honor 7x let
me know in the comments below and I will
catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
