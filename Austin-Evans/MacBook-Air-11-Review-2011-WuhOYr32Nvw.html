here to review the MacBook Air 11 inch
this is the latest 2011 model and the
one I have here has the 1.6 gigahertz
Core i5 processor 4 gigabytes of RAM and
a 128 gigabyte solid state drive take a
look around the air and you'll see it is
unlike most other laptops with a razor
thin design and tiny footprint what I
found most impressive is just how usable
the 11 inch air is it features a full
size keyboard impressively large
trackpad and bright 11.6 inch screen
inside you'll find a new dual core Intel
Core i5 clocked at 1.6 gigahertz
don't let the low clock speed fool you
the air is actually quite respectably
fast it can turbo all the way up to 2.3
gigahertz and features hyper setting
which looks os10 see it as a quad core
CPU ordinary tasks like web browsing a
write on paul with my 4 gigahertz
quad-core Windows desktop and even when
you get to heavy lifting like video
editing and gaming the air can keep up I
work with video all day and while I
still go to my editing rig most of the
time I've used the air to edit some
high-definition videos and have been
quite impressed with how well it handles
it you probably won't want to spend your
days editing and final cut with this but
it certainly will work in a pinch gaming
performance is a bit less impressive but
certainly doable even newer titles like
Starcraft 2 can run without a problem as
long as you don't mind turning the
graphics down the secret sauce behind
this performance and a laptop that's
largely thinner than the iPhone comes
down to a few key components the ultra
low voltage core i5 is a big part as are
the integrated HD 3000 graphics however
the real kicker as to why the air is so
snappy is the salt State Drive if you
aren't familiar with what a SSD is I'll
be brief most computers use a spinning
hard drive which well typically gives
you more hard drive space or just
flat-out slow a solid-state drive is
just a collection of chips which not
only are vastly faster but are also less
prone to being destroyed by something
like dropping your laptop tech jargon
aside this makes the air absolutely
snappy it boots and wakes up from sleep
in seconds and applications load in a
fraction of the time the normal laptop
would take I'm a huge proponent of
solid-state drives and very glad to see
Apple including one on the air battery
life is also quite impressive for an 11
inch laptop under a light load with
simple web browsing you get around four
and a half hours out of charge and with
a very intensive use such as video
editing or game
you're looking at something more like
two and a half hours the 11.6 inch
display is impressive in several ways it
sports a resolution of 1366 by 768
giving it a very high pixel density text
and graphics really pop and in addition
the brightness and clarity on the panel
are good the keyboard is the exact same
size and layout is on the MacBook Pro
it's among the best laptop keyboards
I've used a decent throw and nice
spacing new with the 2011 model is
backlighting which is adjusted with the
f5 and f6 keys and makes using the air
and darker places much easier I can't
say enough about the trackpad it takes
up as much surface area below the
keyboard as possible without getting in
the way of the palm rests and works well
the new gestures included in Lion
unfortunately it's not all good the
webcam is only VGA quality and while you
can see it's not awful I do have very
good light here and in general is not
even going to compare to the FaceTime HD
cameras on the MacBook Pro and the iMac
taking a closer look around the computer
on the left you'll see the MagSafe power
adapter a USB 2.0 port headphone jack as
well as a microphone on the right you'll
find the second USB for a total of two
as well as the new Thunderbolt port for
connecting high-speed accessories as
well as doubling as a mini DisplayPort
for an external monitor even with a
close look at the sturdy aluminum
construction you won't even notice the
exhaust until you fire up the air
cleverly hidden in the hinge is where
hot air is released from the chassis and
only when you really get the air doing
something strenuous does the fan become
noticeable at all the laptop does get
uncomfortably hot at these times though
one question I've been asked quite a bit
is how the 11 inch form factor works
while everyone's tastes are different
I found myself loving it it's still
large enough to get work done without
straining your eyes but it gives you a
highly portable design if you're looking
for a computer to stand in as your main
machine the 13 inches probably would be
a better choice but if you have another
computer or want something more portable
the 11 inch is absolutely great
after seeing generation after generation
of MacBook Airs come and go this was the
one that finally got me to take the
plunge
this model retails for $11.99 and is
really the only base configuration I can
recommend there is the option to go down
to 2 gigabytes of RAM and a 64 gigabyte
SSD for $9.99 however unless you plan on
using the air like a netbook you would
be better off to spend the extra money
as upgrading and yourself would be more
expensive for the SSD and nearly
impossible with the RAM using the air
for the last month has been
interesting experience for me it has
been the right blend of performance
superb design and form factor that makes
an excellent secondary machine if you
are in the market for a laptop and the
price doesn't put you off I highly
recommend at least trying out the
MacBook Air it's easily the best laptop
I have ever used
