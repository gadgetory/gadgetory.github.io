decent game console for $100 as a little
brother to the ps4 the PlayStation TV is
definitely the most gaming focused of
this group inside this is basically a PS
Vita that connects to your TV which
gives you access to a full library of
games
it works with ps3 and ps4 controllers
you can get the console by itself or the
bundle which comes with the ps3
controller and a few extras next up
we've got the Amazon fire TV this might
seem like a weird choice but the fire TV
is outfitted with some pretty decent
specs including a quad core processor
this is a more well-rounded set-top box
with plenty of video and music apps on
top of the games it only comes with a
remote out of the box however there's
also a fire TV controller available last
but definitely not least there's the
Nexus player this is the first device
running Android TV which is based on
lollipop the player is packing some
serious firepower as well with a quad
core Intel Atom processor and like the
fire TV you can play some games with the
included remote or you can pick up the
Nexus player gamepad now let's crack
these open inside the PlayStation TV
bundle you've got a ps3 controller mini
USB cable to charge it a gigabyte Vita
memory card which is basically a
necessity and a code to download the
lego movie game dig a little deeper and
you'll find the PlayStation TV itself an
HDMI cable which is a nice addition and
the slightly bulky two piece power
adapter the hardware is absolutely tiny
and it's rocking a decent selection of
ports including Ethernet and a slot for
Vita memory cards and game cards now
let's jump over to the fire TV inside
you'll find a small power adapter the
fire TV itself which is pretty decent
looking a person and finally the fire TV
remote around back you're looking at
HDMI optical audio Ethernet and a USB
port slide open the Nexus player and
right up top you'll find the player
itself the hardware fits right between
the others in terms of size
however it's fairly light on ports
you've got power in a micro USB port and
HDMI out all tucked away on bottom it's
nice to keep cables clean but that means
the player is Wi-Fi only albeit with
rock-solid 802 dot eleven AC Wireless
you've also got a remote which is pretty
basic it sports a microphone for voice
search and a couple buttons the fire TV
remote looks almost identical but has a
few extra buttons and a nicer feel in
the hand turn on the PlayStation TV and
you'll see this is a game console first
and foremost titles like Need for Speed
Most Wanted show
games that look decent on a 5-inch
handheld don't quite make the transition
to the big screen very well games like
nidhogg look basically identical to on
the ps4 though nicely running at 60
frames per second and being awesome fun
at the same time minecraft isn't quite
as robust as on the bigger consoles
though it's basically the full game but
the framerate is more than a little
choppy at times Arkham origins Blackgate
does a good job of bringing a lot of
what's great about the full console game
into a lighter version however here I
ran into one of my first big problems
the lack of a touchscreen most Vita
games work just fine on the ps3
controller but if they use the front or
back touch pads you'll have to dive into
the menu and enable the touch pointer by
pressing down the left or right
thumbstick
this is a decent workaround but you're
still going to run into some games where
this won't be very practical
video games are great but one of the
best parts of the PlayStation TV is that
they can play a huge variety of games
you've got a good selection of PSone
classics and PSP games you can download
from the store as well as ps3 games
using PlayStation now this is streaming
based so you'll need a decent internet
connection but once you're up and
running it can be a cool way of playing
some of the best ps3 games out there
like The Last of Us there is some
latency which can be minimized if you're
connected via ethernet but for $20 a
month it's a cool way of adding some
top-notch games to the PlayStation TV
you've also got ps4 link to connect to
your ps4 as long as it's on the same
network as the PlayStation TV there's a
fair bit of latency with this right now
so it's not a perfect solution but it
can be handy if you want to play ps4
games on multiple TVs in your house
controller wise you can use either the
bundled kiss 3 gamepad or the much
better ps4 controller this combined with
the ability to play physical Vita games
on top of all the digital titles makes
the PlayStation TV hard to beat for $100
but it's not quite that simple the
Amazon fire TV has some gaming shops as
well games like asphalt 8 don't quite
measure up to console quality but it's
not too far off since the fire TV is
Android based you will find some actual
console ports like GTA san andreas
onboard which you can run an HD with
high detail than the original if you
don't mind ps2 like frame rates
interestingly minecraft runs better here
than on the Vita likely because it's the
Pocket Edition instead of a port of the
console version but are also a few
exclusives like sub-zero which is a
hybrid tower defense game in
first-person shooter which is really
surprisingly fun the controller is
pretty decent it mimics the layout of an
Xbox gamepad
and clothes a few media controls if it's
not your thing though the fire TV works
with other Bluetooth controllers
including the ones in the Nexus player
since it's running Android TV which is
fairly new the game library on the Nexus
is a bit sparse right now it comes with
badland pre-installed which is a really
fun side scroller that not only looks
awesome but could easily pass for a
top-notch console title Leo's fortune is
another mobile game that scales nicely
to the TB it runs smoothly and brings a
solid platformer to the Nexus player Rio
boxing is a very arcade style boxing
game but it's one of the better-looking
games on any of these consoles Riptide
gp2 has been around for a while but it's
still one of my favorite racing games
for mobile and amazingly enough it works
well on the Nexus player unfortunately
only a tiny fraction of Android games
have made the jump to Android TV and
minecraft is one of the big holdouts at
the moment I'm also not a huge fan of
the controller not only is it a fairly
hefty $40 but the layout feels a little
cramped to me luckily just like the fire
TV though it is compatible with other
Bluetooth controllers while all three
have plenty of gaming cred it's not
enough to just play games in this group
spend a few minutes with the PlayStation
TV and you'll find one of the big
drawbacks it's limited to 720p compared
to 1080 on the others this will be a
major problem for watching video that
was much of an option in the first place
download the YouTube app and it'll let
you get as far as opening it before
reminding you that it's only for the
Vita trying to download Netflix or Hulu
Plus and you won't even get the option
of downloading you can watch TV shows
and movies from the PlayStation Store
but if media is a big deal for you the
PlayStation TV just doesn't cut it the
fire TV is much more well rounded not
only does it have the basics like
Netflix and Hulu but you'll also find
apps like HBO Go twitch Amazon video
even saw music apps like my personal
favorite Spotify DLS is nice and
responsive and allows you to listen to
music and other apps although there is a
slight drawback and that is YouTube
since Google doesn't officially support
Amazon's version of Android you'll have
to settle for the web version of YouTube
which works easily but tended not to
play videos in 1080p for me you do have
a handy voice search option using the
remote which is faster than manually
typing but it's pretty limited in what
it looks for Android TV on the Nexus
player has hands down my favorite UI of
the bunch
just like lollipop everything stays
smooth at 60fps it's just quite to do
basically everything top you have your
recommendation from YouTube in the Play
Store with a slight
more useful voice search that pulls from
lots of sources and ok ok come on the
each of that is the best I've seen on
the big screen and it also works like a
chromecast if you want to stream media
from a phone or tablet that's important
because like with games Android TV is
still missing a few key apps like HBO Go
which can be casted and Spotify which
can be leaving Google Play as your best
option for music alright so that was a
lot of information the question is are
any of these actually worth it if gaming
is your number one priority the
PlayStation TV is hard to beat for $100
you're getting a huge library of places
and games going all the way back to the
ps1 through the ps4 Mbita
Android TV on the Nexus player is right
up there with the Xbox one in terms of
looks and speed of the UI which I really
appreciate but the app and game support
is just a bit too limited at the moment
I doubt this will be a problem for very
long but as of today the Nexus player is
more about promise than anything else
that leaves us with the Amazon fire TV
which really surprised me it's hands
down the best media box here with
ethernet optical audio and basically
every streaming service out there and
the game library really isn't half bad
it might not be quite as slick as the
Nexus player and have the huge titles of
the PlayStation TV but for your $100 the
fire TV you might just be the best of
both worlds so which would you go with
definitely be sure to let me know in the
comments below also I got the chance to
do something really cool recently while
I was at CES AT&amp;amp;T asked me to check out
their developer conference and hackathon
and make a video for their official
channel that's live right now so if you
guys want to go check it out and let
them know what you think the link will
be in the description hey guys thank you
so much for watching and I will catch
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
