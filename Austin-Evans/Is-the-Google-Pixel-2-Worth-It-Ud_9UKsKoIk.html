Google pixel - and this is the pixel to
excel but the question is are they worth
it there's a lot new this year but one
of the biggest differences is in price
so the pixel - is going to cost you six
hundred and fifty dollars but bump up to
the pixel - Excel and it is eight
hundred and fifty 128 gigs of storage
then this guy is going to cost you nine
hundred and fifty dollars
jump inside the box and there's actually
a fair bit that comes with the pixel -
so the first thing we'll find is the
actual smartphone itself but beyond that
get a little bit deeper we get a yay
welcome to hash tag team pixel bit which
I'm sure has all our people work some
tool that kind of thing there's also a
USBC - USBA adapter we get what looks to
be a whole bunch of extra cables oh when
Google announced the original pixel last
year something they were really big on
is the idea that it still has the
headphone jack now fast-forward to the
pixel - and it's nowhere to be seen now
I get the idea that by dropping the
headphone jack going to free up more
space inside the phone for sensors or
batteries or whatever but the problem is
unless you're fully on the bluetooth
headphone train USBC is a bit of a mess
right now say what you will about Apple
dropping the headphone jack last year
but at the very least there are some
decent lightning headphone options
available on the pixel you're pretty
much limited to either using the adapter
that comes in the box or a very limited
selection of USBC headphones it's not
all bad with a pixel - hardware so well
yes it does look fairly similar to the
last generation including the pretty
large bezels but in return we're now
getting ip67 water resistance as well as
some pretty solid front firing stereo
speakers move over to the pixel 2 XL and
it is a surprisingly large change so in
front it's rocking a 6 inch AMOLED
display and while I wouldn't call it
bezel list the bezels are a lot thinner
than on the standard pixel - even though
the pixel - is made by HTC and the XL is
made by LG the hardware is very similar
so they're both still rocking a two-tone
design and while it looks nice I
actually do definitely prefer the way
the original pixel looked with the very
blue color because you know yeah I want
all my smart phones to look like this
even though this is a glass and metal
phone the metal part actually has this
sort of coating on it which kind of
feels like plastic if you check out
jerry-rigged everything's durability
tests of the pixel
- you'll see this coding is not
particularly durable I actually kind of
like the ways the pixel two feels but
multiple people who've tried it
immediately thought that was made out of
plastic so take that for what it's worth
take a look at it in Geekbench and while
it's fast and it's absolutely no match
for the Apple a 10x and the iPhone 8
however thankfully benchmarks aren't
everything
what stuff like Geekbench doesn't get
across is that this is an incredibly
snappy phone animations are smooth the
responsiveness is quick it always feels
like it's one step ahead of what you
actually want to do honestly this is one
of the fastest Android phones I've
tested and it is right up there with the
iPhone eight part of that is thanks to
an incredibly clean build of Android 8.0
Oreo so there are some custom features
including google lens this is actually
built inside google photos it would be
nice to see it in the camera app what
it's allowing you to do is scan a photo
and try to figure out what it is for
some things it's not that accurate but
for others it is surprisingly good
although it's just not that useful to me
what's a little cooler is now playing
and once you enable this essentially the
phone will always be listening for music
and if it detects it it will actually
give you a notification now this is kind
of creepy but it works surprisingly well
especially if you're in something like a
restaurant you might be able to actually
pick up the song that's being played
over the stereo the pixel 2 also has a
squeezable frame so if you actually
squeeze it on the bottom half it will
trigger a google assistant so what is
the Fox say
[Laughter]
roll a 20-sided die it's an open okay
you got however not everything is
perfect so all my biggest issues with
the pixel 2 is the display so on the
standard size pixel - it's fine it's a 5
inch AMOLED panel with a 1080p
resolution yes it could be a little bit
sharper and the bezels could be a lot
smaller but it's totally usable however
when it comes to the pixel 2 XL that
display is garbage town I mean it
garbage
town garbage town this reminds me of
really early AMOLED panels from years
ago when you're looking at it straight
on it's okay although honestly a lot of
the colors like especially the Reds look
awfully Brown but as soon as you move it
even a little bit off axis it goes super
supercool this is okay in a cheap
smartphone when you're charging 850
dollars it's basically a deal-breaker it
really is a shame because the pixel xl2
should be able to compete with stuff
like the iPhone and the Galaxy Note 8
but right now the screen holds it back
which to me actually makes the normal
pixel to a much easier cell yes it has
the much larger bezels but to my eye is
a way better screen it's the phone that
I've been using the last few days
thankfully the giant bezels of the pixel
- don't go to waste
it does have some very nice sounding
front firing speakers though this pretty
much blows away any other flagship
that's out today we're throwing the only
exception being the iPhone 8 into my
ears they sound very similar way better
than pretty much anything else you can
get right now one of the biggest
upgrades on the pixel 2 is that 12
megapixel camera now that might not
sound impressive but these are some of
the best smartphone images I've ever
gotten period some of the stuff is
really crazy there is a ton of detail in
these images and they've actually done a
really good job of getting even more
dynamic range than most of the already
great flagship says you can buy in 2017
color is also good maybe not quite as
saturated as some Samsung phones but the
low-light performance is seeing a huge
bump up on the pixel now part of that is
because they finally added optical image
stabilization and that pair with their
awesome image processing means that you
can get some surprisingly usable shots
in very low light the portrait mode is
also really good on the pixel so while
it doesn't have any kind of dual camera
setup using software they're actually
able to get a very similar sort of
result and the upside is this also works
with the selfies now if the pixel dude
does shoot 4k video and you guys can
actually look to see and hear what that
sounds like right now but as far as I'm
concerned this is one of the best
smartphone cameras that you can buy
right now although if you're using a
pixel 2xl taking a look at these
pictures on screen might not give you
too much confidence but believe me the
colors and the image quality is
absolutely there last year's pixel was a
very very good phone with a couple of
major compromises this year Google
basically nailed it almost you might not
mind the screen on the pixel 2 XL but it
is just simply not in the same league as
other flagships and when you're paying
$150 you should expect the best in
everything I really like the standard
pixel - yes the screen is a little bit
small and the bezels are big but the
rest of the phone is so good that it's
kind of worth it it is absolutely one of
the best smartphones that you can buy so
what do you guys think
about the pixel too in the pixel to
excel let me know in the comments below
and I will catch you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
