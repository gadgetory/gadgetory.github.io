the video going over the new Samsung
Galaxy s3 so just finished announcing
this and a lot of really cool new
features including a 4.8 inch 720p
display as well as a quad-core processor
so let's take a look as far as Hardware
goes it's fairly similar to the Galaxy
Nexus up front you're gonna find that
4.8 inch Super AMOLED HD display with a
resolution of 1280 by 720 and this
pretty much dominates the entire front
of the galaxy s3 and of course that's
alright you know who needs a lot of
bezel up top you will find your front
facing camera and speaker grille and
below that you will find physical
Android buttons around back you'll find
an 8 megapixel camera capable of 1080p
video as well as burst mode on top of
that you'll also find a 1.9 megapixel
front-facing camera which actually
should be a pretty nice upgrade for most
front-facing cameras on smartphones
today internally it's powered by a
Samsung Exynos 4 quad processor which as
the name implies is a quad-core CPU this
should give you plenty of power to run
pretty much anything you throw at the
phone and on top of that it's paired
with 1 gigabyte of RAM era between 16
and 64 gigabytes of storage with a
microSD expansion which is definitely
nice to see and it has all the other
extinct that you would expect including
NFC Wi-Fi Bluetooth and GPS
unfortunately that's not what you're
going to find in all galaxy s3 devices
so in the United States you're gonna
have LTE which is definitely a big
benefit however instead of having the
quad-core processor it will instead have
a Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 this is the
same thing that happened in the HTC One
X so the international version has the
quad core processor and 3G and the
United States you get 4G but you lose
that extra two cores when the major
thing Samsung is touting is their new
software improvements so basically just
kind of sum it up it's like super duper
TouchWiz it does run Android 4.0 Ice
Cream Sandwich however it also has a
couple of new features one of them is
called s voice yeah the screen shot kind
of sums it up it's basically Siri and
then the new features smart state which
is the front-facing camera to monitor
your eyes and adjust the screen
brightness I'm not entirely sure how
that's gonna work but hey yeah I guess
it's alright probably my favorite
feature is pop-up play what this allows
you to do is actually take a video and
make it picture-in-picture so you can be
looking for your email app and still
have a video playing go back to full
screen leave it go into any app do
whatever you want and move the video
around the screen now this is something
that I think is awesome you know window
management is not something you
typically find on smartphones of that
stuff but of course with something with
a 4.8 inch screen you can definitely
pull something like this off so when can
get your hands on the galaxy s3 well if
you live in Europe you're in luck you'll
begin shipping later on this month
however everywhere else it's not quite
as good so in North America as well as
Japan he'll begin shipping in summer of
course that will be the 4G LTE version
with the dual-core processor here in the
United States will be coming at least to
sprint and most likely we'll be coming
to Verizon AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile as well
overall the gal says so it looks like an
awesome new smartphone and definitely
should be competing with the HTC One X
to be the best Android phone around if
you guys enjoyed this video definitely
