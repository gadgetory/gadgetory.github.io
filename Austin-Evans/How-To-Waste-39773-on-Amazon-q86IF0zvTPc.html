mystery Tech we're taking a look at the
Vinci smart headphones light a voice
controlled hands-free experience with a
standalone music player activity sensors
and an immersive 3d sound so it's like
an iPod and a Apple watch built into a
pair of headphones this looks like the
comet irreal like you used back in the
80s like Back to the Future Back to the
Future yeah yeah there we go there we go
I'm waiting deep inside you touch my
spark and let me light you give me life
and I'll revive you
I am Vinci simcard there's a legit SIM
card and these headphones are you
serious dude there's like a little
keyboard on the side of your head oh
just putting this on for like one second
I can already tell the right ear cup is
very warm that's not a normal thing for
headphones ken would you be so kind as
to connect my headphones to the Internet
for me it's funny every time you click
something I hear like a little Android
like typing indicator stop play it's
just okay mm-hmm hey Jay cool take hold
take hold place it plate play no please
legit cool they sound decent they sound
like maybe I saw a 50 60 dollar pair of
headphones now comfort wise they're
actually not going to be too bad mind
you've only been sort of wearing them
for a few minutes but they're not all
that heavy especially like this one ear
cop doesn't really feel like it's
overpowering it anything is it's just
kind of warm to the touch but wait does
this screen stay on the whole time
that's totally untrained battery super
fast ah well apparently there's a
firmware update but the upgrade doesn't
want to do any thing the real question
here is how much these cost because
they're definitely not going to be as
good sounding as something like a 2 or
$300 pair of headphones but the idea
that you don't even need a phone like
everything's going to be fully
integrated into the headphones is
interesting Matt how much do these costs
it's $200 that's actually not going to
be that bad then if you pick these up
you really need to be committed to the
idea of having headphones that are
completely standalone they sound decent
but not really worth $200 but I mean you
gotta admit this is a very very unique
setup ah my gameboy
would you like Gameboy for Ken what did
you do that for what what what why why
would you do this also yes so this is
all of the original Pokemon games in
Japanese we've got green red blue gold
silver $52 for pokemon green why did you
just give me a bag of baby hands what
does this have to do with Pokemon what
are you doing I have to play like this
oh man I can't do that like this I can't
get him on set of ten finger hand finger
puppets this is a finger puppet
hello little boys and girls I'm totally
not going to creep you out with my
little tiny baby hands look I can do
this I can do this it's fun there we go
we got it we got it it's so weird it
looks like there's like a team of babies
picking up everything I touch this is
the most bizarre thing I've ever done
full stuff and I just a mystery tag like
in my life the weird part is even though
feels weird in some ways it's actually
better than my normal fingers because I
have these little fingers that are like
easy like grab onto things this might be
where my baby hands are enough for the
baby hands we'll use the baby hands
later oh gee this section original well
let's get like the original town map
dude that is so cool I legit when I
actually put this up 1995 Pocket
Monsters green so you guys are not
familiar Pokemon green was the very
first Pokemon game alongside red they'll
released in Japan all the way back in
1995
no one made this a little bit different
is that we actually never got this here
in the United States by the time it came
here we had pok√©mon red and blue which
were far superior because they were
quite as buggy home han it's fitting
that we're playing pokemon green on the
original green Gameboy yes
really not green but that screen is
definitely green Union Pocket Monsters
green Edition all right let's do it
oh no you know what actually I think I
knew this game well enough I can play it
fully a with Japanese text as a kid my
best friend had a level 100 Pidgeot he
let me borrow it for a little bit and
then I never do it back actually I
remember I started a new game I forgot
to give him his Pidgeot back so uh sorry
excellent
suck it Bulbasaur squirtle is in fact
the superior starter I should do more
mystery tech now shouldn't I finish this
later uh what do you have the hands on
for you do the hands it's weird this is
the hydrate spark 2.0 smart water bottle
something tells me this is not going to
be smart I've been working on this for
over 20 minutes and my bottle is still
not connected to my phone because it
doesn't find it far the staples easy
button okay well anyway this is gone
wildly off the rails but my Bluetooth
water bottle is not working and I don't
feel like spending another hour trying
to get set up so I'm just gonna drink
out of it like a normal water bottle and
ignore the Bluetooth because I don't
need Bluetooth water bottles in my life
dude that's not okay man why would you
do that that's that's that's messed up
it was like a creepy doll Emporium Matt
what are you doing
retro classic backlit mechanical
keyboard oh it's so heavy wait there's
four of these so we've got the retro
classic Elwood the artisan the Onyx and
the posh so please hope you didn't spend
like $100 on keyboards Oh someone sent
this to us okay so this is a vintage
typewriter style USB keyboard but it's
going to be now a wireless but also
backlit it's got USB see a successful
milliamp hour battery it's got a genuine
wood veneer so I've seen some of these
like retro typewriter style keyboards
most of them aren't that impressive this
looks a little bit nicer dude that looks
so nice oh these look it even says
Austin Evans on it alright that's pretty
cool on the back nalli do we have a USBC
cable which you can unplug if you don't
want to use it in Wired mode but you can
switch it from bluetooth USB or off and
you can switch between Mac
PC here okay so this is the fully kitted
out version which is going to cost two
hundred twenty dollars but if you don't
want Wireless it's only going to be 120
130 okay so there's a wide range of
price will will drop the the links in
the description so it is definitely
going to be a mechanical keyboard versus
a typewriter even though it does have
that retro look it doesn't have that
same kind of punch of a real typewriter
but that being said as a keyboard even
though the key caps being round is a
little bit weird it shouldn't take you
that long to get used to I'm actually
kind of surprised I don't know what to
do with myself when there's a mystery
tech that is not complete garbage town
although I got to say there's all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
