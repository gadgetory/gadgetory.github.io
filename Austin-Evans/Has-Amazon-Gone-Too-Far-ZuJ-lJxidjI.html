noticed I'm not Austin and that's cuz he
couldn't make it today so welcome to the
first episode of Ken goes to things that
Austin can't go to we're here at
Amazon's day1 HQ to take a look at some
of the new products they dropped and
they dropped a lot and I don't think I
can cover all of it in this video but
this will just be the things that I
found most interesting today firstly
they announced a lot of improvements to
Alexa so one of the things that they're
doing is making her seem a lot more
human-like so for example one of the
focuses is contextual conversation so
you ask Alexa question and she asks
normally but what you can do now is ask
her follow-up questions without having
to manually trigger her it seems a lot
more natural unlike other assistants on
other platforms Siri apart from that one
of the main focuses of the show were the
new slate of echo products so there's a
lot to cover there but some of the ones
that stood out to me were for example
the echo dot up next to the original
echo dot it's definitely way more
chunkier it has a felt finish but most
importantly it's supposed to be 70%
louder and sound way more fuller than
the original echo dot and at a $50 price
point which puts it right up next to the
Google home Mini which is really cool I
actually want to grab one of those right
now so one of the things that people did
with the original echo dot was plug it
into speakers they already had well
Amazon saw the opportunity so they made
the echo input what is basically an echo
dot but without the speaker or the felt
which is cool
it's at $35 which is a decent chunk of
change compared to the echo dot that's
going on sale if you want to save money
and just plug it into speaker well this
is a really good option so on the higher
end of that where the echo input is a
lower end solution to plugging into
setup that you already have the echo
link and the echo link amp are meant to
plug into your hi-fi setup that you
might have already both of them have
24-bit Doc's to work with your existing
hi-fi setup at home which will work
great for services like tidal which they
just added support for you can just plug
in the link to a receiver you have
already or you can buy the amp which is
basically a kind of receiver that can
drive speakers with dual 60 watt
channels as well the link will be
available for $1.99 and the link amp
will be available for two
the former will be available sometime
this year
and the amp will be available sometime
in 2019 they're also giving Sonos a run
for its money with its multiple and
stereo room capabilities so you can tie
multiple echoes together and essentially
play them in different rooms or if you
have two in the same room you can have
them run in stereo they actually have a
demo of it right there with echo dots
and it sounded pretty good don't but it
sounded pretty good they also added the
echo sub which is at $130 and you can
add that to any echo setup that you have
if you say have to echo dots that are at
$50 each and you have the echo sub
that's at $130 for what is essentially
$230 you have a decent 2.1 set up that
will have a decent punch and sound great
so among the other announcement noise
amazon also unveiled Echo Auto so it's
available later this year for $50 or $25
for an invite only thing whatever that
means it's a module that connects to
your car via bluetooth or auxin
basically makes your car a smart car so
Echo Auto uses your phone your voice and
Alexa to control things like your music
or you can ask it directions and it'll
open up whatever GPS or map app you use
and you can even control your home stuff
because Alexa's in it and it does that
oh don't don't stop stop let's just mute
these we're good now so Amazon down this
hallway may or may not have the future
of the kitchen or something like that so
right behind me is the thing that I've
been looking forward to forever
it's the amazonbasics microwave that
cost $60 and if you pair it with an echo
you can basically have a bunch of
presets on tap to say heat up a potato
or popcorn or my pizza rolls
I guess a ton of microwave microwaving
is done by customers for popcorn
so this microwave actually keep track of
how much popcorn you've cooked and then
order more so that you never run out
will never never be popcorn less the
futures here welcome to 2018
