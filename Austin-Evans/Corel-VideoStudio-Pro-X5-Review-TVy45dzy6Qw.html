musical review of Corel VideoStudio Pro
x5 this is the latest version of the
software I've used to edit my videos for
nearly two years now and there's a lot I
like about video studio if you've never
tried it before you'll find it's a very
simple to use editor that has support
for multiple audio and video tracks
picture and picture editing chroma
keying and much more one of my favorite
new features is the ability to record a
screencast from inside video studio head
over to the capture tab and then select
screen capture you can record the full
screen an individual program or custom
sized area with options to record
Windows audio along with the microphone
and it supports multiple monitors
quality is good although file sizes are
quite large in the WMV format it's great
for doing normal screencasts and you can
even record gameplay footage if you like
although fraps is still probably a
better option for fast paced gameplay
another new feature is the ability to
pull multi-layer images from paint shop
pro and be able to edit each individual
layer which can be nice if you want to
tweak a composition another feature is
being able to export html5 interactive
videos it exports the video in both
h.264 as well as web m and packages it
all up for use on the web while not
something a lot of people will use this
is one of the more unique features of
video studio x5 it also now supports up
to 60 P footage which works nicely with
the time-lapse features while the last
version wasn't bad as far as performance
goes x5 is the notice will step forward
using my editing rig which consists of a
core i7 2604 gigahertz 16 gigabytes of
RAM and 120 gigabyte solid state drive
the program easily keeps up with my
normal 720p video editing and even kept
going when I tossed a few 1080p clips
into the timeline that's not something
you can do with many other editors
regardless of how powerful your computer
is memory usage is also solid with most
projects using less than one gigabyte of
RAM if you've got an older computer
video studio still has you covered with
smart proxy which can automatically make
smaller clips to use with editing and
then render in full high-definition the
overall interface is very similar to x4
and is set up like most modern video
editors with a preview window clip bin
and timeline with a storyboard option
for easier use all your other features
carry over as well including chroma key
support DVD and blu-ray burning
stop-motion video a wide variety of
formats available for export and much
more
the board has also been improved with
the ability to edit NPO 3d pictures from
cameras as well as 3d avi video which
makes us the first editor that I've seen
that can actually use both the 3d Stills
and video from the Nintendo 3ds
it's nothing for me to sit down and edit
a video for several hours at a time most
days so I really need a solid video
editor that has what I need
while the screencasting features have
replaced another program in my workflow
I am still using After Effects to
supplement some higher-end features such
as motion tracking all things considered
though Corel VideoStudio Pro x5
definitely remains my video editor of
choice and something I highly recommend
to anyone who's serious about video
editing video Studio Pro x5 is available
for download on Windows starting today
on Corel website for $80 or $60 as an
upgrade from x3 or x4 will be hitting
stores in boxed 4 and March 21st there's
also a full-featured 30 day trial with
no watermarks or restrictions available
at the site so if you're interested give
it a shot and see how you like it if you
enjoy deadly be sure to leave this video
a thumbs up and if you're interested in
