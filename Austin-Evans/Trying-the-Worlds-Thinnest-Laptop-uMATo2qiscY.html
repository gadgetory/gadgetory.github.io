at CES 2018 with what is the world's
thinnest laptop this is the Acer Swift 7
if you remember actually did a video
about a year ago on the previous version
of this laptop which was at the time the
world's thinnest laptop
however 10 millimeters ha no one wants
to use a laptop that's anywhere near
that thing
so this guy brings it all the way down
to 9 millimeters to put things in
context all you do is look at the ports
so the thickness of a USBC port is
pretty much the thickness of the laptop
of course with a laptop this thin and
light you do have to have some
trade-offs and the ports are actually
where that begins so on here we're
really just getting a pair of USB
seaports in addition to that headphone
jack however because you have something
that's so thin and light I'm willing to
make some sacrifices even though it is
very thin it actually didn't really
sacrifice on the flexibility of the
chassis so if I really try to twist it
my hands here it really doesn't do
anything which is nice the last thing I
want is my laptop the snap in half in my
bag because it was just a little bit too
thin
now as you would expect the Swift 7 is
hardly the fastest laptop in the world
but it still does have a seventh
generation Core i7 processor paired with
eight gigabytes of RAM as well as a 256
gig SSD now because it is so thin it is
going to be the Y Series processor which
does mean it can be fanless cover this
is actually the only configure of the
laptop there's no additional RAM SSD
options anything like that what you get
is what you get with this guy for the
display it has actually surprisingly
large 14-inch panel with a 1080p
resolution while the screen itself based
on first impressions looks pretty decent
what's impressive is that as a
touchscreen and that really shouldn't be
impressive because it's 2018 and all
laptops should have touch screens but
there you go and you would expect there
are some quirks here so something I've
immediately noticed is that the
backspace key is shared with the Delete
key up top which is a little bit hard to
get used to and you also share the caps
lock with the tilde key but for the most
part the keyboard actually feels pretty
good even though there isn't a ton of
travel especially pretty easy to get
used to the trackpad is also interesting
so on the surface that actually is not
bad so you've got windows precision
drivers and the actual tracking seems
fine the problem is is that there's
actually no clicks so when you actually
go to do it you have to just tap it
which I actually don't mind in a lot of
trackpads but it is a little bit weird
to have essentially no sensation we
actually go for a full click on this guy
one thing that does legitimately
separate this from a lot of other
laptops right now is that it has a
built-in LTE connection so the model I
have here doesn't have it working just
yet the idea is that you will have a
nano SIM slot on the side of the
computer where you just put a sim card
in and switch between networks fairly
easily which especially for something
that's this thin and this portable does
make a lot of sense we also have a 720p
webcam on board so you guys can judge
the quality for yourself one thing is as
with a lot of these ultra portable
laptops the webcam placement being on
the bottom is less than ideal unless of
course you want to get some wonderful
nose selfies the people take selfies on
laptops right so because it is such a
thin laptop the speakers aren't hugely
loud but it does sound decent I'm
totally sure where they're coming out
though oh it looks like on the bottom
here one thing you're really not giving
up though is battery life so the Swift 7
should last for around 10 hours or so on
a charge and on top of that it is also
support a fingerprint sensor for Windows
hello the Acer swift 7 will be available
in late March for $1,700 so yes it is
absolutely pricey but considering just
how thin and how nice the hardware is
for some people if you really want the
best affordability it's not bad of
course what do you guys think about the
Swift 7 it's definitely not going to be
for everyone let me know in the comments
below and I will catch you on the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
