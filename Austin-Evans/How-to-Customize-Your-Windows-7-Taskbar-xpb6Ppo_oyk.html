showing you how to customize your
windows 7 taskbar so why should I well I
wasn't planning on doing this tutorial
but in my one of my recent screencasts I
got I got a ton of comments people
asking how did you do that what's that
thing so basically I'll go ahead and
show you guys how to do it yourself
shouldn't take you just a few minutes
basically just download one program and
I'll show you how to customize the icon
so let's go ahead just jump right into
it so the first thing you're going to
need to go ahead and do of course this
is Windows 7 only the first thing you're
going to need to go ahead and do is
download this program it's called
Windows 7 Start button changer which I
know is a fantastic name
so basically the way you want this
basically just go ahead and download it
and I'll show you it lets you allows you
to customize fully your Windows 7 Start
button okay so once you download the
program just go ahead and open it up and
it's really pretty simple so there are
two options there's obviously the main
one which is to select and change your
Start button um however one thing I do
want to let you guys know about is that
there is another one that's basically
that restores your original home ravish
your original Start button
I may actually want to do this because
the program when you pick a custom one
and maybe you might not like it
obviously you know I customized it to
bunch myself if you don't like it all
you need to do is go ahead and click the
original restore back up it'll revert
you back to the normal one and then you
can pick another one if you try with one
customize and you try another customize
a lot of times it won't work so go ahead
and just restore to backup and then try
again if you're interested so that's
going to show you a few of them that are
already pre-built as you can see here
when you download the program it does
come with ten sample orbs pre-built now
actually Debian art is a fantastic place
if you don't like any of these you
absolutely can download many many more
it's no big deal and all you need to do
is just go ahead and point the program
towards it but for this I'm going to
show you there are 10 pre-built I'll do
like quite a few of them in fact I do
like this one as you can see here right
there
it actually kind of fits well I can't
see it but you can if it's well with my
background so again pick you pick any of
these you can make your own or you can
download some that's why just pick that
out and there you go now let's go ahead
move on to customizing your icons so
this one is a lot simpler
pretty much it comes down to picking
what kind of icons you like so this is
the one I'm currently using it's token
now of course while the link to this one
as well
the description so basically you go
ahead just download this and indeed just
the same way with your Start button you
can create your own or you can search
Debian art is great for finding tons and
tons and tons of custom icons so
absolutely feel free to find your own
anyway if you're interested in this we
can go ahead and download it and I just
go ahead and show you it's pretty simple
- how to add it so let's say you know I
will say that there are programs that
will do this automatically for you but
personally I've found is you know it's a
lot easier to just go ahead and do it
yourself manually it doesn't take a
minute so let's just go and show you
head to it so let's go actually go ahead
and pick GIMP so basically what you do
is you need to right-click whatever your
icons you wanting to change then come up
here to where it says the name of the
program so it should be right on the
bottom now right-click this and hit
properties so as you can see here it
will bring up the little properties a
dialog now come down here and hit change
icon now once you're in change icon I
need to do is find it so just look for
browse I'm going to go ahead and go down
to go ahead and go down here to the
token file and obviously during this
step you go ahead and pick whatever you
want go ahead and just look through here
go ahead and just pick out the token
theme does have quite a few or the token
icons whatever you want to call them it
is up quite a few in the dark as well as
light so you know maybe you can look for
you know maybe you want to look like an
airplane now this one actually does have
quite a few icons actually as you can
see here it does have an icon for camp
but obviously this is totally customized
customizable you can pick whatever you
want so maybe I want GIMP to look like a
camera I want GIMP to look like
QuickTime you can do pretty much
anything you want so guys that's pretty
much it as far as how to go ahead and
customize it basically what you do is
restart do H H and every icon now
doesn't have icons for everything
obviously so you know you might want to
mix and match or do whatever you want
and then as soon as you're done now
again actually it's kind of same with
the start button if it's not showing up
for you just restart your computer that
should do it because it has two recache
all the icons but once you do it's they
all should pop up and it should look
pretty much like I have here or indeed
however you customized it so hey guys I
hope you enjoyed this tutorial and yeah
