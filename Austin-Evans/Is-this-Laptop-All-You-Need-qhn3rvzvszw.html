laptop that you need now that might
sound like a weird question but as
someone who takes a look at a lot of
weird extreme tech this is a lot more
reasonable for most people now of course
a big shout-out to a surfer now only
hooking this up with a laptop that's
sponsoring this video and let's take a
look so this is the Acer Aspire r15 now
inside we get the power cable and some
lovely cardboard packages
having trouble contact acer first seems
like perfectly reasonable advice I can't
make fun of so this is the aspire r15
I'm actually curious to see I have
actually not seen this in person yet I
like to sort of cross brush finished
here it looks pretty nice the course
this is a pretty beefy laptop so inside
we have a full 15.6 inch display so
what's cool is that this is a
convertible so you can use it a standard
laptop mode you have a solid trackpad
and you also have a touchscreen so you
can scroll like that but when you're
ready you can actually just flip the
entire screen around and say watch video
like this or you can even flip it upside
down and get tense mode it's a pretty
cool little setup I've got to say now
yeah this is a little bit big to be used
as a standard tablet but if you flip the
screen all the way close
what you get here is what's essentially
a 15 inch tablet this gives you a lot of
flexibility so you want to use the
laptop in a normal situation you sit
down open it up and you can use it just
like any other laptop you have the touch
screen you have your keyboard as well as
your trackpad when it comes to watching
videos oh it's really helpful to be able
to flip the screen around I think that's
a big advantage of the laptop sure if
you want to use it as a stayer laptop by
all means go ahead but having the
flexibility to just flip the screen
around using pretty much any orientation
you want is a huge advantage this guy
also has a pretty good screen so it is a
15.6 inch display with a full 1080p
resolution and not only is it IPS but it
also has 0 air gap which especially
helps with the viewing angle how good
screen is important is this is a very
media focused laptop so you're going to
be watching video playing games and
while yes it would be nice if it had a
4k screen but that would add a lot to
the price I think this is a good
compromise so last time Jane idea made
out of they are a bit of an estate
speakers are also not bad so that's
important well sure you're probably
going to want plug in headphones for
video editing or gaming but it's nice to
be able to know that you have speakers
they're going to work in pretty much any
orientation
of course this guy's running Windows 10
but what's cool is is that it's a
signature addition what that means is
that there's no extra bloatware or junk
that you have on the computer when you
first get it if you're anything like me
you know that you usually have to spend
30 minutes getting rid of all the crap
when you first get a brand new computer
but here it's pretty much good to go out
of the box and since it is Windows 10 it
means we have things like Cortana so for
example I can ask it tell me an
interesting fact venus is the only
planet that rotates clockwise it was
cool about cortana a cortana actually
has probably the best voice of any of
these sort of assistance there's also
support for Windows hello as well as a
built-in fingerprint reader and the
trackpad so something as simple as just
trying to drop my finger on it and we're
immediately logged in now I feel like
the more laptops I use that have
fingerprint readers the more I find it's
actually a really useful feature inside
the aspire r15 we have a core i7 7500
use 12 gigabytes in memory at 256
gigabyte SSD as well as dedicated nvidia
940 MX graphics so with that KB Lake
processor not only are you getting the
latest and greatest but it also should
be easy on battery there's also support
for Windows hello as well as a built-in
fingerprint reader and the trackpad so
that is 4k pros footage playing back
inside DaVinci Resolve now this is not
going to be an amazing editing PC for
that I really would want a quad core
processor but thanks to those in video
graphics you actually can't do some
fairly light editing you can also do
some gaming so right now I'm playing
overwatch at 1080p on low setting I'm
getting a really respectable 60 to 70
frames per second so I think that's one
of the big advantages of the aspire r15
Meli can you do stuff like gaming but
you can do video editing it cutter will
let you do a little bit of everything
especially because it has that SSD and
plenty of memory and while the graphics
aren't amazing you're going to blow you
away they're totally not bad you can
definitely do a fair bit of gaming on
this guy so is this all the computers
you need for a lot of people the answer
is yeah but what do you guys think let
me know in the comments below and I will
catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
