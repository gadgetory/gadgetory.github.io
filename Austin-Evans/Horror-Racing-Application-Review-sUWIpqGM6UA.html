I'm here with an application view on an
interesting application rather a game
called hora racing you know this but
that point of the UH be interesting um
you'll see games like this very often
but you know that's a planet I think
probably should um basically what it is
it's a top-down racer um kinda reminds
me some of like racers from like you
know the old game for days and like
Super Nintendo but you know this has
some good graphics and it's kinda
interesting so I should go ahead and use
jump right in um I won't show you guys
real quick it's it's kind of it's kind
of just a really interesting um
basically you drive the car and there's
other cars on the track and basically
you have to be thin but you can also use
weapons and everything um one thing I
wasn't well I'm not so keen on is that
small stain when you see here you see it
looks very nice but you're you get all
these different kinds of monsters and
stuff yeah that kind of dumb but and
show you guys one more but you do have
quite a few different cars to pick from
and obviously monsters but really the
ones once the angel it really does not
matter that much so you know you're
scoring and friend it so basically the
controls are really quite good I'll show
you guys so it's the whole controls are
here and this is basically the whole I
mean is basically the whole thing it's
not like that complete and you see here
you see it's taught these three targets
on the left the one is finishing them so
I'm the final mission aims say the
game's up on the top got this in at the
bottom on get in line now you see up top
here it shows your health now if you
blow off which I throttle one just to
run second
both luck son and blow up you basically
it's not like going over basically
you're able to just restart in just a
minute he's good um now I like to come
souls to this um you see GI just got one
wheel on the bottom line gif just I'd
open single wheel but it works pretty
well on my thumb can get a little tired
it it's not it's not perfect but as far
as controls go for this I said it is
pretty solid let's go on so yeah I'm gay
la gangs on man it means you actually I
strive getting a substrate and I need to
get my car is smoking that it is so now
have invested just reached actually just
go ahead and finish up this race I'm
right behind but there are at him I'm
stalking you see this jumps and
everything well to be honest it's a fun
game I mean okay here's I'm on the last
lap so sport i'd need this guy doing
much damage on him I mean the brackets
are pretty good it's not we does not run
choppy at all which is definitely nice
things there's a lot of their full
honors and games it's probably only to
the exception of Real Racing kind of
doesn't really work and you know the
normal kind of like right behind the car
view or inside a car or whatever but you
know for a top-down racer this is a lot
of fun I don't I'm not too keen on the
whole monster thing I can just kind of
kind of down but you know
but go st. Louis Park faster and just it
anyway guys that's for racing um you
know I really like the idea that not
really that concept but there's a couple
things to kind of keep me from really
wholeheartedly recommending it on for
one while it is a fun game you know it
the monster thing kind of is a little
bum and the controls while they're good
for a little while and your thumb
definitely gets tired because you have
to hold it there and turn it not a deal
breaker but and you definitely notice
that you know you do get tired um now
one pretty big problem in my opinion is
the price this is this application is
299 and i think that's that's that's a
little too much i think this should be a
99-cent application now of course I mean
you know they can charge whatever they
want but I definitely think they would
get a lot more people if it was 99 cents
um now if you are interested there is a
light version available I have tested
but imagine you know it's just the light
review i get like one race or whatever
and so if you are thinking about it i'd
say go ahead check out the light version
if you want the full version well if you
like it go ahead if you're on the fence
i probably wouldn't get yet i'd probably
kind of no just think about it and wait
till it goes down tonight that sense
opinion guys that was my review on or
racing yeah thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
