with the review of the motorola atrix HD
for only one hundred dollars on contract
you can't expect much but the atrix is
seriously impressive to start let's go
over the hardware it looks similar to
the droid razr with a very thin profile
and kevlar back with a hunt for the 8
megapixel camera up front is the 4.5
inch color boost HD display with
resolution of 1280 by 720 and it's
easily one of the best phone displays
out there it's a bit smaller than some
other phones but because of this the
pixel density is even higher colors are
a bit over saturated but overall it's
solid above this you'll see the
speakerphone and 1.3 megapixel front
facing camera and below as an AT&amp;amp;T logo
even though it looks like a button the
atrix uses on screen android keys on the
left side there's a flat for your SIM
card along with space for a micro SD
card of up to 32 gigabytes to go along
with the 8 gigabytes of storage built in
on the right you'll see the sleep/wake
button and volume rocker and up top is
the headphone jack microUSB along with
micro HDMI out which is definitely a
nice feature fire up the atrix and
you'll see a mostly unscathed version of
Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich most of
the changes are cosmetic such as new
icons and a risk and settings menu
there's also a very handy widget that
lets you flip through the time weather
and battery percentage the excellent
Smart Actions app is also here which
allows you to set certain tasks to
happen when an action triggers it for
example you can have the phone remind
you to charge it at night when you get
home or even automatically lower
brightness and silent your ringer before
you go to sleep the atrix is no slouch
when it comes to performance this is
thanks to its 1.5 gigahertz dual-core
Snapdragon s4 pair with one gigabyte of
RAM and this is the same combo you'll
find in phones like the HTC one x and
samsung galaxy s3 it's about as good as
it gets in phones today you also find
support for LTE on ATT as part of the
deal speaking of cellular I was very
impressed with the call quality on the
atrix in the middle of my house I
typically had little to no AT&amp;amp;T service
the atrix nearly always held on to a
couple bars battery life is reasonable
but nothing on the razr maxx with
moderate usage i was barely able to make
it through a normal day but as i don't
have AT&amp;amp;T LTE in my area that likely
helped the battery quite a bit moving on
to the camera the lower price finally
becomes noticeable well the 8 megapixel
stills aren't terrible you can
definitely notice install
openness in many pictures colors and
dynamic range are also a bit often the
highest end phones out there but in
fairness unless you have a 1x or iPhone
on hand you probably won't notice all
right so I'm not recording using the
rear facing camera on the atrix HD so it
helped me demo this I got my good buddy
Sam so hey Sam you don't say hi no
interested too busy being a dog
natalenya overall the atrix is a really
impressive phone that you can pick up
from as low as 50 dollars on Amazon the
design is a bit lackluster and it would
be great to have a better camera and
bigger battery but on the flip side
you're getting a phone with excellent
specs a top-notch screen and a nearly
unskinny of android 4.0 if you're
looking for a budget phone on AT&amp;amp;T the
motorola atrix HD is definitely
something you should check out if you
enjoyed this video definitely be sure to
