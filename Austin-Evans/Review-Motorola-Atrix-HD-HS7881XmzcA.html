here with a review of the Motorola Atrix
HD for only $100 on contract you can't
expect much but the Atrix is seriously
impressive to start let's go over the
hardware it looks similar to the Droid
Razr with a very thin profile and Kevlar
back with a hum for the 8 megapixel
camera up front is the 4.5 inch color
boost HD display with a resolution of
1280 by 720 and it's easily one of the
best phone displays out there it's a bit
smaller than some other phones but
because of this the pixel density is
even higher colors were a bit
oversaturated but overall it's solid
above this you'll see the speakerphone
and 1.3 megapixel front-facing camera
and below is an AT&amp;amp;T logo even though it
looks like a button the Atrix uses
on-screen Android keys on the left side
there's a flat for your SIM card along
with space for a micro SD card of up to
32 gigabytes to go along with the eight
gigabytes of storage built in on the
right you'll see the sleep/wake button
and volume rocker and up top is the
headphone jack microUSB along with micro
HDMI out which is definitely a nice
feature
fire up the Atrix and you'll see a
mostly unscanned version of Android 4.0
Ice Cream Sandwich most of the changes
that are cosmetic such as new icons and
a reskin settings menu there's also a
very handy widget that lets you flip
through the time weather and battery
percentage the excellent Smart Actions
app is also here which allows you to set
certain tasks to happen when an action
triggers it for example you can have the
phone remind you to charge it at night
when you get home or even automatically
lower brightness and set your ringer
before you go to sleep the Atrix is no
slouch when it comes to performance this
is thanks to its 1.5 gigahertz dual-core
Snapdragon s4 paired with 1 gigabyte of
RAM and this is the same combo you'll
find in phones like the HTC One X and
Samsung Galaxy s3 it's about as good as
it gets in phones today you also find
support for LTE on AT&amp;amp;T as part of the
deal speaking of cellular I was very
impressed with the call quality on the
Atrix in the middle of my house I
typically had little to no AT&amp;amp;T service
but the Atrix nearly always held onto a
couple bars battery life is reasonable
but nothing on the RAZR MAXX
with moderate usage I was barely able to
make it through a normal day but as I
don't have 18 t LTE in my area that
likely helped the battery quite a bit
moving on to the camera lower price
finally becomes noticeable well the
eight megapixel stills aren't terrible
you can definitely notice them stall
openness in many pictures colors and
dynamic range are also a bit often the
highest end phones out there but in
fairness unless you have a 1 X or iPhone
on hand you probably won't notice all
right so I'm now recording using the
rear-facing camera on the Atrix HD so to
help me demo this I got my good buddy
Sam so hey Sam you don't say hi no
interested too busy being a dog yeah I
don't blame you
overall the Atrix is a really impressive
phone that you can pick up from as low
as 50 dollars on Amazon the design is a
bit lackluster
and it would be great to have a better
camera and bigger battery but on the
flip side you're getting a phone with
excellent specs a top-notch screen and a
nearly unscanned version of Android 4.0
if you're looking for a budget phone on
AT&amp;amp;T the Motorola Atrix HD is definitely
something you should check out if you
enjoyed this video definitely be sure to
leave it a thumbs up and if you're
