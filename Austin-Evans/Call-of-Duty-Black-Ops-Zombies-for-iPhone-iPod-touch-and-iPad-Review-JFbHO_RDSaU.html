here with a review of called duty black
ops zombies for the iPhone iPod touch
and iPad just like last year's world
award zombies this is based on the
console call of duty zombies mode where
you kill zombies naturally I'm not a
huge fan of first-person shooters on
touch screens and this doesn't really do
much to change my mind controller handle
with a virtual joystick on the left and
aiming and shooting is done by swiping
on the right side of the screen despite
the very men controls I still find
myself having a great time with the game
if you've never tried cause zombies you
start out on a level with the pistol and
hordes of zombies coming in waves at you
you need to repair barricades to hold
them back and buy new weapons to keep up
with them as they grow a number speed
and hard to kill ability you were able
to spend points you get from killing
zombies and repairing barricades to buy
weapons along with opening doors to give
you access to more of the map this
usually gives you access to better
weapons or perks but then you have that
much more area to cover suffice it to
say that there's a reason zombies was
basically the only thing I ever played
on world war for the Xbox you also have
black ops arcade which you can unlock by
progressing through the game the
graphics are also much better than its
predecessor still not near console
quality but not bad at all and it runs
very smoothly on the iPhone 4s I did
have some issues getting to work on my
iPod Touch 4th generation but reboot got
it up and running one of the best parts
of these types of games is the
multiplayer as with a few friends all
working together the game becomes that
much more fun I mean its difficulties
here however
online multiplayer gave me an air each
time I tried it on both of my devices
and local multiplayer didn't work as
both of my devices are logged into the
same game center account black ops
zombies really has me torn the gameplay
keeps the same awesome elements from the
console version that makes it so much
fun but the problems with multiplayer
and crashing are definitely issues only
having one map to start with also isn't
cool
although more maps should be on the way
soon I'm still having a good time with
it
and if this looks like fun to you go
pick it up but just keep in mind it's
not perfect by any means if you enjoyed
