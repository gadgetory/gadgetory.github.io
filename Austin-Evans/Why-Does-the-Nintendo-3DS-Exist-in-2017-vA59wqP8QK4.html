originally came out in 2011 but in a
world with the Nintendo switch should
the 3ds still exists so if you want to
buy a 3ds in 2017 your going to be
picking from one of these three options
to start with we have the Nintendo 2ds
which came out in 2013 now as you might
be able to imagine this has a little bit
of a different design
I remember wouldnt intend to originally
announce the 2d ass I totally thought it
was a joke so in the transition from the
standard DS to the 3ds one of the major
advantages was the idea that it did
support 3d however the to ds9 does it
look weird but it doesn't support 3d at
all that doesn't really bother me though
as I very rarely use that 3d feature to
begin with so there are a couple of
other trade-offs here most notably that
it has a couple of fairly small displays
and the actual speaker itself is kind of
quiet but when you consider that this
only costs $80 and comes with a copy of
Mario Kart 7 it starts to look like a
pretty good deal take a closer look at
the 2d S and it is a little bit odd
looking so this is the only DS or 3ds
that doesn't have a folding clamshell
design which means that it is definitely
not as pocketable but on the flip side
if you're someone with larger hands this
is actually one of the more comfortable
consoles to play on next in the lineup
we have the new Nintendo 2ds XL and this
actually only came out a couple months
ago and I did do a full video on it if
you guys missed that there's actually a
lot of interesting stuff with this guy
because this is a newer console Nintendo
are still rolling out some new colors
including this white and orange which I
actually think looks pretty nice what I
really want to get my hands on is the
pokeball addition which comes out next
month unlike the original the new 2d s
XL doesn't give up a lot over a 3ds so
you're getting those larger displays
you're getting the upgrade speakers and
of course it'll actually you know fit in
your pockets there are also some nice
upgrades like faster internals which
help with load times as well as give you
a couple vehicles of titles and you do
have a Mito support long story short
this is actually one of my favorite 3ds
you can buy today which brings us to the
only actual 3ds here the new 3ds XL open
this guy up and we'll see the same
QuickStart information a our cards as
well as the console itself what you
don't get is an AC adapter in the box
which is weird considering that this is
the most expensive 3ds you can buy I
will say though that some of the limited
editions such as
Sammis edition 3dsxl look really nice so
this originally came out in 2015 at
least for the non special edition
version and what you got here was very
similar to the 2d SXL except with
face-tracking 3d I do have to admit this
looks really cool but the problem is is
that for only an extra hundred dollars
you can go all the way up to the
Nintendo switch which makes the 3dsxl
kind of a hard sell if you've never
owned a 3ds or just haven't played in
the last few years then there are a lot
of great games for it Mario Kart 7 is
one of the earlier 3ds games but it
still holds up so presently well
especially considering that it comes for
free on the 2d s so I will say that I'm
typically a fan of a little bit more
simulation style games like Fortson Gran
Turismo but it's really hard to argue
with just how much fun Mario Kart is
even though 150cc is not not my strong
suit it is hard to talk about a Nintendo
handheld without mentioning Pokemon and
this is the series that keeps me coming
back and there are so many great games
available including the upcoming ultra
Sun and Moon but the original side of
Moon are also not too bad
Lou the game of actually put a fair bit
of time into and one of the things
that's actually nice about playing on
the 2d s is that even though it does
have a smaller display it's the same
resolution as the bigger ones which
means that this actually looks a little
bit sharper than playing on the 3ds XL
or 2d s XL on top of playing pretty much
all the Pokemon games in the last 10
years or so on the 2d s and 3ds you also
have a couple in the Virtual Console
including red blue yellow gold and
silver I grew up playing the original
Pokemon games so they definitely have a
special place in my heart but I've got
to say it is really nice to be able to
play them on a backlit display with a
headphone jack having a battery it's a
lot nicer than the old-school game boys
I've gotta admit all 3d s's can also
play original Nintendo DS games so the
only issue is is that because the screen
is slightly higher resolution than the
DS screen you're either dealing with a
little bit of blurry upscaling or you
just can't use the entire display for
the games but in return you're getting
one of the best handheld libraries of
all time the games really are why you
should consider picking up a 3ds in 2017
sure Nintendo is slowly bringing a lot
of these franchises over to the
smartphone but at the end of the day
there are a lot of games that you just
cannot play anywhere else besides the
3ds I think it's only a matter of time
before the switch totally replaces the
3ds but for now I think it makes sense
why this exists in 2017 there are still
new games coming out for it if you just
want to play through a few DS or 3ds
games then the original 2d
is not a bad pickup for $80 you're only
a single pair of headphones away from
having a pretty solid gaming experience
my favorite 3d is isn't actually a 3ds
at all it's the new 2d s XL so if you're
okay with giving up the 3d display which
personally I just don't find all that
useful you're pretty much getting the
full experience here and it's cheaper to
be fair the new 3ds XL isn't exactly a
terrible pickup but at $200 it is so
hard to justify picking this up when the
Nintendo switch is only $100 more unless
you're a hardcore fan who really likes
these special editions I would go with
the 2d S or 2d s XL so what do you guys
think should the Nintendo 3ds still
exist in 2017 let me know in the
comments below and I will catch you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
