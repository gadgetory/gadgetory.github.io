here's the video going over windows
phone 8 so earlier today a linked video
hit the web of a Microsoft executive
going over all the brand new features
that are going to be coming in Windows
Phone 8 so this video is originally
meant for carriers for manufacturers
people like Samsung and HTC however it
was late and Microsoft has officially
confirmed it so let's just go over some
of the new features one of the biggest
surprises is that Windows Phone 8 is
going to be heavily based on Windows 8
so this means it's going to have a very
similar kernel and have a lot of the
same features in addition apps that are
made for windows 8 can very very easily
be ported over to Windows Phone 8 this
makes a lot of sense of course with
windows 8 having the new Metro UI which
is very similar to which you will find
on Windows Phone today as well as a lot
of improvements as far as touch screens
and all that kind of stuff goes it just
seems like it's a natural fit how old
are these technical changes are going to
be just that technical and under the
skin so all the current apps that run on
Windows Phone will continue to run going
to be no major changes but there of
course is going to be a lot of under the
hood tweaks this means that several key
upgrades are coming to Windows Phone 8
so it will now be able to support
multicores so of course currently
Windows Phone 7 only supports a single
core CPU however now you'll be able to
get dual core quad core or how many
recorder they decide to fit it all
should work really nicely there's also
going to be support for four different
screen resolutions so currently all
windows phones have a resolution of 480
x 800 certainly not awful but it is
definitely getting a little bit long in
the tooth so now we will get several
more most likely including high
definition resolutions there are also
going to be a lot of brand new features
so this includes a new skype app so it's
still going to be optional so it's not
going to be integrated into the OS or
anything it's going to be very nice to
you of course you want to use skype on
your Windows Phone so the other things
include there's going to be a lot of
integration with Windows 8 so instead of
having to use the clunky zune software
everything will just be integrated so
you can just be able to plug it in and
everything should just work windows
phone 8 will also be using a brand-new
version of internet explorer and I
Explorer 10 mobile now and explore
actually isn't all that bad on Windows
Phone and they're going to be some key
improvements here most notably the fact
that it will actually be able to
compress your data so example some
images and whatnot can I should be
compressed a little bit to help you save
on bandwidth there also will be NFC
support so you'll be able to take your
phone and pay for things and on top of
that also will be able to skin
cameras so for example if you don't like
the standard camera interface you'll be
able to get it skin to however you like
so that's about all we know on Windows
Phone 8 personally I'm actually really
looking forward to this I've been using
Windows Phone 7 for about a month or so
now I've guys say I like it there's a
lot of really cool stuff however not
being able to have a dual core or quad
core processor which you know it's
pretty much what all the major phones
are going to these days on top of only
having one screen resolution across all
the phones they make was a big problem
for me however now they're going to be
fixing both of these as well as getting
some cool windows 8 integration I'm
always looking forward to it so now that
you've heard a little bit about Windows
Phone 8 what do you guys think are you
perhaps interested maybe taking a look
at it maybe switching over from your
current iPhone or Android or Blackberry
or librarians are you making for apps
