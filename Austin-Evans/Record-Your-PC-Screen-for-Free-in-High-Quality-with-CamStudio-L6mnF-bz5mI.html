tutorial showing you how to record your
desktop screen for free so I'm sure a
lot of you guys have seen my screencast
you know I cover all kinds of different
programs browsers etc etc he'll ron
wyden share with you how I do it and
with what program so the name of the
program is camstudio I'm sure a lot of
you have heard of it it's a really
simple free program it's what I use I do
know that there are better things such
as Camtasia however I just like the
simplicity and the freeness if that's a
word I guess the cheapness whatever I
like the fact that scam studio is free
and it works just fine for me so I
figure I'm going to share with you guys
so this first thing is you're going to
go ahead and need to download it so the
link will be a camstudio org I of course
will have it in the description another
two things you're going to need to
download now the first one is going to
be the camstudio 2.0 you can do the beta
but I use the you know just the standard
2.0 it's just fine for me so you can go
ahead and download this you're also
going to need to download the loss looks
lossless codec and I would be right here
at the Exe file basically a lot of
people have camstudio but when you
download and install a lossless codec
that's hard to say it gives you much
much crisper and much more higher
quality video so this one just open up
camstudio and show you how it works i'm
sitting to your very very simple
interface and like i said it's no frills
there's no no there's no anything like
that however it does have the basics
it's got good quality and that's pretty
much all you need so why just give you
guys a little quick tour here and the
file menu you can go ahead and record
pause and the region you can go ahead
and pick you know like how you want to
do it so like right now I'm recording
full screen I can go ahead and do fixed
region where you know maybe I want to
record you know this corner of my
desktop or I can go ahead and just pick
a region and just drag and grab whatever
I like so there's a lot more options I
don't go through everything you can have
it auto pan you can record from your
speakers if I'm going to go ahead and
show you the important thing which is
video options now ordinarily you might
see now of course depending on your
computer you might see more or less here
normally it'll be on Microsoft video 1
that'll be okay
the quote if your computer is not that
powerful this is going to be the way you
want to go I want to go however what you
want to do
which one I'm going to do is select the
gloss list codec that we just downloaded
now that's definitely give you much
higher quality
now not all editors take it just right
so I knew no at least Windows Movie
Maker several others do so you might
have to experiment around but this will
get you the best quality and the
smallest file size okay so that's it for
my tutorial showing you how to record
your desktop screen for free like I said
it's very simple and works just fine so
that's like go ahead and take a look at
it if you maybe want interested in doing
some screencasts for YouTube or maybe
you just want to go ahead and show a
friend of yours or family member a
problem you're having there are a lot of
different reasons why you might need it
so go ahead and take a look</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
