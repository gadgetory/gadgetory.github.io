us
where do you think one III 2014 take a
look at last year's e3 and it was
completely insane so at the
announcements of both the Xbox one as
well as the ps4 the Wii U was still
fairly new there's just tons of stuff
going on now compared to that this year
was a little quieter but there are still
some solid announcements so from
Microsoft we had the new sunset
overdrive which was actually playable on
the show floor a lot of fun and there's
also the new Forza which was a little
bit of a surprise and won the Sony site
I think my biggest surprise was the
destiny the Alpha that kind of just said
oh by the way alphas I'll have fun so
that was cool as well as the order 1886
was also playable on the show floor but
I think the big winner this year was
Nintendo so their booth was almost
entirely dominated by Super Smash
Brothers so they had tons of 3ds and
WiiU demo stations all over the place
they also had some announcements
including the addition of pac-man as
well as being able to use the GameCube
controller on the Wii U both of which
are completely awesome now on top of
that they also had a couple of other
announcements which are still cool
including Mario maker as well as
splatoon but overall I think Nintendo
really nailed it this e3
why do I still have your face on my
lockscreen I think the only way to top
that is to have your unlock sound be hey
guys this is Austin oculus rift or the
sony Morpheus I got to spend some
quality time with the Morpheus this week
if you guys want to see the full video
going over gameplay and demos and all
that kind of stuff you guys can check
that out but the gist of it is I do
prefer oculus right now now that should
be a big surprise there have been
several versions of oculus there have
been completely like updating the
screens and the tracking and all that
kind of stuff
whereas Morpheus is still the very first
version so there's still some things to
be worked out I did think that the
screen was slightly inferior to the
oculus as well as the tracking got a
little bit confused however there's a
lot of time for them to kind of improve
this as Morpheus it's at least a year if
not two years out so it'll be
interesting to see especially if Sony is
able to get some things like actually
being able to make it completely
wireless and kind of get some more
support for some ps4 games it could be
pretty cool but at this very second I do
prefer oculus can you ignore this
question how was your experience at e3
this year with Lamarr Wilson unbox
therapy
Kevin Kenton and others it was a black
so we all had a good time and we also
all filmed a ton of videos so I did one
with Lou as well as one with Kevin and
those are on my channel as well as I did
was it a bunch of videos for everyone
else so I'll actually I'll have a
playlist that's on my channel page or in
the description you guys can go watch
all of the shenanigans that we got up to
e3 but it was a lot of fun
GTA 5 or watchdogs so me along with
pretty much the entire internet was
super hyped up for watchdogs now I
haven't finished the game but I've
played it a decent bit I've gotta say
it's fun but I still prefer GTA 5
something you do with watchdogs just
doesn't have that same kind of soul I
guess of GTA it's really hard to explain
but GTA there's just so much going on
it's such a vibrant interesting world
where's watchdogs there's a lot of stuff
to do it's cool but it doesn't really
quite grab me the same way how do you
say hi to girls come on you guys have
been watching my channel for a long time
you should know the answer to this
question it's always hello ladies this
is Austin as a PC gamer
are you okay with console games running
at 30 frames per second in a perfect
world I would love of all games ran at
60fps at all times however especially on
consoles I'm willing to let it slide for
some games so big open world games
things like third-person shooters things
that aren't quite so you know twitchy
and you need to have like every
millisecond of response time that pretty
much okay with it running as long as
it's a solid locked 30fps
now other games especially like
first-person shooters really do in my
opinion need to be running at 60fps it
makes a huge difference do you think the
GTA 5 PC port will be better optimized
than the gta4 PC port is it worth
pre-ordering after we get a bit more
info you know I'm actually really not
big on pre-ordering games period I mean
sure you might be able to get a few
things like in-game items maybe a little
bit of DLC but for the most part I think
it makes a lot more sense to actually
wait for reviews to come in on the game
so if there's some massive issues like
in watchdogs then it's helpful to not
just pay for it 6 months in advance and
then sitting on a broken copy of the
game that may or may not ever be fixed
anyway big thanks to Ellie from app chat
for helping me film that intro and huge
shout out to Dollar Shave Club for
