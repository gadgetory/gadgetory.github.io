mystery tech time mystery tech tech what
is zu zap a new hey guys this is Austin
and I did not say that right and this is
the January edition of mystery tech
featuring Simba's a news and Buzz
okay so that looks like a normal pair of
over ear headphones are these like fake
over your headphones did you just put
your earbuds in to look cool I can't
possibly imagine why this would ever
make sense
for maximum audio quality on your mobile
device turn off the EQ so she's telling
you to just crank the volume as loud as
humanly possible this is a really bad
idea wait is that bass I hear what this
doesn't work does it hold on hold on
it's kind of echoey though and it's not
that loud you know it sounds like when
you put it in it's like the the trick of
like cupping your hand around like the
speaker of your phone like that's kind
of it sounds like except in headphone
form I do listen to what they sound like
without the headphones on because that's
trippy there's no way it's like that big
of a difference
all right let's reset all those garbage
eq settings just used so these actually
have more bass that I remember it's
definitely a difference putting them in
the zanna's as a little thing or
whatever actually think they do sound
better by themselves anyone want to take
a bet on how much these cost 25 all
right I'm gonna go with 30 whoo $50
matatini yeah don't don't spend $50 on
this just buy a better pair of
headphones mister bleed oh what's up
next
whoo Kimmy on turn your light on whoa
wait what okay whoa
why is it so big okay this is normal
classes for comparison why is that so
enormous oh hello alright what am i
doing I know wait guys change it I have
no idea what any of these things are hey
guys this is Austin and this is the
future of modern technology it's glasses
the light up when you do
so it looks like you can customize it
and have it say whatever you want not
how much of these $70 ooh yeah worth it
very worth it
that's megaraptor why is mega rabjeet
what are you getting Robo Raptor for
well we just did this oh no you did not
get another its Robo spider King no the
joke is funny the first time it was a
little bit playing the second time
there's mildly funny the third time I
mean come on what you hear how loud this
is how much mine is you waste on this oh
it's great it's on sale it's fine right
don't worry about it
yes I agree and I have a mecha Mon yep
whoa okay this is way cool the Robo
rapture whoa there's another one okay
whoa yo okay that's kind of cool that's
kind of cool
oh wait wait no rotate rotate
I'll block it block it
mekka man lost I mean that seems pretty
self-explanatory let's try this on the
floor shall we
oh no we're getting no stop block like
it no yeah shoot it shoot it what I
don't get it about is the smallest thing
in history Tech yet the Jacob so it has
an app in the Google Play Store Windows
Store html5 and it features NFC this is
a Bluetooth ring is this just a ring
with bluetooth and it's got some little
bumps inside and that's it wow there's
literally nothing else here you proposed
already right oh yeah but did you even
try with this how do we get this to work
it says team lift for a reason man what
is this so this is a box from OSI Dex Oh
is there a PC in here
oh I just got much happier all right
let's see what we've got Ken you do not
spend a large amount of company money on
this computer did you no okay
okay well the ring is forgiving this my
friends might be the most over Kell
gaming PC we've ever featured on the
channel so this is a custom config
straight from side acts and we just look
at the water cooling look inside we have
a core I $9.99 hundred K of course
overclock and water-cooled we have a
twenty atti we have the full hard-line
loop 64 gigs of ram oh if you take a
look at the motherboard you'll see the
MSI dragon just constantly kicking ass
good job
this will definitely not be the last
time you see this system on the channel
but let's give a little gaming a try so
you guys probably know battlefield 5 is
not the easiest game to play in the
world however it is one of the only
games right now that does support
ray-tracing
something that this RT X xx hei has
absolutely no problem with even on full
Ultra settings at 1080p we're still in
the 80 to 90 frames per second range
turn a little bit of ray tracing down
and we are way way above a hundred and
with that we undoubtedly have the most
expensive episode of mystery tech ever
can we not top this one I actually don't
like we're good here right we don't need
to spend any more money but this is this
can be like the grand finale why are you
so quiet
