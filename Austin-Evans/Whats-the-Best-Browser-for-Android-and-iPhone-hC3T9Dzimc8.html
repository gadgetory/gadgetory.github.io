a lot of time on the internet on our
phones which browser should you be using
to test I use two of the most powerful
phones out the iPhone 5s along with the
HTC One m8 on the iPhone the default
browser is Safari where on Android the
most common choice is chrome both
browsers are solid however there are a
lot of other options worth checking out
Opera Coast is hands-down the most
unique browser I've ever used it has a
super clean UI that rolls the normal
address bar and surged into one seamless
package Chrome for iPhone on the other
hand is essentially the same browser as
you'll find on Android allowing you to
do things like syncing settings from a
computer move over to Android and we
have opera here we're looking at a much
more conventional browser compared to
coast with features like off-road mode
to help you conserve data when you're
off Wi-Fi another solid option on
Android is Firefox one of the best
features are the add-ons which aren't
something you typically see on mobile
there are plenty of reasons why you
might want to use any of these browsers
but what I want to know is which one is
the fastest to start with we have the
peacekeeper benchmark one of my
favorites as it tests a wide variety of
a browser's performance on Android
Chrome and opera are very close
where Firefox comes in just a little way
behind jump over to the iPhone and
you'll see there's no competition so far
I distances itself from chrome and coast
since Apple forces other apps to use a
slower engine for JavaScript performance
on more complex sites we've got the
octane test on Android again opera and
chrome essentially tie with Firefox
coming in just behind on the iPhone
however Safari absolutely destroys the
others entirely thanks to the nitro
engine another JavaScript test is
SunSpider
and here we see things change up a bit
Firefox on Android pulls out the win
with Chrome and opera coming up right
behind on the iOS front it's the same
story as Safari crushes the benchmark
over twice as quickly as toast where
Chrome wouldn't even complete it
properly jump over to the html5 test
which is essentially how well each
browser supports the rule book of the
Internet and you'll see chrome opera and
Firefox on Android do well we're all
three iOS browsers come in farther back
I know I open my
several times a day so next I tested how
long each app takes to load all six did
well with Firefox and coast taking the
win and operon Android being the slowest
even though it only took a second and a
half if you use an iPhone right now
Safari is the obvious choice however
once iOS 8 comes out all apps will be
able to use the exact same nitro engine
that Safari does meaning performance
should be identical on the Android side
though it's a little more complicated
for a pure performance chrome is the
best choice however both Firefox and
opera aren't too far behind and they
each have features that might push you
over the edge
so which browser do you use definitely
be sure to let me know in the comments
below also I got to do something really
cool recently so I worked with Chris
Pirillo to create an actual ad for the
Lenovo yoga tablet if you guys haven't
seen it yet it's actually a pretty cool
design the tablet itself is super thin
with a battery cylinder on the bottom
they give solid longevity and also
houses a built-in metal kickstand it's
also got an 8 inch screen with good
viewing angles and front-facing stereo
speakers the yoga 8 is a really
interesting unique tablet especially
considering the price if you guys want
to be awesome go check out the full ad
over on Lenovo's channel which I'll have
linked in the description we definitely
did things a little differently anyway
guys thank you so much for watching and
I will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
