getting more and more powerful every
year what's the best phone for gaming to
find out I gathered a few flagships
including the samsung galaxy note 5 LG
g4 oneplus 2 and iphone 6 plus but
screens around 5.5 inches these are all
big phones but that's not a bad thing
when it comes to gaming the oneplus 2
and iPhone have 1080p screens where the
g4 note 5 rocking 1440p displays and
while the extra resolution seems like an
advantage it actually doesn't help for
gaming even consoles usually top out at
1080p so the bigger differences are in
the quality of the displays and while
all four have salt screens that clear
winner is the note 5 the AMOLED display
gives great contrast in excellent colors
this is one of the best screens period
take a look at the specs and on paper
there are some major differences the
iPhone 6 plus has a relatively tame
dual-core processor pair with one
gigabyte of RAM compared to six cores
and three gigs of memory on the LG g4
eight cores and four gigabytes on the
oneplus 2 and an even faster eight core
processor with four gigs of memory on
the note 5 the specs are only part of
the story though to get an idea of how
the phones will handle actual games I
have a pair of benchmarks 3dmark and GFX
bench these run a series of tests that
are more demanding than what you'll find
in most games but are a good way to
measure the limits of the phone in
3dmark you'll see the note pulls out of
solid when with the oneplus 2 putting in
a good showing and the g4 and iPhone
coming surprisingly close move over to
GFX bench which focuses less on CPU and
more on graphics and the note 5 still
does very well but when you factor in
resolution the oneplus 2 an iPhone
actually pull out the wet something else
to consider while gaming is heat when
you look at a gaming PC or console
you'll typically find fans to dissipate
the heat put off by things like the
processor and graphics but phones have
to be passively cooled which means the
temperature is carefully managed this is
where throttling comes in for example
even though the note can run as high as
2.1 gigahertz in 3dmark it spends most
of its time below 1.5 gigahertz with
quite a few dips below 1 gigahertz this
isn't necessarily a bad thing it makes
sense to have a phone that can boost up
too high clock speeds for short periods
like when you're opening a webpage but
that also means that when it comes to
gaming the specs don't tell the whole
story the next and arguably biggest
tests are the actual games badland is
one of those rare ty
that not only looks great but works just
as well on a phone as a console or PC
Lara Croft go is not only a terrific
looking game but again performance just
isn't a problem on these high-end
devices modern combat 5 brings a Call of
Duty like first-person shooter to phones
while the framerate can get choppy on
all devices this is where the 1440p
screens on the note and g4 noticeably
her performance Leo's fortune on the
other hand is a good-looking game that
is absolutely no problem to run on all
four phones
Telltale's Game of Thrones might not
look quite as nice as on console or PC
if it still holds up well on both
Android and iOS PCs are usually where
you'll find MOBAs however vainglory does
a surprisingly good job using just a
touchscreen and the new Android version
looks excellent it shouldn't be a big
surprise that the vast majority of games
are easily playable on today's flagships
but the extra power of the oneplus 2 a
note 5 should make sure that things run
nice and smooth going into the future
one of the bigger differences is
actually the game selection between
Android and iOS games like fallout
shelter came out on the iPhone months
before Android and great titles like
transistor are shared with the ps4 and
PC but not Android and general the
selection tends to be better on iOS
however Android has a big advantage
emulators there are dozens of options
for playing everything from NES to PSP
games and many of them work really well
depending on how into retro gaming you
are this might not be a big deal but
powerful phones like this handle most
emulators no problem to play these games
though you'll probably want a controller
and here Google has you covered many
Bluetooth controllers will work but I
prefer the Nexus player controller it's
made specifically for Android including
back and home buttons and not only do
most emulators work with it but a lot of
Android games do as well you can find
controllers for iPhone as well like the
SteelSeries Stratis but the controllers
are typically pricey and while some
games support them Android tends to have
the edge here there are also the smaller
features like virtual reality support
which I checked out in a video recently
where the screens on the Galaxy s6 and
note 5 really stand out as well as
options like HDMI out to play on a TV
using either a slimport cable on the LG
g4 or the Lightning HDMI adapter on the
iPhone which pair with a controller can
turn your phone into a pretty decent
little game console being by far the
cheapest phone here the oneplus 2
delivers serious horsepower for the
price
and the LG g4 has a great screen with
useful features like a microSD card slot
and the option for HDMI out it's hard to
argue with the game selection on iOS but
at the end of the day the Galaxy Note 5
pairs a great screen with enough power
to handle basically any game on Android
giving it the edge in this one on the
other hand with a new iPhone coming out
soon the comparison might not quite be
so simple time for round 2
also I got to do something really cool
recently HP invited me to be a part of a
commercial for the release of Windows 10
and it was awesome Najee protect you and
your company from today security threats
did he just say security threats I've
done a couple things like this but never
quite on this scale I mean there was a
whole crew there I had a script there
were actors like it was a really legit
thing and I gotta say it was actually
really fun if you guys want to be
awesome go check out the commercial over
on HP's channel which I'll have linked
in the description and let them know
what you think anyway guys thank you so
much for watching and I will catch you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
