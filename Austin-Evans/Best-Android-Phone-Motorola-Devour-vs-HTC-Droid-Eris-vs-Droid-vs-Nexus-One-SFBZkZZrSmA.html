today I'm here with an Android showdown
that's been over a year and a half in
the making I'm going to be comparing the
absolute best Android phones that you
can buy on the market today I'm going to
go over four of them want to go over the
Motorola Devourer I'm going to go over
the HTC Droid heiress the Motorola Droid
and of course the Google Nexus One one
should go over all four of these majors
Android smartphones I want to tell you
guys about the prices the features what
versions are running and special little
things about them all on go it all over
it all and tell you guys what I think
anyway let's get this one started
okay so let's begin with the Motorola
devourer this is the newest Android
phone is just come out for Verizon
Wireless and really to sum it up in just
one sentence it's like a aluminum
smaller Motorola Droid it's it's it's
like that one of the major differences
is that it's a little bit of a lower
spec phone you know instead of running
full Android 2.0 actually runs 1.6 but
there is a reason for that it actually
has the moto blower interface now if you
don't know what the motoblur interface
is it's Motorola's special skinned
version of Android so basically it runs
Android but on top of it you'll see a
lot of different things such as like
status updates for all kinds of social
networking and a lot of different uh you
know custom touches nothing like
something like the Droid or the Nexus
One both of which this one's stock
Android you actually you get the phone
but it might take a while for them to
get updates if you get updates at all
but that said the motoblur interface has
some putting these nice things and for a
lot of people it's pretty heinous
motorola devourer does run on some lower
specs than the droid it's got a similar
form factor with the slide-out keyboard
but it runs a slower processor less ram
and a worse camera as well as a three
point one inch touchscreen which is
smaller than the 3.7 inch that you will
find on the droid now it's not meant as
you know something the next version of
the droid is meant more as like a scale
back the smaller version and that's okay
but the problem is there's really not a
whole lot of reason to buy it compared
to the droid they both technically if
you look at Verizon at stores that
prices are different but generally on
the you know a normal price like on
Amazon to buy it
both of them are fifty dollars with a
two year contract Verizon so between the
two it's kind of hard to you know pick
the Devourer when you got the droid but
you know if you really do like the
motoblur on her face it's still pretty
strong especially for $50
you might want to take a look at it so
the next Android smartphone we're going
to cover is going to be the HTC Droid
heiress from Verizon Wireless now right
off the bat I've got to mention that
this is kind of one of like the older
generation of Android smartphones if you
know the HTC Hero that came out last
summer I believe that was the you know
the cutting-edge Android smartphone you
can get back then well this is basically
a very very similar version of it
they've just basically reward the shell
looks a little bit different and it
obviously runs on Verizon Wireless so if
you know the hero you're gonna know that
this is very very similar it runs
Android 1.5 which is a pretty old
version of Android you know you're
missing a few features but it does come
with the custom HTC Sense interface i
got'em it per my just speaking from
personal preference I really like the
HTC Sense interface it really looks good
it looks very modern you have the the
clock you're able to run a lot of
different programs such as like a
customizable interface slight social
networking all kinds of stuff and it's
totally customizable which is pretty
cool for one of the really most
important things about this phone is the
price it is free on a two-year contract
from Rison that's unheard of this is the
very first Android smartphone that is
actually being offered for free and
that's pretty good considering that you
know if you look at this compared to you
know like some little flip phone or
something I mean this is going to win by
a mile so that alone really just puts it
in the lead by itself of course you know
if you look at it compared to the Nexus
One which is probably the closest phone
similar to it because both of them do
not have the physical keyboards then you
know the Nexus One it's gonna you know
totally blow it away it's fast or new or
sleeker all kind of stuff but the Nexus
One runs you almost of two hundred
dollars whereas this is free and now
that's a pretty major factor so buy that
by itself really puts the HTC Droid
arish does really good job so if you're
looking for a cheap basically free
Android smartphone and you cannot go
wrong with the HTC Droid Eris okay so
the third Android smartphone that I will
be covering today
it's got to be the motorola droid the
motorola droid I'm sure there's really
one of the major phones that pushed
Android and - you know everyone knowing
about it
you know before it's just like iPhone
Blackberry and you know there's this
thing called Android
well then also and Verizon spend like
millions and billions of dollars on all
these really cool ads like Droid does
and all kind of stuff and something
really androids taken off
so obviously the end motorola droids
that really saw the phone and you know
it's really taken off if you look at it
it's a pretty thin device it's almost
better than the iPhone I believe and it
sports a 3.7 inch capacitive multi-touch
screen as well as if you flip it out a
full keyboard underneath the keyboard is
not actually amazing it's it's okay but
it can kind of be a little flat and you
know not that great but if you like you
know obviously a lot of people myself
included prefer a actual hardware
keyboard so if you're looking for a
hardware keyboard that's great and it
works pretty decent now one of the major
things especially when it was first
released was the fact that it ran
Android 2.0 which brought over a lot of
new features that's still the case it
has not got an updated as of yet
although it will be updated soon and the
main reason is that is that it does not
run any kind of custom Android scan or
anything like that which would cause the
updates to come slowly pretty much as
soon as an update comes out you can get
on the droid fairly quickly so I would
definitely expect that you will see the
droid being updated constantly for quite
a while to come the droid is a really
really good phone I've got to admit it's
probably one of if not the absolute best
phone in my opinion on the market today
the one big deal about it though right
now it is actually down to $50 as the
two-year contract also from Verizon
Wireless and for $50 this is a lot of
phone I know the iPhone know you also
have the Nexus One you know those three
is what was the palm
the Palm Pre Plus all four of those
phones are really solid but the Droid
gives you something that really none of
them can really put together it's got
the great combination of Android a
really nice sized high resolution screen
and a really good keyboard so put it all
together and the drawer does a really
solid package so lastly but certainly
not least we have the Google Nexus One
which is built by HTC but that's a
different story the Nexus One really is
the top Android smartphone right now now
the Droid is great don't get me wrong
but the but the next one really just
step-step notch it runs the latest
version of Android 2.1 but it also has a
lot of really killer features it's very
very very thin what it then is in the
iPhone it has a full 3.7 inch color
multi-touch touchscreen the whole works
and it's running at a very very high
resolution so the screen on just looks
excellent it but the probably the
biggest deal about the Nexus One is the
fact that runs a Snapdragon processor
the Snapdragon is a very very very fast
processor you know running close to 2
times faster than a lot of others so for
it to be running like that the Nexus One
is very snappy and it really moves
really fast so that alone really puts
the Nexus One very high but it's just a
very good looking device - and the fact
that runs the newest version of Android
and you know it just put it all together
it is the top Android phone right now so
it's hard to argue with it it does run
on t-mobile at the moment and it will be
$180 if you are a new t-mobile customer
with a two-year contract you can also
buy it unlocked for I'll leave little
bit less than $600 but if I were you if
you don't like to mobile it will be
coming to Verizon here sometime in the
spring so if you like to get Verizon you
should be able to pick it up as well as
AT&amp;amp;T should be coming so pretty much if
you want that because one before long
you should be able to get on three of
the four main carriers so that's a
pretty good deal and so you should be
the Nexus 1 so that is the Android
smartphone showdown there's four really
good phones and you know you could get
to pick any of them if you wanted to but
in my opinion it really comes down to
three the Droid heiress is great and
it's free okay you just can't understate
that that's it's great deal as a really
solid phone the Droid is only fifty
dollars and if you really need a
keyboard and you want to want a solid
phone you know you've got to put a high
on your list if the keyboard doesn't
matter to you too much and you don't
mind it either waiting a little while
for to come out on Verizon or going
ahead picking it up on t-mobile right
now it will run you $180 but the Nexus
One is absolutely a very very solid bone
and it's really the cutting edge right
now
so really it's it pretty much comes down
to what you think to be honest I like
both - I like them all really but it's
pretty much all down to you so whatever
ends with smart phone you want it's
really hard to go wrong anyway thanks
