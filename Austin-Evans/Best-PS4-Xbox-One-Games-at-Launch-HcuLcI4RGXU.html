here with the best launch games for the
PlayStation 4 and Xbox one
so both consoles are only a few months
away so let's see exactly which games
you should be picking up on day one
starting with the PlayStation 4
we have driveclub which is a racing game
that leans more toward Gran Turismo than
burnout it's a very social sort of game
with a big emphasis on multiplayer as
well as being able to beat your friends
times on various tracks there will also
be a special edition of Drive Club
that's free for PlayStation Plus
subscribers which cuts a few cars and
tracks but still gives you a good chunk
of the game for free Killzone Shadowfall
is another ps4 exclusive which continues
the story from Killzone 3 you're thrown
into the middle of a civil war and
Killzone does a good job of showing off
the huge maps and graphical horsepower
of the PlayStation like most first
person shooters there's also a
multiplayer mode and in shadow fall you
can customize a lot of what you do in
your online matches NAG is a much more
charming game with an almost cartoony
style you play as knack who can change
his form to help repel the goblin
invasion it plays from the top down
where you fight the goblins and even do
a bit of platforming and puzzle solving
it's one of the few new games that looks
like fun for kids and adults alike
moving on to Xbox one exclusives
we have Dead Rising 3 this is a huge
open world zombie game that drops low
times and features absolutely massive
amounts of zombies on screen at once the
crafting system from the previous games
has been brought over giving you lots of
fun weapons and even allows you to use
Kinect to shout to distract zombies
Forza Motorsport 5 continues to be one
of the best racing simulators on the
Xbox with excellent graphics and
hundreds of cars new and old including
open-wheel racers in addition to a large
single-player campaign there's also of
course multiplayer including an
interactive ghost mode that analyzes you
and your friends driving styles so you
can race against each other even if you
aren't at your console Ryse son of Rome
is one of the best looking next-gen
console titles yet thanks to Crytek you
play as a Roman general who fights
through hordes of enemies
it's a third-person game somewhat
similar to God of War with an emphasis
on QuickTime events however the addition
of controlling an army should make it a
lot of fun you can even use Kinect to
shout out commands to your soldiers so
these are some of the exclusive games
coming to the ps4 and Xbox
one however now let's take a look at
some of the games that you can play
regardless of which console you're
picking up watchdogs is absolutely one
of my most hyped games of this year it's
an open-world game like Grand Theft Auto
set in the future Chicago where you can
hack anything and everything the
graphics are fantastic and there are
lots of cool stealth sequences to get
around fighting by hacking lights and
much much more
battlefield 4 takes everything about the
last game and cranks it up to 11 it's
still of course a first-person shooter
however with the extra power of the new
consoles everything from the maps to the
amount of enemies on screen has gotten
way bigger destructible environments are
back in full force as are the huge
variety of weapons and vehicles to play
with it wouldn't be a new console launch
without a new Call of Duty and ghosts
brings us exactly that as an all-new
series it's set in the future where the
US has fallen but it's protected by yep
you guessed it the ghosts multiplayer
has also been majorly revamped
with character customization dynamic
mattes and the ability to lean and slide
around corners an assassin's creed 4
black flag you take control of an
assassin back in the pirate days it's
more of an open world style game with
bigger mats allowing me to get into all
kinds of trouble on your own in addition
to the main story you of course get to
pilot a ship again in this one and a lot
of the controls and gameplay dynamics
have been tightened up that's not all
games like Minecraft Need for Speed FIFA
and Madden will also be available on the
next-gen consoles at launch and some
other games including infamous second
son and halo will be available next year
so I'm interested to know what do you

next-gen consoles definitely be sure to
let me know what games you're picking up
