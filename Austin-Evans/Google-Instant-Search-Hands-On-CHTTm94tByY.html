of Google Instant Search so this is a
really cool thing the Google just got
finished announcing this at their San
Francisco event something go ahead and
show you guys how it works so let's go
ahead just search for something let's go
for YouTube I'll go ahead and start
typing in YouTube and as you can see
here there we go there's Yahoo and hit
oh and there we go that's YouTube so
basically it automatically loads the
autocomplete so as you can see obviously
there's an autocomplete where you know
you always see it when you're typing in
searches but now it actually as you're
typing it automatically picks it out so
for example YouTube is the second most
popular search with those starts with a
letter Y so as soon as I hit Y it
automatically started loading the search
so I didn't have to do anything I typed
in two letters and I'm already here
where I am let's try it again let's go
ahead and go for like Wikipedia so there
we go again two letters Wikipedia I'm
already here and I can do whatever I
want so guys this that's pretty much it
Google Instant Search is very very cool
it really I love how you know Google is
my favorite search engine by far I
always use it in the first place but
what this is just even better and it
really does work quite fast so if you're
interested in going ahead and turning on
instant search basically go ahead check
out I have a link in the description
where you can go ahead and opt-in now
currently this supports all major
browsers with the exception of opera but
I'm sure they'll add that soon and then
it also is a mobile version which should
be coming fairly soon as well so
definitely good news</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
