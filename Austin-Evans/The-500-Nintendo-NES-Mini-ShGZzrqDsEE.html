classic and for about 60 bucks it's
probably the best way of playing
old-school Nintendo game or is it
because what I have in front of me right
here is a $500 in yet this is the into
mini and when analog offered to send it
out I couldn't say no this is too much
the exact opposite of what the NES
classic is is this is a serious piece of
machinery the first thing that jumped
out to me is just how solid it there's
nothing wrong with the NES classic I
really do think this is a nice little
design but it's pretty much plastic and
if you open one of these things up
there's not a whole lot going on inside
whereas this is sort of the ultimate
mint to know they have gone all out
inside the box we have the NES 38 video
controller now that I should already
done a video on this a few months ago
and I really liked it not only is it
Wireless so you can use this little
adapter to be able to plug it straight
into the original NES card slot but
besides that it feels almost completely
identical to an original NES controller
I also have a ton of power bricks and
adaptive short different country as well
as some extra cables so right here we
have HDMI just like the NES classic you
can connect this to a modern TV via HDMI
go over because these guys are
completely crazy we also have VGA
components s-video and composite options
because reason they really went all out
with this so there's support for the
Famicom mic attachment as well as the
Famicom audio you also have a USB port
for charging the controller around the
side you can upgrade the firmware via SD
card what wait what oh I didn't even
realize the bottom is like plus a glass
I kind of want to open this up just see
what's inside what's interesting about
this unlike the NES classic is that
while this supports software emulation
so it's essentially running like a low
powered smartphone chip to be able to do
all of emulation this is running on an
FPGA which is essentially the original
hardware from the NES now they're really
proud about the idea it pretty much has
no lag when you're playing games now
it's not exactly like there's a lot of
lag when you're playing on the NES
classic but these guys have really gone
above and beyond to make the most
authentic experience possible the build
quality of this thing is stupid good not
only is a real aluminum
but with that acrylic window and they
just look so over the top with this when
you think about it Danny s is over 30
years old at this point and these guys
engineer essentially the ultimate
version for 2017 now one of the other
big advantages over the classic is well
this come in with 30 games this doesn't
come with any but you actually do have
the full NES card slot as well as for
the Famicom so you ready to play game
you scrap an original NES cart and it
clicks right in and that's going to chit
this is ready to play once you get to NT
mini setup it's pretty much an NES but
there are a few options so there's a
small menu here and we have a few
options like running the actual game but
a lot of the interesting stuff is in
settings so if you go into videos they
have an insane number of options so not
only can we pick whatever kind of
resolution we want we can also go and
exactly change the height to position
the width I mean they even have all the
things for like scanlines rights if you
want to 3 for x original like this is
way way more than they want to actually
need so undoing the sort of basic way of
playing right now which is using HDMI
it's easy to get set up but if you're
really hardcore with this you can use
stuff like VGA out to really sort of get
that analog input oh look at that look
at that kirbymastah right now if you're
a hardcore Nintendo fan yeah you'll
probably appreciate some of these
differences and I do think that the
ability to play all of your original NES
games and not just those few that
actually come on the NES classic is cool
but this is for hardcore people this is
for people who want to spend $500 on the
ultimate end yet it is crazy that this
even exists at all so no I'm not going
to sit here and tell you that you should
spend $500 on a Nintendo however I think
anyone can appreciate the crazy level of
detail that makes this even exist in
2017 so what do you guys think about the
NT mini let me know in the comments
below and I will catch you on the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
