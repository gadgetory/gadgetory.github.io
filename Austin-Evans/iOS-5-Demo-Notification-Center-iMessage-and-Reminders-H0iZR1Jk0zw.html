dental of iOS 5 now iOS 5 is of course
the latest version of the iphone ipod
touch and ipad operating system so let's
go over some of the things that are new
now probably the first and most
important thing is the new notification
so of course if you guys remember before
used to be the little blue pop ups and
you know they want awful but they really
want great but now if you swipe down
from the status bar you will see that
there is a new kind of drop down menu
very very similar to android so the way
it works is you have a couple of widgets
so for example here stocks in here is
your weather and on top of that any
notifications that comment will be
listed here so for example have a
reminder that i need to make this video
just kind of a test and if I want to I
can tap on that and it will bring us
over to the application it's pretty
decent it's not fantastic um you know it
would be nice especially you could add
custom widgets not that kind of stuff
but overall especially we have lots of
notifications it's easy just to swipe
and it works really quite nicely the
next app is going to be I messages now I
messages is kind of like a BBM for
iphone what allows you to do is send and
receive free text messages and they're
not actual text messages there's
transmitted over Wi-Fi or data and they
are available as well as on the ipod
touch ipad as well as of course the
iphone now the way it works is very
simple so as you guys can see here you
can add contacts so if you have the
person's phone number who you know is on
iOS 5 and has an iphone you can send it
to them or if you have someone with an
ipod touch and ipad you can use their
Apple email address so i was pretty
nicely you can add to contacts and all
that kind of stuff in the way that works
is very similar to FaceTime so the way
it works you guys can see here you can
scroll through your messages but want to
send a message I can certainly just type
out whatever I like I can also click
click on the little button here I can
send a picture so if I wanted to send
tie a picture whatever I certainly could
do that another nice new feature is the
additions to the camera so from the last
one we can double tap and click the
little camera icon as you guys will see
here we do have the camera open and
working so it works pretty simply to go
ahead and rotate it here so you can take
a picture just as before however there's
a new options so if I open this up here
if you have an iPhone 4 and HDR mode
will be appear here where you can you
toggle it on and off you also have a
grid mode where you can kind of help
Center your shots that have a little
grid on the screen I know on top of that
if I flip my ipod touch over here you
can now take a picture with the volume
buttons so if I click on their yeah we
can take a picture I like that I think
it'll work a lot better on the iphone
than the ipod since it's a little
awkward to hold it like that but no big
deal and it definitely is very nice to
have an actual physical button now you
guys may or may not have noticed but
i'll show off the camera app and open it
back up it's a lot faster which is good
the camera app used to be awful it's
still not blazing fast and sure be
faster on the 4s but it is a nice
improvement there are a couple things we
can do with the picture so as you guys
can see here there are a few options
such as emailing it sending it as a
message using as a wallpaper and
tweeting it and i get into the Twitter
integration in a second there's also a
new editing functions so for example we
can want to rotate the picture which
shouldn't really be necessary but if you
want to you can do that there's also an
automatic resampling mode auto enhance
where you want to call it which will
just kind of mess with the contrast and
the saturation all that kind of stuff if
you like I'm going to turn that off also
you can do red eyes so we want to pick
some red eyes of course I don't have me
in this picture but you can do that all
from the device and last what we do have
props so we want we can crop into one
angle and do that so the camera app is
definitely received a pretty nice
overhaul on pretty please with the a des
were really quite nicely the next appt
is reminders reminders is pretty similar
to several other iOS apps however of
course this one does come pre built and
it works pretty really quite nicely so
we want to create a new reminder here we
can say oh I don't know upload video
it's kind of hard to type the upload
video hit return and they're real which
so we're done and if we want we can open
up here we can have it remind us to send
us a push notification oh I don't know
in 10 minutes so we can do whatever we
want and also show more new priority
some notes and of course to leave
another a nice addition is the Twitter
integration so if you come to the
settings and you open up the Twitter
part you can now install the official
twitter app straight from here as well
as add your contact the way it works is
you guys can see sure you actually add
your contact now your i rather your
twitter information your login you add
to iOS 5 and then from there you can
enable for example Safari and Twitter
and all that kind of subtext
use your account so if we open up safari
here and if you gets a little demo so
click the button here we cannot tweet it
so let's say we're reading an article
you're seeing something you want tweets
to go hey check this out and I can't
type very well up here but yeah so it
works really quite nicely and the
Twitter integration is in many many
places around the operating system
including Safari the Photos app and
several other places there are also some
updates to help you just use the
operating system better so for example
take this little thing if you have a
name for your device which I'm sure you
do you can now change it from on the
device which is nice so in you you name
it like I do based on what firm works on
and it changed this firm where you can
sit and really easily do that top of
that there is now wireless updates so
looks like for example iOS 5.0 point one
comes out tomorrow I could just open up
the software update you would
automatically download it and I would be
good to go instead of having to plug
into itunes and updating all that kind
of stuff lastly but certainly not least
there is the iTunes Wi-Fi sync now of
course if you guys have been jailbroken
you know that there is a similar tweets
been around for quite a while however
now you don't even have to jailbreak you
can just simply long to your devices
plugged in and your it's on the same
Wi-Fi network as your computer that you
want to sync it with you can out do it
wirelessly lastly there is the new
newsstand so did you guys can see here
it almost works look like folders but
instead you'll be able to download
magazines and newspapers and that kind
of thing from the app store it's not
currently enabled hold by the time you
guys watch this video you'll be able to
you know do magazine subscriptions and
all that kind of stuff anyway guys it's
going to be about it for my demo of iOS
5 overall to look pretty solid update
and of course it is free for everyone on
ipod touch 3rd generation ipod touch 4th
generation is compatible with the iphone
3gs the iphone for the ipad 1 as well as
the ipad 2 and obviously will be coming
will be shipping with you what new white
ipod touches as well as the iphone 4s
