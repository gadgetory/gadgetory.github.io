hear the review of the Nikon d3200
with 24 megapixels in 1080p video with
full manual control all in a small
package this has a lot going for it but
is it worth it over the d30 100 or d50
100 taking a look around the d3 200 you
can see that it looks very similar to
its predecessor I've already done a full
comparison between the two cameras if
you want to check that out but the gist
of it is you can expect solid ergonomics
and build quality as you would expect
with a Nikon DSLR it's still made
entirely out of plastic and it's not
weather sealed like the d7000 by
considering the much cheaper price tag
it's not a surprise and just still hold
up fine with normal usage around back as
the new 3-inch 921,000 dot LCD which
matches the resolution on the 3.2 inch
screens on the d4 and the d800 this is a
huge help when shooting in life you
because manual focus is much easier with
the added clarity there's also a new
accessory you can pick out which will
give the camera Wi-Fi capability for
transferring pictures and video as well
as letting you control the camera from
your smartphone probably the most
important part of any DSLR is the image
quality and the D 3200 definitely
doesn't disappoint here with 24
megapixels at your disposal you have a
lot of room for cropping images which
gives you a lot of extra freedom in
addition it also works for allowing you
to change your framing after the fact a
lot losing precious resolution I really
found myself enjoying shooting with the
D 3200 because of this being able to
resolve that much detail really is
impressive for a $700 camera a lot of
people complain when the d3200 was
announced that having so many megapixels
would compromise the low-light
capability but overall iso performance
is very similar to the d 3100 noise is
hardly distinguishable up to iso 400 and
even moving up to 800 noise is still
fairly well maintained ISO 1600 was
about as high as I felt comfortable
shooting here noise is fairly visible
even without cropping and colors and
detail begin to fade just a bit but the
files are still usable 3200 doesn't lose
too much more detail but noise is more
prevalent and 6400 is really only good
for resizing the photos down for web use
you can't expand the ISO to 12,800 but
well don't do that if you don't have to
wear the D 3200 really shines as in
video mode I shoot hours the video on a
DSLR a week and I've been very pleased
with the D 3200 you choose 1080p video
at 30 frames per second or 720p at 60
frames in h.264 at around
21 megabits per second at 1080p as you
would expect video looks really quite
nice from the aps-c sensor with good
depth of field and great color the kit
lens works fine here although I do most
of my shooting with prime lenses which
will definitely give you better results
all right so I'm now recording using the
Nikon G 3200 so this is pretty much
totally stock I'm using the 1855
millimeter kit lens and I'm also using
the built-in microphone which I might
add is actually not half bad at all so
one of the greatest things about the D
3200 is that you can manually adjust
your video super example while I'm
recording I can go up to ISO 400 or 800
and I'll still go ahead and adjust my
shutter speed to kind of compensate for
that and again bring the ISO back down
change the shutter speed all that kind
of good stuff is very very easy to do
while recording on top of that it also
does have auto focus during video modes
so if I half press the shutter C it
should auto focus on the grass and then
you can use the d-pad on the back of the
camera to just exactly where you want to
focus and get one half press one more
time it'll just quite right here it's
not quite the best especially with the
kit lens but there we go so pretty
decent job there now the autofocus isn't
great it's definitely nice to have but
as you can hear it's a little bit loud
and you since you have to half press the
shutter each time it's not going to be
continuous the D 3200 also has a
microphone jack which is helpful when
you're out on a shoot although I
personally prefer to use external audio
it is a nice option have a very nice
feature is that you can manually adjust
your audio levels as well as display
your levels on screen as you record with
full manual control over the 1080p video
audio in width level adjustment and the
low-light performance and depth of field
this is one of the strongest Nikon
cameras for video to date overall the
Nikon d3200 is an excellent DSLR and a
considerable improvement over the
already great D 3100 the megapixel count
is second only to the d800 and a Nikon
range a camera that cost four times as
much
ISO performance is reasonable bill
quality is top-notch and the video mode
is a massive improvement for $700 I can
safely recommend this to anyone who's
looking for an entry-level DSLR the
stands right up there with the Canon t3i
interested in more coverage of the d3
200 feel free to check out my unboxing
as well as the comparison with the D
3100 if you enjoyed definitely be sure
