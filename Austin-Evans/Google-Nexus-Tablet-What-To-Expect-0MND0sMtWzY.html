the video going over the Google Nexus
tablet of course ahead of a holiday
android tablet so far probably the most
successful has been the amazon kindle
fire and considering the amazon pretty
much stripped all the Google out of
Android I don't think they're all that
happy about it so today we're going to
be talking about Google's answer to all
this the Nexus tablet earlier this year
at CES I was at the press conference
when it suits announced the ipad Nemo
370 T this is a quad-core tablet with a
7-inch screen and a price of only two
hundred forty nine dollars over it seems
that google and asus we've gotten
together and said to cancel the epad and
instead turn it into the nexus tablet
most of the specially carryover from the
mimo including the nvidia tegra 3
quad-core processor which is in many of
the most powerful android phones and
tablets right now as well as a 7-inch
display front and rear facing cameras as
well as only a Wi-Fi model major
difference however is going to eat price
two of the major competitors are going
to be the amazon kindle fire as well as
the blackberry playbook both of which
are currently selling for two hundred
dollars even surprised me whatsoever of
google's able / the price down to two
hundred dollars perhaps by offering only
eight new bites of storage without an
expandable microSD card slot one of the
major benefits of going with the Nexus
tablet is the fact that's going to have
a pure start version of Android so you
have to worry about skins blow wear
anything like that and on top of that
Google usually updates the Nexus devices
with firmware updates first the Nexus
tablet is expected to be announced at
Google i/o in June and most likely go on
sale sometime in the middle of July so
what do you think would you be
interested in the nexus tablet for two
hundred dollars doesn't be sure to let
me know in the comments if you enjoyed
this video definitely be sure to leave
it a thumbs up really appreciate it
helps me out a lot and if you're new to
the channel you want see more videos
like this be sure to subscribe play and
a price of $249 however it seems that
Google's actually got together with a
suit with this is pressed by offering
only 8 gigabytes of storage with a
microSD example example what two of the
major competitors are going to be the
amazon kindle fire as well as the
blackberry playbook and both of these
are two hundred dollars so it wouldn't
surprise me whatsoever of Apple Apple
quad-core processor 7-inch display as
well as probably only Wi-Fi what am I
talking about</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
