computer you may find compatibility
issues with the following parts list
today in view of my next computer build
video this time at the $1400 price point
at this price you'll be getting a sul
computer for doing almost anything
however do keep in mind that unlike
previous builds I built this computer to
my specific needs so you may want to
make some changes depending on what you
plan on doing with the computer to begin
with we have the Intel Core i7 2670 CPUs
available right now this makes a
fantastic starting point for our build
it features 4 physical cores with
hyper-threading clocked 3.4 gigahertz
stock and can be overclocked very easily
my build is at 4 gigahertz but nothing
at all is stopping you from going much
higher this will run you 315 dollars to
help us get a nice overclock we will be
using the cooler master hyper 212 + CPU
cooler with a 120 millimeter fan that
comes with it and an optional second fan
for push-pull airflow on the massive
heatsink this keeps the CPU nice and
cool for $40 for a motherboard I chose
the gigabyte z68 X UD 3p as one of the
new z68 boards that you'll find some new
features including support for SSD
caching dual BIOS plenty of SATA 3 and
USB 3 connections and gigabytes very
solid build quality with support for
both crossfire and sli graphics
configurations this will run you $170
moving on to the graphics card I chosen
as soos Radeon 6850 well you absolutely
could go for something with a bit more
punch like a 69 fifty or sixty nine
seventy here I found that the 6850 can
handle most games available today such
as Starcraft 2 Battlefield Bad Company 2
and Just Cause two maxed out at 1080p
without a problem with full support for
DirectX 11 a pair of DVI ports along
with display at HDMI and a reasonable
price of $150 after rebate this is a
solid card for memory we'll be using a
gigabytes of Corsair Vengeance Ram
running in dual channel this memory is
clocked at 1600 megahertz which is about
the sweet spot for RAM on the Sandy
Bridge platform the only downside to
this memory is that the heat sinks are
rather large
making it very difficult to mount a
second fan to the CPU cooler other than
that this is solid for $85 storage is
more than taken care of by an ocz vertex
three 120-year bytes solid-state drive
as one of the best current solid-state
drives for
you'll find stellar read and write
speeds across the board with this
letting windows booting around 10
seconds and even memory hungry
applications such as Photoshop load
extremely quickly at $270 currently this
will do a lot to keep your computer
speeding since 120 gigabytes really
isn't enough for most people we'll be
using a high tachi 2 terabyte hard drive
to supplement the solid-state drive even
though you should mainly use this for
documents music and videos you'll find
that it's really quite fast in its own
right for $80 while a DVD burner
certainly isn't necessary these days on
a bill like this there's no reason not
to include one for 21 dollars a light
yon drive will do just fine for the case
I chose the Kula Master half 9:12 while
certainly not an expensive case by any
means it offers a lot of solid features
including plenty of room for installing
additional fans easy access to the dust
filters for cleaning an expensive
interior for lots of hard drives
graphics cards as well as a cage for
installing a pair of 2.5 inch hard
drives on the bottom of the case if you
have to have LEDs and huge windows by
all means pick a different case but if
you want to add something that still
looks good but it's quite a bit more
understated I highly recommend a half
9:12 for $50 after rebate with a
higher-end vil like this you don't want
to skimp on the power supply so today
we'll be using the corsair TX 750 horse
a typically makes very high quality
power supplies and with the TX 750 you
will get 750 watts of power for a
reasonable price allowing you to
overclock add extra hard drives or even
upgrade or add additional graphics cards
without needing to worry about power
issues for $100 lastly we have a system
builders copy of Windows 7 home premium
of course if you like you could install
Linux or a copy of Windows you already
have but otherwise this will run you $90
so how much damage did we do as of June
15th 2011 on newegg.com
the entire parts list will run you 1390
dollars and 88 cents after all rebates
for the price you'll be getting a
fantastic computer for gaming video
editing and just about anything else you
need to do after using this computer for
the past few weeks I've got to say I'm
very pleased with just about everything
about it but of course feel free to
customize it to your own liking if you
