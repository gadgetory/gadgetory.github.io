here with the tutorial on how to build a
gaming computer this is based on my 600
hour mini ITX PC inside the BitFenix
prodigy however most of this applies to
building any computer if you're
interested in learning why parts I use
to feel free to check out my build
guides before we begin you should find a
workspace on tile or wood floors to help
prevent static electricity from building
up touching the case is a great idea to
discharge any static as far as tools go
all you really need is a phillips
screwdriver
building a pc is very simple and most of
the time you can even use thumb screws
first step is to prepare the case which
here is a bit phoenix prodigy on the
right side you'll see the power and
reset buttons headphone and microphone
jacks along the pair of USB 3.0 ports
around back is a 120 millimeter fan your
motherboard tray slots where the
graphics card will reside and the power
supply start by removing the four thumb
screws on the back you'll find one top
and bottom on the left side one on the
bottom right and finally one on the top
right now remove the left side panel by
pulling it back and then off then set it
aside for later then do the same for the
right side panel to free up some room to
work on the case inside you'll see a box
which contains screws to set that aside
for now before working in the case we
need to remove the center drive cage by
pressing on the tab so we have room to
install the graphics card set the case
aside for a minute and grab the
motherboard inside the box you'll find a
pair of SATA cables for connecting a
hard drive or optical drive the i/o
shield for mounting the motherboard a
drivers DVD and case badge in the manual
which will be helpful in a few minutes
the motherboard itself is sensitive to
static and is wrapped in an anti-static
bag gently pull it out by handling it by
the plastic components and then set it
down on the box the motherboard comes in
this is how we'll be working on until
its installed in the case before we get
to work let me take a minute and go over
a few important things to pay attention
to around back you'll find all of your
ports including USB Ethernet and audio
out which will be sticking out the back
of the case when we're done you'll see a
pair of long blue connectors which is
where your RAM will be installed on one
side you'll be able to press the white
clips back so that we are all ready to
install the memory
the bottom of the board is where you'll
find the long darker blue connector this
is PCI Express which is what we'll be
using to connect the graphics card in a
few minutes
beside the heatsink with the assist logo
are six SATA ports these can be used for
many things but for this bill we're just
going to be using a single port for the
hard drive one thing to keep in mind is
that the white ports are going to be
what you'll use if you have an SSD as
they're faster than the blue port
in the center of the board is where the
CPU is installed and it should have a
plastic cover protecting the socket for
now now it's time to open up the
processor in this case a core i3 inside
the box you'll find the heatsink and fan
which has pre applied thermal paste on
the bottom be sure not to touch this
there's also a bit of info on the CPU as
well as a core i3 case badge if you want
to use it the CPU itself is inside the
cardboard and protect it inside a bit of
plastic before removing it keep in mind
that there are tiny gold pins on the
bottom and you do not want to touch
these at all come over to the
motherboard and remove the cover by
pulling on the tab labeled remove then
push the arm to the side to get access
to the socket grab the CPU by the edges
and just rest it into the socket don't
press it in at all it should fit by
itself there's a small golden arrow on
the edge which will make sure you will
line up properly set the cover back down
and push the arm down to hold it into
place you'll have to put a lot of
pressure on it but don't worry this is
normal time to install the heatsink just
align the four pegs over the holes in
the motherboard and press each down
until they click once you're done you
can now pick up the motherboard by the
heatsink without any worries installing
your RAM is up next you'll find a notch
in the memory as well as in the slot on
the motherboard so it only goes in one
way
line it up with a thumb on each corner
and press firmly until it clicks into
place grab the second down line it up
and salt the same way super easi stuff
now it's time to install the assembled
motherboard into the case the prodigy
mounts at lying flat on top of the four
built-in standoffs
first grab your i/o shield that came
with the motherboard and pop it into the
back panel press firmly until it snaps
into place and don't worry you'll
probably need a minute to get it popped
in correctly handling the motherboard by
the heatsink carefully align it over the
four standoffs against the back of the
i/o shield gently shift the motherboard
back so that all the ports are clear
make sure the little metal pins are
touching and that each and every port is
lined up now grab the box of hardware we
pulled out of the case earlier and
you'll see a bag of screws open it up
and find for the smaller screws if you
aren't sure which to use the prodigy
manual shows the exact design now let's
create a motherboard into place the best
way to do it is to start with one corner
and tighten it moderately but not all
the way and then go to the opposite
corner and do the same I'll double
checking that it's still in the correct
spot and everything is visible out the
i/o shield then go back and screw the
last two screws into place once you're
done everything looks good tighten each
screw to make sure everything is fully
in place nicely done you get everything
assembled on the motherboard and it
securely installed in the case
that's it for part 1 of this tutorial if
you enjoyed don't forget to hit that
like button and check out part 2 anyway
guys I'll catch you in the next one
