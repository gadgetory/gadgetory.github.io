here with the steamos tutorial and demo
it's totally possible to build yourself
a steam machine right now however this
is the very first release so it's a bit
complicated as far as the install goes
and still lacking a few major features
like game streaming first of all you'll
need compatible hardware in your PC as
of now this means a system with an
Nvidia graphics card and a fairly recent
motherboard that supports UEFI boot
steamos is based on Linux however out of
the box you won't be able to install
both it as well as Windows for example
as there's no dual booting so if you do
decide to install steam OS keep in mind
that it will delete everything else on
your hard drive so definitely be careful
once you're ready to begin you need to
download steam OS installer dot zip from
valve and I'll have that linked in the
description you can also use the system
restore option which is supposedly
easier however when I tried it I ran
into quite a few issues so for this
tutorial we're going to stick to the
standard method grab yourself a USB
Drive that's at least a couple gigabytes
and now we're going to freshly format it
so make sure that it's been wiped clean
of any data on windows just right-click
the drive from my computer and select
format make sure it's set to fat32 name
it steam OS and then click format on Mac
open up Disk Utility pick out your USB
Drive and select erase again make sure
it's set to fat name it steam OS and
you're good here now find the steam OS
installer zip we downloaded earlier and
extract all the files right onto your
USB Drive make sure the files aren't
inside any kind of folder they should be
at the root of your drive time to get
this started
plug the USB into your soon-to-be steam
machine and enter the BIOS usually using
the f10 or the delete key as it boots
find the boot menu and enable legacy
plus UEFI or a generic UEFI option then
make sure your USB Drive is set as the
first option at boot and exit the BIOS
if everything worked you should see the
steam OS install screen show up from
here just select the automated install
and give it a little while to load
everything onto your hard drive
it might appear to freeze a few times
but just be patient and it should
complete once it's done you'll see this
screen that means it's safe to unplug
your USB Drive and allow the PC to
reboot it will then bring you to a
generic looking boot menu this part is
important go to the drop down menu and
select gnome then type steam as the
username and steam is the password both
is lowercase and it should bring you to
a mostly empty desktop you should see a
steam icon if not log out and log back
in making sure you selected the right
options open up steam and now is the
same installation process as on PC so
just follow the prompts after it
downloads log in with your account
information and then it should bring you
to the normal steam interface we are
almost there go to the top right button
and log out of the steam user account it
should bring you back to the login
screen flick the gnome option once again
but this time login with the username
and password desktop again all lowercase
go up to the activities menu select
applications and then pop open the
terminal type this command in exactly as
you see it here I also have it in the
description if you can't quite read it
on the video ignore the warning and type
the password desktop in one more time
and it will take a few minutes to create
a recovery partition it will eventually
bring you to this screen after a reboot
just type Y hit enter and let it do its
thing for a couple minutes until it
boots natively into steam OS congrats
you have a steam machine up and running
for you guys who stuck with me this long
good job now let's take a look what
steam OS is all about the interface is
basically the same as big picture mode
as you've got support for the mouse and
keyboard along with the wired xbox360
controller right out of the box you can
browse through games and take a look at
all the info screen shots etc and by
default it shows everything however you
can sort by Linux games in the store to
see what actually works on steam OS as
well sorting in your own library the
games that you can install things are
fairly basic however you do have your
standard options along with information
to check what version of steam OS you're
running hardware info and a check for
updates button there's also a basic web
browser included that works decently
with the controller the first game I
tried was Metro last light which is one
of my surprise favorite games of this
year by default the screen was way too
dark but after bumping up the gamma
everything looked fine
unlike the Windows version the quality
settings boiled down to a single slider
which really annoys me as it's hard to
fine-tune the visuals
speaking of with a GTX 650 Ti boost it's
not too bad it's hard to say what the
equivalent settings are normally
it looked to be somewhere between low
and medium by default turning things up
resulted in better quality but a pretty
poor framerate that ended up crashing
right out to steamos left 4 dead 2 on
the other hand is an almost exact port
you've got full control of your quality
settings and you can enable the
controller and the options for the most
part it runs just fine however I ran
into quite a few weird hangs where the
camera would just pause for a moment
especially when the game was loading a
new area of the map so what do you guys
think of steamos
are you going to give it a shot let me
know in the comments below anyway if you

and greatest anyway guys that we'll
