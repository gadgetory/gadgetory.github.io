of the living room so how did the ps4
and Xbox one stack up in the software
department even though both consoles are
closed in most areas they take two
totally different approaches for the
interface the ps4 is focused on gaming
with media as a secondary feature where
the Xbox one puts a much bigger emphasis
on entertainment both are outfitted with
a blu-ray drive that supports DVDs but
the ps4 oddly doesn't work with audio
CDs the Xbox also has an advantage by
supporting the vast majority of video
formats over USB and you can also run
your cable box through the one to
control everything through a single
device you'll find all the standard
streaming apps on both like YouTube
Netflix Hulu Amazon Prime video and
twitch and quality wise we're looking at
1080p across the board they also have
some exclusives Skype is only available
on the Xbox and Spotify is on the ps4
which is a pretty killer feature for me
it would be nice to have 4k considering
some hundred dollars streaming devices
can handle it but it is technically
possible for 4k support to be edited at
some point unlike the last generation
both consoles can multitask
the ps4 will keep apps running in the
background and bring it right back up
when you open but it's quick to kill
things when it needs the memory the Xbox
handles things more elegantly you can
hit the Xbox button to minimize the app
or game while it's still running you can
even run two apps side by side I find
myself using snap all the time to watch
a video or live stream in the background
which is especially nice on a large TV
something optional for both consoles are
connect and the PlayStation camera they
both serve basically the same purpose by
supporting a few camera enabled games
and giving you voice commands the
PlayStation camera will do a few basic
things and although I feel it's not as
accurate as connect the camera does a
good job of tracking to let you play
some pretty cool games the Kinect
includes Bing which works well as a more
Universal search and it's also got more
commands such as being able to turn on
and off both the Xbox and TV with your
voice the problem is that both of these
are fairly expensive add-ons that don't
seem to have much of a future especially
in the Kinect's case get into gaming and
both have plenty of cool tricks the Xbox
one just added backwards compatibility
for 360 titles and it works really well
you can use disks or downloaded games
which work inside an emulator it's
basically indistinguishable from playing
on the original hardware and it even
works like a normal Xbox one app for
things like multitasking on the ps4 side
digital foundry discovered Sony snack
and a ps2 emulator
as of today it only works for a handful
of Star Wars games from a limited
edition bundle the bigger push is
PlayStation now which is a way of
playing ps3 titles via streaming if
you've got a solid internet connection
it's a cool way of playing a lot of
games that will probably never come to
the ps4 but you can't play your own
games and it's about 15 dollars a month
which makes the Xbox solution hard to
argue with the ps4 does however have
remote play on a few devices like the PS
Vita you need to solid connection
between the pair but it works really
nicely you essentially get a mirrored
display on the Vita and some games have
specific support for the controls the
Xbox has streaming to Windows 10 devices
which is basically the same thing you
connect the controller to the PC and
you're able to stream Xbox games right
over to the computer one thing to
consider is that both consoles require a
subscription to play online PSN is $50 a
year where Xbox Live comes in at 60
however it's often available for quite a
bit less than that both give you access
to free games and discounts each month
and the selection is pretty comparable
recently but regardless you'll have to
show up for a subscription to get the
most out of these consoles while the
series so far has been closed this one's
pretty straightforward
the ps4 has a nice interface quite a few
cool tricks and enough apps to cover the
basics but the Xbox one has more
features a better design UI camera and
backwards compatibility giving it the
clear win this time around with four
episodes down the Xbox and ps4 tied so
stay tuned this isn't over just yet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
