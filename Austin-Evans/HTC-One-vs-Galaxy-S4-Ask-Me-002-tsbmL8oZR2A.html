was asking me episode 2 so if you guys
missed the first one this is pretty much
my series just answering questions so it
can be about me can be about technology
whatever so let's just jump right on in
how much planning do you put into each
new video and how do you organize when
you go to edit and film it it definitely
depends on the type of video so for
something like this it's not really all
that difficult I just took the questions
and put them on my iPad so I have them
here as my notes and I just answer the
questions you know set up the camera and
the lights all that kind of stuff so as
far as that goes it's pretty simple most
of the videos if you see just me facing
the camera it's very simple I don't
really ever have a script for this kind
of stuff again I usually will have like
my iPad with a couple notes some bullet
points you know make sure I don't forget
anything major but anytime you ever see
me actually talking to the camera I'm
just pretty much winging it and coming
it up with coming up with it as I go but
for more of my complicated videos like
for example my review of the galaxy s4
those get way more complicated really
fast so for example the galaxy s4 review
was shot in New York City as well as
three places locally so that was over
like three weeks so I was just going to
different places and shooting just
getting all kinds of footage and then
once I had most of my footage I brought
it back I wrote a script I definitely
always script but I really you know big
reviews Cleveland get all the
information into a short amount of time
and see that it's pretty much the way it
worked and then when I go to edit i have
my pretty much in my entire voiceover
and i just cut all the different clips
together and finish that's how it works
do you prefer the HTC One or samsung
galaxy s4 I was actually planning on
doing the whole video talking about this
but a car got a little bit delayed since
I broke my elbow a couple weeks ago and
I kind of slowed me down as far as
videos when but the gist of it is at
least personally for me I did choose the
HTC One and in fact I've already ordered
mine it should be getting here soon I
know the main reason why I chose the one
it probably actually doesn't apply to a
lot of you guys is for the video now
desin something wrong the galaxy s4 is a
great phone I've actually been using it
over the last couple weeks but the main
reason why I've chosen the one is for
that video because it's really good so
obviously if you guys hadn't noticed I
tend to film just a little bit of video
for my channel and the fact is the one
is actually good enough that I can
absolutely use it in a pinch for filming
whatever in fact a lot of the galaxy s4
review was actually filmed on the H
see one will make it a lot of it but
several of those clips in there as well
as some of the other clips for some
upcoming videos I just shot on the 1 and
of course yeah it's not quite as good as
my DSLR obviously but it is absolutely
good enough where I don't have the need
to you know carry around the giant
camera or even carry around something
like a camcorder whatever when I'm
walking around just you know screwing
around the HTC One is totally good
enough where I can just pull it out film
whatever I need and that's totally good
enough to go on my channel which is
awesome of course for normal people you
probably appreciate any other build
quality which really does feel awesome
as well as the front facing speakers all
that kind of stuff but just personally
for me the video alone is enough to make
me go with the HTC One and over pretty
much anything else out there if iOS
completely evolved but the iphone screen
size stayed the same would you switch if
some new version of iOS came out that's
just crazy awesome blows everyone away
then yeah I would switch to it but I
gotta say it would be tough getting back
used to a smaller screen again I mean
the last few phones I've used your left
something like an HTC One or galaxy note
2 or even the galaxy s3 I am so used to
having a phone with a big screen at this
point then going back to an iphone just
feels weird and bizarre it's just way
too small and this is keep in mind this
is from a guy who used to use an iphone
4s with no problems never had any
complaints about the screen but now i
pick up an iphone 5 it just feels way
too small what do you expect to be
revealed at Google i/o that's a great
question so Google i/o is coming up here
pretty soon and there's a bunch of
things I definitely expect to see
probably the number one thing I'm most
excited about is seeing the next version
of the nexus 7 whether they call it the
Nexus like 7.1 or the nexus 8 whatever
but the next version it should be much
more powerful it should be a lot better
as far as the screen goes but most
importantly of all it should be running
Android 4.3 which on that same topic is
another thing that google should be an
asking at Google i/o so as you probably
guessed from the 4.3 name it probably
won't be some massive huge upgrade or
anything like that we definitely should
see some cool new features coming for
Android in the next little while how do
you and marques brownlee know each other
we both started on YouTube about the
same time back in two thousand nine so
he left me a comment and I kind of
checked his channel out and we kind of
started talking it just kind of all went
from there what was kind of funny was
when we first kind of met each other I
think we both had maybe like 50 to 60
subscribers something like that I mean
we were very
be very very new to YouTube we both
totally sucked back then we were friends
it kind of started and helped each other
out we did some videos for each other we
even start a couple channels together we
did all kinds of stuff and yeah marques
is an awesome guy definitely one of my
best friends here on youtube if you guys
haven't checked them out definitely go
check them out and you make some of the
best videos here on YouTube he's
actually almost at 300,000 subscribers
which kind of blows my mind but yeah go
definitely go check them out youtube.com
