chance to take a look at a lot of very
cool out is this year from the q7 to the
r8 on the track to the e-tron but the a7
might just be my favorite one yet as
always shoot shout out to outtie for
sponsoring this video and for hooking me
up with the a7 for a week at first
glance this looks similar to the last
gen car which is not a bad thing at all
take one look at the rs7 and it should
be pretty clear why I think this is one
of the best-looking 4-door sedans of all
time but I will say that the a7
definitely does step it up don't be
fooled though this car is all new for
example the LED headlights look so cool
especially at night this also comes
across with the taillights so not like
today run across the entire length of
the back of the car but they're all LED
and they even animated out nicely when
you turn your turn signal on it's a
super cool touch the newly seven does
share a lot of DNA with the a6 but one
of the big differences is of course that
it is a sport bag which means that there
is a ton of cargo space we pop the back
you will see that we have a ton of stuff
loaded up in here it's not only there
are a couple of camera cases we have a
bunch of random little bags and
accessories what's nice is that we can
take all this instead of plenty of room
for Ken and I don't know people inside
get the a7 out on the freeway and this
is really where things Shayne so not
only do we have great adaptive cruise
control but we also have that paired
with the lane keep assist so we're a
little bit of mixed traffic right now
and what really impressed me is just how
smooth everything is so the car is
completely handling the throttle and the
brake and the steering is pretty much
all completely automatic as well I do
need to keep a hand on the wheel but
beyond that the lane keep assist does a
really good job of keeping us centered
and more importantly driving smoothly
so I've driven a fair few cars that had
various levels of driver assistance and
self-driving capabilities and well they
generally do work pretty well usually
you can tell it's not a real person
driving because it's not quite smooth
right it's a little jerky doesn't quite
stay in the lane quite right little like
drift back and forth but here it really
does feel like a normal person is
driving the a7 is loaded with cool tech
take one look around this interior and
you will see that outtie does cabins
right
Meli's are this great wood finish that
wraps around the front but if I turn the
car on you'll also see if there's LED
lighting which goes all over the place
if they should really subtle look but
it's nice to have just a little bit of
an accent here over here down here
pretty much everywhere you look if you
saw the video we did on the each one
recently
the center staff will is very familiar
so in the bottom we have a touch screen
which is mostly used for things like the
climate control as well as a few system
settings and on top of that we also have
a much bigger touch screen and this is
used for navigation radio all the kind
of fun stuff this is also where you'll
find the excellent 360-degree view it is
super cool to be able to see now from a
top-down perspective but also to see a
full 360 around your car just exactly
where everything is it looks so cool
it's like a video game here I can see
from outside the car from inside the car
and that's thanks to a series of cameras
that are wrapped around the a7 one of my
favorite features is inside the console
well do we have Qi wireless charging so
you can just set my phone down and will
begin to charge but on top of that we
also have wireless carplay it's totally
seamless and it is so dope there's also
an upgraded version of virtual cockpit
now a lot of other cars are moving away
from physical gauges but this purely
digital set up with a nice high
resolution screen looks really nice and
it's a big step up from my car
for a big car this thing actually
handles pretty well so it is helped that
we have those big 21 inch wheels and
those sticky summer tires I mean you can
do this up in the canyons and it handles
pretty well which is weird because like
in my head I know just how big this car
is a very large Sportback once you
actually get it out on the road the size
definitely kind of shrinks it feels much
more nimble maybe not quite like an rs3
but close I mean the drive is so smooth
so the e7 actually does take advantage
of a mild hybrid system so there's a 48
volt battery underneath the cargo floor
and the back and what that gives you is
just a little bit of extra torque with
the electric motor to get rid of any
kind of minor turbo lag which I can't
tell if there's any at all and on top of
that it's really cool because it allows
you to easily start the motor very
seamlessly we're a start or a stop
[Laughter]
so I just had to do that so we do have a
seven-speed dual-clutch transmission and
of course it does a great job of sort of
driving around in automatic mode but you
do have the paddles if you want to have
a little bit of extra fun I've got to
say there's a lot to like with the new
a7 between all the cool tech as well as
just how well it drives for such a big
sports ACK not gonna lie
kind of excited for the new rs7 though</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
