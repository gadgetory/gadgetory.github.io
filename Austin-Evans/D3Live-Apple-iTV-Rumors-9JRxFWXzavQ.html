episode of g3 live so today I'm going to
be discussing the upcoming Apple TV also
possibly known as the ITV apples right
iteration of the Apple TV and is going
to be a real competitor against the
upcoming Google TV and why they have to
add TV to every name but yeah let me go
ahead and just run you guys through some
of the rumors we've heard a lot of stuff
about it and actually could be coming
out as soon as next month so of course
I'm sure a lot of you guys are familiar
with the current Apple TV but the next
one I'm just going to be calling at the
itv it is going to be probably a huge
step up its going to be a lot different
so the current apple TV is pretty much
relegated to just being you know a
device that can you know get on iTunes
you can download all your music and
movies etc but there really is not a
whole lot else you can do with it it's
really pretty much locked down to just
be able to access step through itunes
it's not like you know where you just
open your computer and you just do a lot
of you know dropping files etc now what
we're actually going to probably be
seeing in the ITV is it's going to be
much much smaller so the current apple
TV is somewhat rotten about around the
same size as the mac mini it's you know
it's a decent size is not huge however
the upcoming ITV is likely going to be
very very small probably a little bit
bigger than just maybe the iphone 4 and
continuing with this is actually going
to have a lot of the specs on iphone 4
including 16 gigabytes of flash storage
as well as the one gigahertz apple a4
processor and should be running iOS some
sort of modified version of course now
this is going to be really interesting
as obviously as I'm sure a lot of you
guys are part about the Google TV which
will be coming out on currently as well
as all for next year's they develop it
and get more and more stuff out now an
interesting thing about the Google TV is
that it really is integrated well as
your TV and that's something that Google
really worked on they really want you to
be able to just continue watching your
TV just like you normally would and
there's just extra features such as web
browsing etc etc on top of that now I
think that's a really good idea and I
think it's something that I TV should
really focus on now the ITV like i said
is going to be a very very small device
I think that's going to be really cool a
lot of people who've seen it has
actually you know described it is like
an iphone without a screen now one
pretty important part is like
I said earlier always going to have
about 16 gigabytes of flash storage now
that's way down from the current Apple
TV which it has 160 gigabytes and really
16 gigabytes is not going to be able to
get you a whole lot I mean yeah you can
maybe have a couple of TV shows and you
can get a little bit of music but but
most of you are going to have to rely on
is cloud storage now what I really hope
with ITV is that I actually be able to
sync over to your computer so you know
let's say you have a laptop or a desktop
or whatever have it on it will just
connect via the network and actually go
ahead and be able to pull stuff off that
in addition it would be really cool if
Apple actually allows you to pull your
stuff off of you know some sort of cloud
based itunes so instead of having to
download all the stuff all we need to do
is just click a button on your I TV and
go ahead and just start playing through
different itunes songs that you already
have bought and just have it strained
straight from the itunes servers i think
that would be a really cool feature now
there's no telling whether we'll
actually be able to see this um I think
that there's been a lot of rumors about
you know being some sort of cloud based
itunes I think it'll be a great idea
however if we'll see it I don't know how
if it will be more expensive things like
that so we have to wait and see about
that um so now let me just quite and
just really briefly um some of the
rumors have said that we actually might
be seeing as soon as next month the
apple ipod append i'm not too sure about
this it'll either be public between then
and sometime early next year I wouldn't
be surprised if it actually does come
out next year however i wouldn't be
entirely surprised either before you see
it next week a rather nice clump now's
the price is actually probably the
biggest thing about the itd it actually
said multiple people said that it should
be going around ninety nine dollars
which would be a really fantastic price
personally I'm not really quite sure how
they can actually get in that cheap of
course it does have pretty simple parts
like I said it should be about size of
an iphone so you're not really going to
be worrying about a lot of the intricate
electronics etc so if they're actually
able to get in for ninety nine dollars
and that really does have a lot of
functionality with cloud based itunes
etc I think I TV will be a really solid
bit okay so for the second segment of d3
live I'll be taking live questions
obviously every episode of DC live is
filmed in front of love to me we've got
quite a few people in here and Alice
splinting some questions okay well going
to be more than 16 gigabytes on the ITV
as far as different persons that's a
good question i do not know a lot of
them pretty much all the rumors have
said that there would just be a 16
gigabyte now I onsen would not be
surprised whatsoever if there actually
is a 32 gigabyte auction or even larger
than that is obviously there's not a
whole lot in there unlike an iphone
where you know there's not really a room
for extra chips however it launched it
looks like it will just be 16 gigabyte
you will just have to really back it out
with either hooking connecting it to
your iTunes or hopefully at cloud based
itunes who is the direct competitor to
the itv or is it an illegal zone um i
think they're actually depending on how
Apple markets it I think it could go a
couple different ways no matter what
they do I think it's going to be a big
competitor with the Google TV I think
you know the google TV looks really saw
it's got a lot of really cool features
and as long as Apple really pays
attention gets a little bit away from
itunes because that was one of the major
problems with the original apple TV is
that it is so connected with itunes if
you don't have everything set up to
there it's really a pain to use so if
they can't really get away from that
actually you know get more towards like
a tebow well you know you can actually
record stuff you can actually go ahead
and check what time's your favorite
shows are on then i think it will be a
competitor's actually more of the TiVo
and a lot of the standard sort of you
know DVRs that you know you get with
your cable or satellite company um so i
think that the Apple TV depending on her
rather the ITV depending on how Apple
decides to make it what features they
need to get outside to give it to it it
just kind of vary between what it will
actually focus on well I can be
including netflix um possibly actually
the obviously if it does run iOS which
pretty much everyone seems to say it
does abaya of course a very modified
version of it it will actually be able
to run full apps athletes at Netflix
would probably be one of those apps
obviously there's a netflix app for the
iphone and ipod touch as well as ipad or
at least coming soon so i wouldn't be
surprised that going get to the itv and
that goes the same for quite a few other
really in popular apps such as Hulu Plus
etc etc so I think yeah as far as
getting separate content like Netflix
etc I think it would be pretty good well
is the core i7 a good seat
you yes the intel core i7 CPU of course
this is pretty unrelated to the apple TV
but yes the core i7 is a fantastic
processor pretty much anywhere you go
it's a lot of power actually my laptop
has a core i3 and honestly I can video
editing everything just fine on that but
of course I've seen a lot of people have
tested the core i7 and it is a very vast
chip so if you're thinking about getting
a processor for your custom computer or
anything like that that's definitely not
you know there you won't have any
problems as far as power goes um how
much money will the ITV be most likely
we've heard a hundred dollars personally
I think that might be just a little bit
low especially for an apple product it's
not like Apple to really go a really
really low price I wouldn't really be
surprised if it goes from more than 20
more like two hundred dollars maybe 150
and of course if it doesn't have
different versions so maybe like it has
a 32 gigabyte version or something like
that then that would probably add a
little bit more into the price but I'd
probably aim for somewhere in the
hundreds $150 range with pug do it costs
it won't do 1080p videos is this true
actually that's a good thing yes we have
heard quite a few things that says that
it probably will not do be able to do
1080p video and that's a pretty big deal
um personally I think it's a little bit
overblown as well obviously 1080p video
is quite a bit clearer and crisper most
people don't even know the difference
can't tell the difference between 720
and 1080 p a lot of people can't tell
the difference and I think that if it
can do 1080p that would be great but if
he doesn't I think it's going to be a
problem but I don't think it's going to
be a deal-breaker well let have a DVD
Drive no it won't it is basically going
to be an iphone feted screen maybe just
a little bit bigger but honestly it's
going to be very very small and there's
not going to be any room for a DVD drive
blu-ray anything like that which is a
slight problem but I think through the
market that Apple is really targeting I
don't think it will be an issue well
Apple TV be able to run standard iphone
apps most likely now of course there's a
big difference between using you know a
TVs across the room and a little you
know three and a half inch device in
your hand I would be surprised if
they're able to maybe poured it or do
something where a standard apple may be
like you can actually run and
iphone app off of your current iPhone
and just connected or however they would
do that however I don't know how you
know a standing appt would work
obviously if it needs accelerometer or
touch screen stuff like that which
obviously it's not like you to go pick
up your TV and you know start floating
messing around with it like an iPad or
something anyway guys that's it for this
