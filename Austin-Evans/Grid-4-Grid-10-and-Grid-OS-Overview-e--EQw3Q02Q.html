the brand new grid 4 and grid 10 in the
past few months there's been a lot of
viral marketing about a company called
tat Co but you know wouldn't really know
who it was
however this morning they went ahead and
fully announced what their products were
and turns out this fusion garage and you
guys may not recognize the name but they
were the ones who came up with the juju
tablet which I did less than
spectacularly a few years ago so let's
go ahead and take a look at what their
new products have to offer to start with
let's talk about the grid for now as the
name implies this is going to be a four
inch smartphone running the grid OS now
the grid OS is running on both the phone
as well as the tablet and it for all
intents and purposes is a reskin version
of Android now they are calling it a
fully separate operating system however
it not only does it is it based on the
Android kernel but also runs Android
apps so it's probably going to be a
pretty customized experience but it's
not going to be all new the specs on the
grid 4 include a 4-inch 480 by 800
resolution display a 1 gigahertz single
core Snapdragon processor a 5 megapixel
rear facing camera with 720p video
support as well as 16 gigabytes of
internal storage now this phone should
be launched in the coming months and it
will be available for $399 off contract
which is actually not a bad price
whatsoever for a phone like this on top
of that we'll be announcing carrier
partner so for example AT&amp;amp;T t-mobile etc
etc whoever decides to pick up the phone
they will be announcing that at a later
date moving on to the grid 10 we are
going to have a full 10.1 inch tablet
although with a very high resolution of
1366 by 768 it has a dual core NVIDIA
Tegra 2 chip like I said very very
similar to what you will find on pretty
much any Android tablet that you
purchased today but on top of that it of
course does run the grid OS blown up for
the large display now it's a little bit
hard to tell what version of Android
this is based on just based on the
screenshots and the video that we've
seen it doesn't look like it's actually
going to be honeycomb however it does
have a lot of really interesting and
really nice-looking effects transitions
at etc etc now moving on a little bit
more about the tablet it's actually has
a fairly sleek and thin design it only
is 0.37 inches thick which is not half
bad at all considerably thinner than a
lot of the other tablets that are
available on the market and on top of
that it will be available a little bit
later on this year for 499
with a Wi-Fi model in $599 for the 3G
model I'm a little bit split on this on
the one hand I'm always really looking
forward to when new people come into the
space new ideas new products really kind
of shake everything up now on the other
hand the choo-choo was a complete flop
absolutely just abysmal flop and these
two both they look kind of decent but
nothing really spectacular I mean
particularly the OS well it definitely
does have some nice things I definitely
can see some Windows Phone 7 in there
it's a little bit chaotic it's just
really not a very slick interface that I
would definitely like so this one comes
over to you guys what do you think and
of course both of these are going to be
fairly unique products and like I said
we should be seeing them in the next
coming months so what do you guys think
are you interested does this look like
something you would be interested in
buying something that you would never
touch in a million years definitely be
sure to leave your thoughts in the
