lynda.com hey guys this is Austin and
today I'm here the video going over some
of my favorite gaming gear something I
get asked about all the time is what
mouse and keyboard I use when gaming I
really like the Logitech g7 10 plus well
there are a lot of cheap mechanical
keyboards out there the g7 10 add some
features to make the extra price worth
it for me
first of all are the Cherry MX brown
switches which strike a nice balance
between click enos and not being
incredibly loud another nice feature is
the customizable backlighting using the
buttons on top you can like just the
WASD and arrow keys the entire keyboard
or change the brightness of each
individually small touches like a volume
wheel game mode switch to disable things
like the windows button and an extra USB
port onboard make the Logitech g7 10
plus an awesome gaming keyboard moving
over to the mouse we have my absolute
favorite the Corsair Vengeance m95 the
first thing you'll notice is that this
is built like an absolute tank with
aluminum wrapping around the entire body
and covering the bottom which also
happens to look awesome the ergonomics
are spot-on with a slightly grippy
finish on the outside and a thumb rest
on the inside so if this is geared more
toward mmo's you have 9 programmable
macro keys along with the ability to
change sensitivity right on the fly what
really sets the m95 apart though is the
tracking this is basically ruined my old
Mouse well it's not really meant for
hardcore gaming I really liked using the
Logitech performance MX for the great
ergonomics and extra buttons but the
8200 dpi sensor in the m95
is so much more accurate and even simple
things like browsing that it's no
contest
considering it's not even that expensive
for a gaming mouse the Corsair Vengeance
M 95 is definitely worth a look next we
have speakers and here I used the Harman
Kardon sound sticks 3 while plenty of
people have pointed out the slightly
unique shape I personally really like
the clear look as a 2.1 setup you get 2
satellites with four 1-inch tweeters
each along with the 6-inch round
subwoofer each speaker has an adjustable
stand as well as you also have touch
controls for volume now these are sub
$200
so doesn't expect anything too insane as
far as the audio quality goes
however listening to music and editing
audio I have no complaints there's some
solid bass with a subwoofer which you
can adjust with a knob on the back and
the highs are nice and clear the
mid-range is a bit lacking but I'll let
you guys have a listen for yourselves
overall if you want a nice looking and
sounding set of speakers that won't
break the bank it's hard to go wrong
with the Harman Kardon sound sticks
three another important part of my
gaming setup is the Elgato Game Capture
HD this is a killer little capture card
that allows you to record gameplay for
basically any console out there
including the Xbox one ps4 PC and more
the hardware itself is small and simple
with a mini USB port which handles both
power and data HDMI and AV end from your
console and HDMI out to a monitor it's
dead simple to use and allows you to
record at 1080p while still playing a
game using the HDMI pass-through which
keeps lag out of your waiting quality is
great especially for YouTube this is how
I record basically all of my gameplay
there are presets for different consoles
infants their works with nearly any HDMI
signal I also use the Game Capture to
record gameplay from my PC builds which
is nice when I don't want to impact the
performance it even supports retro
consoles like the ps1 with an RCA
connector if you want to catch your high
quality gameplay the Elgato Game Capture
HD is absolutely worth a look so what
does some gaming tech that you want me
