for you guys today but hopefully it
should be pretty helpful especially if
you're just saying Apple Computer
basically I have created a list of
applications that you can download which
is one-click cursive and the only I says
wrong 9:8 guys I'm not gonna say that
anymore the video you guys know what I'm
talking about there's this great website
and I just did the name of and they have
a basically you can go ahead and
download all kinds of things for example
web browsers you know different music
players I mean guys all kinds of stuff
so basically guys what I've done is I've
went through went through all of these
picked out some of my favorites I've
made you guys two presets now this is
good for a couple different reasons on
the main thing is is that when you first
set up your computer you know obviously
you know it could be any kind of Windows
computer XP Vista or Windows 7 but you
know as soon as you install your
operating system you know that you're
gonna have to wait and wait and wait you
have to go to google.com download Chrome
Apple go go this that this that well
guys with one click you can go ahead and
download everything and on top of that
if you're already using a computer and
you just want some more programs go
ahead guys there'll be two links in the
description let me go ahead watch the
video I'll show you guys all what I'm
talking about and then if you don't have
any of these that you want to try them
out or whatever go ahead and come down
and you'll be redirected to this page or
you can go ahead and mix match whatever
you like on so hey guys I'm gonna start
with the basics on this is all I made
both these lists this is just kind of my
opinion but this is just kind of the
basic pack if you don't want to get a
bunch of stuff so the web browser is
Chrome I love Chrome guys it's probably
the best web browser around right now I
mean I know a lot of you guys use
Firefox and Firefox is decent but really
guys chrome does almost everything
Firefox does just better lately so I
recommend you know if you're maybe still
using Firefox or Internet Explorer or
something you Mel go ahead switch to
Chrome especially if you're setting it
up on a new computer but you know that's
just my opinion in the messaging I don't
have anything this is a basic thing so
I'm not you know no Skype or anything of
course the guys you can add it if you
want but I'm leaving it out for this for
the
basic pay now we come down to media I've
only selected two here I've got you guys
iTunes itunes I mean it's not the
greatest but guys it's really hard to
you know not use iTunes between you know
the you know having to hook up your
iPods and iPhones and iPads and you know
have to do you know buy music from the
iTunes store a lot of stuff iTunes is
kind of a necessity course should feel
free to you know to unselect if you like
also VLC guys if you don't know what VLC
is it is a fantastic audio video player
guys literally any kind of format any
kind of codec guys I've never really
been able to find something that won't
play in VLC I mean you can but it's very
very difficult highly recommend guys
mine I had the best UI ever but it's
really really handy so I definitely
recommend you guys go and download that
I have Picasa the cost is a really good
Google program that allows you to go
ahead it tags your photos you can do
your faces and it pulls them all in you
can do some really slight editing but
for this basic pack I didn't I didn't go
ahead and do anything like camp or
whatever so you might want go ahead and
do that Adobe Reader I've got next Adobe
Reader guys I'm not a huge fan of it but
a lot of websites and stuff rely on it
and it's hard to you know get around the
internet without using Adobe Reader for
this and that so I went ahead and
included
thanks guys I have security now actually
I get this question asked quite a bit
what kind of security show to use guys
Microsoft Security Essentials is
literally the only thing I run on my
Windows 7 computer I do have spy pot
that you know I run every month or so
because Security Essentials
is a fantastic program it's by Microsoft
it's updated frequently and really
should keep you your computer nice and
clean and everything next I have run
times not gonna go into this you have
flash Java Silverlight you know this is
just kind of standard stuff you know
that you'll you'll need eventually so
why not go ahead and get down with it
the last thing I have here guys I
skipped a lot of this stuff because this
is the basic pack after all is CCleaner
ccleaner is a fantastic utility one of
my favorites always the first thing I
download when I get my computer again
get a new computer reset it or for
whatever reason guys it will basically
wipe out all
the junk on your computer will clean out
all kinds of you know you know temporary
files that you can even go through your
registry you can check you can deselect
programs to automatically open tons and
tons of great stuff guys I highly
recommend it so once if you if you like
this list go ahead and hit the basic
link in the description below it will
take you to this page and where you can
go ahead and you know select some maybe
you want image burn we can go ahead and
just click it and that will be added
deselect it but you can go ahead and
guys if you've had some of these just go
ahead and unselect them and then go
ahead and all you have to do is hit get
installer just that it'll automatically
download as soon as you hit that button
and then you go ahead just just run it
and it will go ahead and download and
install all the apps that you choose
okay so that is now the next one is for
advanced now guys this one is more of a
full feature this is kind of more of
what I run although you still can't get
all your programs that you can get a
good amount of them so guys for the
advanced one I had a couple more web
browsers I added opera 10.5 fantastic
browser it's really really good and
Firefox that guys you might be wondering
including Internet Explorer you'll be
having four browsers well I actually run
pretty much as many browsers as I can I
do that mostly for checking websites for
example Zurich I have to you know run in
different websites to test and plus you
know sometimes it's nice to have you
know different browsers I do Bowser's
comparisons and stuff so guys I add in
these three if you want feel free to
just stick with Chrome just stick with
Firefox you know you can guys can mix
and match that however you like next to
messaging I added two more Skype Skype
is fantastic guys I mean you can go
ahead and free chat you can chat to your
friends voice or video if they have
Skype you can also no talk on you know
different from play things such as like
for eyes and phones are starting to get
Skype as well as you know the iPhone you
obviously can get Skype on so Skype is
great pigeon pigeon is a multi instant
message client pigeons pretty good for
you know if you want to chat to your
friends or and you can go ahead and do
that in a ton of different kinds so
instead of you know having a bunch tabs
up on your computer or something
pigeon load up all your information you
can chat with all your friends
everywhere now me I only added one thing
and it's audacity audacity is a pretty
good audio editor again guys the UI is
not fantastic in audacity but I do use
it occasionally when I need to edit the
audio on my videos guys this one's kind
of this one is they're definitely very
optional if you don't ever really need
this I would go ahead just unselect it
but you know I imagine some of you will
so that's why I added it next we have in
imaging we have GIMP that's the only one
I added and GIMP guys literally it is
open source Photoshop now guys I've used
GIMP for a very long time probably a
couple years and I'm still not very good
about it I'll tell you that I'm not I'm
kind of a noob still in GIMP but guys it
is fantastic I love it it's just as good
as Photoshop in my opinion I mean it's
not there's a couple things that lacks
but literally it's GIMP is fantastic
only problems is just has doesn't have
that great of loading times but it's not
a big deal so guys definitely recommend
you need an image editor it's really
hardcore we'll be able to do all kinds
of stuff Campus the one documents now
guys this one is um the only thing I had
was OpenOffice to be honest OpenOffice
is pretty good I prefer Microsoft Word
but of course not all computers come
with it and you don't necessarily want
to pay for it so if you have word I
recommend don't install open office but
if you don't open all this is a good
alternative and that's what I use when I
don't have four I didn't add anything
else in security at some much I like
Microsoft Security Essentials Spybot
guys if you were going to add anything I
would add Spybot that's the only one
that I would really recommend but that's
just if you want to be extra cautious
like me and right everyone swap not a
necessity go down to file sharing
utorrent um guys if you don't ever do
torrents you know go ahead and uninstall
it don't click it but I like utorrent
because it's got a great interface it's
very very quick loading it automatically
updates and it's very secure so I mean
if you're if you'd like to do you know
use torrents that's definitely the one
I'd recommend okay guys we're getting
towards the end we had Dropbox I'm gonna
go ahead and try to keep this a little
bit quicker now Dropbox is a great
online and backup you can file sync
basically it will allow you to
upload a file you just as soon as you
have it downloaded you just drop it in
the Dropbox file and it goes up to the
cloud then you can go on a variety of
different of the computers as well as
there are some apps for some things I
believe there's one for the iPhone as
well and you can go ahead and have your
files you have two gigs free and you can
have your files anywhere it's really
good we come down to utilities image
burn I don't honestly use I mean to burn
all that often but I know a lot of
people do I don't ever really even use
discs I mean I'll pop in maybe a DVD a
year in my computer so I don't really
use it but occasionally this does come
in really does come in handy especially
if you have you know you know Windows XP
or Windows Vista oh hey guys we're
coming into the last four I'll going
through them really quickly
yeah 7-zip it's great for compressing
files on you know I actually I have
another program that's called as I pay
that I like to use but they don't have
it on here so you might want to go ahead
and check that out but 7-zip is pretty
decent and so if you just want to go
ahead and just click it as a no big deal
and then lastly guys there's three
developer tools notepad is really good
for coding it's also a pretty decent you
know it's an enhanced version of WordPad
I guess or if you don't want to use
OpenOffice you have the Java development
kit this actually if you do do
OpenOffice I highly recommend you do
that it helps it out sometimes
OpenOffice won't work so and we have
winscp this is mostly if you have a
jailbroken iPhone or iPod you need to
SSH into your you know your device then
you'll definitely need one SCP otherwise
you might want to go ahead and pass so
yeah guys that's it of course the same
way you just go ahead and hit get
installer and you go ahead and download
whichever programs you to chose and
you'll be good so yeah guys I hope you
enjoyed I hope you know you appreciate
all this kind of stuff of course you
guys feel free absolutely feel free to
mix and match what you want
I'm just check out there will be two
links in the description check out if
you want the basic pack if you want the
advanced pack and you know just go ahead
and mix match I would be highly
surprised if any of you guys just pick
the standard one and don't customize it
at all so guys if you're setting up into
computers to be perfect if you get
you're not even if you've had your
computer around for a while go ahead
maybe check out a couple of the apps
that you might not have
and test Mountain everything you might
be surprised anyway guys thanks for
