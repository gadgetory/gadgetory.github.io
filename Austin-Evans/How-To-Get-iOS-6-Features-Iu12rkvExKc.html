the video showing you how to get Iowa
six features now there are some nice new
additions in iOS 6 but almost all of
them you can get today by jailbreaking
if you haven't jailbroken your iphone
ipod touch your iPad yet it's very easy
and you can follow this tutorial first
if you're on Iowa's 5.1.1 and then come
back to this video one of the bigger
announcements is Facebook integration in
iOS 6 to get this today on iOS 5 all you
need to do is download fusion which is
available for three dollars in Cydia
Fusion allows you to quickly update your
status from anywhere I have it
configured to open by double tapping the
status bar but you can change it to a
wide range of activation options inside
you'll see the normal iOS tweet menu
with the option to add your location
upload a picture or post a song you're
currently listening to fusion that only
has Facebook integration but also
Twitter Foursquare and MySpace you know
if you're still in 2007 for some reason
it also works system-wide anytime
there's a tweet option in an app it
automatically opens fusion so you can
also choose to post a Facebook or the
other social networks Siri integration
is also included post status to Facebook
saying hello world as you wish master
not bad huh iOS 6 also brings an
improved mail app for this
I love Sparrow an email client available
in the App Store for $3 Sparrow handles
multiple accounts along with multiple
email signatures in a UI that really
puts the default mail app shame there
are lots of excellent little gestures to
navigate through your mail quickly and
even though it's lacking push
notification support right now for me
the trade off is worth it I've been
using Sparrow for the last few months
and wouldn't trade it even for the new
iOS 6 Mail app in iOS 6 you can finally
open apps with Siri but my friend Nick
Frey has already created a cydia tweak
to do this months ago called voice utils
it's a straightforward tweak but it's
free and works very well
open jetpack joyride
it might be a year or two late but Iowa
six also finally brings the ability to
use FaceTime over 3G this is something
you can do easily if you were jailbroken
with the help of an app called 3G and
restrictor which is available in Cydia
for $4 all right so I'm not using 3G
unrestricted to do FaceTime over 3G all
right now to help me demo this of course
I'm a good friend would you have to
introduce yourself guys don't go check
him out so you guys can see here he
looks very very good
pretty much it's just exactly like on
Wi-Fi how's it on your end on top of
allowing you to make FaceTime calls over
3G or 4G it also allows you to download
anything at all over cellular for
example the App Store doesn't allow
large ads to be downloaded or to watch
high-quality YouTube videos over 3G but
with 3G and restrictor it tricks apps
into believing you are on Wi-Fi so it's
universal there are also included sv
settings toggles to restrict ass back to
Wi-Fi if you're going over your data
usage but otherwise this is I basically
must have tweaked there are many other
features you can get now between the App
Store and Cydia including turn-by-turn
navigation apps more Siri mods and much
more but these are my favorites if you
guys enjoyed the video I'd really
appreciate it if you could leave it a
thumbs up and if you're interested in
