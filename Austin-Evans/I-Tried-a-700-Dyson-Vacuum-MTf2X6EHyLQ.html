Boston not exactly what you're expecting
right this is the Dyson cyclone v10 I
know what you're probably thinking why
am i doing a video on a vacuum
however when Dyson reached out and
wanted to sponsor a video on this
brand-new v10 I've gotta say there's
actually some pretty cool tech inside
what makes the Dyson v10 interesting is
that Mellie is today the launch but this
is the first in the next generation of
vacuums so from here on out while
they'll still sell some of their current
models all the new models are going to
be cord free pop it open and the first
thing we see is some paperwork on how to
solve your problems with Dyson we also
get the activate your warranty which is
going to be for two years and there's
actually a lot of vacuum pieces so it's
interesting about this is that you're
actually going to be able to use it as a
bit of a convertible so not only is it
going to be a standard sort of upright
vacuum but you can also use it a little
bit more of a handheld mode so inside
here is going to be where you're going
to find the motor the cyclone that
actually is not too heavy
there should be a battery oh you hear
that
that's really cool so the batteries
already in here
that's super lightweight I feel like the
Dyson engineers they spent literally
five years working on this motor design
but feel like two or three of those
years were like how do I get to sound
really cool and they definitely
succeeded so I feel like I've done
enough unboxings that usually I'm kind
of like oh whatever chargers this is
that but with this I legitimately have
no idea what to expect and every single
time I think I'm done there's like five
more boxes full of cool stuff on the
level with you guys for a second fridge
all the vacuums I bought my life are the
cheap terrible ones this this is all
much nicer now with that I think we have
all of the accessories for our Dyson v10
now the next step is to charge this guy
up and actually see what it can do of
course is a vacuum the only way to
properly test it is to well vacuum stuff
that that actually works surprisingly
well do you think because this is
battery powered it's not going to have
the same suction as a normal vacuum but
the motor in here is kind of ridiculous
it spins it like a hundred and twenty
five thousand rpm even though this is so
portable you're really not going to be
losing out on any practicality either as
even though it's going to be really
lightweight you're still getting up to
60 minutes on a single charge when it
comes time to actually empty it out it's
super simple just remove your attachment
open up your trash can and there's a
little button on the bottom here if you
just press all the way down empty
everything out close it up and you're
good to go one of the nice parts about
the Dyson cyclone v10 is the fact that
it is going to be so modular so because
you get so many different options that
all come in the box we can switch the
head over to something that's going to
be a little bit better for hard floors
and we just fire it up easily do it I
feel like I'm in a commercial right now
but once you're done with that say we
can just unhook that set it down we can
switch it over to fully portable mode
with one of these smaller little dudes
so I hook that up and we can you know
fix our a completely realistic in normal
looking scenario of having stuff on a
table but it so works I'm gonna save
these Dyson cyclone v10 is a legitimate
piece of tech when you consider just how
crazy powerful those motors are how
powerful the batteries are the lasts a
full hour as well as all the different
kinds of accessories and stuff it's
pretty cool so of course if you guys
want to check out anything to do with
the Dyson cyclone v10 the link will be
in the description I'm curious do you
think this video sucked I'm sorry I mean
all the way through the video without
making that joke so I just had to get it
in here at the very end let me know in
the comments below and I would get you
with next one can't believe I did that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
