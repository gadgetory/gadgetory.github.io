the gaming demo of the iPod Touch 5th
generation to start with we have wild
blood one of the best looking iOS games
yet this is a hack and slash RPG with
near console quality levels of polish
gameplay is fairly straightforward you
have a few types of attacks and
generally you just need to spam hit
after hit which feels a bit like God of
War
next we have one of the most impressive
games on mobile yet Lily this is a bit
of an odd game first but stick with it
and you'll be in first prize it's all
about stealing flowers off the backs of
spirits who are the rulers of the world
gos not only are the graphics phenomenal
but the sound and art style are
excellent asphalt 7 heat is the latest
in a long line of asphalt games while
I'm more of a fan of racing games like
real racing there's no doubt that
asphalt is an impressive game with tons
of licensed cars an incredibly
fast-paced gameplay it's more of an
arcade style racer with pickups boost
and drifting but it's typically pretty
cheap and fun for a quick blast only one
lap stay on target
one of my new favorite games is bad
piggies while it's not optimized the
larger display just yet
I found myself enjoying this much more
than I ever liked Angry Birds you play
as the pigs this time and both crazy
contractions to get yourself through the
levels and it absolutely works
as with any Rovio game there are tons of
levels and plenty of replayability with
different ways to make it through each
level if you're interested in winning a
brand-new iPod touch I'll be giving one
away soon so be sure to subscribe to the
channel so you don't miss it hit up that
like button if you enjoyed and I will
catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
