Internet Explorer 9 beta so guys this
has just come out today I've had some
time go ahead test it out and overall
I'm pretty impressed with this so I'm
glad to show you guys all what's new and
that kind of stuff so to begin with
let's take a look at the interface which
is much much better and a huge step up
from previous versions of Internet
Explorer so as you can see here they use
a lot of arrow glass which I love arrow
glass it's one of my favorite things in
Windows 7 so I'm really glad that they
brought a lot over you can see here the
tabs use it pretty much the entire
interface uses it which is really really
cool now as you see here they actually
they've changed it quite a bit where the
tab bar and the address bar are now kind
of pushed together at first it really
wasn't liking that I thought it's kind
of you know obviously you can only fit
so many tabs when you're having to share
this space however the more I use it I
think it's actually a pretty nice
feature and of course the wider your the
bigger your monitor is the better it's
going to be but in general I didn't
really think is a big deal you can on my
monitor I can fit four tabs and of
course you can go ahead and fit more and
they just shrink a little bit so not a
big deal at all if you actually want to
come up here the now there's no more
search bar now it's all it's kind of
like on the Chrome on the bar or
basically you can type in URL so you can
also go ahead and type in searches and
all works from the same window so
definitely pretty cool so it works
pretty well now I do want to mention it
is of course a beta so there are a few
issues like actually you take a look
here YouTube videos for example a lot of
the text is whited out I think I
probably has more to do with Flash
Player but yeah so there are a few bugs
and glitches here and there but overall
it's not too bad um so let's go and take
a look at performance which is a big
deal obviously now Internet Explorer or
Internet Explorer in general has always
been pretty slow as far as performance
mean you know last few I mean I haven't
at the Internet Explorer 8 was slower
than pretty much anything else by a huge
amount especially when you compared to
something like Chrome however their new
Explorer 9 does a really good job of
catching up so now I will start by
saying I haven't done all my tests so I
usually do a lot of in-depth testing and
I've really had the time to do that yet
but for my shorter preliminary tests
Internet Explorer 9 seems to be pretty
much on par with Firefox now it's still
a little bit slower than Chrome and
opera
not by a huge amount and it's still
really pretty fast in day to day usage
in addition Internet Explorer 9 also
finally best support html5 so as you can
see here it doesn't scored that well so
we got 96 out of 300
whereas Chrome for example scores about
200
however since they're just starting out
I know I can kind of forgive that they
are finally getting it set up getting a
lot of stuff you know working as far as
html5 so it's definitely good news and
it also does support GPU acceleration so
for certain things actually we'll go
ahead tap into your GPU on your computer
it's basically make text look better
games run better all kinds of stuff like
that so that's definitely good news now
there are a lot of features and I don't
have time man I could spend quite a bit
of time to go ahead talk through all of
them so but one of my favorite ones is
the fact that now all the tabs run as
separate processes just like in Chrome
so what this means is let's say you're
watching YouTube and flash crashes so
you know the whole normally that would
go ahead and crash your entire browser
well however now it would just go ahead
and kill that single tab and restart it
and everything else stays the same and
another way where this kind of shows is
that you can go ahead and pick up and
tear off tabs so go ahead and me
obviously move them around I can go
ahead and picking them up tear them off
and create a new window right here or
I'm go ahead and pick this tab and drop
it down and windows 7 drop it onto the
taskbar so now as you can see here it
actually creates a very similar to like
on Chrome a application shortcut so I'm
going to just click on this it will
instantly open up whatever website at
one and actually continue along with
that Google's actually not the best
example but several web sites including
Facebook and Twitter you actually can go
ahead if you take their site and drop it
down you actually have quite a few
options here so for Facebook with
Twitter you might have new posts check
your messages all kinds of stuff like
that and it's all built in so that's
definitely a pretty cool feature and
definitely will make this really pretty
handy I'm so guys that's just about it
for my review of Internet Explorer 9 in
general I'm really impressed with it and
now of course it could be a little bit
faster a chrome is still a decent bit
faster but to be honest I'm really
impressed with it I mean it's still
plenty fast for day-to-day use now I'm
have to live with the interface just a
little bit longer I've only had for just
a little bit but from my initial
impressions I actually do like quite a
bit the stability has been pretty good
for a beta there's a lot of cool new
features that wasn't able to get on -
such as add-ons there's a new download
manager all that kind of stuff but you
can go ahead and take a look for
yourself anyway guys if you're
interested you can go ahead download it
it is a public beta so you can go ahead
and download it now is only Windows
Vista and Windows 7 only so if you're
still on XP you're not going to be able
to get in an explore mine which is kind
of a cut a little bit odd that Microsoft
was the first company to quit supporting
XP as far as a browser but hating that
big deal so guys that way if you're
interested take a look and download
Internet Explorer 9 and let me know what
you think in the comment section below
anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
