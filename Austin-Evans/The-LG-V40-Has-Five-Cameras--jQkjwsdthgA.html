very interesting year for smartphones
we've lost our friend the headphone jack
and instead we now have notches on
almost every smartphone you can buy and
dual camera setups are everywhere but
what if I told you that there's a
smartphone flagship in 2018 that does
things just a little bit differently the
brand-new LG v 40 think you takes all
the boxes you would expect out of a
modern flagship you're getting that huge
six point four inch OLED display it does
have a notch although it actually is
hidden by default which looks nice and
you're getting that classic glass and
aluminum build with well something's a
little bit different if you look closely
you'll find not one camera not two
cameras but three cameras on the rear
and just to sort of add to that there's
also two front-facing cameras the three
cameras aren't just for show they each
serve a different purpose so the main
camera is what you would expect on most
smartphones
it's a roughly thirty millimeter
equivalent but the wide-angle camera at
16 mil is going to give you a much wider
field of view and the telephoto with a
roughly 2x zoom at around 50 millimetres
is going to get you much much closer to
the action I sound like the the LG ad
right now it'll get you closer to the
action the main camera is the highest
quality of the three now I do have a
wide F 1.5 aperture but there's also
optical image stabilization as well as
dual pixel autofocus that wide-angle can
give you a very different perspective
now to be fair this is something that LG
has been doing on their flagships for a
little while now but usually you lose
out on the telephoto option whereas with
the v40 you literally get at all the
telephoto camera is the weakest of the
three all of that comes down to the
sensor which does seem a bit inferior to
the wide and the standard you don't
quite have the same range and you are
losing some features like it does not
support raw and the color just isn't
quite on par quality wise the v40
cameras do a pretty good job but they're
a little bit different than the iPhones
and the galaxies of the world so out of
the box it's not going to be as punchy
however I think a lot of people were
buying the v40 are going to really be
into sort of customizing and tweaking
their images and there's a lot of
flexibility here specifically thanks to
that raw processing there's just a lot
of dynamic range that you can get out of
the wide and the standard photos it
might not be quite
part would like an SLR or something
that's really impressive what you're
able to get out of this if you don't
mind doing a little bit of editing
low-light performance is pretty
impressive on the standard shooter as is
the bokeh it's very nice
even without the portrait mode and on
top of that the AI cam is actually
decent so like most smartphones in 2018
it has some kind of mode which will give
you a little bit of an optimization
based on what you're taking a photo of
for example if you take a photo of food
it will boost like saturation or
sharpness or whatever the case is
usually I don't find this all that
useful and you can of course turn it off
here but it actually does a pretty good
job out of the box the portrait mode on
the v40 is actually pretty decent so to
be fair we do have pre-release software
so I have noticed a few issues like
sometimes it does a really good job of
cutting you out of the shot but then it
will slightly miss focus but generally
speaking it's pretty solid it is a
little bit weird that you can't take a
portrait mode shot with the telephoto
camera like pretty much every other
phone instead you have to use the main
shooter
I assume that's probably something to do
with the fact that the telephoto camera
isn't as good but there are some cool
modes including a contour lighting modes
very similar to what you're getting on
the iPhone but my favorite is the code
backdrops so as opposed to just cutting
you out and putting like a black
background behind you can pick a bunch
of different colors and some of them
look really nice assuming you don't have
hair or anything that it doesn't like
mat looks great on it this one's top
notch
video is a huge component of the v40 so
as a little test we are now shooting on
the v40 at 4k 24 frames per second you
can't go all the way up to 4k 60 but for
this test because this is a 24 p video
that makes a little more sense we have
the high bitrate mode enabled we are
shooting an HDR 10 and then grading it
down to rec 709 to fit inside
standard YouTube timeline so you guys we
get a good sense of sort of the quality
of the image as well as the audio
because we are using the hi bye audio
that is built into the phone as if three
rear-facing cameras weren't enough you
also have two selfie shooters so one is
going to be a standard email excel and
then we have an extra-wide 5 megapixel
option to be honest I can't tell a huge
difference at first glance between the
two shooters but once you actually
switch over to that wide-angle that can
make the difference between getting your
friends in the shot or only your
favorite friends in the shot the bottom
line is that while it sounds excessive
to have 5 cameras on your smart phone
they actually do all serve a purpose
props tell chief we're not just adding
gimmicky features like a extra depth
sensor or a monochrome sensor all five
lenses really do give you something
different here the v40 continues LG's
trend of nella including a headphone
jack but a properly good one so this is
rocking a 32-bit - wah Zac and what
better way to test that then with the
sponsor of today's video mass drop and
the sennheiser 58 x jubilee headphones
all you do is jump into the LG settings
and enable the high fived ack and we
should have the full power of the phone
so one of the reasons why this actually
is a really good combination is that
these headphones give me that they're
only $150 our proper audiophile grade
and they sound almost identical to the
$500 version of the sennheiser headset
these headphones actually are able to be
driven with a normal headphone jacks if
you want to plug it into a standard
phone or laptop they're going to sound
good but if you have something they can
give them just a little bit more juice
such as the v40 it really does help them
to come alive so you were probably able
to hear my music pretty well with these
and that's because there are open-back
headphones now there are pros and cons
to this design one of the pros is these
like a lot of other high-end headphones
do give you a very wide soundstage -
rich rich sound but on the downside it
is definitely going to be a little more
for home use because well it's not
exactly a stealthy way of listening to
music if you've been curious about
getting into higher end audio the HD 58
X Jubilees are an awesome way to get
into it and right now there are only a
hundred and fifty dollars on not strop
but if you guys know how masks drop
works they're not going to last for long
they've sold over 20,000 of these pairs
of headphones so you'd better get them
soon or you might be waiting quite a
while enough excuse me I'm
to go back to listening to a little bit
of music Tom a LGV 40 and my super dope
headphones coming back to the v40 the
hardware is very similar to a bigger g7
that means you have glass on front and
back with an aluminum build as well as
if a prince sets are right where it
belongs
unfortunately what you're not going to
find is any kind of face unlock but and
I mean fingerprint sensor still works
right the screen looks terrific it's a
six point four inch OLED display with a
1440p resolution and they actually have
a lot of different customization options
as you would kind of expect on a
high-end phone like this that's aimed
for more of the creative wes's of the
world yes I like how the display is
customizable for the creative
professionals like me in the world
thanks boss unfortunately early software
on the v40 means that we can't actually
do our full screen regiment of tests but
based on at least subjective impressions
it looks very accurate although maybe
not quite as bright as stuff like the
iPhone 10s or the note 9 inside you'll
find a snapdragon 845 paired with 6 gigs
of ram as well as 64 gigs of storage and
that is expandable with the micro SD
card slots aka
it has almost the exact same spec as
every other Android flagship in 2018 now
we are shooting this video before the
official announcement so at the moment
we don't have the final price or the
release date but assuming that it is
somewhere in that 800 to $1,000 flagship
range it looks interesting the cameras
really are the selling point of the v40
having three individual options is
something that is legitimately helpful
to have on a phone there's a lot of
potential here and I'll tell you what
this certainly will not be the last
phone we see with three or even five
cameras this year or next year it's
probably going to be a thing now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
