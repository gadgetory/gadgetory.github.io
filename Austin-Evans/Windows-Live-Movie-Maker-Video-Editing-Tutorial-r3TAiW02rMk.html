really be able to read my mind
okay just gotta make sure I really don't
think about it you know what is up guys
that staying here with the tutorial
showing you how to make videos in
Windows Live Movie Maker so as you guys
can see from that video that you just
saw you can do some decent stuff in
moviemaker certainly nothing spectacular
or professional or anything like that
but you can make some decent stuff so I
want to give you guys kind of an
overview a lot of people think that you
need something really hyper you know
professional or what not real expensive
like Vegas or Final Cut or something
like that but there is a surprising
amount of things you can do with the
free Live Movie Maker so of course this
is the interface as you guys can see
here this is the timelines you can see
here's our text here's our video on
music all that kind of stuff
it is not perfect kind of more an
approximation as you guys can see here
just kind of splits it up into a couple
of thumbnails it doesn't really give you
fine-grained control but for a lot of
stuff you don't really need that too
much and if you really do you can kind
of work some work a little bit of magic
to get it to work properly now up top
you'll see that there are quite a few
different options as well there are a
few options there not that many you can
add your videos and photos you had music
you can record straight from your webcam
which is certainly a nice feature
student need to be worrying about some
third-party software whether if you
wanted to you know film something with
your webcam you can do it straight from
Live Movie Maker and then just import it
and edit it just like nothing really
simple you can also do grab screenshots
of the video so for example if I wanted
to do some adding on this particular
clip or scrub ahead a little bit you
know do do
if you want you can do that which is
definitely does come handy sometimes you
make titles captions credits now there
are a couple of auto themes but
particularly I don't really like these
most of this stuff you can do a little
bit better if you just do it manually
but of course there are a few things
that are built in also you can rotate
and whatnot but less so I think you guys
a quick little example of how I did this
so first of all of course I do have my
music if I open up the music tools
dialog there's a few things there's fade
in and out which not again nothing is
really all that fine grained in Live
Movie Maker it's pretty much it's not
like I want it to fade in for a half a
second don't ever know it's going to be
slow medium or fast which it'll work you
also do the music volume that kind of
thing as far as this goes now one of the
big things about video editing just in
general but especially when you're using
something that's not particularly
high-end is be creative you learn how to
improvise so for example with this I
wanted to do a nice long fade in you
know I don't want to just jump straight
into the video so what I did was I just
grabbed a generic black background is
just you know they leave 1280 by 720
just all black and just use it for the
video and just I believe what I do it
for here I'd like nine seconds and then
kind of have it fade in so I mean there
are different things you can do with
just straight images and that's kind of
something you'll learn slowly I mean if
you learn to improvise learn to kind of
do some cool little things to speed up
your editing or make it look a little
bit better definitely will help
especially in life movie makers so I did
that I also did text here so you guys
can say bye head over here the text
tools are actually not half-bad probably
some of the best things in moviemaker
you can select your fonts and colors and
your sizes and all that kind of good
stuff you can even do transparency if
you like you know how long it runs when
it starts all that kind of good stuff
and there are also quite a few different
effects so there's some of the more
basic ones just fade in and now kind of
stretch span your class some of these
are not particularly amazing there are
also some pretty decent ones like for
example this one I think looks rather
nice kinda a little lens flare and kind
of zoom in all kinds of stuff like that
I can zoom all the way anomie there are
some definitely some decent ones in here
I mean not a huge fan like for example
that one and this one don't look
fantastic to me but you can make some
decent looking text and show up on your
video now as far as the video itself
goes
there's not tons you can do with it like
I was saying earlier with the music you
can kind of split it and trim it exactly
where you want so you know you want cut
the beginning of the clip before you
start it or whatever you can do that
pretty simply it can speed up and slow
it down you know you want to make
something somebody run around the fest
or whatever and you do your fade ins and
outs but where the bulk of it is in the
visual effects you can also add
something like blur so for example if I
wanted to make it all out of focus put
some text here kind of draw your focus
to the text instead of the video behind
I could do that there also some kind of
crazier ones like edge detection and you
do want to come makes it look a little
bit like an oil painting I mean there
are some decent effects in here I will
admit me you know certainly some things
that you can definitely use and you know
there are also some standard ones like
black and white with a little bit
filters and whatnot
you can also do some different things
like flip it upside down or add like
effects on the side of it I mean you
know if you can do some things for the
most part though you know you're going
to more want to do some kind of fun ones
like this you know it's not really
something you're going to want to do on
most videos but if you want to kind of
have a little fun with it you certainly
can have it spin around and whatnot as
you guys are probably tell by now movie
maker actually is pretty decent as far
as how the effects go and this works the
same way for animations and whatnot all
you do is just hover over to find the
right chapter all you do is just hover
over and it'll immediately start playing
even if you don't have that particularly
great of a computer it's typically
pretty good so if you want to test
something out
Staffing to drag it and sometimes rig
like on other software you can just drag
it or just hover over rather in or just
fine you also do have a brightness
control so you know it's not bad you're
definitely not going to be able to do
full color correction but if you want to
turn the brightness down a little bit or
up you can certainly do that and the
last thing I want to show you guys is
the animation so uh you know there are a
few animations here so you know some of
these that are a little silly looking
you know it's gonna it's it's live movie
maker you know movie makers always going
to have some kind of silly effects but
there are also some decent ones like
this one I kind of like fade in it's
kind of blurred through black we can
also do it just kind of a crossfade blur
you know there's definitely some
different things you can adjust the
animation or the duration of the
transition kind of suit whatever your
needs are lastly we do have the pan and
zoom so we'll actually pan and zoom
through the video you guys can't see it
too
well here but if I can get a good one so
you guys see here it's kind of zoomed in
it's gonna start slowly panning up on
that big fan of this of course there's
no keyframes of any type on here but you
know if you want some general kind of
things like some panning and zooming and
why not this will work pretty decently
anyway guys that's it for my overview of
Windows Live Movie Maker so what I
really recommend for you guys is just to
check it out it's free you may already
have it on your computer otherwise it's
just a quick free download away and it
very well might be enough to hold you
over from needing to buy that Sony Vegas
or needing to buy Korell video studio or
something like that for a while it will
allow you to do some decent video
editing make some okay stuff I mean what
I've shown you guys here's definitely I
mean it took me maybe 10 min to make
I've seen people do quite a bit better
videos with it so just give it a shot
it's very easy to learn it handles a lot
of formats leave an export and you know
in high-definition or send it you can
send it to YouTube or Facebook or
whatever you want so it's a pretty
decent editor anyway guys if you enjoyed
