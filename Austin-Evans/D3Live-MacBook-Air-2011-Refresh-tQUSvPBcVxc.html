episode of d3 live and today we're going
to be talking about the new macbook air
refresh so of course if you haven't been
keeping up with it it looks like in the
next week or so perhaps even the next
few days Apple will be releasing the
brand new MacBook Airs now of course the
original macbook air which came out
around a year or so ago has been really
well received your had good prices much
better than the original macbook years
and the designs are they were absolutely
top notch by it's probably one of my
favorite laptop designs of all time just
just across the board period but now
looks like they're going to be doing
some refreshes now of course on the good
side they're not going to be doing
anything as far as the hardware goes so
we should have the same designs the same
very small 11 and 13 inch designs on the
macbook airs but where it will differ is
some of the internals so of course we
should have the mini DisplayPort remove
and swapped out with a Thunderbolt
Thunderbolt port of course Thunderbolt
works pretty much the exact same as many
DisplayPort was the added bonus of being
able to be a really really really fast
interconnect on top of that it also will
have some big internal changes including
the new Sandy Bridge processors so one
of the only major problems with the
macbook air when it first came out the
fact that came with a core 2 duo
processor if you have been keeping up
with Intel and CPUs and all the concept
it's basically it's kind of old I
believe it came out couple years ago
certainly not the fastest that you can
get in a even a nice thin light laptop
so it looks like they will be replacing
those with the new core i5 some core i7s
stars like my little be one core i5
model and there will be two core i7
models and of course you can pick me an
11 inch and 13 inches all that kind of
stuff so you definitely should to get a
lot more processing power in the new
back book airs which should be very very
helpful if you're interested in doing
video editing or doing any kind of thing
that's hardcore on the macbook air it
will make it much much faster now beyond
that I don't see a ton of changes I hope
that we would see full gigabytes of RAM
standard in the macbook air that's one
thing two good bites in a thousand all
computer it's a little cheap especially
since you really can't get at it
yourself and you'll upgrade and whatnot
so I really like to see if they can
upgrade it to four gigabytes and most
likely we will probably just see the
integrated graphics in the core i5 and
i7 I don't really see
them adding any kind of dedicated
solution but you never know beyond that
I expected pretty much everything should
stay the same so like I said 11 inch 13
inch she'll should still see the same
keyboards they may be backlit but I
wouldn't really count on that and the
prices should hopefully stay the same
although I wouldn't be surprised if the
13 inch does get bumped up a little bit
on the high end if you choose to get the
very maxed out core i7 model for the
second segment III live we're taking
live questions from everyone in the chat
so of course every episode d3 life is
filming from the live audience we've got
quite a few people in the room right now
so let's just take a couple of questions
do anything released a tiny 64 gigabyte
version again yeah I wouldn't be
surprised I mean even though that's not
a ton of storage for a laptop like the
macbook here which is really thin really
light not totally meant to be a normal
system that's going to you know be
carrying all your data and everything
around you is typically you're going to
have some kind of storage elsewhere
outside the computer I think 64
gigabytes is okay considering it does
have a solid state drive in fact it's
one of the great things about the
macbook air is that it does have that
solid state drive which just makes it so
much faster so much snappier so much
more responsive than a typical laptop
would be so even though 64 gigabytes is
certainly not a lot I think a lot of
people can get by with that and I think
it's definitely worth it to get into
that low one thousand dollar price point
which is that technically that low but
it keeps it from getting any higher than
that I suppose am I going to buy the
ipod touch 5th generation perhaps I'm
not sure I try not to decide if I'm
going to buy anything before I actually
see the information see oh it's got this
and that and you know kinda get a little
bit more information because now all we
have mostly as rumors but more than
likely i probably will i do like the
ipod touch it's a pretty handy little
device so yeah i'll wait and see but
more than likely i will house a new
macbook air compete with new laptops
well i think the macbook air is really
it almost sounds kind of like gold with
cheesy but i think it really almost is
in a class of its own there is really no
other laptop that you can buy that has
the same thinness in the same excellent
excellent design i mean there are other
thin laptops but a lot of them are just
not a lot of them I've never seen any
other laptop that is built as nicely as
you know thin across the board is light
and it's just so well-built I mean not
built a plastic reading like that it's
built out of aluminum and so there are
other laptops that are you know go was
instead of light out Scott specs
whatever but I don't think that there is
a laptop on the market today that can
match it is well in specs and price and
desire I just don't think that's
possible so I really it's kind of hard
to say oh that's you know I can compare
it to this or that so yeah I think that
hopefully answers your question I just
think the macbook air is a fantastical
laptop especially once it gets these new
additions what are the advantages
between opera and chrome which is better
one thing I will be doing a browser test
you guys are familiar i do browser test
from time to time on my channel when new
stuff comes out and so more than likely
i'll be doing at sometime next week a
browser test between operim chrome so i
don't want to get into which is better
just yet hopefully the browser test will
help answer that question but i will say
the new version of opera 11.5 is
fantastic i really really like it on
this couple of new features as far as a
speed dial and that kind of stuff but i
really like us to you why it's a lot
cleaner it's a lot more sleep a little
bit smaller before i thought it's kind
of a little bit too big almost
cartoonish really big like chrome is but
they really pared it down i think they
did a great job so i'm really looking
forward to testing out opera as far as
you know the specs and that specs but
the the x and scores not kind of stuff
but just right off the bat i really do
like opera source that designer not kind
stuff goes will it be new close to the
new macbook air well there was a rumor
that we may be getting a black macbook
gear of course if you guys are not
familiar typically laptops apple laptops
used to be just white and then they came
out with the aluminum ones which reports
were kind of silver but they were there
was editor at one time a black macbook
air macbook original macbook just just
straight macbook i near the plastic one
there was a black version of that how
old they don't make that anymore but
there was a wisdom talk they may be
bringing that back with the macbook air
which I you know the standard kind of
silver aluminum finish as well as some
kind of black personally comment the
backlit keyboard I think it's possible
but I wouldn't definitely a plan on
getting one man it very well might
happen but like I said I'm not really
sold on it's definitely definitely gonna
be able to see that anyway guys that's
it for this week's episode III live you
