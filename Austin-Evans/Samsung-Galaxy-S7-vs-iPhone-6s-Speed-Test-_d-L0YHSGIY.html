Samsung Galaxy s7 the fastest phone out
there to find out let's pit it against
the current fastest phone out there the
iPhone 6s plus even though these are too
high-end phones with 5.5 inch screens
they actually have a lot of differences
the galaxy s7 is driving some serious
specs with a quad-core snapdragon 820
processor 4 gigabytes of RAM and Adreno
530 graphics on the other hand the
iPhone is no slouch either with a
dual-core Apple a9 chip 2 gigabytes of
RAM and power VR graphics specs are
great on paper but the real question is
how do they actually perform to find out
let's turn to the Geekbench 3 test which
primarily focuses on the CPU side
Geekbench does a good job of testing
real-world performance a phone that does
well here is going to be noticeably
faster during normal day-to-day tasks
such as web browsing and installing apps
considering that the galaxy s7 has twice
as many quarters as the iPhone it gets a
small but substantial lead in the multi
thread side however for single toy
performance the iPhone is still king
even though it's fairly close the galaxy
s7 pulled out a small but noticeable win
here next we've got GFX bench which is
all about testing the graphics
performance so this is important for
making sure the phone is nice and smooth
as well as how it can handle gaming one
of the big differences between the
iPhone and the galaxy s7 are the screens
while the iPhone has a fairly standard
1080p screen the galaxy s7 has a much
more pixel dense 1440p panel which means
that the processor inside has to do a
lot more work to keep things running
smoothly you can see the difference here
when you rang the man had an on screen
test the iPhone is able to pull 38
frames per second where the galaxy s7 is
only able to pull out 29 however if you
take the screens add the equation and
just want to see which one has the most
raw power you'll find the galaxy s7 wins
out here with 47 frames per second
versus only 40 on the iPhone don't get
me wrong these are absolutely two of the
fastest films out there right now
however as far as raw performance goes
the galaxy s7 also pulls out the win
here one feature is becoming more and
more important these days is a
fingerprint reader
both the iPhone and galaxy s7 have them
however I wanted to find out which one
is actually faster the first glance both
phones are incredibly fast scanning your
fingerprint unlocking the phone just
about as fast as you can press the
button however if you want you back in
slow motion you'll see the galaxy s7 is
a bit faster
mostly because it gets you immediately
to the home screen where the iPhone
spends a second giving you a big
animation bringing all your icons on
screen it looks cool but it wastes time
galaxy Assefa is just faster here
what comes to tap to focus both are
really solid so if I had to pick a
winner I would narrowly give it to the
galaxy s7 while both are solid the s7
seems to be just a little bit quicker
and just a little bit more accurate than
the iPhone since both phones can capture
4k video my next test is to capture 30
seconds on each phone and then export it
to see how long it takes
here the iPhone has a major advantage
thanks to iMovie not only is this a
fairly solid video editor but it also is
much faster at exporting videos in the
galaxy s7 there's no doubt that the
iPhone 6s is one of the fastest phones
out there but the galaxy s7 edges it out
yeah I did that that just happened I'm
really proud of myself right now if you
guys want to see how the galaxy has
seven fares in a water test I want a
chance to win a brand new one check out
the link in the description my buddy Jon
and I are going to be giving away a
brand new s7 or s7 edge anyway guys what
do you think about the s7 let me know in
the comments below and I will catch you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
