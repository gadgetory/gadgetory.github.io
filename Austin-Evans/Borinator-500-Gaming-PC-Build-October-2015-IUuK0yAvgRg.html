to do a 500 gaming PC build right right
so plan is we need to get out of here
with 500 all over the parts trying to
get an idea of like prices around here
this all looks roughly what I would see
in the u.s. no nevermind I take it back
that's like 150 okay it's way more
expensive here this may be a slight
problem
Oh $300 power supply Oh welcome to
Canada
I'm just realizing how screwed we might
be right now pro tip for how to shop at
NCIX okay you don't walk around in the
aisles you look at what's on the weekly
special here okay that that looks good
so yeah I Drive 60 bucks kennedys I'm
gonna need like a Canadian translator
right there that's singling a good deal
American uh yeah so that's about 42
dollars okay that's that's a good deal
for a one chair okay here I'm gonna go
borrow a pen and paper okay it's a good
idea all right what am i doing what if
we go to 1358 we could do talking back
and work right we discovered that
certain newer games
I believe farcry 4 farcry 4 and Grand
Theft Auto were among them and simply
don't run low on a dual-core anymore
should we try and get a multifunction
printer into the budget will totally
work $5 for printer I mean everyone
needs an underdog printer with a $5
gaming PC it took CK right there it's
$92 $92 well guess that makes sense us
that's about what it would cost like
it's like usually like new yellers
something like that that's actually a
good deal oh here's a 950 $220 I mean I
really wanted to use a 950 I did not
realize it's gonna be that expensive
feel this squeeze it like 254 960 does
not sound right the 950 is 220 could we
use another 30 bucks and get a 960
that's $200 for the graphic starting to
find on a dollar bill that would be
tricky 250 Canadian 200 u.s. effectively
like 1 190 u.s. really hold on what
about this Coolermaster elite 350 with
the 500 watt power supply Oh
63 bucks including a power supply and
it's not great 500 more I'm sure it's
not but it should be okay if we do this
it's $63 what we're gonna pay $40 for
the power supply
yeah we were gonna pay 40 bucks for the
power supply before us
we were getting a case for $23 which
we're not okay so basically right now we
think we've got it I'm feeling pretty
good about this we actually have $50
left which is a first for a five dollar
bill that's a lot of money first things
first the processor design socket
wah-wah so you have a 6300 in stock at
63 yes so that's six seventy ten dollars
over your five hundred dollar budget why
don't you just be somewhat flexible for
once in your life Austin this is six
hundred and seventy dollars Canadian so
we're being pretty flexible right now
but I think that's that's dual can you
do too cuz really it's only seven
dollars the title of this video is going
to be five hundred eight dollar gaming
PC how you feeling right now I'm feeling
good I think we just got like a wicked
system that is yeah completely bowled
over your last five hundred dollar
machine no I'm actually really surprised
I was like hoping maybe we get a 950 but
I 9/16 of strix
so you process your hybrid hard drive
it's a memory that's so cool oh man I
think we're business is feeling good we
got this let's do this thing so this is
the FX 6300 it's a six core or a hex
core processor if you want to be all
fancy is that she should be pretty good
I think it might not be the greatest
thing in the world for gaming but for
what we're gonna do especially with a
960 I mean I probably put like you know
a pair of nine 80s with this thing but I
mean I'm not put together nandi system
in a little while which means I'd put
this in what it's worth because their
platform hasn't changed in the last
all right back to work so lioness would
you care to do the honors of exactly how
you should put their own face on I heard
you're supposed to put a credit
card-sized goop on top and then you wipe
it in with your hand correct
okay so hello I'm following the
instructions credit card-sized and then
goop it with your hands is that what you
said oh people gonna kill us with Ovid's
one of the co six cores is probably
right here so that's why there's a
concentration of thermal goop and this
tutorial is off to a great start
see like I was so excited cuz this is
gonna be like a great tutorial you're
going to learn a lot of stuff it's gonna
be like awesome everyone gets their own
PC and then this happens I have faith
that you can get this one right no no no
sorry well that was that one there you
go see it was afraid you were a moron
for a second but now I feel better now
give it a knife on you alright so we
actually bought here this is where we
saved all the money right so this was
170 bucks this is a case with a 500 watt
power supply a schoolmaster so I think
it should be alright 360 what what what
are you doing home
Oh 130 on the five oh wow great oh I'm
glad that we have a nice silver I owe
sealed to go with our nice silver case
so everything matches and it's super
cheap nests but hey who cares you're
gonna be like you gotta have to look so
many FPS in your gains like it won't
even matter like your eyes will be
bleeding from like the awesomeness that
you only be able to look at your case
dude this is like not a bad PC actually
it's a good point yeah everything is
everything's legit here this is actually
a really simple build like if this like
got someone's first like PC like this is
really straightforward there's not like
anything too crazy power supply comes
pre-installed everything's really nice
and that even though I usually recommend
like micro ATX cases because usually it
a little smaller and they tend to be a
little bit cheaper but something like
this you definitely have a little bit
more room to work it's not anywhere near
as cramped man these K I'm actually
legitimately embarrassed about like how
bad these cables are right now and
here's the boring stuff that no one
cares about but we have to show anyway
because we want to be
and professional about our videos full
jokes we are alive well it wants to yeah
I mean that would be cool
generally kind of helpful
welcome to the magnificence of the Borah
mayor

card is actually not boring a case
