worth it
so Nintendo hooked us up with one of
these very first switches so I'm curious
to see what we actually get in the
blocks so inside we immediately get the
actual switch console itself now as you
can see without the joy con this looks
exactly like a tiny tablet speaking Navi
much bigger than like a phone so for
size comparison this is the switch next
to an iPhone 7 plus music oisin might
even fit in a pocket oh yeah but of
course we do need to add the
controller's which are right here so
these are the joy con controllers the
way they work is they just slide onto a
rail and that's it so once we add both
of them the switch definitely gets a
little bit bigger but a lot smaller than
the Wii U gamepad so inside yes you get
quite a few accessories starting with a
full size HDMI cable we've actually got
a standard USB C cable so the cool
things about the switch is that if we
just plug it in here we should be able
to charge it but you can also use that
USB C to drop it on the dock or bike you
could probably even use something like a
battery bank to charge the switch while
you're on the go we also have the joy
con grip so if you want to use the joy
con by itself you can just slide this
guy on it gives you better access to the
top button and of course a very very
secure and safe strap this is what
safety looks like by the way there also
is the joy card grip so in addition to
be able to use them individually or with
a switch you can also snap them in here
so if we slide the second joique on on
this is pretty similar to what you would
find with a standard console controller
but the cool part is not only can you
use it like this but we can just pop the
kickstand out on the switch you can
imagine if you have yourself a nice
little portable gaming setup so we've
got ourselves a tiny little bit of
paperwork so good job on not including
an enormous user manual when I assume is
the actual dock for the switch so what
this guy will do is not only power the
switch but it also will give you HDMI
out to a TV so if we pop open this door
here you'll see the port for the AC
adapter
there's USB 3 port as well as HDMI out
on the side there's also a pair of USB
port here so what's cool about this is
it all runs off of the single USBC port
on the bottom of the switch so when you
dock the switch it pretty much just
rests in place so it doesn't take a
whole lot of force to pick it up and
when you're ready to actually gain
portable mode you can just slide your
joy cards on and finish like that you
have the full switch experience so even
with the joy on detach the switch is
still pretty small there's actually a
lot going on here
on top there's the power button and the
volume rocker you have the exhaust as
well as the headphone jacks and the slot
for the game cartridge speaking of games
we have the Legend of Zelda breath as a
while so if you pop it open you'll see
that the switch Karsten so our pretty
tiny
so not only our swish game smaller than
the 3d at cards where they're even
smaller than an SD card on bottom of the
switch there's not much you have that
USB C port for charging as well as
connecting to the dock and around back
you have the kickstand as well as hiding
behind that is the micro SD card slot
that's not going to be important as the
switch itself only shifts with 32
gigabytes of storage so in theory you
can put up to a two terabyte micro SD in
here but realistically right now you're
maxing out at around 256 gigabytes which
should still be a fair bit of storage
for the switch even though they look the
same the droid colored controllers are
actually different so the right one has
the X Y a B buttons up top and it has
the stick on bottom and on the very
bottom of the controller there's an IR
sensor take a look at the second joy con
you'll see the analog stick is on the
top so when you're using them separately
or together in the actual grip you'll
find that the sticks are actually offset
which feels much more like an Xbox
controller than something like the ps4
the first thing that jumps out to me is
the interface on the switch looks so
much better than the Wii U so now that
we have a class of touchscreen which
makes things feel a lot better but
everything just looks clean look a lot
less cartoony than previous Nintendo
consoles so let's switch has 32 gigs of
storage out of the box you only have
25.9 gigs of free space now with a
couple of this I do feel like I would
probably be buying more physical games
than digital if you're planning on that
you really should look into a microSD
card since we got to switch early we're
missing some major features such as the
eShop but that will be coming in a day
one update when the console launches on
Friday so we can't test everything right
now what we can do is play some games
one of my favorite parts which is just
how seamless it is so right now I can be
playing on the normal handheld mode but
if I drop it onto the dock you'll see
that almost immediately will come right
over to the TV so you can imagine that
you play on the TV for a few minutes
whatever the case is and when you're
done you pick the switch right up and
it's
right back on the display out of all the
modes for the switch my favorite might
just be handheld so this is the switch
by itself with the joy Kahn's attached
and it feels good so one of the biggest
differences here is when you actually
compare it to the Wii U gamepad so from
the front they look about the same but
when you compare the thickness
especially it is a huge difference of
course keep in mind is the Wii U gamepad
had to be tethered to a full Wii U
console whereas with the switch sure
there's a dock because you don't use
that at all
you can absolutely take this on the go
no problem you can also use the
kickstand so if I pop off the joique on
all I need to do is kick the kick stand
out and I can set it down so the cool
part about this is that you're really
not losing any control and honestly I
kind of like the idea of having full
freedom and I have to kind of keep my
hands nice and tight boid problem is the
kickstand isn't happy graded it works
fine on a table like this if you try to
set it down on something uneven like a
couch it's going to immediately fall
over so some reviewers have had issues
with the left joy condi syncing from
their switch however I haven't had any
issues Mellie has been really reliable
but being able to drop them on take them
off it's all been super seamless so far
the joint lines really are one my
favorite parts of the switch it's a nice
table just drop it on the dock slide the
controller's off not only can I use
these guys separately if I want more of
a console experience I can slide them
onto the grip accessory and play it like
this the grip controller is decent but I
feel like my hands are slightly too
close together honestly my favorite way
of playing on the TV is really just
using the joi cons by themselves it's
nice and comfortable and especially when
you look at this as a full package
Nintendo has done a really good job
there are a lot of moving pieces here
with the removable controllers and the
dock and everything but it does
completely work seamlessly together
interestingly the switch has two
different performance modes when you're
playing handheld on battery it runs at a
lower clock speed when you drop it on
the dock it over doubles the performance
now the main reason for that is that
while this has a 720p screen when you
connect it to a TV you can run it up to
1080p now while some people's complains
at 720p seems like it's kind of low
honestly the screen looks fine and I
would much rather have better battery
life and better performance it's a
slightly lower red screen and there's
something that's more high-end but
completely kills the battery light
speaking of the switch is launching a
4310 milliamp hour battery now that's
decent but it's not that much bigger
than most smartphone and Nintendo says
that you should expect about three hours
on a charge
you're playing an intense game like
Zelda and I might testing that sounds
about right
it's pieces but nothing spectacular
there are a couple of ways to charge
from the switch by far the easiest is to
just drop it on the dock not only will
that give you the TV out there also will
charge down as a console but also the
joy Conn controllers however since it's
got a USB C port you have other options
such as using something like the MacBook
Pro charger you can also use battery
banks but you do need to be careful that
they will supply enough power
however because of that USB C port you
have a lot of options for topping this
guy off the Nintendo switch is
hands-down the most colorful portable
console ever now yes some might call it
a little bit gimmicky but honestly it
works and it works really well sure
there might not be a ton of games at
launch however when you consider just
how cool and unique this thing is it is
absolutely worth it so what do you guys
think about the switch let me know in
the comments below and I will catch you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
