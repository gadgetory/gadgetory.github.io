CES with NVIDIA about to take a look at
GeForce now so not only were they
awesome enough to sponsor this video but
he just caught my video a couple months
ago where I took a look at GeForce now
for the Mac you know that actually works
pretty well so in that video I was using
a 2009 MacBook I got for 200 ollars on
eBay and playing proper PC games using
the internet game stream tech which
sounds really exciting and fancy now not
only is that still around but today
we're actually able to also play now on
the PC one of the big advantages of
GeForce now is that you can play games
on hardware that you normally couldn't
so take for example this this is the HP
stream and it's a 200 oh a laptop I've
actually done a video on this a little
while back and while it's not a bad
computer gaming is definitely not its
strong suits since this is cloud gaming
we are relying on having a decent
internet connection so this guy is gonna
be hardwired in but beyond that the
requirements actually aren't too crazy
in addition to GeForce now being
available for the PC there are also now
some you play games available which is
why I'm playing Rainbow six okay that's
not good this is a lot of fun something
I'm noticing here is that the latency
really just is not that bad even when I
get into gunfights the main thing that
kills me is uh you know my expert skills
one of the nice parts about this is that
because we are playing via the cloud
we're actually able to crank the
settings up pretty high I'm curious what
are we actually running out right now
running at very high settings on a Tesla
p40 because you know exactly what I want
to play on my 200 a laptop since I did
my last video GeForce now has seen some
updates including there's now an actual
search function so if you want to look
for a specific game you can do that now
what's even more exciting is there's now
an ultra streaming mode the idea here is
that in the cloud the game is going to
be running at 120 frames per second and
then you're going to still get a 60
frames per second feed to your computer
the idea is is that that will help to
cut down on some latency now it's not
supported on all games one game that is
supported is fortnight something
interesting here is that we're playing
on a slightly higher in computer so this
is like a standard Ultrabook and while
it has a nicer screen which is
definitely helpful the actual experience
of playing the game should be the exact
same so like five seconds in I can tell
that this is actually a slightly
smoother experience so while there's
very little latency on this side having
the game run 120 Hertz even though I
actually don't have 120 Hertz panel just
does cut down latency ever that much
also I deployed my parachute way too
early and actually what's interesting is
so in Las Vegas right now the actual
server were playing this on is in Los
Angeles which is a few hundred miles
away next we have pub G which is the
most popular game on g-force now and
well basically everywhere else so the
demo here is we have two identical 400
laptops
one running the game natively at a
slightly less than optimal two frames
per second on low and the other running
the game at full KP 60 on wall g-force
now so what's kind of interesting and
something very helpful that Nvidia has
provided is a full chart showing the
performance gains you can expect when
you stop using the integrated graphics
on your laptop and as you can see these
numbers are much higher look I don't
have to do this this is something I
don't need to do but I'm gonna try to
play pub G at 2 frames per second
because I don't have a good reason
actually I'm gonna try it it's a really
impressive experience I've got to say
the the graphics are unrivaled and the
frame rate is what some would call
buttery smooth I mean there's less than
probably 5 seconds of latency between
when I had a button and when I actually
see my character move on screen I stop
there he stopped anyway I'm gonna move
on to g-force now I think that's thrill
though this is a great demo of what
makes g-force now really interesting the
idea that with a 400 laptop that has
pretty low-end internals I mean this is
like a Pentium that's able to play games
like pop G at a really nice and smooth
frame rate obviously you need a good
internet connection but it almost even
makes more sense with pub G because you
need a good internet connection to play
it anyway
odds are if you're going to be playing
this you're gonna have an internet
connection that's going to be digit
enough to actually be able to stream the
game
I mean pub G is maybe not the greatest
looking game in the world but especially
the last few patches really have made
look nice and the desert map actually
looks pretty decent although I know
nothing about where anything is right
now oh oh hello hello hello no no no we
don't yeah there we go I got one kill I
feel very proud and accomplished that I
caught a guy as he was running out of a
building and successfully got him
okay so well the G Force now beta for
Mac has been out for a few months it is
now available for PC and it is still
free at least Intel Nvidia comes to
their senses now the cool thing is that
if you were already on the Mac beta you
can get on this immediately but
if you haven't tried it at all yet you
can get on the waitlist and they're
going to be adding more people every
week so if you guys have not tried this
it is definitely worth a look but what
do you guys think about g-force now let
me know in the comments below and I will
catch you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
