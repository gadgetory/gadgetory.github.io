here live at CES 2012 with the Nikon d4
so as you guys can see it right here it
looks pretty awesome course it is on a
full-rigged that's why can go over some
of the features so of course this is
going to be the full frame nikon camera
it's going to be the successor to the
d3s as you guys can see here it is of
course built pretty awesome made a full
metal construction walk around to the
back here you'll be able to see it has
have a bit of bit larger display I
believe it's about 3.2 inches or so
really monster monster camera so the
features is I believe it has about a 16
megapixel sensor don't quote me on that
I believe it's about 16 megapixels as an
iso ceiling of over 200,000 which is
ridiculous things going to literally be
able to see in the dark it also has some
improvements to video mode and in
general i believe all the buttons are
backlit as well so very very impressive
stuff from the folks over at nikon and
i'm gonna sleep they'll let me keep one
but anyway guys it's gonna be about it
for my hands on of the nikon d4
definitely sure to subscribe to the
channel for more camera reviews
