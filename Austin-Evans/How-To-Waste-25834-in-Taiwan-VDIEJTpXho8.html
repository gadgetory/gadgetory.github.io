mystery Tech International with a
certain special guest
this is sap from super soft TV I was
gonna say hey guys do it sure with the
Gwang want digital plaza here in Taipei
and I think inside this giant seven
storey and enormous tech mile we might
be able to find a couple of weird things
I think so I've not done this before so
I'm excited seventy seven hundred new
Taiwan dollars equals two hundred and
fifty eight dollars in the United States
so that's actually a pretty decent
budget I think I'm talking about that's
about two hundred pounds so it's not too
bad I'm sure we can find some weird
stuff in that month let's do it which is
interesting it's which of those little
stores in here everything looks familiar
right now so far like where's where's
the weed stuff we need to get out of the
cool area and we need to find the weird
stuff I think that's where we're
actually going to be able to afford
something yeah we need to I don't know
like maybe some funky cases funky
accessories
I wish paid more money I feel like
there's an ATM oh did our budget just
magically increase this ATM means
something different here unless it's
inside there I'm not going in you go for
it wait wait wait look at the door look
at the clock
is it locked oh wait what's that stuff
it was yeah so you're almost causing it
that would have got to be monetized that
that would definitely be be monetized Oh
bad look HTC Desire does that look like
one of the desires right I think this is
just a generic thing just saying what's
upstairs
oh but look PC games and video games
vehicle video records so I'm guessing
like dash cams this seems like more in
our price range in our budget let's go
one minute 37 seconds later it's out its
out of our budget
that's why everything that happened here
have you ever used one of these I have
not the Wickham yeah yeah obviously
that's that's what I use absolutely yeah
yeah oh look at okay this this is cool
oh yo does that actually work I I think
it's got it's probably got like
something like Tetris on there are some
pho oh that's awesome so that is pretty
cool Oh aha aha
that's actually even better that looks
like a proper Gameboy
this iPhone 7 that's better point 7 n8 8
as well okay have you seen this check
this out this is like it looks like a
you know one of those Auto Clips oh yeah
yeah ok let's try it let's try the under
selfies let's take a wide selfie ok ok
it's working it's working that's that's
pretty white Oh the selfie light what
we're buying this I'm not even gonna
look at it we'll take it we'll take it
alright so we update time do you have
left
SAFF just spent all of our money and
we've been here for five minutes so so
far we found cameras we found processors
a lot of computers it seems like the
farther up we go the weirder stuff we
found but not really anything that's all
that crazy it reads a sim what is this
these SD micro SD XD compact flash but
it reads the SIM card how could you
possibly read a SIM card I don't know
I'm really curious to find out so I
think we should I think we should take
it I'm too
I'm too easily convinced no 350 I'm done
with that okay we're gonna try this out
okay alright so we're gonna find out
what it does when you put a SIM card
inside how does it connect it's just USB
right yeah I don't know if there's like
some software check your contacts or
something about I'm really curious yeah
maybe it is a contact thing possibly do
they have a SIM card reader here all
they do
Wow I wonder if some of these stores are
connected to that it's also 350 so we
didn't get ripped off we've got Ken's
girlfriend's GPS how much can we buy the
girlfriend could we buy the girlfriend
will it fit in a suitcase will she fit
in a suitcase looks like a carry-on
right so the thing with this place is
not only do we have all of these floors
but there's also going to be an entire
separate building - I wonder how many
actual stores are yeah I think we need
to be a little bit more sort of careful
with our spending mm-hmm yeah I agree
careful definitely the phrase this looks
promising so it's like giant air pots
the ice setting that's tws alright let's
go get this okay
you know hey hello this how much oh we
can do that yes a budget that's probably
the coolest thing that we've found so
far I've never seen these before they
look really cool yeah I mean they're big
see they're like very large air but
sipping it in airports all right so with
our air pods in hand things are looking
much better now we're down to four
thousands we have 500 all right 3,500
3,500 okay yeah
just every single cable you could ever
ask for hang on you have any dongles Oh
dongho's my friend we've got dongles
this is actually spent yeah it does
oh this okay one of them is a speaker
the other to it we're gonna do that but
it's external vigilance in a speaker
yeah yeah okay let's do let's do it with
what color do you want
we're gonna do blue right okay yeah cool
can we get this and got our fitness
center in hand this is coming on pretty
well fidget speeder bluetooth I like how
you saw it yeah you're nice I don't like
to happen what is that I think that was
pretty successful I think so we've got
some pretty weird stuff I think we also
didn't spend all our money right what do
you have left
look
I think it's uh maybe a couple of
thousand I've got a thousand I've
literally just got a thousand I've got a
thousand fifteen
I've got 1,600 so we've got 2600 left so
she's not too bad not too bad let's uh
let's go see if any of this stuff is
complete garbage or not yeah I mean
looks quite interesting six thousand
miles later we have our mystery Tech in
hand this should be fun or really lame
having said yes
our first item is the ATM 101
digi-fusion which again I don't
understand how it's supposed to read SIM
cards it's got to be the contacts so
here's the reader which is actually kind
of small although it doesn't she have a
captive USB cable oh look at that we're
sitting up smart card whoa okay so shows
oh oh so smart card and USB to crw okay
well if I open up file I see nothing how
disappointed I thought it's gonna be
really cool but it uh I don't know I
don't understand what you actually might
do that next up we have the Gameboy case
so this I'm kind of curious about
there's actually wait do you ever
actually see if this thing turns on the
game machine designed a mobile phone
case which has been taped closed so yeah
alright well it's actually not that
thick oh we need a battery for it okay
that explains why it wasn't working in
the store do we have a watch battery oh
it keeps coming out the battery's not in
there very securely at all wait just
resetting know every time I hit a button
it just resets you see this no matter
what I do it just resets oh I don't know
how I just did that it's I'm doing a
game okay oh I can shoot them oh that
makes so much more sense yeah okay so
once you actually somehow get the game
working it's kind of fun I will say the
case this is actually not that bad it's
not going to be that much thicker than a
standard iPhone and
even if you're not using it as a game
this Kyllo school in the back next up we
have the beauty speaker which I'm very
very deeply skeptical of so I guess the
way this is supposed to work is it plugs
into your headphone jack and this is the
whole thing so you've got a headphone
jack on the bottom a speaker on this
side and a light on this side oh whoa
okay that's that's a selfie light whoa
start taking a selfie here see how
beautiful I am now I guess it makes a
little bit of a difference it's um no I
you really gotta up the selfie game you
could get a little a little bit of
action but I don't think it's that great
I think it's a little too bright and
sort of in-your-face
I really see it's a speaker works so
it's not very good it doesn't sound any
louder than a phone speaker and it's way
tenure and plus I don't like the idea
that I have to unplug and replug it in
every couple minutes just to get it to
you know not sound like garbage next we
have the one-and-only wireless music
spinner this is gonna be probably not
very good okay connect it successfully
sounds good to me
that actually might be one of the worst
sounding speakers I've ever heard in my
life
it sounds like it's not a high quality
Bluetooth device but most importantly I
can unplug it and do this hmm
but that's still cool right now this
actually might not be that bad this is a
flashlight in three and one camera lens
so in theory this should pretty much
clip on to any smartphone open this guy
up and it's actually kind of nice
packaging so I forgot we got the pink
one alright so I don't know how you get
three lenses
oh there's actually so there's a point
for two point six magnification
wide-angle lens or you can take it off
to get a macro lens if you want a macro
selfie or you can take the whole thing
off and get nothing there we go that
looks about right wait Ken turn the
light on oh wow that's actually kind of
brave so if I hit oh I can oh wow okay
so you can actually Frankie oh should I
look to bat alright umm it's not the
sharpest thing in the world but you can
definitely see a difference with the
light versus not although I don't know
maybe my selfie game isn't strong enough
yeah you what something that's not
terrible I'll take it that's actually
kind of cool now this is what I'm kind
of excited to try the i7s okay well I
just don't know what the full name of it
is but what I do know is that this is
pretty much a straight earpods clone oh
wow okay so the first thing to notice is
that that is much much larger than the
normal ear pods case I will say one
thing
these are significantly bigger than air
pods they're a lot sort of chunkier but
the actual ear tips themselves look to
be fairly similar and they do have a
button on each side so let's give this a
try oh so they both connect as
independent speakers right wait and so
what happens if I try to play music
which one does it play out of it plays
out of the right one now real ear pods
are in a completely different league
this is kind of barely usable assuming
that I could get them to actually pair
together correctly they still sound that
great I mean it's kind of cool to have
wireless headphones that are in a very
sort of similar form factor to air pods
but uh romantic with the real thing on
these</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
