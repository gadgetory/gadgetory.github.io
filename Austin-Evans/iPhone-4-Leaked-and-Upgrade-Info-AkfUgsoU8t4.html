today I am really glad that I don't want
for Apple yeah guys it's happened again
they have lost another iPhone 4
prototype I don't know what kind of
what's going on they never leave the
prototypes also now they're like all
over the place but this one new one
actually has been torn down got some
pretty interesting things and internally
as well as it's a little bit higher
quality there's been a few changes from
the Gizmodo prototype so I'll run you
guys through it as well as talked a
little bit about what we might be
looking for as a release date as far as
people being able to actually upgrade
but I'll get all into that in a minute
anyway
let's get this one started this latest
technology covering everything
okay guys so again story on how they
found this one's a little unclear it's
actually it was not found here but is
rather found in Vietnam so the
Vietnamese website on how they got it
I'm gonna get into that but but they've
got a lot of pictures which I will go
ahead and show it throughout my talking
of the video on what that means but yeah
they've got a lot of pictures that show
the new iPhone and there's a few key
things first of all this one has now
shows instead of jet before that said xx
gigabytes and so you know showing how
how many gigabytes that I had this one
says 16 gigabytes so we do know that
it's not it's going to at least have 16
gigabytes which maybe they thought they
found was the base model another key
thing is that when you look at it the
fit and finish compared to the other
prototype it looks much better
as you see especially on when you look
at the bottom of the iPhone where the
where the speaker girls are you now see
that there are two left screws there so
obviously either that one was an earlier
prototype or this one is this one's
either a very late prototype or an
actual production device I'm kind of
lean towards it's probably out of
production device but we don't know so
all the way around the phone you can see
it looks much nicer fit and finish is
very very exact you know for those of
you who saw the for the first prototype
and you know kind of long fence take a
look at this one some of these pictures
actually I really like it it looks
really solid
I'm not big is moto iPhone this one
actually seems to be somewhat working
all the pictures and video they have
shows that it's on the screen is on and
been showing like a development version
and focus the fireball which apparently
has been seen on prototype iPhones
before so unfortunately it still doesn't
work as a full life own way as you can't
tell you know any kind of goodies about
you know iPhone OS 4 for it or anything
like that but it does look pretty cool
so guys one of the more important things
I think that we found it through all
this prototype is that it looks like it
does have at the very least an Apple a4
processor which is the same as on the
iPad and it gets better I think not only
is it going to be maybe some
it'll very least but actually has the
scent a lot of the same model numbers
when you look at the two processors and
the iPad processor so we very well could
have just as fast the iPad just brought
down for the iPhone now on a slightly
different note I've actually got some
good news if you plan on buying this one
as well as the possible release date so
if you guys probably know if you're
about an iPhone in the past especially
if you tried to get more than one of
course AT&amp;amp;T in the US has basically they
let you upgrade now most of the time
it's to eat every two years but if
you're on ATT if you pay more than $100
a month for your bill then a lot of
times they will do between 12 and 18
months ahead so let's say you bought an
iPhone 3GS on the release date last year
well if you pay more than hundred
dollars a month then the earliest you
could go ahead and be eligible for a
cheap upgrade likely like $200 so the
owner should be eligible for that
upgrade would be a year two years of the
day this year okay so a lot of people
were complaining that last year with the
3GS because not many people had had a 3G
and they wanted to upgrade to 3GS and I
couldn't well it looks like a teen teen
might be taking steps to prevent this
now they looks like they've changed the
eligibility rules so that they've pulled
them back a lot of people it was saying
November 21st but now it's all of a
sudden showing June 21st so this kind of
votes well the June 21st is a date a lot
of people have been looking at you know
towards the end of June for it to
actually be released so if you very well
could be especially if you bought your
iPhone 3GS
right when it came out you very well go
ahead and be able to upgrade to the 4G
for just the standard you know usually
$200 price that's really good news
anyway guys that's it for all I phone
for GHD 4i we still need to know the
name of this thing but whatever the next
iPhone we got a lot more information on
it actually we got most of that all
information we can get until it comes
out really no no how many more
prototypes fancy but anyway guys
definitely let me know in the comments
what do you think now that you seen new
pictures which looks to be a very close
to final if not as
we file design if you're what do you
think you like it more if you didn't
like it before do you like it now if you
still liked it before we like it better
now just let me know what you think guys
and especially let me know if you think
what you think about the eligibility if
you know if you wanted to upgrade to
this you definitely want to pay
attention to what day you bought your
previous iPhone because that will kind
of really affect when you can get this
next one of course if you want it but
you know anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
