here with a closer look at the Nintendo
2ds so at first glance it looks a lot
like a 3ds that someone flattened
however there's a little bit more to it
than that once you crack open the box
you'll find a few things including the
Nintendo AR cards for the built-in mini
game a giant manual to explain important
stuff I'm sure and the power adapter
which is the same as other 3ds a--'s and
the DSi you'll also find a four gigabyte
SD card included inside the console the
biggest difference with the two DS is
the lack of any 3d well that sounds
exactly like a normal DS at first it
actually makes sense I know I almost
never turn the 3d on while playing so I
imagine a lot of people will have no
problem with the change even though it
is called the two DS
you can still play both 3ds and normal
DS games on it just with the 3d function
permanently turned off all of the
software and games are exactly like on
any other 3ds including games that use
the 3d cameras which still work even
though you can't actually see the 3d
effect on the 2d s what that means is
that this is the cheapest way to get
into the enormous Nintendo library of
games like Pokemon X&amp;amp;Y and that's a huge
selling point the design though is not
my favorite thing it's roughly the same
size as an open 3ds and when you're
playing games on it that's fine the
buttons have been moved up which is more
comfortable and thankfully it's not
covered in a fingerprint magnet glossy
finish the problem is that it's
basically just not that portable I can
throw the 3ds in my pocket just fine but
it's just not happening with the 2d S
which is a major shame Nintendo does
sell a carrying case which is almost a
necessity with the exposed screens and
with it I'd feel a lot safer throwing
the 2d s in a bag but that's still a big
downside especially if you're giving
this to a kid speaking of kids the 2d S
is reasonably built however all the
plastics feel very lightweight and not
too reassuring it's good because the
handheld isn't all that heavy however
it's not the most sturdy thing in the
world so I wouldn't trust it to survive
too many drops once you get into the
game the 2d S is actually really nice it
fits well in my average-sized hands and
all of the controls line up right where
they feel most comfortable we're looking
at the same size 3.5 inch screen up top
and three
display below and quality is very
similar between the two DS and 3ds
interestingly the 2d s actually has a
single display that split into two with
a clever trick of sinking the screen
into the case of it
the top is covered by a piece of plastic
where the bottom has a resistive touch
layer it all works well enough that you
would never really notice except that
the top screen is sunk in a little one
odd area where Nintendo cut on the two
DS to hit the $129 price is removing a
speaker this actually really bothered me
for some reason having a single weak
speaker instead of the usually great
stereo sound on the 3ds is really
disappointing however you do have the
headphone jack which is an option
battery life is unfortunately still the
same meaning you can expect between
three to four hours of gameplay
depending on the screen brightness the
2d s might not be perfect but it does do
a lot of what's great about the normal
3ds for $40 less making this a good idea
for someone especially if you're going
to be buying it for a younger one maybe
as a gift
however definitely be sure to let me
know what do you guys think about the
two DS would you be interested in
picking one up would you prefer
something like the 3ds or the 3ds XL
