table
hey guys this is austin and welcome to a
very peculiar episode of mystery texas
what
unprocess your food a rapid egg cooker
what you want me to cook an egg right
now is this is really the way that
mystery tech is gonna go today
oh it's the prime day special the -
rapid egg cooker OneTouch cooking in 360
watts that's a lot of watts my friends
how much was this on prime date twelve
dollars relative bargain it seems pretty
straightforward we're literally looking
at a power button so I guess as long as
you don't leave your eggs in too long
it's okay oh this is the whole thing I
just thought I just put in here hit the
button anyways I have to actually like
do stuff so I'm going to pour the water
in alright that's not a crazy amount of
water next step I want to attach the
boiling handle and drop it on top the
scary part is going to be poking a hole
in the egg because I feel like I'm about
to like break it this is bad idea is
this really how you do this oh okay I
did it I did it this seems reasonable
I'm gonna spin it around so it looks a
little nicer camera alright wasn't
really short cable by connecting what is
it on wait I just pulled in it that
means it's on already wait wait wait no
no it's that supposed to be on yet I
didn't start my timer wait
okay I'm gonna start a timer for four
minutes look I am NOT responsible for
any injuries that may or may not occur
due to the use of this egg cooker but I
think it did right hey there's water in
it there's a hole in the egg in case it
explodes or whatever that does there's
steam it feels very warm
I shouldn't say super hot shouldn't
touch that this seems very reasonable I
see no reason why in 3 minutes and 32
seconds Ken will not enjoy a very soft
boiled egg that has been it's not post
rate that's not what this is it's a
different thing we are done now Shea
open it it should be okay right oh
that's hot okay
hmm that looks pretty boiled to me look
methane caught on fire and there's
almost all our water was boiled off too
I think we actually got the right amount
look at that it actually is boiled and
not liquidy and goopy and making a mess
whoa what was that
the Opole err laptop cooler oh wow that
okay what are what wait
why okay so this is going to be an
external laptop cooler because that
always is a good idea
step one assemble the SMS Nebel ass
metal the laptop cooler with this
silicon shroud then push the cool toward
the exhaust vent until the shroud
completely covers it that doesn't look
suspicious or anything look I don't know
anything a flesh-colored but we're just
gonna move right past they got a great
deal on some extra flesh-colored
materials okay so I'm guessing that's
gonna be it
this looks no there's no way that's this
is this is not okay
okay so with our old polar laptop cool
ready let's turn it on and see what
happens
it's a fan is blowing air out this side
and so I can get in from the laptop
the only problem with things like this
is that well that's not how this works
because there's already heat being
exhausted putting a suction on one end
is not going to help the fan spin any
faster it's just taking the hot air
that's when I the laptop and making a
noise and exhausting it out so if you
want to do this with your laptop all day
by all means go waste money on Amazon
like Ken did but I think it's time to
move to the next thing so I can let go
with a flap why why
you bought a TV what's what is this the
toshiba fire TV can I ask how much of
our money wasted on what I'm sure is
going to be your new TV yeah 250 that's
actually X you bad so if you can't tell
I'm boxing space not really meant for
something that's this big so the deal
with this is it's actually going to have
fire TV built in so now I do you have
but you're also going to be able to have
access to Amazon Prime that that's
broken oh wow ok so oh look who seem
like condensation inside of it that's uh
that's not what you want to see on your
brand-new TV even for 250 bucks yeah
that's pretty bad
well I gotta say we've seen a lot of
things on mystery tech but um this is
gonna be a new one I really think
there's a whole lot I can do about this
what beause this is not weird this is
not terrible would you get some
reasonable stuff so we've got the qc25 s
as well as the Soundlink micro how much
was this oh wow $7,100 that's actually a
pretty solid deal man
I don't what to do about things that are
actually functioning and are not total
garbage town this is a really new bit of
territory for me wait why are these made
for iPhone they've got a 3.5 millimeter
cable on it how is it made for iPhone
what all right so they come in a pretty
nice-looking carrying case now these are
going to be noise cancelling but unlike
the higher-end models they're not going
to be bluetooth so you are going to need
a 3.5 millimeter adapter Wow I like the
way they steal those so there's a lot of
flexibility as far as you can rotate
them the headband feels pretty good man
I gotta say I don't spend a lot of time
with bows stuff but their noise
cancellation is so impressive it
absolutely just sucks any kind of
background out I mean I think this is an
easy one if you're able to pick these up
for a hundred bucks I mean that's a
no-brainer those are really really nice
just make sure you have that noise
cancellation on next up we have the
Soundlink micro nano
is actually a very popular Bluetooth
speaker one of the main features here is
that not only is it supposed to sound
pretty decent but that's kind of weird
but okay we're also going to be getting
it's going to be not only waterproof but
also reasonably rugged all right I mean
for such a tiny speaker I am really
impressed with how loud blankets and
there's actually a bear bit of bass too
I think a lot of times when you get
these small speakers they've got a good
amount of bass but it's kind of
overpowering everything it's not only
that clear of it sounds but I mean for
70 bucks this is a no-brainer at a
hundred it's a little bit more
questionable but still I mean that's a
lot of power and what's a waterproof
nice little chassis I gotta say Ken this
is actually not garbage town good job
what is this what can count so I don't
know what and octo mattone sweets is so
first of all you hold it second of all
you move it and then you make music with
it and then you have a happy face never
fails ken gets me all excited with
something cool and he brings me right
down to earth with some stupid crap that
I'm probably gonna hate Oh what what is
this why does it do that I don't want it
to do that that's not okay
that's got fun
that's the heart out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
