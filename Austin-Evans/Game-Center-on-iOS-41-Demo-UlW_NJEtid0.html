overview of Game Center on iOS 4.1 so I
have already done a video on 4.1 talking
about all the new features however the
only thing I was not able to fully cover
was how game ssin works sounds go ahead
to show you guys that right now um so
there's a couple things for example
let's go ahead just pick a random friend
I'm just going to show you so for
example when you go to your friends page
you can see you know how many friends
they have how many gains that have and
how many achievements let's go ahead and
take a look at that person what kind of
you know gains they do have so for
example I want to go ahead and challenge
him on flight control or whatever then
you can go ahead and unfriend and report
a problem so that's kind of cool also
but the main deal obviously is games um
so for me I only have one game which is
real racing let me go ahead and show you
kind of what that looks like I'm so
right here you see this shows real
racing the icon lot supply my plate it
and there are also leaderboards so you
can go ahead and look for overall you
can go into the different tracks so
let's just go ahead and look at ferrino
valley for example I'm so in here we can
go ahead and look today this week or all
time so we go ahead and take a look here
how my friends have done so these are
like three of my friends so they can see
what their times are you also go ahead
and just see all how many other players
are you know went ahead and got those
things and also doing it actually quite
make in here you can also go ahead and
at any time hit play so if you're
looking through go okay that's the time
you want just hit play will
automatically launch the application so
that's pretty much it i will show you
achievements like I said achievements
are pretty big why should I didn't say
that but but the cheese are pretty big
in a game center you can go ahead and do
quite a few so you can go ahead and pick
there are 21 achievements in real racing
so you can go ahead just look through
here you know complete a race you know
doing using the different controls etc
etc there are all kinds of different
achievements that you can get I'm so
it's pretty much it you can't go ahead
and her friend requests everything like
that and of course if you have more than
one game like I do you can wet and
scroll through or you can go ahead and
just search and just you know pick out
whatever game you want so anyway guys
that's my overview of Game Center on 4.1
and also in case you've been wondering
I've actually the camera I'm using to
record this is the ipod touch 4th
generation so you know excuse the kind
of the quality isn't up to the spar I'm
trying I'm trying to hold it
still as I can but you know so go ahead
this is the guy I guess like kind of a
double video you can go ahead and take a
look and see how the quality of the ipod
touch 4th generation camera is this is
my second generation i'm recording with
kind of confusing i know but uh so
basically guys if you're interested in
you know how the ipod touch 4th
generation the camera is i'm definitely
take a look I mean I think it's pretty
good not quite perfect but you can hear
the audio quality which our hope is
pretty decent and yeah so anyway guys
