Docs for Android so of course there's
been a web version of Google Docs for
quite a while and it works decently
however just this morning Google
released their native version of Google
Docs for the Android platform and what
I'm going to do is give you guys a
little overview of it there's actually
some really cool things you can do with
it so of course it is free in the
Android Market you just pick it up and
actually these back all the way out is
testing out there but once you open up
it's a very simple interface you see
here you can go your items collection
starred you can take a look at your
documents images if you click on the
more tab you'll see text spreadsheets
and presentations so all the standard
things you expect to do with Google Docs
you can definitely take a look at from
your android device i'm over there's a
couple of really cool things i'll show
you guys i've to come up here when
create new you can create new document
or spreadsheet and that works very
similar or last show you guys that but
what the cool thing is you can create a
document from photo so what I'm going to
do is I actually have a piece of paper
here with some information on what I'm
going to do for you guys and you kind of
hard to show you on camera
in fact I'm can't let me let me back it
up a little bit and take a picture there
we go so if I set that off to the side
you guys can see took a picture of well
basically have a script of mine so I can
click done and then you'll find that a
couple of options so you can create a
title you can pick Y account you want to
send it to if you want convert it to a
Google Doc so we're on the way and click
OK maybe we'll upload so we take a look
and just takes just a moment to upload
and then and then once we there we go I
think then once yeah there we go it is
upload we can click on documents click
on this and you guys can see here it'll
actually try to translate the text from
our document onto here so you see here
there's our picture not perfect but if
we look down here actually see it does a
very good job so in fact I can write
here very very close now what you might
want to do is touched up a little bit so
you definitely it's not going to be
perfect we're gonna zoom in a little bit
here it's not going to be perfect but it
does do a really solid job and as you
guys can see here picture is not
particularly great it's kind of grainy I
know I'm gonna do another test here so
it's back out
and create something else I'm doing this
all live just to give you guys a
demonstration I'm doing handwriting so
do the exact same thing here and just
create a new document from photo and try
and of course it's kind of hard to show
on camera but there we go so you can see
there wonder how it reads handwriting
click done
go through the exact same process I've
hit okay set this off to the side and we
can see exactly how well it does so
upload complete click on that you see
and once it loads and it actually looks
like you did not figure that out at all
so there are some issues that's not
going to be 100% perfect but definitely
some pretty cool stuff and if I want to
back out and really quickly just show
you guys um just type this up pretty
easily I know it seems to use the web
interface for a lot of it if I click
Edit it seems pretty much to just use
the web interface so I'm you know you
can go ahead and type out your whatever
or you can take a look at your Doc's on
the go but overall I would say that
definitely the biggest feature of it is
just being able to take a look at your
your handwritten documents rule rather
not handwritten because as you can see
it didn't work too well but you have
something typed up it actually will do a
decent job and of course you can just
add it up a little bit you know fix the
typos but on the whole of it definitely
much much faster than typing it all up
yourself hey guys that's about it for my
review of Google Docs for Android
definitely very cool if you use if
you're a user of Google Docs house I
recommend go ahead and download it give
it a shot you know it's pretty much the
best of the web interface with a few
added added bonuses</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
