is the OnePlus 5.
So OnePlus has been known
for making flagship phones
at midrange phone prices.
But is the OnePlus 5 worth it?
Big shoutout to OnePlus
for not only sending us
a review unit so we can take
a look at the phone early,
but we also have this entire box full
of accessories to check out.
(cardboard tab tearing off)
So what's cool is this
is actually a custom pack
specifically meant for reviewers.
(laughs)
Some very subtle marketing there.
First, we have the OnePlus 5 itself,
so this is the higher-end model
with 128 gigs of storage, but we also have
a few accessories here.
So this is the bumper case,
we also have the sandstone,
we have a rosewood,
and we also have ebony.
Does anyone care about this stuff?
So, we have the phone itself,
which at first glance looks pretty similar
to the OnePlus 3.
We also have the Dash charger,
which is kind of enormous.
It looks like two iPhone
chargers just like,
squashed together.
From the front it looks fairly similar
to the OnePlus 3, however,
when you flip it around
back you'll see they've actually done
some pretty major changes here.
So even though this is only
.2 millimeters thinner,
because it has a more tapered edge,
and the whole thing
feels a lot more rounded,
it actually feels a lot thinner.
And of course, we do have
those dual rear-facing cameras.
Not similar to any
other smartphone at all.
Yeah, there's uh, there's
definitely a little bit
of resemblance in the family.
So one of these cameras is
going to be your main shooter,
and one of them is going
to be a telephoto lens.
Pop out the SIM slot,
and again, we do have
support for dual SIMs,
but what you can't do
with the OnePlus 5, is
use a microSD card here.
I'm kind of surprised at
how much I like this design.
So up front, it definitely
has much larger bezels,
than something like a Galaxy S8,
but as far as just like, in-hand feel,
I really do like how the tapered design
just kind of fits nicely.
For comparison, the Galaxy
S8 has a lot smaller bezels.
So put side-by-side with the OnePlus 5,
it's clear that this looks
like a phone from the future,
and this looks like a normal smartphone.
Now that's not necessarily
that bad of a thing,
so the OnePlus 5 still
does have a full home key
with a fingerprint sensor,
whereas with the Galaxy S8,
you're gonna have to deal with
the goofy thing on the back,
but when you look at these side-by-side,
it's clear that while the
OnePlus 5 is caught up
in specs, design, it still
has a little ways to go.
Inside, the OnePlus 5
absolutely has flagship specs.
So it's rocking an octa-core
Snapdragon 835 processor,
either six or eight gigabytes of RAM,
as well as 64 or 128 gigabytes of storage.
So both the Galaxy S8 as well
as the OnePlus 5 are fast,
and the OnePlus actually
slightly edges out the S8,
but regardless across the board, these
are very, very fast phones.
What's almost more
impressive is the speed of
the storage on the OnePlus 5.
While the Galaxy S8 is
definitely no slouch,
here we're able to get over
700 megabytes per second
on the read speeds.
To put things in perspective,
that's faster than a lot of PC SSDs.
Inside, this guy is also rocking
a pretty solidly sized
3300 milliamp hour battery.
That combined with the Dash charge,
which is about at fast as
you can charge a phone,
thanks to OnePlus's giant power brick,
means that the battery situation's
also pretty solid on the OnePlus 5.
Now the comparison with
the S8 really isn't fair,
as well, this guy starts at 479 dollars,
the Galaxy S8 is over 750.
However, it is impressive
at just the level
of power and specs that OnePlus was able
to cram into a phone under 500 dollars.
On paper, this guy has
a very similar screen
to the OnePlus 3, as
it's still a 5.5 inch,
1080p AMOLED panel, however, this year
they definitely upped the quality.
Not only have they done a much better job
of calibrating the display this year,
but in addition to supporting
sRGB, it also supports
the full P3 color gamut.
- Hey guys, this is Austin!
And today I'm here at E3
2017 with a simple question,
PS4 Pro, or Xbox One X?
- The screen here is a really
big jump over the OnePlus 3.
So while it's not quite
as good as something
like the Galaxy S8, it's still AMOLED,
it still looks great, and honestly,
having a 1080p resolution
still looks totally fine.
If anything, it's just going
to help your battery life.
The one issue with the OnePlus
5 as far as video goes,
though, is the speaker.
So it's still a single
bottom-firing speaker,
and while it sounds decent, it does get
reasonably loud, compared
to something like the iPhone
which also hides a second
speaker in the earpiece,
it just doesn't sound as good.
The OnePlus 5 also supports Bluetooth 5.0,
which I shall now demonstrate
in total overkill fashion.
(electronic music)
The OnePlus 5 is also
running Android 7.1.1
with the latest version of Oxygen OS.
For the most part it's
fairly stock-looking.
They have made a couple of tweaks.
For example, they have app priority,
which will supposedly figure out
which apps you use the most often,
and preload them in the background.
And one of the things they've done
is they've enhanced the latency,
so everything here should feel
a little bit quicker than normal.
And while it's hard to
tell without actually
having something
side-by-side, it feels snappy.
The OnePlus 5 definitely
has the specs down,
but one of the biggest upgrades here,
is the new dual camera.
The OnePlus 5 is rocking a
16 megapixel main camera,
as well as a 20 megapixel telephoto.
So what's interesting
is it's the exact same
orientation as the iPhone 7 Plus.
When you switch over to that
telephoto, it is a 2x zoom.
When it comes to taking a normal
still, it's pretty snappy.
But, all you have to do
is just tap the 2x button,
and it will switch over to the telephoto.
There's definitely a
difference in image quality.
I do think that the main camera looks
a little bit sharper, but importantly,
it's actually pretty quick
to move between the two.
Next, let's try portrait mode.
Oh, wow!
That looks pretty decent.
It's a little bit soft on the edges,
especially around your shirt,
but it looks pretty decent.
So I think the iPhone shot was
a little bit more natural, so especially
the way it handles jumping
from Ken to the background.
It's a little but smoother,
whereas you can definitely
see the line where the OnePlus does it.
Is it fair to compare the OnePlus camera
to a phone that costs
several hundred dollars more?
I kind of think so.
I mean, they're not exactly being subtle
with who they're targeting with this guy.
The OnePlus 5 also has
pretty nice-looking 4K video.
So, compared to the
iPhone, it's a little bit
more compressed, and because there's not
optical stabilization
in 4K, it's not quite
the smoothest-looking video in the world,
but for a cell phone, there's really
not a lot to complain about.
The OnePlus 5 goes on sale on
June 27th, for 479 dollars.
While it's a little bit more expensive
than previous OnePlus
models, when you consider
what you're getting
here, especially compared
to something like a Galaxy S8,
this is a pretty solid deal.
So, what do you guys
think about the OnePlus 5?
Let me know in the comments below,
and I will catch you on the next one.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
