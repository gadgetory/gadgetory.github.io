4.0 so for $400 million are you getting
a system that's going to be easy to
build especially if this is your first
time building a gaming PC we're also
getting a lot of power so start with we
have the thermal tech versa h 15k this
is one during micro ATX which means that
we have plenty of room for all of our
components plus a little bit of
upgrading in the future but more
importantly than that it's going to be
easy to work in so if I pop it open here
you can see that I'm looking at the
wrong side but in theory it's easy to
work on it by come at it from this way
so around back there's a 120 millimeter
exhaust band up front there's a USB 2
port as well as USB 3 so this might not
be the most fancy case in world it does
have some cool features including a
removable dust filter for your power
supply for when you put this on carpet
and it gets all gross and dusty for
power we have the full 130 watts EVGA
supply now especially when it comes to
budget builds you do need to be careful
what kind of power supplies are getting
so well sure there are cheaper options
than this this is kind of the heart of
the build you do not want to put a very
cheap supply at your build and have it
explode maybe I explode but seriously
you do want to at least get something
decent and with foreigners very lots of
capacity this should be more than that
for the bill that is so once we get the
car supplied slid in here you'll see it
actually fits pretty well and while this
case doesn't have the best cable
management in the world we actually do
have some room back here to route some
of our cable for the motherboard we have
the nside be 250m Pro VD because
motherboard names are awesome now what
is cool about this is it is with that be
250 chipset supporting not only skylight
but also the brand new Intel KB Lake
processors so it was a little bit of a
basic board we do have some cool
features including check out that PCI
slot so I've actually never seen ones
metal the idea is is that it's going to
give some more protection when you're
say traveling with a computer and you've
got that heavy graphics card that's
trying to rip the whole thing out of the
slot trust me it happens on top of that
we also do have an m2 slot which only
supports SSDs but also the new Intel
octane powering the boson 4.0 is new
Intel Pentium G 4560 now typically pen
teams haven't been good for gaming bulbs
what's special about this is that it
supports hyper threading essentially
turning this into a core i3 the cost a
whole lot less so even though it might
be
don't underestimate the Pentium so with
a clock speed of 3.5 gigahertz it
actually really isn't that far off or
even the higher-end ship like the Core
i5
depending on the game it's really
speaking for a bill like this this is
going to be pretty much perfect who's
actually going to be like first time
trying to G 45 60 now as a guy who's
done just a couple of budget build I'm
really excited to see what this thing
can do but from everything I've seen it
is no joke as far as performance goes
next up we have memory and here we're
using a gigabytes of HyperX fury so the
cool things about skylake and KB Lake
chips is that they do support ddr4 so
it's not really a huge difference
compared to ddr3 it is a little bit
quicker and hey I always take a couple
extra frames and I can get them so this
is going to give us a gigabytes of RAM
in the boson which is fine for now but
if you ever do want to upgrade we do
have an additional den slot so if you
ever wanna get this guy up to 16
gigabytes it's no problem
so things are going along pretty like
this so far however next up we have the
graphics card which in this case is an
EVGA gtx 1050 so the GPA is 1050 is none
of these parts that really does make a
ton of sense for budget builds so we're
about a hundred and ten dollars or so
we're getting a lot of horsepower here
and especially when you pair it with
that Pentium we should be good for some
pretty decent 1080p gaming while it
packs a punch the tip 50 is a pretty
small little card and that's not exactly
a bad thing not only does it easily fit
in our case with tons of room to spare
but it also is completely powered from
the motherboard so what we have all of
our connectors for more beefy graphics
cards this guy pulls all power needs
straight from that PCI slot and that is
about it however last but not least we
have an SSD and yes this is an SSD in a
$400 system so it is 2017 and I am a
firm believer that you should not be
buying or building a computer without an
SSD it makes such a huge difference to
everyday usability of a computer so much
faster so much less frustrating so for
this we actually went with the Kingston
SSDs now UV 400 now the only real
downside with this this is only 120
gigabytes so if you don't like going
just a little bit over the $400 budget
you can upgrade this to 240 gigabytes or
since this is a game PC and we have
plenty of room for expansion you can add
an additional hard drive here to have
extra stuff like games files that kind
of thing so you kind of get the best of
both worlds and it's as simple as that
to build the boson 4.0
so now I'm going to do a little bit of
cable management get this guy all up and
running and we'll see what it can
actually do so this is Grand Theft Auto
5 running on the boson so right now
we're playing at 1080p high settings and
we're getting anywhere between about 70
to 100 frames depending on what we're
doing so this is a 134 Hertz monitor so
that extra framerate actually does look
nice and smooth but if you're playing on
a standard display you can see currently
setting it up even more and still get a
very smooth output next up we have
overwatch and this is one of those games
that really does look better on PC
versus console merely do the graphics
look nice at 1080p on high we're also
getting a super smooth a to about 100
frames per second now I think I mean
sure it's totally playable on console I
mean if you're playing at 60 Hertz it's
fine but being able to have the option
of actually really cranking back
graphics settings up while still getting
a nice solid frame rate is really
helpful for $400 the boson 4.0 is a
pretty solid little gaming PC so as
always the links to everything you guys
need to actually build this guy will be
in the description I'm curious what neat
guys think about the latest boson let me
know in the comments below and I will
catch you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
