I'm here with a application you are a
really good app called Gang Starr some
of you guys might seen this it just came
out recently
um basically it's as good as you're
gonna get to getting Grand Theft Auto
for your iPhone and iPod Touch I gotta
say eat really mostly delivers got a few
little things are not so fond of but
still I mean you're not gonna get
anything close to this yeah
so it's real simple um there's mocks and
everything but I just show you those net
now first thing you'll notice I
intentionally wanted to leave this in is
the loading times are quite long I mean
still I mean maybe 30 seconds which is
still kind of long for like a pro app
from App because usually apps you know a
lot much quicker but still once you get
in there that really aren't many loading
screens it's it's an open world so you
know that's not a big deal anyway
so basically Gangstar like I said is
grand theft auto I mean really just
that's that's the whole thing I mean
it's not perfect but you see here that
I've got full 3d graphics and you can
see that it's actually quite good
um you see there's controls when you're
walking because you can steal cars let's
try that and do missions and all that
kind of stuff just have your pad right
here so you can walk around I mean you
can punch I don't have any weapons right
now but you can do that too but you can
walk around and basically you have
missions and stuff to do now I'm gonna
go ahead and show you this this is the
map okay so that's where I am this is
where I can go this is actually it's not
a huge huge I mean especially if you've
been playing like some open-world on
like the Xbox Playstation I mean it's
not gonna totally amaze you but still
pretty good big and I mean you can you
can go a long way now go ahead and go
into options now this is one of my
favorite parts of this which kind of
seems weird because it's a good game but
one of the really good parts of this is
the fact that you can listen to your own
music in the car kind of like you're
play Grand Theft Auto well you know yet
the radio we can you play music from
your iPhone iPod or I
and by just simply just going through
the playlist or whatever and you know
just going through it yeah but obviously
I don't want to get killed so I won't do
it um okay let's go ahead and it's the
car so basically what you do is you walk
up to one not here yeah I was good and I
hope icon appears just walk up to it
toss the guy out and there we go now
this is a different control scheme and
now you can hear that there's a radio in
already
but that's not my music so okay so let's
just take off throws a little hard to
get each true there's also an
accelerometer controls but I don't
really like those so much
these aren't amazing either but
basically you can do whatever you want
I mean you can graphics are actually
really quite good you can see here if
you look for a little ways ahead you can
see that it's still loading it but
that's not bad and fine lights great
thank our yeah I mean just there's the
Dexter in and I got money for it got
about that and you just fly around do it
if you want really
there's missions and there's also
different radio stations you just run
around and then one gather car then just
walk around and so steal ambulance
telega steal name now one of my this is
one mine but they were parts game just
driving around not doing anything just
you know stealing stuff and having fun
but there is definitely a story mode and
to be honest I'm not really entirely
like this one oh there we go
the swing mode it's really cliched I'm a
hen's dope game drive straight my story
mode is really cliche I mean you don't
play this for the store no but it
doesn't would have been nice who had a
decent
and I mean it's really lots of cutscenes
and just destroy doesn't really mean
that funny
it's just kind of like all right ever
definitely shows that the story at least
drink that daughter a trying to rip it
off but you can see here that it's quite
easy to drive around and drive for a
ways and you see that the car actually
you see - that suspension everything
which a lot of cars don't they just kind
of pretty straight and now okay that's
waiting for that now I'm wanted so let's
just see here in a second we start
seeing some props there's one so now I
get out here that's not gonna last long
so basically I got a wheel I hear oh
fast no no and wow that was pretty easy
well um there's that's almost the whole
thing you can see when you get caught
you see these one of these kind of
cutscenes I got fine there though but
they let me go and then I can just go
ahead and do that battle I have anything
stuck here now you see a tough one I had
five and four yellows um I would show
you guys a mission but I mean it's
pretty generic and there are some
glitches and sort of stuff a lot of the
things like some tech cutscenes like
like let's say that camera will be over
here and you're looking over here well
if a car drives by it kind of ruins the
cutscene which seems weird and you sees
through stuff same thing here I shall
apply it
I walked near this building which
actually that's why she got caught you
see the camera cannot seems that yes
he'd go through and see here by you know
it kind of goes through buildings and
stuff which you can definitely looks
pretty weird
okay I'm real quick I guess I'll show
you guys I have a fight I'm having
weapons you see so I'm just smash the
but until he's down or it's kind of dumb
but now I've begun so I can keep you
think so
you know you gotta have the gangster
kind of style on it so you walk around
and just do it if you want but yeah
that's just about it guys
Gangstar I believe it is seven dollars
at now on the App Store
I definitely
think for $7.00 definitely worth it I
like myself
I love open world so I like just being
able to drive and you know just do
whatever you want but there's also story
modes not that much fun but you know
it's not bad graphics are definitely
fantastic especially for an open world
when you see over there baby maybe
compare to see it's kind of gray or only
loads fill along my eyes that's funny
and keep them they keep walking right so
yeah that's just about it guys
Gangstar not a perfect game it's the
story was better and your warrant so
glitches and stuff didn't rain live here
I'll definitely would give this a solid
10 as this now though it's pride more
like a 9 but still great game love the
love to see this is this runs great
no no problems whatever you guys that's
just better thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
