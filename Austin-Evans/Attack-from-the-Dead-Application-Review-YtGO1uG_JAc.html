I've got a special in-depth application
review on a really cool app but before I
begin I'd like to do a couple things one
I want to give a shout out to raise
reviews you guys seriously check him out
he's really cool he's got a lot of
really awesome case reviews uh
definitely that's totally not my area so
you know check him out and also look for
later probably early next week sometime
it'll be a little bit i'm going to do a
special application review on some
outdoors type applications getting that
all set up that's going to look like
it's going to be a lot of fun can be
really cool anyway this is going to be a
full-on application view on attack from
the dead it's a really cool game I like
it a lot and so let's get this one
started
okay so basically what type from the
dead is is it's a third-person shooter
and it's very very similar to a popular
flash game and there are others like it
it is called last and if you can play
last and you will very quickly figure
out a type of that and really you will
appreciate it because it's a lot of fun
basically it's very very simple you uh I
mean it's absolutely basically think of
it like a port of last name for the
iPhone because it's i mean that's then
don't think that's not a that that's
good that's a good thing okay so
basically what type of the Dead is is
that you are a you're a US Army
something I don't yeah it's kind of a
little crazy you uh but yeah you're
supposedly army or something and you
were been sent in to basically just you
know take out zombies it's I mean
standard I mean I know I review a lot of
these kind of things and they all have
the same kind of generic zombie story
that no one pays attention to but that's
not a problem like I always say it's a
zombie game so who cares so basically
what you do is during the nighttime you
hole up in a building and basically you
just somme bees come at you and you
shoot at them you get bunch different
weapons you start with like pistol you
can get revolvers machine guns shotguns
a lot of different really cool things
basically you've got last through the
night which obviously as you go every
day gets longer and more difficult and
and so you keep going and basically what
you do is after you get through one
level which is one day then then you can
see the Sun come up it's not as good in
last and you actually see the Sun like
actually come up where's this it's more
like the levels over then it kind of
brightens up it would kind of be nice if
you could see like like through windows
or something somehow you could tell that
you could it's like being uh it's
getting brighter outside
um but that said that doesn't I mean
that's not that big a deal um so what is
that you wait until the Sun comes up
levels over and then what you do is you
go into a basically you go you're
supposed to search each house for
survivors and then you also find
ammunition and then you can also fix
your base basically what it is is that
every day you get like three points and
then generally you use to the points to
search a house and then one of the
points to either look for more ammo or
repair your base if it's gotten attacked
now um one of the my favorite things
about tech from the dead is just the
graphics I mean where you where you
fight with the zombies everything it's
really really really cool looking
there's like blood stains on the walls
um now the graphics aren't a hundred
percent it's it's going to say it's like
I'm not they're not full 3d graphics but
they're not they don't look like normal
pixel graphics it's it's a nice mix and
you won't be looking at go oh that's
terrible-looking zombies are zombies I
mean they just kind of stumble around I
mean when you shoot them the the
animation do kind of get a little
repetitive as they fall but you mean you
only really notice that the beginning
because once you get towards the later
you're you know shooting so fast and
really not paying attention um time that
it's got two modes it's got story mode
which is just just the standard way I
was just telling you about the story
where you go through each day and i want
to say 30 days don't quote me on it I've
totally forgotten but you basically go
through all the days and you get to the
end and I won't don't say what happens
but you get to the end and that's that
and there's also survival mode which
just as you know you would think
survival basically what you do is you
just sit there and you attack and you
don't attack they attack you and it's
just an endless stream and you basically
pick up ammo from picking up different
ones and it's pretty simple it's a lot
of fun I almost think it's better than
the story mode but I mean they're both
fun you can play one sometime
x and then there's co-op mode and before
you say no co-op mode you can't do it on
one iphone ipod touch it's basically if
you have to in a closed you know closed
over a though they can connect over
Wi-Fi together then you can play you can
play co-op together like they would be
like on one side you'd be on the other
and you guys would both shoot zombies
together one feature and i always like
to talk about this one feature i always
always always wish in games it's auto
safe and yes and the type of dead does
have it i really enjoy that although i
did not realize that it came in an
update because this game has its on
version 1.3 point three and i originally
had reviewed on one point oh there's
been a lot of upgrades and like the
survival in the co-op modes are new um a
lot a lot of things are new and that was
one of the things i did not realize it
was in an update and i could not figure
out how to get out and save so i don't i
don't know how many matches i ruined but
not realizing i had to do is hit the
home button to save i totally ruined
like all these things i'd spent like an
hour on everything but attack from the
dead is it's for me it's still like I
will say it's 99 cents it's been 19
cents I for several months I don't know
if they plan on raising it I wouldn't
think so although i would not mind
paying two or three dollars for this a
type of the day it's a lot of fun if you
like the if you ever played the flash
game last and that's that's the simplest
way i can do it because this is very
very similar it's I mean it's a lot of
fun you actually pick up survivors when
you search through the houses you can
find survivors which will give you guns
everything but when you find survivors
sometimes they do different things
sometimes you will find survival will
actually be standing beside you and
shoot they're not nearly as good as you
obviously because they only have like a
pistol and you you have all these
shotguns and all kinds of stuff but
definitely once you get it going into
later levels when you have you there and
then maybe like two other survivors and
zombies are just come at like crazy some
of the big zombies some of the the
running zombies I don't know what the
names are but they're zombies it gets a
lot of fun
so that's just about it on a text in the
dead it's not for everyone because the
sea eyes tend to review a lot of apps
like this that I like so for me a lot of
these are what I'm into but for some
people obviously you don't like it the
best thing I could say is you if you
want if you want to know more about it
and really get a full thing about it
check out the flash game last and you
can search for it you find somewhere
because if you like that game the text
is basically you can play it on your
iPod or iPhone because it's a lot of fun
and I'm just rambling here so I'll just
cut it now but yeah I like it and if you
think you're into these games go ahead
and i would say recommend picking it up
