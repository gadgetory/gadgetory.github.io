comparison between the Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T
iPhone 4 now the earlier this morning
Verizon announced that they will be the
second carrier in the United States to
go ahead and pick up the iPhone 4 and
it's actually going to be a little bit
difference not just for the exact same
phone that actually have made some
pretty sizeable changes to go ahead and
support on the Verizon network stand
we'll go ahead and go over all those
changes both on the network side as well
as just on these phones themselves to
help you all make the best decision that
you can about which one is going to be
right for you
so to begin with let's talk about the
design now I do please keep in mind that
this is not a you know comparison
between you know the iPhone 4 on AT&amp;amp;T
and the iPhone 5 or something like that
I mean Verizon did not pick up anything
special they have the iPhone 4 they both
both phones are 99% identical but just a
few key differences so don't expect you
know that the Verizon the Verizon iPhone
will have 4G support or anything like
that it's just going to work on the same
standard 3G network of Verizon just like
the AT&amp;amp;T version runs on their 3d
network so some of the major things that
as far as the design goes is that the
Verizon iPhone has a slightly different
antenna now of course the AT&amp;amp;T iPhone
has had a lot of issues as far as near
the antenna gate where you hold it in
specific that's point
it loses reception now whether they
change this or not whether they fix this
or not is not entirely apparent however
they have ended the antenna to go ahead
and work hopeful a little bit better on
the Verizon iPhone now as an extra
little notch and they're actually kind
of more sized that they kind of more
symmetrical it does look a little bit
nicer but another thing is that this
actually means that everything has been
tweaked a little bit on the side so if
you know with the volume buttons and the
lock switch has been actually changed
and lowered just a little bit now in a
reality is probably going to make a
whole lot of difference however what
will is that this should make a lot of
current iPhone cases not work with the
Verizon iPhone just because the buttons
that move down just a smallest amount
now if you already have an iPhone on ATT
and you want to move over to Verizon
this is going to be an issue because
most maybe at all but most of your cases
won't work and indeed the same way goes
if you have a Verizon iPhone where you
plan on buying one now obviously you're
going to want a case to protect your
phone
a lot of the cases you know won't won't
be really specific it'll work for the 18
t but not yours so that's definitely
something to keep in mind although of
course not the biggest deal in the world
I know as far as software goes again
they are very very similar so you won't
find any kind of V CAST or any kind of
Verizon specific apps on the Verizon
iPhone just like you don't see anything
on the AT&amp;amp;T however there is one key
piece of software on the Verizon iPhone
that should be very helpful which is it
allows you to go ahead and use it as a
mobile hotspot so using this on the
Verizon iPhone go ahead and enable up to
five different devices go ahead and
connect through the Wi-Fi on your iPhone
pryzen the way this works very simple if
you've ever had a 3G card or need a lot
of other phones a tether it works very
similar it's simple you can go ahead and
just plug in your play anything but it
it all goes through Wi-Fi so maybe have
a game system like a PSP iPod a laptop
anything you want that has Wi-Fi
go ahead connect through your iPhone 4
and then go up and you can go ahead and
get on the internet so you go ahead and
share out with several other devices now
they haven't had said anything about the
price it will be preloaded on all
iPhones now they haven't said anything
about whether they will charge you extra
for which I'm fairly sure they will what
you can go ahead and just use this for
free so we'll have to see about that but
anyway this is definitely a very nice
feature that you can do on the Verizon
iPhone that's what move on to that
networks themselves which obviously are
going to be the biggest draw now here in
the United States AT&amp;amp;T has decent
service some places I will give it that
but for a lot of places such as where I
live it's really you're just just bad
it's just really bad where is on Verizon
there they have a lot better coverage
that I found a lot of other people kind
of agree just depending on where you are
I'm for ice it does have really really
solid coverage so that alone is going to
be the number one thing if you keep good
ATT service where you live and that's
point going to be a good option and if
you get good Verizon service that's
going to be a good option so if you live
in a place like I do where 18t is
terrible and Verizon is excellent it's
gonna be a no brainer and likewise if
it's ATT is great and Verizon is
terrible you're gonna want to go ahead
and go at that phone you know it doesn't
matter speed features this that price
need of that what matters most is if you
is going to work or not so in general I
found that Verizon tends to work better
and a lot more places than AT&amp;amp;T does you
should notice any major speed difference
as far as on the internet or anything
like that although one thing I will give
to AT&amp;amp;T is network and it's a fairly
important thing is that on AT&amp;amp;T let's
say you're have your iPhone you're
making a call and then you need to get
on the internet you need to go look up
something maybe you're on a call and say
hey let's go find a restaurant to eat
dinner tonight we can do that you can do
simultaneous voice and data usage on the
Verizon iPhone this is not going to be
the case if you're on a phone call
you're not going to be able to get on
the internet likewise if you're surfing
on the internet or anything like that
you get a phone call you're gonna have
to get out of that and go to the call
now this is not again this is that one
of these huge deal breakers or anything
like that but it's definitely something
to keep in mind and now the last thing I
want to talk about is price upfront the
price is going to be the same both
carriers will carry it for $199 for the
16 gigabyte and 299 for the 32 gigabyte
models I know whatever they do differ is
the price of the con of the you know
these service plans and all that kind of
stuff AT&amp;amp;T you go ahead and check out I
won't go through all they have a lot
different plans and all kinds of like
that
now actually we don't have any concrete
and information on the Verizon iPhone
plan although I do assume they will be
very similar to their current lineup of
smart phones I don't really really say
anything about it they're going to
change it and if they would I would
imagine they would have said so so in
general expect that you will probably
pay a little bit more for Verizon but
again it kind of comes down to you pay a
little bit more but you do generally get
a better network sooner guys that's it
for my whole wrap up and comparison of
between the Verizon and the AT&amp;amp;T iPhone
4s personally I'm going to go ahead and
pick up myself a Verizon iPhone 4 you
know I really like the look of it I
really like the Verizon coverage like
I've said I hate AT&amp;amp;T around here a lot
of places it really does not come in
well so really this is gonna be just I'm
gonna probably stay in line and go get
one for myself
um however if you do want to hold back
especially gonna wait for the Verizon or
AT&amp;amp;T or whatever they decide to the
iPhone 5 or whatever they decide to call
to come out this summer I definitely
don't blame you as that will probably be
a new upgrade
cause you a lot of problems if you
decide to buy it now so anyway guys
