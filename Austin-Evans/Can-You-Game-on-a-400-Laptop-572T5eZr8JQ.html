very expensive gaming hardware but today
i want to find out can i game on this
$400 laptop this is the lenovo z50 and
it's currently less than 370 dollars on
amazon right now based on the giant
Gears of War 4 picture they have on the
product page I think it's pretty safe to
assume that they're aiming this at
gamers typically with budget laptops
you're getting integrated Intel graphics
which are fine for basic use but really
can't handle serious games over here we
actually have an AMD FX APU which in
theory should work a little bit better
also I was very meaty CTO I think I
actually cut through the blocks here cuz
in the box so inside first of all we get
CD laptop itself and the first thing I
noticed is that the battery actually
doesn't come install it's been a long
time since posting a laptop with a
detachable battery like this this is a
twenty eight hundred million power
battery for reference I feel like a lot
of smartphones have bigger batteries
than that also have the power cable and
when I'm sure is the power adapter so
nothing too exciting in the box but of
course this is a budget laptop what
we're really getting here is actual
performance at least hopefully it's are
getting the batteries taking me back I
smell a long time since I've actually
use a laptop like this
so if first glance it looks very plastic
II but once you open up you do see that
it looks pretty decent inside and mostly
thanks to the sort of fake brush metal
here this is a very interesting
selection of ports so not only is there
VGA which is really weird a laptop in
2017 we also have Ethernet HDMI USB 2.0
as well 3.0 but the really weird part is
when you actually come around to the DVD
drive yes this laptop and 2017 comes
with a DVD drive standard which actually
is not really a bad thing just weird a
big downside is that this does lack AC
Wi-Fi instead opting for the older
school Wireless n as it be fair you do
have an Ethernet port so it's not all
bad but there are a lot of very unusual
design choices with this laptop what
makes this special are the specs inside
it has a quad-core AMD FX 7500 apu with
radeon r7 graphics as well as a
gigabytes of RAM this should give us a
fair bit of power to gain no no it's not
going to shame a laptop with dedicated
graphics but the Radeon stuff really
isn't bad and this cost less than $400
you really can't be picky at this price
however there are some sacrifices to get
that much power this sort of price the
biggest one is the screen this guy is
rocking a 15.6 inch panel with a
resolution of 1366 by 768 it is not very
good as a low-end TN panel this really
does bring you back to the days where
budget laptop screens are kind of
terrible one of the biggest places that
you can see are with the viewing angles
so if you look at it straight on it's
not that bad but you get off access it
ghosts really badly plus having such a
low resolution on such a big screen just
makes everything was a little bit weird
there's very little screen real estate
now I have to delicately balance the
laptops so it doesn't completely washout
on camera 330 our laptops and I'm going
to be using it for the next week these
speakers are okay but this is not going
to be a great video watching experience
thankfully the keyboard isn't bad so it
has a sort of classic lenovo layout and
it feels pretty good to type on what
some is there's a fair bit of flex on
the actual keyboard itself but it's
totally usable on same thing goes for
the trackpad it's maybe not the most
accurate thing in the world however you
are probably going to want a mouse for
gaming although that's like true for
every trackpad ever so remove three
screws on the back it's actually easy
enough to open the laptop up and one of
the nice things about being a bit more
of an old-school design is that there's
a lot that you can actually upgrade
yourself not only can you get access to
both of the memory slots there's also a
one terabyte hard drive pre-installed
that looks super easy to swap out this
is my PC I'd spend a few extra bucks and
throw an SSD in here it will make a big
difference
the real sensitive laptop though is to
play actual games so to start with we
had csgo so right now we're playing at
768 P which is the max resolution of the
screen and we're playing with a mixture
of medium and high settings and we're
getting decent frame rates it bottoms
out in the mid 30s but in some of these
more open areas we're getting in like
the 40s and 50s next we have rocket
League this is another game that isn't
incredibly demanding but here on quality
settings which is roughly equivalent to
medium it's pretty smooth we're getting
in the mid 40s to low 50s next we have
minecraft now yes this will run pretty
much anything including a Raspberry Pi
but on the lenovo we're able to crank
the settings up pretty much all the way
to the max and we're still getting
really solid frame rate you can flying
around here as loads chunks we're still
in the 60 to 70 frame per second range
next we have overwatch this is a little
bit harder for the laptop to handle
we even on low settings here it's a
little bit choppy so in less
action-oriented scenes it's fine but
once we get a lot of characters a lot of
effect on screen we do sometimes
duplicate below 30 it's kind of playable
but you've got to really want to play
overwatch the Lenovo is v50 is
definitely not a perfect gaming laptop
but for less than $400 it's actually not
bad as always I'll have a link to check
this guy out in the description and let
me know would you pick up a three
hundred seventy dollar gaming laptop let
me know in the comments below and I will
catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
