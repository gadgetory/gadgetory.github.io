this is the world's thinnest laptop so
this is the Acer Swift 7 so thinner is
usually better right you don't see
everyone walking around with the
enormous laptops anymore however my
question is how thin is too thin as this
guy measures in it less than 10
millimeters thick so inside the box we
get Oh fit work perfect huh that is a
that's a thin laptop all right if first
things it doesn't seem crazy so we have
a couple ports on the side we'll get to
that in just one second
a USBC USB adapter in the box how
thoughtful we also have a USB C to HDMI
adapter include in the box and the power
cable is also USB see behind guests yet
this laptop has only USB C ports
although this is a little bit big for us
PC charger so that's one of the
downsides to having something that's so
thin and like I said with all the other
USB C devices this year such as the Mac
books well it's a great connector it's
absolutely the future it's difficult to
get by with no standard USB ports today
that is a nice looking laptop so side by
side with the current generation 12-inch
MacBook it is a fair bit thicker so
you're seeing there's a lot bigger of a
taper here now this is not exactly super
thick laptop any means but this is
definitely thinner and something you
won't find on the 12-inch MacBook are
two USB C port switch the Swift has so
at the very least you can plug in
something like an external drive and
also charge a laptop at the same time
you know like any laptop ever should be
able to do I do like the finish as a
laptop but it gets really fingerprinted
very quickly I haven't even turned it on
and yet it's completely coated already
open up the Swift 7 and you will find
the 13.3 inch 1080p IPS display now it
might not be quite as high resolution as
I'd like it's a really nice looking
panel something you won't find is a
touchscreen so no matter how much I
touch the gorilla glass display nothing
happens and that's kind of a
disappointment at this point if you're
going to get any kind of reasonably
high-end Windows 10 laptop I feel like a
touchscreen should be part of the
bargain
this keyboard is not bad so a lot of
times when you have very very thin
laptops one of the first things that
gets sacrificed is the actual keyboard
travel it's very shallow it's very
clicky this is a surprisingly good
keyboard there's very little sort of
flex in it and I feel like I could
pretty much immediately get up to speed
on this guy the trackpad is also not bad
so even that's a little bit of a weird
shape with it being very wide not so
tall the accuracy is nice we have things
like multi-touch gestures I can swipe to
go back and that's one of the things
that's really kind of immediately
jumping out to me about the sweat 7 even
though it's a super thin laptop Acer
didn't compromise on the essentials
right so the screen is solid keyboard
surprisingly good eating the tripod it's
completely usable letting folks running
the headset off of the built-in speakers
are also decent so unlike most laptops
especially these days they're actually
firing downward which means that this
sound is not quite as clear as it could
be but for something that's this then it
gets a pass something you won't find
around back or in events as this is a
fully fanless laptop now that's not
exactly something brand new however a
lot of times you're going to end up
sacrificing performance and with this
we're getting a slightly lower spec CPU
inside we have the latest seventh
generation Intel Core i5 processors
based on KB Lake so let's Foley up to
date however these are the same
processors that used to be called Core M
essentially what that means is in return
for that fanless design it's a much
lower watt part around four and a half
watts give you some perspective on that
most smartphones are not too far south
of that paired with a gigabytes of
memory this is going to be fine for
light to moderate tasks however when you
get into heavier lifting such as photo
and video editing expect things to slow
down this is not a workstation in theory
though we should be able to do some
light gaming such as csgo so this is
720p on medium and it's not bad um it's
not the smoothest experience in the
world so we're bottoming out around the
mid 30s on the frame rate but for a bit
of gaming's it's not bad at all so you
Armand I wish all gaming could just be
played against easy bots on csgo
I shouldn't play with real people it's a
bad idea a few moments late
yeah okay so I pressured Crouch right
that's not a good idea oh come on that
was actually pretty close that was
pretty close rhymed there was a solid uh
eight and twenty for the switch seven is
a legitimately cool laptop whoever
you're paying a price for that not only
are you losing for it so you know you
get dongles in the box more importantly
it's expensive around eleven hundred
dollars you can pick up other laptops
that are very similarly equipped that
have actual USB ports an HDMI ports
they're gonna cost you a couple hundred
dollars less this is not a bad laptop
but you really are paying a premium for
those extra few millimeters of thickness
so what do you guys think I'm Pub the
world's thinnest laptop deadly be sure
to let me know what you think in the
comments below and I will catch you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
