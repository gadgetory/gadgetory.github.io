today I'm here with a tutorial on how to
jailbreak your iPhone or iPod Touch
using red snow now you guys might know
red snow that's a program you used
before to jailbreak but it's been
updated for a three point one point two
and it allows some really cool things
such as changing your boot logo so yeah
let's get this one started
okay guys so before we begin we gotta do
a couple things obviously first of all
we're going to need to download red snow
but before we do that I want to make
sure that you can go ahead and do this
okay so so there's a couple things that
you need to do one you need to be
running either a Windows PC or an Intel
based Mac if you have a power PC Mac or
an Linux computer they will work but not
right now they're still working on
adding that functionality I don't know
exactly when it will be ready but it
will be ready fairly soon so if you've
got one of those computers you might
need to look quite a little bit and also
if you have an iPod Touch 3rd generation
red snow currently does not support it
and even when it does most likely will
be tethered so it's not a little gonna
be that different so if you have an iPod
Touch 3rd generation and kind of adil up
for the moment anyway so if you have one
of the supported devices and you're on
either a Windows or an Intel based Mac
you're good to go so you go ahead come
to this link which I will have in the
description I will recommend go ahead
read through this I should cover
everything but it never hurts to you
know know just a little bit more about
it anyway so go ahead and read if you
like and then you need to come to the
download links now there's going to be
two download links one for an
intel-based Mac's up top and one for
Windows down bottom I'm using Windows 7
now so this would be for Windows so just
download whichever you want and we'll go
ahead and go to the next step okay so
now that you have read snow downloaded
just unzip it I prefer to put it on my
desktop as always but you know whatever
is convenient to you now you're going to
only need one more thing as going to be
your IPSW or your iPod or iPhone
firmware the firmware is real simple if
you don't know it's obviously just what
runs the device and red snow is just
going to basically edit it very slightly
so that basically you can get Cydia and
be jailbroken so it's real simple now
there's a couple ways of getting the
firmware if you happen to have the
firmware handy you know you've you've
jailbroken before and you've saved it in
a file go ahead you can just skip this
next step just bring it out to your
desktop otherwise if you don't have the
firmware it's really simple you can
download
if you need to but you really shouldn't
have to because iTunes will
automatically download it for you so if
you have ever if you've had your device
for any amount of time there's a really
good chance that iTunes has data has it
saved so to find that in Windows 7
you're going to need to hit Windows key
+ R and this will open the run command
and obviously the run command is in XP
in Vista as well you just open run
doesn't matter how you do it ok it's now
I'm going to want you to do this it's
very simple you do percentage sign at
data percentage sign that simple
okay so just type in exactly like that
then hit OK so now you will see that we
have we go into the add data file okay
now it's real simple you need to go now
I believe in XP it does not
automatically put you here basically you
just need to go to roaming Apple
Computer iTunes and then iPod software
updates ok so say that again you go into
add data roaming Apple Computer iTunes
and iPod software updates might seem a
little bit complicated but it's not a
big deal just go into that file and you
will see the IP SW and it would be your
iPod so in my case is iPod Touch 2nd
generation and it's the firmware 3 point
one point two okay very simple so now I
recommend going and copying and leave
the file in here but just copy it and go
ahead and put on your desktop so now
that you have it on your desktop we're
ready to begin technically but there's a
couple optional things you might want to
consider before we actually begin the
process and that is boot logo and
recovery logo now one of the big things
and probably the main reason you want to
use red snow is that it supports boot
logos and recovery logos and the custom
ok so before you begin you might want to
take a pause and go find one or go make
one or whatever it's real simple just
needs to be a PNG file it's not huge and
obviously 320 by 480
so make one find one whatever obviously
you don't have to get one but it's
probably the main reason you're doing it
so as you see here I have my two so now
you have red snow downloaded you have
your IP SW and you have your boot logo
in recovery logo ready to be
okay so now we are ready to begin now
there's only one thing last thing you
want to do hopefully you guys figure it
out but yeah you're going to need to
remember to take your iPod Touch or
iPhone and plug it into your computer
via USB
I've already got this done now be sure
to if iTunes pops up make sure it's
closed obviously you don't want iTunes
running you want to have everything
closed so now that you have your iPod or
iPhone hooked up the view USB it's time
to go ahead and open up red snow so just
go ahead and double click it now
it's gonna be really simple just real
quickly and then all I gotta do is click
browse okay now at this point look for
the IP SW the firmware we just got
whatever it is obviously mine is on my
desktop so as you go ahead and click it
and hit open and just give it one second
to process the firmware okay so now at
this point it will give you a little
prompt if you are on an iPod touch and
this is very important to make sure that
you're not on an update iPod touch such
as a third generation or a newer second
generation okay now to check it's very
simple as you can see here it says is
this an MC model of the iPod Touch 2nd
generation okay so at this point all you
need to do is open up your iPod or
iPhone obviously it's your gonna have an
iPod hit Settings General and about and
on the bottom you will see your serial
number and if it starts with MC then you
do not need to use red snow because it
is not supported that's the best way to
do it and it's very simple so assuming
that it is a older iPod Touch 2nd
generation
go ahead and you are good so you can go
ahead and click no ok so now we're in
red snow it's successfully identified
the IPSW go ahead and click next now you
give it just a minute it's going it's
going to prepare the jailbreak data so
it's going to patch up the kernel and do
some other things this is really simple
just give it a second now you can go
through the options
obviously you want Cydia you can leave
the boot alone if you if you want a
customized that you can but really just
I would just leave it unchecked now
you're going to need to go into the
custom boot logo and custom recovery
logo so obviously I have both you don't
have to
use this but that's probably good reason
so I'm go ahead and click my boot logo
here and same with my recovery logo now
also you can do the already pwned option
and that is to just add a new boot logo
without having to reach reduce reduce
try jailbreak your iPod or iPhone so
that's really simple if you've already
been jailed if your re jailbroken you
just want to add a new boot logo you can
just do that and then it'll it'll just
be a lot quicker but we're jailbreaking
from scratch so you're good now
go ahead and click Next and now will you
go ahead and show you guys how to do it
okay so once you get this pop up its
gonna be really simple all you're gonna
need to do is make sure that your iPod
or iPhone is connected via USB and you
ready to begin ok so if you are Dennis
before you've ever use red snow or some
of the older jailbreak programs you know
what to do it's really simple just take
your iPod and then you need to hold the
home and the power button and you don't
keep them held down until this message
disappears might taking you 20 30
seconds or so I'm going to go ahead and
do it with you okay so one but hand up
here one down here and you start holding
it it's really simple they see it'll say
slight power off to ignore that and keep
holding it and in just a second ill
start to reboot and still keep holding
it until that message totally disappears
okay so still keep holding it you know
just one more minute and then you will
see just one second it will say connect
to itunes and you will be done so you
see here it does take there we go okay
so now we're done here and now you see
that it is going through it and it's
uploading everything and as you see here
it was that simple now it says download
jailbreak data and we're basically done
as you see here it will probably take
three four five minutes something like
that let red snow finish up but
obviously you see that this says
downloading jailbreak data you will take
them
because I have to reboot several times
and iTunes will recognize that stuff but
it's really simple you're done so like I
said wait four or five minutes whatever
and then basically your iPod will be
totally the same as it was before the
only difference will be that you will
have Cydia and you also have a new boot
logo so let me go ahead and cut here let
it finish up and show you guys did your
broken device okay so as you see here
guys my custom boot logo and yeah it's
finally restarting this so let's go
ahead and give it just a minute and it
should be good so yeah guys that's about
it for red snow uh you know I gotta say
I'm pretty impressed with red snow it
works really nice really fast it runs
really nice and smooth you guys right
down there at Cydia so as you see guys
it's really nice it's smooth it does not
take very long which is pretty cool and
if I forgot to mention this it I had I
did a customer store before I did this
video because I did before I tested it
but if you already have like less than
you have your phone obviously full you
know data app so I can stuff it's gonna
stay the only different changes red snow
makes is to the recovery the boot logo
and it basically will patch it so that
you can add Cydia so that's pretty cool
yeah guys that's about it red snow I I
definitely like it and it works really
good anyway thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
