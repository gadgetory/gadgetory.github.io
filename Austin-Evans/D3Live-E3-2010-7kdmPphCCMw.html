we're going to be taking a look at all
we expect to see in III 2010 this year
first wind stop with PSN premium now PSN
premium looks pretty good I've gotta
admit PSN of course is the free xbox
live alternative to the PlayStation 3
and of course you can do a lot of things
such as you know play games with friends
your trophies all that kind of stuff but
what kids and premium is going to be all
about this is actually going to allow
you to go ahead and do a lot of things
such as cross the game voice chat you
can do some things like downloading full
demos of any game play them for like an
hour a lot of cool things it's going to
be pretty good
so we expected this will go ahead and be
announced at e3 2010 this year
now of course it will be paid as the
premium name suggests it will be paid so
we don't know how much it'll be people
set all kinds of stuff from five dollars
a year to you know eight dollars a year
but generally I think it will probably
be roughly on par with Xbox Live
probably a little bit cheaper but you
know who knows the features look really
good guys I don't personally have a
PlayStation 3 but you know a lot of the
really good things that from Xbox Live
has the PlayStation is taking them and
they're bumping it up a notch
I mean it's because of course with PSN
it's the one you should stay exactly the
same so if you don't want to pay for it
you should be able to do everything that
you can beforehand so for example you're
still playing games with your friends
but if you go for kiss and premium
you'll just get more so guys definitely
check this out it's a pretty cool thing
I expect we'll see it at e3 this year
the next thing we'll be taking a look at
today is the Xbox 360 slim now guys Xbox
360 slim is something that we've talked
about a lot you know to be honest I
think it's kind it's not exactly
necessary but as you know they advance
and then you know fake stuff on the Xbox
Kinect like all the red rings then of
course they do notice makes sense
they're gonna go ahead and slim it down
and you know fix stuff um so we've had a
couple pictures about it before and it
basically looks very similar to you know
the Xbox is just a little bit slimmer
and that's what I expect that we will
publish see now I will say guys that I
don't
and expect that we will actually see the
Xbox 360 slim at this year III I do
think we'll qui see it sometime this
year but probably thought might be a
little bit longer we might wait you know
a few extra months before we see it you
know this was a major console release
I'm sure we will go ahead and see it you
know like 6 months in advance when it's
just you know a refresh is making it a
little bit smaller I don't know who
they'll make a full huge deal about it
you know six months before it comes out
you know hurt all the sales of the Xbox
360 in the meantime
now what expect for the Xbox 360 slim is
that it's going to be very similar to
what that normal Xbox 360 is yeah you
will go ahead and you know still have
you know hard drives although for all we
know they actually might become it would
be internal hard drives instead of the
top one because I really don't see if
it's going to be an Xbox 360 slim then
it will actually go ahead and snap on
top I just don't see them they it's
gonna be slammer there's no app that the
normal hard drives will fit I mean I
think it'll probably an internal hard
drive with any luck we actually might
have Wireless built in finally there are
also a couple smaller things such as you
know they might remove the memory card
slots which makes sense considering that
Xbox with one of the later firmware
updates have been able to go ahead you
can plug in USB thumbs thumb drives for
example G's just like memory cards you
know to bring your data and all your
profiles and everything from one Xbox to
another or whatever now as the name
would suggest obviously an Xbox 360 slim
should be smaller but I know a lot of
people looked at it Ben Heck for example
he's a really good Xbox moderate he's
created Xbox laptops and all kinds of
stuff he's taking a look at some of the
pictures we got a few months ago and you
know he basically said that you know the
Xbox 360 the way that DVD Drive is and
the way that you know it just needs the
cooling everything no matter what they
did you know even with smaller parts and
I think it's not going to be you know
like the size of a week I don't think
anybody really expected that I mean you
look at the ps3 the original and
compared to the ps3 slim it's smaller
but you know it's very relative I mean
you know goes from really big to just be
you know so but I suspect you know it
might
you know get about an inch thinner might
not be quite so tall might not be quite
so long you know that's not kind of
necessary in my opinion I mean I love my
xbox 360 but it's big I mean I'm not
gonna lie it's a big big thing so you
know if you can go ahead they could
shrink it a little bit maybe like add
like internal hard drives hopefully you
know something pretty decent you know
instead of these you know 60 gigs and
120 gigs maybe something a little bit
more where we can go ahead and store
lots of movies and games and that kind
of stuff um think we didn't do that
remove some of the features like memory
cards that we don't need and especially
add features like Wi-Fi because to be
honest the fact that they charge you
$100 and $1 for my after face bucks
really I mean I don't get that yeah guys
so again I don't know 100% expect this
to come out of me 3 it might but I do
expect that we will see the Xbox 360
slam or whatever they decide to call it
by the end of the year so the last III
thing that I'm expecting this year will
be the Nintendo 3ds now of course you
know the you know we've heard about it
and they Nintendo just you know put out
a really a high press statement
basically saying there's gonna be a new
3ds just to kind of offhand I believe
there were some Japanese press we're
about to link the sport anyways they
jumped ahead of them so even to this day
even though they announced Nintendo's
officially announced at e3 they will
show the 3ds we don't know that much
about it but I will go ahead and go
through what we do know so real quickly
we do know though that it should have
two screens now that I'm sure they did
say that it will be compatible with
normal DS games and seeing as normal TS
games have two screens
I'll bet that the 3ds does as well
especially because it's worked pretty
well for Nintendo in the past but also
because of the fact that you know with
the two screens you have the touch
screen and then the top but it's
obviously not a touch screen but of
course if they that's not a definite
that would have two screens I see I mean
a possibility like you see on my DSi
right here if you imagine that I put
these two screens together and you have
just made like you know the top screen
and the bottom screen and you just touch
on the bottom screen if it was just one
big touch screen like very similar to
like what an iPod or iPhone with me then
you know I can definitely see that that
could work as well
now what we've heard and I absolutely
have to believe saying it has been so
many years since the original Diaz came
out well is that the 3ds one has some
seriously improved graphics and
obviously it's been half pretty so what
we've heard is that it should have the
NVIDIA Tegra 2 chip now this is a really
common it's it's very powerful it will
go ahead and to be able to render really
pretty decent 3d graphics you know I
mean pretty a good step up from you know
the DES and even the PSP of today now
the one thing that you know everybody's
talked about is this gonna be 3d you
know it's everybody this year has been
talking about you know 3d TVs wants
going to be a 3d handheld well this has
never be kind of me this is gonna be
kind of hard to understand exactly how
the 3d is gonna work now there's been
some sharp made screen touch screens
that will allow you to go ahead and
without any 3d glasses at all be able to
look and see the 3d now that's gonna be
kind of cool because it's going to be
give you a very similar experience 3d
that you see in for example of movie
theater you know with the 3d glasses on
but you don't have to wear any glasses
because all done on the screen now if
they're to do this it'll be a really
cool thing I think I mean between you
know having a possible accelerometer and
having 3d I can imagine some really cool
3d environments where you actually see
the entire world move as you move the
iPod I'm sorry I bought the DS it'd be a
really cool deal now of course this one
is not you know specular anything Dave
Nintendo's come out and said that they
will announce that at e3 this year now
when exactly it will come out that's a
little unclear originally they said that
it will be out before I believe April of
next year but a lot of people have said
a bunch of people come forward and game
developers etc it said that it should be
out by October of this year that makes
sense if it's going to be out by the
holiday season which is of course where
they sell tons and tons of them expected
October sounds like a pretty reasonable
thing so guys I definitely would expect
to see the DSi and rabbit I'm sorry the
3ds of the three this year now one thing
we don't know about the 3ds
I would touch on this really quickly
that we don't know the final name now
they said that the 3ds they've said it
more than on one occasion that the 3ds
is not going to be the final DS I mean
the final name of it now they've said
that it might be something else than
they were going to go ahead and go
forward with what the name is but we've
seen some things in Japan where they've
actually copyrighted some things such as
3d s where a couple of things using the
3ds name it's a decent name I think it
could work
personally you know I'm a big fan of the
original game boys I wish they'd called
the no Nintendo Game Boys 3d or
something but I understand that you know
they might want to go ahead and you know
go ahead just use the Nintendo 3ds or
something very similar so we just have
to see about that okay guys so as always
