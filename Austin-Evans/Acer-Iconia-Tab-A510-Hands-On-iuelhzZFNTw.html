live at CES 2012 with the acer iconia
tab a510 so if you guys won't come in
here you go ahead take a look this is
powered by nvidia tegra 3 so this is
going to be a pretty cool tablet here
one of the very first tablets to come
pre-loaded with ice cream sandwich and
of course it does run the Tegra 3 I also
might give you guys a little demo here
Ice Cream Sandwich on this is very
smooth very snappy as you see here force
with quad-core processor got plenty of
power to do pretty much anything you
want so in fact while I'm here when I
let me take a look at something so let's
just give a shot Riptide GP just give
you guys a little demo of the gaming
performance I know while it's loading
here if you want to come around to the
side you guys can see this have some
cool ports so you have an hdmi crow hdmi
mini or something like that it's
probably something we need there around
back pick it up here because to be able
to see it does have a rear facing camera
not entirely sure what kind of specs on
that and we want to come over here to
the left take a look it does look like
it has a headphone as well as the power
and up top we have a volume rocker and a
lock switch let's go and give you guys a
little demo of the graphics on the
iconia tab a510 so go ahead and right
here see if i can do what i can do with
just a microphone but seeing some demos
of this in person this looks some really
impressive graphics soon ok so see here
no idea what I'm doing here
there we go I'm gonna do it with two one
hand here ah I'm gonna fail there guys
this has been a hands-on video demo of
the a 510</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
