here with the test to see exactly which
browser you should be using for this one
I test it on both Windows and Mac on the
PC side I used a mid-range system with a
core i3 eight gigabytes of RAM and a 250
gigabyte SSD for the Mac I used a 2013
MacBook Air with a core i7 eight gigs of
ram and a 128 gig solid-state drive to
kick the tests off we have peacekeeper
which is one of my favorites as it tests
a wide range of things from speed to
compatibility on the windows side both
Chrome and opera do very well which
makes sense as they're closely related
under the hood Internet Explorer and
Firefox are quite a bit behind here
though switch over to Mac and you'll see
things are closer as Opera and Chrome
swap places and Safari puts in a decent
showing next up we have octane which
sets aside all the other stuff and
focuses on how fast each browser is
shockingly enough again Chrome and opera
put in very good showings on Windows
Firefox does a lot better here and the
latest version of Internet Explorer is
lagging behind on Mavericks is starting
to become clear that opera is ever so
slightly quicker than chrome with the
others a little ways back moving on
let's take a look at the html5 test
which is essentially how each browser
handles the rule book of the Internet
here we can compare browsers across
Windows and OS 10 where Chrome and opera
do very well yet again interestingly the
built-in Safari and Internet Explorer
both fall quite a bit behind browser
scope is the next test and it takes a
look exactly how secure or not each
browser is again we can check both
Windows and Mac results here and opera
takes the win for blocking the most
threats with Firefox trailing a little
way behind the rest ons are you open and
close your browser a few times a day so
for this next test I took a look at how
long each browser takes to load and then
open up the Google home page here we see
Internet Explorer take a pretty
substantial lead on Windows partially
thanks to it being built-in and always
hiding in the background Firefox Chrome
and opera are all a little ways behind
jump over to Mac and the results are
very very close with chrome taking a
slight lead but all four load within a
half second of each other thanks to the
SSD the less memory of
Oh grant eats up the better especially
if you have a slower computer so this
next test measures how well each browser
handles seven tabs open on Windows 8.1
there's a major difference with Firefox
taking up less than half the memory of
Internet Explorer opera distances itself
a bit from chrome here as well
likely thanks to a more stripped-down
build of chromium jump over to using a
Mac and things are much closer with
Safari and chrome winning out but by a
fairly small margin while there are lots
of personal reasons for choosing a web
browser if you're on Windows the best
overall choice is Chrome now if you're
on a Mac it's a little harder to nail
down as both opera and chrome are
fantastic choices so it really comes
down to whichever one you prefer
speaking of what web browser are you
using right now definitely be sure to
let me know in the comments below or
over on Twitter because I'm basically
over there 24/7 so yeah that's the thing
anyway guys thank you so much for
