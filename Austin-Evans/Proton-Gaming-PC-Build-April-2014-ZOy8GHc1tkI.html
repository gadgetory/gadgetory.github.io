the proton ready to see what you can
build for the price of a console the
idea for this build is to see what you
can put together to compete with a ps4
Xbox one while for pure graphics it's
hard to beat the beefy APU in the
PlayStation 4 right now there are a lot
of advantages to gaming on a PC
including the ridiculously huge game
library first of all is the case which
here is the fractal design core 1000
I've used this a few times for budget
builds as it's surprisingly well built
comes with USB 3.0 and is nice and easy
to work in especially for first-time
builders crack open the proton and
you'll find it's powered by AMD's latest
Kaveri APU with a quad-core CPU clocked
at 3.5 gigahertz and built in r7
graphics the AMD a10 7700 K is a solid
choice on a budget it's not all that
different to the AP use inside the
consoles and packs enough power to play
games at reasonable settings a nice plus
is that the 7700 K comes with a free
copy of battlefield 4 right now since
people are constantly pestering me to
test minecraft the proton handles it no
problem with the graphics cranked up at
55 frames per second jump over to
battlefield 4 and you'll need to bump
the resolution down to 720p which really
is the sweet spot for Kaveri but
otherwise you'll see a nice 41 FPS on
medium next we've got Metro last light
again this particularly punishing on AP
use but we're still able to get 36
frames per second on low settings
BioShock Infinite is a game that looks
great period and here the proton is able
to handle it on medium at just under 45
fps last but not least as far as the
games go is grid 2 which is a much more
forgiving game on the 7700 K with frame
rates in the mid 40s even on medium
settings at full 1080p resolution as
always there's more to build than just
the raw numbers so the proton is built
inside a micro ATX case which means that
shouldn't take up your entire desk and
also runs fairly quiet on the power side
of things the proton does very well as
you would expect from an APU based
system with needing 30 watts at idle and
just over 80 watts in gaming now when
doing a gaming bill based on an APU one
of the most important things to look for
is the memory you really can't skimp out
here for the proton
we've got a gigabytes of g.skill ripjaws
1866 megahertz ram not only is having
eight gigabytes important even on budget
systems these days but that faster
memory speed makes a big difference
especially in gaming while SSDs are
awesome and there's nothing stopping you
from using one in the proton that can be
a bit pricey so for this bill we're
going instead with a one terabyte
Western Digital blue hard drive the
motherboard is an msi a 78 M II 35
another one of these parts I love using
and build as it gives you all the bells
and whistles you need including USB 3.0
SATA 3 and the ability to overclock if
you're up for squeezing a little more
performance out of the proton to power
everything we've got a corsair CX 430
for the power supply now I love these
things not only are they rock-solid as
far as the reliability goes but 430
watts is actually going to be enough to
not only run everything in the system
but also allow you to add an additional
graphics card later on if you like to
altogether you're looking at a pretty
killer little system that's perfect for
games like Minecraft League of Legends
dota and Starcraft like with the maze on
I will have everything you guys need
including the full parts list additional
information as well as some upgrades in
the link in the description over on my
website so definitely go check it out
anyway I've got to go big shout out to
Hulu Plus for making this video possible
you've probably tried Hulu on your
computer but Hulu Plus is so much more
with Hulu Plus you can watch current
season episodes of your favorite shows
like The Colbert Report Shark Tank and
Family Guy along with every episode of
shows like Naruto South Park and Doctor
Who along with add free movies and kid

phone isn't that convenient you also get
