great year for smartphones the pixel
three is killing it on the camera side
we've got the Oppo find X which might be
the coolest design yet and we have the
good old poco phone which at 300 ollars
is kind of changed the game I just read
this is a blue phone or a blue
background does that look weird okay
wait hold it in this hand the poco phone
it's changing the game for real though
this phone has changed the way a lot of
smart phones are being sold right now
previously the oneplus really was kind
of like the standard of the sort of
benchmark phone at a much cheaper price
right so we get all the flagship specs
but usually at a couple hundred a lot of
discount however this year the poco
phone is doing the exact same thing but
it's something close to $300
while most phones at this price point
have significantly slower internals and
the flagship of the world that's where
the poco phone definitely differs in
sight it has the exact same snapdragon
845 processor as in the $1000 galaxy
note 9 the battery again the exact same
size as that note 9 even when you take a
look at the design is fairly similar to
the notch on the iPhone and well yes it
is made of plastic when you consider
that all this is coming in a phone
that's just a little bit over $300 it is
seriously impressive that's where this
comes in the brand new Nokia 7.1 which
at 3m $50 might just be able to go
head-to-head the biggest difference here
is in build so the polka phone does come
in a couple configurations this is the
armoured edition with the aramid fiber
back and you also have the cheaper
plastic but none of these really can
hold up to the glass and metal of that
Nokia I mean this looks so much nicer
not only does it have that glass but
it's also made out of aluminum and
personally as far as I'm concerned it is
a lot nicer right I mean sure they
definitely spend a lot more of the
budget on the build quality versus the
internals but you spend all day holding
the phone I do think that's an important
consideration of course though none of
this really matters too much if you put
these phones in a case as much as I like
the feeling of the Nokia it is a lot
more fragile right if I drop the phone
I'm gonna shatter the back more than
likely
where's what the poco phone might be
plastic but if I scratch it whatever
I guess not whatever but I don't have to
replace the entire phone as opposed to
this guy considering that both phones
are pretty cheap the screens are not bad
at all
the poco phone is a little bit bigger
although they're about the same
resolution the main difference here is
with the speakers
neither of these phones sound all that
great
so the main issue is that they both have
a single bottom firing speaker which is
a little tinny and easy to cover but the
good thing is is that they both have our
friend Jack headphone jack that
headphone jack is useful for the sponsor
in today's video Maz drop in their
excellent AKG M 220 Pro headphones D CL
Smooth that was WOW I know right
headphone jack approves please have
quickly become some of my favorite
headphones especially considered there
right now on mass drop they're only $35
with a wide soundstage thanks to the
semi-open design not only do they sound
way better than you expect for the price
but on top of that they're comfortable
they're fairly lightweight they have
replaceable ear cups as well as a cable
it's a really really solid package
really really and I just really saw it
really really solid because I know
adjectives and adverbs and thesauruses
mass drop wanted to make a deal just for
you guys so for the next 30 days you can
pick these up for only $35 if you've
been in the market for some decent
audiophile grade headphones definitely
be sure to go check them out the link in
the description of this video the real
difference between these two phones is
in performance run them through
Geekbench and you will see there is a
massive lead for the poco phone it is
really playing in a different league it
also has the advantage of a heat pipe to
help keep the foam cool while you're
gaming and on top of that the Polka
phone has more ran six gigs versus four
there is this big of a real-world
difference in performance as you might
expect but it is very clear to me that
the polka phone is a superior performer
and that goes a long way especially want
to use this phone for a few years it
should be able to keep up it also helps
that the polka phone has a significantly
bigger battery forty thousand milliamp
hours versus three thousand on the nokia
now at this point it might seem like the
polka phone is the very obvious winner
but there's one key area that the nokia
has over it and that is software so this
is using shammies me UI on top of
Android 8.1 which is a little bit of a
skinned version of Android shall we say
whereas this is completely stock version
of Android 9.0 Pi and it is Android 1
compatible which means this is
guaranteed at least two years of solid
software updates where's the polka phone
I mean it's got an update so far but who
knows how long that will last
now software can't be a subjective thing
it may be might like some of the extra
features the way that they've scanned
the poco phone as far as I'm concerned I
will definitely take stock Android any
day and the very least I would want to
put a launcher on the poco or
back both have a similar setup with a 12
megapixel main camera as well as a depth
sensor for portrait mode and for looking
like you have two cameras on the back of
your phone honestly both are totally
usable but I will give a slight edge to
the poco phone now that does it
consistently give really nice and
results right out of the box but on top
of it I think a lot of people just will
prefer the slight tuning of the images
that poco is doing the nokia it looks
fine but I do feel like I trust the poco
phone just a little bit more and that
goes especially in low-light the nokia
does have a little bit of an advantage
when it comes to selfies but as far as
video goes again I'm gonna give it to
the poco phone that 4k video actually
looks really impressive at least here in
the US both these phones are easily
available on Amazon links in the
description but the main difference here
is that while the nokia does come with a
warranty here the poco phone actually
doesn't have any US warranty your
results will vary based on what country
you're in but that might be a
deal-breaker for some people the build
quality and especially the software is
really impressive on the nokia but I
have to give this one to the poco phone
not only is it a great overall package
both the hundreds of dollars you're
gonna save versus a bigger more
expensive flagship you could even buy
yourself a pair of shiny new mass drop
headphones available right now
