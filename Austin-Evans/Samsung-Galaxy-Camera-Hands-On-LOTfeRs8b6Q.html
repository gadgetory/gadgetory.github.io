here with a hands-on of the new Samsung
Galaxy camera now I've been waiting for
something like this for a long time
of course smartphone cameras are getting
better and better but they're still
going to be limited there's not going to
be any zoom there's gonna be some little
issues as far as just the small sensor
you can't get you the best images all
the time so that's where the Galaxy
camera comes in it's basically a normal
compact camera but it's got all the guts
of something like the Samsung Galaxy has
to be built in taking a look at the
galaxy camera you'll see from the front
it looks pretty much like every other
compact camera around cover it flip it
around to the back and you will see a
giant 4.7 inch display so this is very
similar to what you will find on the
galaxy s3 and what it means is that you
actually have a really really nice
display so there's no other buttons on
the back or a couple up top here as far
as resume and whatnot but for the most
part is just all screen all the time
which is very cool so let's go ahead
jump right on into the camera and so I'm
go ahead and just give you guys a little
demo here just take a picture of this
note and just take this picture so it
works just like a normal camera it's
very fast very responsive but if we go
ahead and open this up we shall have
quite a few different options let's go
ahead and open up expert mode here we
have all kinds of different options to
choose from so you choose shutter speed
we can choose aperture go ahead and
choose it exposure ISO which it goes all
the way up to 3200 you do all kinds of
stuff so see if we can get a decent
picture here so we're gonna adjust it
you see that does adjust on the fly so
we can't see yeah it's a little
overexposed there you go that looks good
I didn't half press the shutter and we
got the picture of course there are lots
of cameras but the cool thing is this
has full support for all kinds of apps
I'm gonna open this up here we have
widgets apps it's basically just like
using a normal Android smartphone it's
even has a drop-down notification bar so
of course you have a couple of specific
apps so for example you have a video
editor which is definitely cool and I
can actually see myself actually using
this example shooting some video and an
event editing it on the device uploading
it because it does of course have Wi-Fi
as well as 4G you also do have the Play
Store so it's actually not going to be
set up here just yet but you're gonna a
download pretty much any app to work on
your Android phone it's gonna work just
fine on the Galaxy camera so up front
you have a 23 millimeters wide angle
lens now it does go up to 21 times zoom
which is actually pretty impressive a
lot better than will be able to get on
your normal smartphone with your digital
zoom which really is just basically a
glorified crop mode up top here you'll
have basically wadies your sleep/wake
button so go ahead and hit that it'll
lock unlock
all that kind of fun stuff you have your
zoom slider which actually doubles as a
volume so come on go ahead and adjust
that over here we do have a USB port so
of course you can connect it to your
computer but probably the most important
thing is down here you will be able to
see you have HDMI you have a micro SD
card and you also do have a SIM card
slot so of course this is going to be
available with 4G so the doors not gonna
close but that's okay how you do have a
tripod mount down here and that's pretty
much it again around back there's going
to be pretty much no controls you have
some virtual Android keys
I know it does adjust so if you want to
you can go ahead and make it look
exactly like a normal galaxy device but
yeah anyway guys it's gonna be about it
for my first look at the new Samsung
Galaxy camera at first glance it looks
really impressive and that's not doesn't
have an official release date just yet
besides later this year but you will be
able to pick it up from carriers such as
AT&amp;amp;T so my guys it's gonna be about it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
