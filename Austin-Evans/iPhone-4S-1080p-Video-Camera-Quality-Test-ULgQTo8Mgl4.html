using the back facing camera on the
iPhone 4s so I am course outside for the
coastal road so it's probably a little
noisy not much wind so if you guys are
hearing the wind you might get hurt a
little bit but you shouldn't hear that
much I'm sure let's go and just take a
look so let's do some focusing tests so
if we get nice up and close here and I
tap the screen should be able to focus
yeah they do
of course tests have auto focus as well
that's very bright here so I can't see
the screen super well well yeah it's
going just keep going so I know what I'm
looking for are you something exciting
to film how about we get close to this
tree so again I shall I know I do we get
again focus focus very well there we go
so nice little shot here also you guys
should be able to see as I walk around
the stabilization so I don't let it
focus back here but oh I'll do a little
more walking around seeing from what I
can tell on the phone it looks very
stable it's very smooth and all that
kind of stuff I'm even holding one hand
right now I'll hold it two-handed and
move slowly don't look too bad
so hey guys it's gonna be a quick
quality test of the rear facing camera
the 1080p video of the iPhone 4s</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
