conference just wrapped up the major
keynote for today there are a couple
different things they talked to a little
bit about android the next version
android but well i'm going to cover
today is the google TV guys this looks
really really solid so let me just go
ahead and give you guys a brief rundown
it was bad now and a half of stuffs i'm
going to cat try to convince it for you
so the first thing is just the basics
the google TV will be out all this year
they'll be sold under a couple different
companies sony will make it built into a
sony TV as well as that will make a box
just like me very much like a cable box
like a TiVo or something and in addition
logitech is also going to be make their
own kind of set top box we can expect
more partners and everything to come
forward and make these set-top boxes
with google TV built in but it launched
they're just going to be the three of
those um so let me go ahead and explain
to you guys a little bit about what
Google TV is it's pretty impressive so
basically Google TV when you first hook
it up and what's just like your normal
TV you actually go ahead and you can
watch your favorite shows go change
channels it just does everything like
that and you just look it up to normal
cable or satellite very simple but the
cool thing is that you can go ahead and
pull up your menu and it will go ahead
and launch you into the full Google TV
experience and guys it looks really cool
so basically what Google TV is is it's a
modified version of Android for your TV
so the cool thing is it showed a lot of
demos like for example like they show
that somebody was watching a basketball
game so then they're like well you hit
the button and then a box comes down
from the top and then you can search and
so you search whatever and then inside
that search box will you will see Google
search you will see TV channels so like
they served us say you search high
search house for example will show when
house comes on the next couple times you
can actually have it hooked up to you
just click it and it'll automatically
record on the DVR soon as that comes on
but you can also search the web as well
which is very cool so they have a full
web browser on
it's actually chrome which is kind of
interesting that they have chrome
running on Android but so they have the
full chrome running on Android with with
flash fully enabled and I've got to say
guys it looks really solid they showed
searching through a lot of websites
opening them up everything around
perfect videos ads flash obviously
worked so it looked really really solid
another very very cool thing I thought
was actually my favorite thing in the
whole of the whole keynote was the fact
that you can actually watch picture and
picture TV and web browsing so how this
works is basically like again they will
shoot a lot of basketball so they had a
basketball game going well they had some
button I don't know they're going to
have special keyboards and mice pointing
devices something it's going to work
very similar to like a normal computer
so they open it up and in your TV want
to picture in picture mode so your
normal TV went down to the bottom right
so you can still down and watch the game
but what you could also do is on top of
that you had your full web browsing so
you know like they for example showed
like you can be watching the game and
then looking at the scores for the game
or whatever like that I think that's a
really cool thing I hadn't even thought
about that for the idea that you can go
ahead and watch TV and surf the internet
and it looks really quite good so guys
there's a lot of different things that
showed apps for example on the
surprising thing is is that a lot of
normal Android apps will go ahead and
run on google TV without any
modification pretty much any app that
doesn't you know lie on stuff like
straight from phone like for example
like an accelerometer or something like
that anything that is standard and basic
like for example Pandora you know likes
like website kind of acts that sort of
thing will run automatically just by you
know adding it they also will go ahead
and add a lot of new special google TV
apps now this problem will not be coming
towards the beginning of next year the
google TV will could be out all the
boxes and the team will be out of this
fall but they're going to the api's and
all that kind of stuff won't be out till
the beginning of next year so when you
first get the google TV ad the box that
won't be able to
doing these things but it will in time
and a lot of the stuff that show those
really cool I'm seeing guys that's about
it with all we know about the google TV
i gotta say guys I'm really impressed
with it it looked very very solid or no
no they had a lot a lot a lot of
technical difficulties they had a bunch
of bluetooth keyboards and not more
connecting cut because they were in a
room like 4,000 developers all with the
phones on it was it was actually pretty
funny to watch the conference they had
at the end they had the CEOs a sony
intel logitech best buy adobe had a ton
CEOs including that eric schmidt in guba
CEO of google mail came out but it was
kind of a funny moment when they were
people were bringing the chairs out and
they were walking behind them so you see
these huge CEOs talking and then you see
people walking around with chairs it was
it was really funny but overall guys I'm
really impressed google TV um of course
it will be available like i said on a
sony TV sony set box and a logitech set
box at the beginning but they will go
ahead and because it would be open
source next year and they'll i'm sure
they'll be working with more people from
now on they will be having all kinds of
more boxes so the whole story i think is
that Apple you better get rid of that
Apple TV this the google just blew you a
little higher but you guys so it
definitely looks really cool on i expect
definitely once it comes out i
definitely take a look at it because
this really looks cool to be able to
surf the web watch TV do it mix the two
doing the same time whatever anyway guys
it was definitely a very cool keynote</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
