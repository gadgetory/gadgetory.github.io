my third application review okay so
let's get this one started with a really
interesting application that first of
all I think everyone should go out and
get for two simple reasons okay it's
called boombox
now I'm sure most of you have or have at
least seen Pandora now believe me I love
Pandora it's just a religious great
application you can listen to music
everything but it has two big downfalls
one of which is the fact that you can
only listen to six I mean you can only
skip six songs and for me I like to I
like to skip around a lot so I mean
we've only been able to skip six songs
usually that just I just shut it down
after that and the second thing is that
it just doesn't you you can listen to
new stations and obviously you know
finding music which is great but a lot
of times I want to find a certain
special song and I really can't do that
in boombox you can do both okay in
boombox is it's really cool you can
actually go through and search any song
you want and listen to it as many times
as you want it's basically like having
every single song I mean the the library
is really pretty bit nicely sized
basically having any song you want on
your iPod or iPhone do note that this
only works over Wi-Fi there's a paid
version that uses 3G I believe but you
can stream it over but I've I've got an
iTouch so it's not a really big deal
basically the it's great I let me know I
love it a lot of times I'll you've got
this one certain song plan in my head
but there's one big downfall and that is
it's glitchy it's laggy in general if
you didn't have such such a great amount
of music everything that I can't find
really anywhere else I would not even I
mean I would not even bother with this I
mean there's as soon as you launch it
it's constant barrage of asking for your
location and even if you eat no matter
what you hit it keeps coming back every
few seconds I mean that gets really
annoying then beyond that it now that I
will say they are changing servers right
now so that might help
not um the thing is though is that even
even so that they're doing that it's
been like this for a long time now I
don't know maybe there may be when they
change it it might help but Mele
annoying
that said though it's free and I see
absolutely no reason for you at least
not put it on the back of your device
listen to Pandora all the time or
last.fm or anything whatever else you
use but everyone smiling you know you
get that one song you want to listen to
pull this out and it's perfect
glitches and lag and everything aside I
do recommend this app the second app I
will be reviewing today is a really cool
and actually it's called lemonade Tycoon
now first of all I'll say it's really
pretty unique because it tries a couple
things it's by EA and as you know I'm
sure everyone oh they make leap for
speed and there's the new Tiger Woods
golf game a lot of really pro games is
mentioned
not to mention about a million different
console games and this is the first free
one that I've found that wasn't a lite
version or anything like that and I
gotta say it's pretty cool if you've
ever played lemonade stand or lemonade
to for the eye Touch and iPhone you'll
you'll know instantly how it works
basically what you do is there's much
different options and all kinds of
different stuff like that but basically
there's career mode and challenge mode
what you do is you start and it will
give you a menu and basically what you
do is you got to make lemonade and sell
it people which sounds pretty simple
what you do is you have all kinds of
different options you their supplies
will you buy lemons and water I mean not
lemons sugar ice and cops there's then
there's a place where you go into the
recipe and in that way and that's pretty
important because that's how how people
will you know buy your lemonade and you
basically you can say per picture how
many lemons how much ice and how much
sugar and there's a couple new things
there's like marketing where you can go
in there
you can say how much the price is how
much you want for perk up then you can
do actually advertising and that's
that's key you'll I won't get into too
much of it because it's it's there's
there's a couple different cheats where
you can once you figure out the right
recipe and everything the game you blow
through the game but it's more fun to
learn it there's even a staff thing
which I've never I've never really seen
in a kind of eliminating those basically
where you can hire people which you know
that's pretty cool but you have to you
know be higher up and making a lot of
money there's upgrades where you can get
you know different kinds of like juicers
to get faster pictures and canopies all
kinds different stuff but when you first
start the game you really don't get into
a whole lot of that stuff then lastly
there's buttplate different places you
can go and then basically you just start
the day now one thing you'll have to
notice is that and towards the top it's
a really cool screen towards top it'll
tell you the weather the weather
forecast that's really key because it
depends on how many how much ice you put
in because if it's a cold day it's a hot
day you want put more or less ice and
it's little things like that that you
really got to pay attention to anyway so
once you start you go in and it's kind
of a cool it's kind of a cool I'm trying
to say I guess uh I have no idea what
I'm trying to say background graphics
whatever it's pretty cool because you
walk around I mean you know I don't know
what I'm saying you have everybody's
welcome by your stand and you can do it
slow or you can fast-forward it or you
can just you can watch it fast forward
reading just go through the whole day
and then at the end of it you'll have
everybody you have your results which
show you know how much you made how much
this that basically just everything he
needs to know and that's just about it
there's there's the challenge mode which
is basically just just a just a
challenge we'll just see how much money
you can make and so many days I I'm
sorry I've totally gotten in this career
which is basically just you go and
basically just make as much money as you
can
lemonade tycoon it's a pretty cool game
and I guys say
like I like the the format of it because
it's just like you know all the lemonade
stand and all the different games but
it's free now one thing you'll notice is
that there's a some pretty unique
advertising when you launch it there's a
there's gonna be a an ad for like a CD
on iTunes like Kelly Clarkson or some
kind of CD that you gotta see I don't
know I don't mean nobody likes
advertising but I would definitely not
mind you know looking at an ad every
once sir every day it's only when you
first launch it and basically just say
no and then get straight into a game so
I mean if seeing as its free one ad is
not that big a deal I have to do is tap
on the screen and say no and then you're
right into the game I mean obviously ads
aren't great but I it's not that big a
deal
anyway um I think lemonade Tycoon it's
pretty cool I'd say go ahead check it
out it is free I don't think that it's
gonna go up and I just pick it up
especially if you wanted any others the
last type I'll be reviewing today is a
really cool okay and it's called iron
sight light now if you've ever played
ice shoes or worms it's kind of similar
to that but it's totally different it's
actually 3d full just totally it's
really really sick basically what it is
is there's battle mecca's which
basically you know just robots with you
know different missiles that you pick up
and everything but you actually walk
around the train to shoot your to shoot
the the opponents I mean basically just
imagine I shoot in 3d I mean it's really
cool basically what you do is there's a
few levels in the light version but but
then the paid version is four dollars a
plate right now and let me say this from
the light version I definitely
definitely definitely plan on going to
get that because it is just that cool
basically there's some just awesome
awesome graphics I mean seriously
they're just sick basically you walk
around you depending on the level you
have different amounts of mecca's and
you know it may change it's not there's
never gonna be the same but
basically what you do is you uh you pick
your different whichever one you want to
battle you have like I want to say it's
90 seconds it could be 80 I'm not I'm
not really sure basically you walk your
Mecca around and basically just get
whatever position you want and then just
you can angle up the the firing your
firing angle to see you know how and
then you hold the fire button descent to
see how much power it's kind of a little
tricky just because an I shoot it was
pretty simple you know like where your
tank is and you just angle it up it's
pretty simple but with this everybody
moves and it's not just like left and
right whoever I mean it's a whole island
basically you can walk anywhere you want
that said though it's really really fun
the difficulty is kind of difficult but
once you start to get the hang of it I
mean you'll just play it non-stop like I
said it's a light version but I mean
it's got a lot going for it it's got
some just great graphics and gameplay
well like I said it is kind of difficult
but as you're walking around everything
I mean you see those awesome graphics
and the gameplay it's pretty cool
because I mean you actually it adds a
real third dimension to the whole game
because you're actually moving around
you're actually adjusting your firing
angles and I mean all kinds of just real
just cool cool stuff I'm not gonna get
too in-depth on it because it is a light
version but basically everybody needs to
go get this just right now it is just
awesome
it's ironsight light and I highly highly
recommend it and it seems like it the
full version I'll definitely do a review
on that to be sure to check out centric
