today I'm here with a review of a new
city application called multiflow using
this basically enables you to have some
kind of cool background style if you've
ever seen the palm pre and how it has
the deck of cards it's somewhat similar
although not quite as polished but it
does work and i'll go ahead and show you
guys how to get it and everything about
it ok let's get this one started ok guys
so let's go ahead and get this one
started by just giving you guys a simple
demonstration of how multiflow works ok
it's based and runs off of background so
if you've ever used it you're going to
know exactly how this works but let's go
ahead and show you so let's open up a
couple apps let's open up echoes on I
just let it load it up here really
quickly here and then just like in
backgrounder hold the home button for
just a second it'll pop up saying
backgrounding enabled then we'll back up
let's also open up Oh settings so we
open up settings let this load to all
right and let's wedding background that
ok so once you have an app or two and
the background running you right you can
go ahead and open up multiflow so to do
that just double tap the home button and
i will note there's a lot of city apps
that tend to be using the home button
such as orbit and a lot of others so you
know you gotta I'm kind of just laughing
at how you got it you have the special
time taps but that's kind of eerie
gardless so anyway just double tap the
home button pretty quickly and it will
bring up the multiflow interface as you
can see here we have basically a
screenshot of when I back rounded it and
we can scroll a little bit back and
forth between them and i'll go ahead and
then if you want you can go ahead and
click either of them so i'll go ahead
and hit settings and back right back
into settings and then if I double tap
it I can go out and I will note that
once you are from background and you
actually can go out to your springboard
as well which is pretty handy so
basically that's it in a nutshell mostly
flow is not something amazing although
it does have one more feature let me go
ahead and show you guys a real quick
so let's scroll over and you can see on
the bottom you have two little tabs if
you hit about it just tell us a little
bit about what version and kind of tells
a couple of things such as don't and
they don't try to enable backgrounding
like we know when app launches that will
actually go ahead and cause your
springboard to crash likewise another
bug i've found is that if you try to
double tap when you don't have any apps
running when you let's say you've just
respring or anything like that it will
that will crash it as well so it's got
bugs um it's it's hard to say if they'll
be fixed I imagine they will but there's
no telling so everything about multiflow
is pretty cool it works well it's really
handy to be able to just you know real
easily use backgrounder to you know flip
between your different apps it's got
some bugs but that's be expected of a
lot of apps and to be honest it's not
that big a deal the biggest problem I
have with multi flow and the sole reason
why don't you know make it one of my
must-have city applications it's just
the price it's 499 and you know without
talking a lot about it just straight up
I don't think it's a hundred percent
worth it backgrounder is free and it
would it's ninety percent of what
multiflow is now don't get me wrong i
entirely support people who make city
apps and charge for them you know if you
make an appt is you should be able to
charge if you're making it for city or
you make for the app store but i think
499 is just too much it's it's it's just
not it's just not enough there I mean
you know you can get it through
different repos and stuff that won't let
it you have for free I don't support or
condone it that or anything but I just
really think that 499 is too much and it
really I just don't think it's 100 not
worth it to have to pay that much if it
was a doll or actually I think this
would be really really good app but for
five dollars I just don't think it's
quite worth it anyway guys though if you
do want take a look at it it's it's a
pretty cool thing what you do have it
though it's it's not it's not a bad deal
it's nice to be able to you know load
your cydia
and do all kinds of different stuff so
no guys that's my review of multiflow
pretty cool just a little too expensive
anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
