of these phosphor world time curves
inked watch so this is of course a watch
which is not something I normally review
however after you guys take a look at
this I think you will kind of understand
why I decided to go ahead and take a
look at this so first thing I want to
take a pay attention to is the packaging
very very nice packaging here I have
used this for about a week and a half or
so but I want to go ahead and show you
guys you have a little bit of
information about the watch itself of
course I will tell you guys all about
that just a second and then inside the
box we do have the pink watch itself so
let's go ahead just pull all this out to
the side here and show you guys the
watch itself some people I can give you
guys a closer look at the watch
so we're go ahead and pull it in here
just a little bit you'll see that the
display is an eating display now this is
what you might find in a Kindle Nook a
lot of ears however this is the first
one that I believe anyway for a watch
and as you can see here very very clear
you know the text is just just
phenomenal looking and you can also go
ahead you hold the left side for just a
minute you actually go ahead and swap it
so you can go ahead and see it white on
black or black on white I kind of prefer
the other way but of course it is
totally customizable and up to you so
moving on from the display we'll talk a
little bit about the watch in just a
second the web and what all features
everything I do want to really show you
guys the design it's a fantastic
fantastic design and you can see here
it's a fairly large watch you know it's
a bit bigger than a standard kind of
watch but one thing I really liked was
the curved glass so as you can see here
it's got nice curved glass and in fact
this whole piece if I go ahead and pull
it in on here you guys can see it's all
stainless steel so this is all one piece
now you can't remove the band so if the
band ever wears out that might cause you
a little bit of problems however the
watch itself is excellent I mean just
really secure and sturdy of course you
don't want to get this scratched up but
you know it's built very very solidly
you know you can drop this probably no
problem at all I think it's very very
well constructed okay so let me go ahead
and show you some of the modes now the
way to do this is very simple there are
this button right here is actually two
two-piece so technically it's two
buttons
on the left side as I showed you before
and it would change the screen and then
you go ahead and press on the right side
which go ahead and do right now no
change the different modes so I'm go
ahead just show you guys a few of the
modes so right here you can see this is
just the same time use your standard
local time just in smaller format press
it again you'll see that we're actually
we can go ahead and pick world time so
what this is about obviously since this
is a really based on being world time
for a traveler so you actually go ahead
and pick out different cities and
actually go ahead and see what time it
is there so for example if I'm traveling
London I can go ahead and take a look at
my watch see that's 654 which is
definitely very handy now the next mode
is going to be a hybrid so we actually
go ahead this is my local time right now
and then this is London time so I should
go ahead and take a look and say maybe
by like for example if I was going into
London I go ahead and see what time it
is back home so that's definitely a very
useful feature I'm not continuing on is
the calendar mode now to be honest I
didn't find a whole lot of utility for
this one this was a little bit busier
than some of the other ones of course
you do you can go ahead and pick out the
date and the time and the day and
everything but again like I said really
wasn't didn't find too much utility in
this one and for me generally I just
mostly just left on that just because
it's so just you know very simple very
clean now one thing I really have to
talk about is whether it's worth it now
obviously that's a huge thing in all my
reviews and for this one I actually have
to say it is this is a very unique watch
with the ink display I think that's
really you know just really unique you
can actually go ahead and practice it's
not you know it's not amazing here it's
not gonna be you know life-changing or
anything like that but you'll find go
ahead just pull it in very close this is
a very very clear screen which is
something I really did appreciate now
there are a couple of downsides namely
the fact that this will not work in the
dark
I do the limitations of an eating
display you know if you're in the dark
you know if you middle night wherever
you want to check your watch you're not
gonna be able to do it unless you have
at least sunlight so it's definitely
something to keep in mind
I know another thing I'm sure a lot of
you guys would be asking about is what
about buying maybe like an iPod Nano and
using as a watch I know a lot of people
are doing that these days go ahead and
just buy an iPod Nano which is not much
bigger than this I think it's a little
bit wider but I'm gonna go ahead and
just buy a watch band for it and do that
now obviously that's going to have some
advantages over the
but one of the major things that I have
a problem with is the battery life now
this runs off as standard and when she
goes and runs off a standard watch
battery so you know this is gonna last a
very long time you know I'm sure this
will be you know you're gonna be
measuring battery life and months if not
years whereas you know with an iPod Nano
you're gonna be measuring battery life
and you know maybe it might last you a
day so that's a big thing you know I
just I just can't really understand why
you want I mean that'd be kind of cool
but to have to charge it every day so I
think that by that alone really makes
this a much better proposition if you're
just buying it strictly as a watch so
overall if this looks like something
that you would be interested in and of
course do keep in mind that depending on
what band you get it can range anywhere
in price from around 150 to close to
$200 so it's not exactly a cheap watch
but I do believe that you get what you
pay for it's a very well-constructed
watch definitely something that you know
you'll get a lot of people ask me about
I definitely did so if you guys are
interested in go ahead and check out the
description for more information
I would definitely to give a big thanks
to phosphor for going ahead and sing
this out to me for free review so anyway
guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
