of these phosphor oral time curves Inc
watch so this is of course a watch which
is not something I normally review
however I can you guys take a look at
this i think you will kind of understand
why i decided to go ahead and take a
look at this so first thing i want to
take a pay attention to is the packaging
very very nice packaging here i have
used this for about a week and a half or
so but i won't go ahead and show you
guys you have a little bit of
information about the watch itself of
course i will tell you guys all about
that in just a second and then inside
the box we do have the e ink watch
itself so let's go ahead just pull all
this up to the side here and show you
guys the watch itself some people i can
give you guys a closer look at the watch
so we'll go ahead and pull it in here
just a little bit you'll see that the
display is an eating display now this is
what you might find in a Kindle Nook a
lot of e-readers however this is the
first one that I believe anyway for a
watch and as you can see here very very
clear you know the text is just just
phenomenal looking and you can also go
ahead you hold the left side for just a
minute you actually go ahead and swap it
so you can go ahead and see it white on
black or black on white I kind of prefer
the other way but of course it is
totally customizable and up to you so
moving on from the display will talk a
little bit about the watch in just a
second order the weapon what what all
the features everything I do want to
really show you guys the design it's a
fantastic fantastic design and you can
see here it's a fairly large watch you
know it's a bit bigger than a standard
kind of watch but one thing I really
liked was the curved display glass so as
you can see here it's got nice curved
glass and in fact this whole piece I go
ahead and pull it in on here you guys
you'd say it's all stainless steel so
this is all one piece now you can't
remove the band so the band ever wears
out that might cause you a little bit of
problems however the watch itself is
excellent I mean just really secure and
sturdy course you don't want to get this
scratched up but you know it's built
very very solidly you know you can drop
this probably no problem at all i think
it's very very well constructed okay so
let me go ahead and show you some of the
modes now the way to do this is very
simple there are this button right here
is actually 22 piece so technically it's
two buttons for us
left side as your surgeon before and it
would change the screen and then you go
ahead and press on the right side which
go ahead and do right now go change the
different modes so I'm go ahead just
show you guys a few of the modes so
right here you can see that it's just
the same time use your standard local
time just in smaller format press it
again you'll see that we're actually we
can go ahead and pick world time so what
this is about obviously since this is a
really based on being world time for a
traveler so you actually go ahead and
pick out different cities and actually
go ahead and see what time it is there
so for example if I'm traveling to
London I can go ahead and take a look at
my watch see that's 654 which is
definitely very handy now the next mode
is going to be a hybrid so we I should
go ahead this is my local time right now
and then this is London time so I should
go ahead and take a look and say maybe
by like for example if I was going into
London I go ahead and see what time it
is back home so that's definitely a very
useful feature I'm not continuing on is
the calendar mode now to be honest I
didn't find a whole lot of utility for
this one this was a little bit busier
than some of the other ones of course
you do you can go ahead and pick out the
date and the time and the day and
everything but again like I said really
wasn't didn't find too much utility in
this one and for me generally I just
mostly just left on that just because
it's so just you know very simple very
clean now one thing I really have to
talk about is whether it's worth it now
obviously that's a huge thing and all my
reviews and with this one I actually
have to say it is this is a very unique
watch with the ink display I think
that's really you know just really
unique you actually go ahead and
practice it's not you know it's not
amazing year it's not going to be you
know life-changing or anything like that
but you'll find go ahead just pull it in
very close this is a very very clear
screen which is something I really did
appreciate now there are a couple of
downsides namely the fact that this will
not work in the dark I do the
limitations of an eating display you
know if you're in the dark you know you
middle night wherever you want to check
your watch you're not going to be able
to do it unless you have at least
sunlight so definitely something to keep
in mind I know another thing i'm sure a
lot of you guys would be asking about is
what about buying maybe like an ipod
nano and using as a watch i know a lot
of people are doing that these days go
ahead and just buy an ipod nano which is
not much bigger than this I think it's a
little bit wider but I'm go ahead and
just buy a watchband for it and do that
now obviously that's going to have some
advantages over this but one of the
major things that I have a problem with
is the battery life now this runs off a
standard and wouldn't show you guys it
runs off a standard watch battery so you
know this is gonna last very long time
you know I'm sure this will be you know
you're going to be measuring battery
life and months if not years whereas you
know with an iPod Nana you're going to
be measuring battery life and you know
maybe you might last you a day so that's
a big thing you know I just I just can't
really understand why you want I mean
that we kind of cool but to have to
charge it every day so I think that by
that alone really makes this a much
better proposition as you're just buying
it strictly as a watch so overall if
this looks like something that you would
be interested in and of course do keep
in mind that depending on what bands you
get it can range anywhere in price from
around 150 to close to two hundred
dollars so it's not exactly a cheap
watch but I do believe that you get what
you pay for its a very well-constructed
watch definitely something that you know
you'll get a lot of people asking you
about I definitely did so you guys are
interested in go ahead and check out the
description for more information I would
definitely to give a big thanks to
phosphor for going ahead and sing this
out to me for free review so anyway guys
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
