episode of inside tech today we will be
taking an in-depth look at the latest on
the google phone the nexus one will also
cover what might be the end of pi star
and try to sort out exactly what is
going on let's get this one started the
past week has been a positive storm of
leaks or rather flood about the google
phone the nexus one still more
information has come recently so let's
sort through exactly what Google has
cooked up for us first of all it is an
HTC made smart phone running android 2.1
provides more importantly however is the
fact that it was commissioned and
created to google specifications to be
branded as an actual google phone this
marks the contrast with all android
phones so far which bodes well for the
nexus one another important feature
about the phone that it will almost
certainly be sold unlocked meaning that
you will be able to use it on any
carrier that supports it t-mobile and
AT&amp;amp;T in the US although there's no 3g on
AT&amp;amp;T just edge many people are
disregarding the nexus one already it's
just another Android phone but there are
two problems with that first of all
something important to understand is
that this is going to be the new Android
device made entirely the way the Android
engineers envisioned that alone can mean
a lot of things from simply speed boosts
too tight integration between the phone
and the OS just like the iphone the most
important wild card with the nexus one
is going to be the price and whether it
will only be sold unlocked carrier
subsidized phones so that you pay
considerably less than what you'd would
on your own so unless Google beats a
substantial amount of the cost of the
phone you could be looking at a very
expensive phone the nexus one will
likely be released January fifth so we
can expect more information between now
and then the ongoing saga of the mat
clone maker pi-star might finally be
coming
going in or not last night Dow Jones
reported this pi star will be firing
symposiums shutting down things
immediately if you follow the battle
between PI star an apple then you will
note that recently pi star has lost
badly with an injunction stop sign the
mat clones by December 31st immediately
after the report the PI star website
went down however the attorney for pi
star so they are not shutting down
permanently which is backed up by the
fact the PI star website is now back up
although no products for showing in
stock right now regardless of whether pi
star is able to reopen it looks like
they will not sell anymore Matt clones
so it's hard to see what they're going
to focus on besides settling the rebel
efi software which supposedly allows you
to install snow left on your own
computers maybe it never will end and
that'll do it for this episode of inside
tech be sure to subscribe to keep up to
date with all the latest tech news we
will catch you in the next episode
