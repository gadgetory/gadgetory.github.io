not something you're used to seeing on
the channel but today I'm going to find
out is a prebuilt $750 game PC worth it
all the fun stuff already we get a
CyberPower PC gaming mouse we also get
the multimedia gaming keyboard it
actually doesn't look bad we'll see what
the switches are like but alright we get
seven six accessories so this is the
CyberPower computer itself so it's roomy
- this was actually the fact that it's a
pretty decent looking system for $700
so you guys probably know I do a lot of
custom gaming PC builds myself and
usually the big problem with these
pre-built systems is that they're really
just not very good for the price so you
sure you might have something like a
core i7 a ton of memory then you have
like an $80 graphics card but with this
it actually looks like a pretty
reasonable build probably assembled and
supported in the US so one of the things
that actually is cool about buying a
pre-built system is it actually does
come with a warranty so sure when you
build it yourself you're still able to
you know warranty a specific part or
something but it's kind of nice that now
you're not building it but you actually
do get some perks with the actual system
so this is actually a pretty nice
looking case so we have an actual glass
side panel which looks very dangerously
easily breakable all right Dada that's
actually pretty good packing you gotta
say it was makes me really nervous
anytime I try to ship a computer because
it's so easy for something like this is
just like break inside this guy it's
rocking an AMD risin 5 1400 processor as
well as a Radeon rx 580 that's really
not that bad if I was building a system
around 750 dollars I would probably use
pretty similar components now it's not
perfect so for example about 580 only
has 4 gigabytes of memory instead of 8
gigs which will hurt it for high
resolutions and speaking of memory this
guy only has 8 gigs of RAM now for
system like this is actually totally
fine and it's actually easy enough to
just throw in 16 or even 32 gigs if you
want more later but it's deadly not a
completely over-the-top system so the
cable management is actually really nice
here we have a solid a seuss be 350
motherboard and we also have a pair of
120 millimeter fan on intake as well as
exhaust and an LED strip for the super
RGB lighting once you
on the system there's actually a button
to be able to cycle through the
different colors of the LEDs it's that a
huge deal but it's actually fairly
tastefully done it also changes the
color of the power button as well as a
little strip underneath you know if
you're into RGB that gets around back
you'll see that cable management is also
decent it's pretty clean by here and
they're using a pretty solid EBG a 400
watt bronze power supply how do you
actually use this in a couple builds I
like it a lot especially for the price
and test by here is a one terabyte
Toshiba hard drive that's actually
probably the biggest weak link here now
that's a bad hard drive but if this kind
of price I actually would like to see an
SSD thankfully that's something you can
add pretty easily with the 2 included
SSD bracket that still means you're
going to have to reinstall windows it's
going to be a little bit of pain in the
ass can't say ass so I like all the
stickers on the back includes this one
server PowerPC assembled from tested
components complete system not tested
that sure fills you with confidence
doesn't it for 750 dollars the hardware
isn't bad what I'm curious about is how
it actually performs well GTA 5 might
not be the newest game out it still can
be reasonably demanding and here on
1080p at high settings we're seeing the
frame rate generally bottoms out around
50 or so and you can see what the flying
step we're actually well above 70
however the bigger problem that I'm
noticing as I game at the CyberPower PC
is noise it's actually really loud I
think most of that is because the case
fans seem to be spinning a lot faster
than they actually need to but then is
something that you could fix
unfortunately it's just really loud out
of the box though next to have
battlegrounds so this is a steam early
access game so it's definitely not as
well optimized as it could be but even
here we're able to play on 1080p at high
settings and we're getting decent frame
rates so here with a fairly empty spot
when the 50s but we get a little more
action tipping a little bit closer to 30
but it's totally playable taking a look
at another new game we have prey and
this is something else that runs really
well so this is 1080p with very high
settings and we're actually getting 60
frames on college the lower end but kind
of get into a little bit of a quieter
area it actually can go above 100 so yes
this is not the most colourful system in
the world but for 1080p gaming is more
than good enough anything you want okay
that was that nope wrong way for
high resolution ad is behind me okay
thank you Brian for high resolutions
until you actually can play and it is
technically V already as well so if you
have an oculus battle or two but uh I'm
just gonna hide over here interestingly
the value is actually kind of on this
side too so for seven hundred two
dollars you're getting that Rison v
processor and RX 580 but you're also
getting a pretty nice fantex
case RGB lighting and AC Wi-Fi card
Windows 10 installed as well as a mouse
and keyboard they might not be the best
but consider that you get all of this
for $750 it's not that if you tried to
build this yourself with the same parts
you're actually going to end up paying
three dollars more and that's not
including a warranty the mouse keyboard
or that super fancy RGB lighting this
actually isn't a bad deal so is this
seven have $50 pretty well gaming PC
worth it yeah now if this is my system I
would upgrade it with an SSD and some
quieter case bands but beyond that this
is actually a pretty solid value so what
do you guys think let me know in the
comments below and I will catch you on
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
