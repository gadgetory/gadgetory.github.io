a review of the tokyoflash 3d unlimited
watch watch is typically aren't the kind
of thing I review but for this I had to
make an exception tokyoflash makes them
very unique and awesome looking watches
and the 3d unlimited is definitely one
of them up front you'll find the face
which displays the time in a 3d cube
format the top number displays the hour
and the bottom pair of numbers of the
minutes the Devlin can be a bit
confusing at first but they're a little
bit of wearing the watch you get used to
it you can also use the bottom right
button to toggle between the time and
date which reads the same way its water
resistant to 3 meters so if you get it a
bit wet it shouldn't be an issue well
maybe more than a bit the display
numbers are reflective making the watch
very easy to read in sunlight you can
also talk a lot of backlight for reading
in the dark which is a bit damn but
about average for most watches it's also
powered by a standard watch battery
which should last about a year or so the
3d unlimited comes in a few different
colors including black and solar for the
watch and band as well as the LCD comes
in red blue orange pink and green I've
got the black with the blue LCD here and
I've got to save this is one
nice-looking watch it's made entirely
out of stainless steel including the
watch itself as well as the bands since
it is deal it's quite durable as far as
scratches and drops go not entirely sure
how often you're going to be dropping
your watch I've enjoyed using the 3d
animated the past few weeks and it
definitely doesn't hurt that the watch
looks pretty awesome and geeky in just
the right way if you enjoyed definitely
