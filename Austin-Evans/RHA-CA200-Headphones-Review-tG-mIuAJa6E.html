here the review of the rha CA 200
headphones these are over ear headphones
that are available from amazon com for
thirty dollars when you get the CA to
hundreds they come in a fairly nice box
with the cans and a detachable cable
taking a look around you'll see that the
made out of a shiny black plastic and
are fairly good-looking with the option
to pick them up in white as well for
thirty dollars you shouldn't expect
amazing build quality and I'd say you
get about what you pay for here they
feel a bit flimsy and lightweight but
they should be durable enough to handle
normal wear and tear up top you'll find
a bit of padding which is quite soft and
works just fine coming to the earcups
they're covered with a fake leather
which is also soft to the touch and has
a good amount of padding they do get a
bit uncomfortable after hours of use but
it's not a major issue the cuts
themselves are a bit smaller than I
would like but with a bit of adjusting
this should fit most ears the CA to
hundreds come with a detachable cable
which is definitely something I'd like
to see on headphones this way if there's
ever a problem with the cable you can
buy a new one as opposed to trashing the
headphones as well it's quite thin and a
bit apt to tangling but overall it's a
good length and works well now on to the
most important part sound quality after
listening to these for the past couple
of weeks they remind me quite a bit of
beats for three hundred dollars beats
are seriously lacking but at thirty
dollars it's a very different story bass
is definitely the focus of the CA 200
and it's quite good very rich and punchy
for the price these are especially good
for EDM hip-hop and anything else with a
heavy emphasis on base elsewhere they
fall apart a bit mids aren't great and
the highs are drowned out by the base
the overall sound isn't the clearest but
for thirty dollars I'm not complaining
too much overall I think rha did a good
bouncing job with a CA 200s the look is
good build quality is where it needs to
be and the sound quality isn't half bad
especially if you like bass there are
better on your headphones if you'd like
to spend a bit more by the wise they see
a 200 ortho look if you enjoy definitely
be sure to leave the video a thumbs up
