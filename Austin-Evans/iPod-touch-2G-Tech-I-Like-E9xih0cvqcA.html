the fourth episode of tech I like its
name going to be talking about the iPod
Touch 2nd generation and this is kind of
special to me because this is how I
started my channel so without this I
probably never would have made my videos
ever but of course it was also cool
gadget too so let's go ahead and take a
look what's kind of surprising is just
how much things haven't changed
so iPod Touch 2nd generation was
released in 2008 and to be honest it's
very very similar to the iPhones and
iPods that we can buy today so it still
has the exact same size screen has all
the same home button sleepweight Rutan
30-pin dock connector everything is very
very similar to what you'll find on a
new device today the iPod Touch 2nd
generation had a couple of major
improvements over the first generation
so to start with actually had a speaker
so yeah the first generation iPod Touch
did not have a speaker instead of had a
this however you pronounce that it was a
little bit thinner but the major new
difference was I had an all-new tapered
design somewhat similar to what you
would find on the iPhone 3G then one
thing that I didn't like on the iPod
Touch 2nd generation and don't even like
on iPods of today is the backing so it's
very like a polished mirror finish I
tell you what it is so easy to get
scratched I mean it looks fantastic
when you pull it out of the box but use
it for about three seconds and it's
gonna just look awful and then the thing
was the app store now of course it's
something we all take for granted today
the first generation iPhone iPod Touch
actually didn't have the App Store it
wasn't until almost a year after they
were released over the iPod Touch
second-generation came with a day one
and I don't think I have to tell you
guys how big of a deal apps were of
course you can buy an iPhone that cost
six seven eight hundred dollars or you
can buy a $230 I pod touch and play all
the same games the apps all that kind of
stuff it was a big deal unfortunately
eppley longer supports the iPod Touch
2nd generation as the most recent
firmware for it is 4.2.1 however that
doesn't mean that it's not usable as in
fact you can still do a lot on it so
most in the Attucks you download from
the App Store will still work on the
iPod Touch in most games that all of
them so if you get like some really
graphically intense games it won't run
but for the most part a lot of the more
simple games will run on the iPod Touch
2nd generation no problem not bad
considering it's got an amazing 500
megahertz processor and a jaw-dropping
128 megabytes of RAM not to mention it's
over 3 years old now of course I can
talk about the device all I like but the
real reason why I love the iPod Touch
2nd generation because this is what got
me my start on YouTube my first I'll be
reviewing today
is called AI te FPS so my very first
video was an app review and what I did
was I took screenshots of the apps I
took a microphone that I stole from rock
band and talked a little bit about the
apps and that was it that was my very
first video and you gets to check it out
if you want if you want to be horrified
beyond belief but yeah that's part of
the reason why I do these tech I like
series not maybe because this is the
best technology ever or you know it was
something that was life-changing but the
stuff that I personally really liked and
I would definitely have to put this in
that category that's about it for this
week's episode of tech I like you guys
enjoyed definitely sure to stay tuned to
the channel I do these every Saturday
afternoon and to make sure you're
notified whenever I post these videos be
sure to subscribe to the channel hey
