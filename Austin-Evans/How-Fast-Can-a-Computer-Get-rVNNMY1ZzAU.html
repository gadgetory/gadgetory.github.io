a computer be not too long ago all
computer really needed to do was a
little web browsing and text editing but
today computers are absolutely
everywhere from watches to massively
powerful workstations the speed of the
computer is typically measured in
gigahertz how many billions of cycles a
processor can run per second here I have
one of the most powerful CPUs available
right now an Intel Core i7 4770k by
default it runs at 3.5 gigahertz which
is a very healthy speed but compared to
the AMD FX 95 90 which can be right up
to 5 gigahertz there doesn't seem to be
too much competition on paper however
not all gigahertz are created equally as
far back as 10 years ago
processors like the Pentium 4 were
capable of speeds approaching 4
gigahertz but put it alongside a modern
core i7 and there's a massive difference
at a certain point chip makers started
hitting a wall when they couldn't just
keep throwing more and more power to CPU
to make it run faster to get around this
we now have processors with multiple CPU
cores having one powerful core is good
but having two four or even eight on a
single chip allows a computer to work on
lots of things at once this has worked
well over the last decade allowing
computers to get faster and faster by
adding more cores
however this too has a limit over the
last 50 years processors have gotten
more and more complex going from two
thousand transistors in 1971 to over two
billion in modern designs this constant
improvement allows engineers to do one
of two things either take their current
designs and make them smaller and
therefore cheaper or keep the chips the
same size and add things such as more
CPU cores the latest Intel Broadwell
technology is based on the 14 nanometer
process which is seven thousand times
smaller than the width of a human hair
CPUs are going to continue to get faster
and add more cores for the foreseeable
future
however the pace is slowed down as it
gets more and more difficult to cram
more transistors onto a single chip
another important part of a computer are
the graphics known as a GPU this is what
displays video and typically has been in
the form of a graphics card like this
however companies like AMD have fit
powerful GPUs into the same chip is the
processor to create an APU where a CPU
has a few very powerful cores a GPU has
hundreds if not thousands of much
smaller cores which is ideal for things
like gaming and dealing with
where things get really exciting is when
you look at quantum computers a normal
CPU today has two states zero and one on
the other hand a quantum computer can
work with massive amounts of numbers at
once allowing it to solve problems that
would take a normal computer millions of
years in a matter of seconds a company
called d-wave builds what are arguably
the first real quantum computers and
organizations like Google and Lockheed
Martin are already using d-wave systems
to create algorithms to recognize images
and test flight control systems just
like the giant room sized computers of
the 1950's quantum computers are in very
early stages requiring a massive box
filled with shielding and cooling to
keep things stable regardless of which
technology comes out ahead it's not hard
to imagine a future where a device the
size of a smartphone becomes the most
powerful computer in the world
the human brain had a good run</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
