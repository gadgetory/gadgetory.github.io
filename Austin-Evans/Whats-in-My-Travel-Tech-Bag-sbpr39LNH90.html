what's in my tech travel bag so start
with we have what's probably my favorite
camera out right now which is the Sony
rx100 mark for its rugged a one-inch
sensor with a 24 to 70 lens most
importantly it should some really
nice-looking 4k video so what she shot
an entire video on the rx100 last year
and didn't tell anyone that I did it and
surprise surprise no one can tell the
difference wing this in my main camera
now to go along with your rx 100 I have
a zoom h4n
and while the RX does a great job for
video the audio side is not so
impressive so that's where this comes in
so this is the crown jewel this is the
Sennheiser MKH 416 this is by far my
favorite microphone I've ever used we
really like about the 416 is that it
sounds amazing so if you listen to
pretty much any of my videos in the last
year they're recorded with this and
especially when I can take it in a
travel bag I mean this is not a crazy
audio setup it makes a world of
difference and to round my kit out I
have a Joby Gorillapod action this is a
small gorilla pod it works perfectly
with the rx100 so I've been in a lot of
hotel rooms after doing things like
conventions oh really we could look at
your bedside hotel room I need to film a
lot of video in hotel rooms you know
YouTube video when the nice things about
a gorilla pod is this you can mounted
basically anywhere as long as you can
wrap the legs around something it's
pretty much an instant tripod anywhere
you go hi mom now to edit everything I
use a 15 inch MacBook Pro the main
reason I'd like to use this computer is
that considering the size it's actually
pretty powerful it's got a quad core i7
dedicated graphics it's got a terabyte
super fast SSD most importantly it runs
final cuts so yes I added all of my
videos inside Final Cut Pro 10 and most
importantly Jon from TLD made me switch
so if you guys have any problem with me
using a Mac and Final Cut please tweet
him at TLD today so for editing I use a
samsung t3 SSD now it was a really big
fan of the t1 and this is pretty much
the exact same thing in a metal
enclosure with a USBC cable the thing I
really like about these Samsung SSD is
they are fast really fast so this is a
one terabyte model and it's got read and
write speeds over 400 megabytes per
second one fast enough to edit video or
pretty much anything to be honest the
mounts I like to use is the Logitech MX
master I've used some original MX
products and they were cool but the
problem is they needed add-on
however this works straight off of
Bluetooth on top of that it's still a
really comfortable Mouse to use it has
both vertical and horizontal roll wheels
so this pretty much always lives in my
bag getting into the fun stuff we have
the great Oh
sra de headphones I'm Ron Burgundy
so these are only about a hundred bucks
which is kind of expensive for
headphones but when you consider the
audio quality you get of these it's not
bad the downside is that these leak a
lot so if you're around anyone else
they're going to be able to hear what
you're listening to on the flip side
because they do have an open back design
you get much better soundstage and $400
these things sound killer now to go
along with the Gredos I have a pair of
Apple earpods
laughs me all you want I actually like
these things so these are one of the
very few in ear headphones that are
actually comfortable my ears usually the
ones with the rubber tips get
uncomfortable after 2030 minutes for me
but I can listen to the ear paws for a
while
for phones I actually have both an
iPhone and a Samsung Galaxy s7 well I
might seem a little bit over the top
considering how many videos I do on
smartphones it's really helpful for me
to have perspective on both the iOS and
Android side of the camp last but not
least is the targa squash now I should
like this a lot it only is it fairly
inexpensive but super low key no one's
really ever gonna realize there's some
expensive gear in here and if someone
tries to steal it I'll stick Ralphy on
him I'll begin eat them and with that
ending it's gonna be about all for this
one so you guys want to check out any of
stuff I talked about this video links
will be in the description and big shout
out to John and Ralphie for helping with
the video anyway guys I will catch you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
