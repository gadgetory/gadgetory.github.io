I'm here with a video definitely
hopefully it'll be helpful on how to
extend the life of your xbox 360 you
know a lot of people are afraid of the
red ring of death and you know that's
definitely you know a big possibility
and no matter what you do but there are
some really simple steps that you can
take to really extend the life of your
xbox to keep it healthy you keep it
running for years to come
so okay I'm just gonna go over a few of
them the number one in my mind is
ventilation guys Xbox is you should know
put out a ton of heat I mean they are I
mean when you turn them on there we've
got two big vans in the back and they're
just kicking out heat now there's Vince
all the places you have Vince on the on
every side you have Vince I mean just
all over the place
you absolutely have to make sure that
none of them are there all exposed okay
now this seems totally simple but you
would be totally surprised the amount of
people who put these in cabinets who put
even putting one up against the wall
it won't might necessarily instantly
kill it but it's definitely not good
because you mean these things even when
they're properly ventilated runs very
very warm so definitely you know really
be careful be sure I like to have the
way mine is set up and it's kind of hard
I know a lot of times you know the way
you set your step up but seriously try
to keep I mean if you can as much space
as you can I try to keep at least four
inches on I keep mine upright like try
keep four inches on each side and just a
couple inches in the back and obviously
keep the front exposed that makes sure
that doesn't get really really hot and I
know sometimes that's not going to be
possible you know you'll have it in the
cabinets and that sort of thing but in
general the better the more room you can
give it the better that they'll
definitely go a long way because well at
the time it's not so much just you know
it's just being stupid you know closing
it in not letting it breathe anyway the
second one is also something pretty
simple but basically give it a break now
don't get me wrong marathon game runs
are great and everybody
but you can't really use these for hours
and hours and hours I'm in I mean like I
said you can but it will definitely kind
of start to wear your life down on it in
general maybe like four hours this is is
about the limit after four hours just
stop it shut it off and just you know
even if it's one 15 20 minutes just let
it cool let it you know chill for a bit
you know go grab a drink what just do
whatever and another thing is don't
leave it on for extended periods time
even if you're not playing games
obviously if you're playing a game water
but now DVDs you know you can watch a
couple movies but we if you're really
playing it a lot you know for hours but
if you're just like watching a DVD
that's okay but just don't leave it on a
lot you know if you're not on it just
shut it off it's as simple as that
I mean seriously think of it like like a
car and you've got a set amount of like
let's say you have so many miles of the
car will go well if you're leaving it on
guess what you're just wasting the life
of your xbox so just turn on turn off no
big deal you know the last thing is just
be careful with it now I know all these
are just no tips but you know you'd be
surprised how many people don't just be
careful with it absolutely never under
any circumstances move Xbox while it's
on never don't ever drop it be very
gentle with it you know and definitely
you know be really careful and really
listen to it it means you hear a weird
funny noise coming out of the disc well
it's not normal anyway stop using it
maybe open up the disc there's no good
stuff me something in there or maybe the
disc is about to fail same goes for
anything I know that's will gentle
advice but you know if you're really
paying attention and you're listening to
it that can help because I mean
sometimes it's small problems if you
catch does it could be I mean something
really really minor I mean it could be
like there might have been something in
the disc drive and you just pick it up
and toss it out something I mean I have
no idea but I mean if you're just really
being careful
and I mean you just don't take it for
granted you know take a look at it make
sure you know nothing happens to it your
xbox will go for years and years to come
you guys just a video I just wanted to
get it out there help you guys out keep
your Xbox is running a long time to go
anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
