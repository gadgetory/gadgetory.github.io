here with an unboxing of the iPad Mini
with an all-new size and lower price
that looks solid so if you're interested
in money one of these be sure to hit up
that subscribe button to catch my
giveaway to start let's get at the box
this is the white 16 gigabyte Wi-Fi
model but beyond that there's not much
to see here with some help from a knife
we can make a quick incision to get to
the good stuff
now we just need to pop the lid and bam
we have the iPad Mini 4 now let's set it
aside to see what else we have in the
box first off we have a bit of info
including your Quick Start Guide
incredibly boring important safety info
and the Apple stickers
who doesn't love Apple stickers you'll
also find the USB wall adapter which is
a bit smaller than on the full-size iPad
and the new lightning to USB cable this
replaces the 30-pin cable used in
previous iPads and is much smaller and
reversible now for the fun part the iPad
Mini and also aluminium goodness the
first thing that jumps out at you is how
absurdly thin it is it only seven point
two millimeters the bezel is much more
than the normal I pad and here you'll
find the 7.9 inch screen which
unfortunately isn't a Retina display up
top is the FaceTime HD front-facing
camera and around back is the five
megapixel iSight shooter along the right
side you'll find the volume rocker and a
switch to mute or lock orientation and
at top is the sleep/wake button
microphone and a headphone jack the
bottom is where you'll find the
lightning connector and your stereo
speakers set the ipad mini next to a
7-inch tablet like the Nexus 7 and
you'll see it's quite a bit larger
especially if you try to hold it with
one hand at first glance the new iPad
Mini is looking good but be sure to stay
tuned to the channel by hitting that
subscribe button to not only catch more
videos but also the iPad Mini giveaway
don't forget to drop a thumbs up if you
enjoyed and I will catch you guys next
