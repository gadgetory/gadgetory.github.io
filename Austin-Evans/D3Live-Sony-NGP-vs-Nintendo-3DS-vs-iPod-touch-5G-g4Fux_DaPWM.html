episode of d3 live so today we're going
to be talking about a really big an
ambitious topic which is going to be the
pretty much the next generation of
handheld consoles it's going to be the
Sony NGP also known as the next
PlayStation in the PSP to whatever you
like to call it the NGP versus the
Nintendo 3ds versus the ipod touch 5th
generation now this is gonna be a pretty
big deal like i said you know i think
that one of these three is going to be
the undisputed king in the next pi 2 or
3 years so i just kind of compare them
and help you guys decide which one is
probably going to be the best um so
let's one talk about the one that
everybody's been talking about this week
which is the sony NGP now if you missed
out one give you a quick recap the NGP
is the next generation playstation p or
PSP I'm it's got some really insane
space it's got a quad-core processor
it's really good graphics as well I mean
this thing is going to have very similar
graphics to what you might find on the
ps3 maybe not quite as good but in
reality when you're playing it you
really won't be able to tell whole lot
of difference until me freezing me the
good looking as far as the graphics go
he's got a 5-inch olev touchscreen
really big nice display everybody
everyone who's ever seen it just just
can't just say enough about how much
they like it it's also got some of the
cool things such as a rear rear touchpad
so almost kind of similar to what you
might find on like your mousepad
whatever well that's going to be on the
back of the next PSP it's also got
analog sticks so you have dual analog
sticks you got motion controls like in
the PlayStation Move you've got 3g Wi-Fi
I mean the list goes on and on and on
the next PSP is going to be just
absolutely excellent so I won't get into
too much of any more of the details but
i will say is coming to some of the
stuff I like and dislike one of the
things that I'm a little bit leery about
is the price with something like this
that has so much huge technology i mean
you know you've got processors and this
and that everything is probably going to
cost a fair bit more than the 3ds now
that's kind of an important thing
because a lot of people think the 3ds is
a bit overpriced i think the price will
come down but I'll get into that in a
little bit as far as the NGP is I think
one thing number
think something has to be careful of is
the price no one wants repeated when the
playstation 3 came out it was like seven
hundred dollars and note i was like oh
you know so as long as they can keep the
NGP at a reasonable price point i would
say 400 would be the max hopefully more
closer to 350 or three hundred dollars i
think if they can do that and the NGP is
just gonna be a really solid player now
some of the things i really do like is
the fact that it no longer uses umd's
this is kind of a little bit of a
disappointment obviously because you
know you know all your PSP games won't
be able to play it but to be honest I
think that it's definitely the right
choice you know the old style of the
disc umd's just wasn't that good for
gaming I mean you know it was just there
pretty large we had to have a whole disk
drive everything a handheld so that just
wasn't the most ideal situation and in
the NGP you'll be able to download games
and apps Malik kind of stuff but you
also be able to use a an SD card like
that's not going to be an SD card but
it's going to be kind of someone's
watching my finding the 3ds you know
just you'll buy it the store and you do
go and plug it in in the war chest farm
so the NGP is definitely I'm really
looking forward to that it's gonna be an
absolutely excellent handheld a nice one
we're going to talk about is the
Nintendo 3ds I can go ahead and just
roll through pretty quickly here and you
do have a three and a half inch 16 by 9
not touch screen that's going to be a 3d
display that's pretty much one of the
major things about in 3ds is that you're
going to be able to use without glasses
3d this is gonna be a pretty cool thing
I think because obviously 3d is really
picking up and you hear more and more
about it every day every week you know
the more 3d TVs and this and that and
we're being able to have 3d in your
pockets so it's going to be a fairly
small console and you'll be able to see
it without any glasses it's gonna be a
really cool thing now some people have
said that it's not gonna make them all
sick and this and that which I
definitely can understand I mean a lot
of people don't like 3d too much I don't
love it but I don't like having issues
with it but the cool thing is with 3des
there's a little slider there you shut
off 3d it just turns into you know just
standard 2d you don't have eh
use be moving on from that it does have
a touch screen on the bottom it is
resistive so you guys still need to use
a stylus which is kind of a bit of an
annoyance but I don't think it'll be a
huge of a deal I will have a joy yeah
let's cut it's not exactly a touchpad
that's going to be kind of similar to
what on the original PS Pina the little
thumb stick it's gonna be a little bit
bigger and nicer than that but it's
still not going to be a fool you know
have drug analog stick like on the NGP
now this is going to have the same kind
of design as the d/s so portion you have
two screens I know it'll be able to open
and close you will have to shoot cameras
on the back which is a pretty cool thing
we actually go ahead and take 3d photos
and you can plan off course the view it
on the screen and you have a front
facing camera as well now the 30s is not
going to be nearly is graphically
intense as the NGP you know most people
says probably somewhere around gamecube
to wheat graphics may not quite that
good you know that's that white is nuts
Neville that's not it's not nearly as
good as the NGP and probably the ipod
touch I'm however it still should be
plenty good enough and one of the really
big things about the d/s was you know
didn't have that great of graphical
capabilities you know developers really
made up for that with some really unique
and innovative games so I'm not really
too worried about that on the 3ds now
the three years will be available at the
end of March are actually the end of
February's in Japan and the end of march
in the united states and europe and i
believe a couple of other countries so
pretty much by the end of March pretty
much everyone should be able to pick up
the 3ds you know it's going to vary
price pirate price through the country's
hello from united states that will run
you to 49 a little bit expensive but i
think it will be pretty good and I do
like the 3ds and the last one is going
to be the wild card then the ipod touch
5th generation now the ipod touch slowly
big having a better better gaming
platform i think with the 5th generation
apple is really going to break down and
really going to make this you're just a
major competitor to the other two so the
obviously the ipod touch is really in a
fourth the iphone but i'm going to be
mostly talking about the ipod touch here
there's one major thing what makes it so
successful it the app store the app
sport is just really really good
for gaming now if you're wanting to buy
you know some of the really nicer games
like you're not going to find a pokemon
or uncharted running these big
franchises on the ipod however learn a
lot of new ones a lot of cheaper games a
lot of ones that really bail picking up
Steve's for example Angry Birds you know
angry birds is turning into a really
really big thing and of course there are
a lot of other developers such as
electronic arts they're bringing over
Madden for example need for speed hot
pursuit on the ipod touch I've
absolutely loved that game I've been
playing it probably more than any game
that you know I've had at the last
couple months so while a lot of people
say and I do agree that you know a lot
of quality of games aren't that great
don't count it out there are a lot of
really good games coming out and the
good thing is they're really pretty
cheap and so while you know what the NGP
probably paying probably forty to fifty
dollars i'd imagine fifty dollars for
games with the three es probably forty
dollars or so I'm put on the ipod touch
you usually ten dollars about the max
you'll ever play our example dead space
just came out and that cost about seven
dollars so you're getting a lot a lot of
content very close to what you might
find a console quality but for a
fraction of the price which allows you
to buy a lot more games for the same
money and so what if maybe wanted to
aren't the greatest you still got two or
three more games for the same right so
that's one of the big things i do like
about the ipod touch now of course the
ipod is also really a wide ranging
device so you know you will actually be
able to get on the internet it's got an
absolutely excellent browser you have a
full touch screen you know with various
other apps that aren't gaming related
you got both front and rear facing
camera you've got a lot of really cool
things that does it's just not a gaming
device obviously it's an ipod so you get
movies and music and all that kind of
stuff now one of the things that are
about the ipod touch 5th generation that
should be new this year is the possible
the other 3d display now this is a
confirm that's mostly just been rumors
hell I wouldn't surprise me that much if
we do see a 3d display very similar to
what you might find on the Nintendo 3ds
only Nick's ipod touch now in addition
to that of course it's probably going to
be more powerful with no better specs
and you know the graphics are
continuously just getting better and
better and better you know I would say a
lot of games on the
I mean on the ipod touch right now are
already PSP quality and above so
everything what the next generation
should be much much better tonight
that's my brief wrap-up of all three you
know all three heads of pros and cons I
mean the ipod touch is really good it's
probably going to be along the cheaper i
would say it's going to be about the
same price 230 yes it might better it
might be up or down just a little bit
but I thought touch is really going to
be solid and I'm definitely liking that
no three yes I think it's going to be
mean after the hell successful zadi s
has been I don't think we can have any
issues ugh millions and millions of them
and you know as soon as I do that that
guarantees that the game's going to come
and with that unique 3d display is going
to add a lot of new you know people
interested about 3d however my pick is
definitely going to be the Sony NGP this
thing is absolutely just going to be
phenomenal now hopefully we'll be out by
the end of the year may be there early
next year some places they haven't been
entirely clear but from what we know
about this it's just going to blow the
others out of the water as long as I
keep the price right anyway for the
second half of d3 live without taking
live questions for everyone in the chat
as always with every episode of d3 lives
Phil in front of a live audience we've
got a lot of people in here watching on
blog TV so if one just take some
questions i do i think the ipod touch 4g
this game performance in the cpu improve
yeah i do think so i think that pretty
much every year apple likes to improve
it to you know add more processing more
ram this status that I mean I definitely
think that was a dual-core processor it
will really open up a lot more better
looking gaming for the ipod touch um
what's it between an mb and NC model on
the ipod touch um well it pretty much
did a different types of ipod touch the
MC model is the newer now it's the ipod
touch 4th generation ipod touch 3rd
generation and the MC model of the ipod
touch 2nd generation really the major
difference is just for jailbreaking you
know sometimes you can jailbreak an mba
in that MC but really the best way to
kind of keep track of the ipods you see
if it's a second generation third
generation or 4th generation the NGP of
a UMD slot no it is not with other ng
pieces like a kind of
earliest almost like an SD card it's not
going to be it's some kind of
proprietary so anything that's going to
be a small chip where you just go ahead
put it in just like you know what you
would do on a d/s or 3ds so if that's
the way you will get you the games you
also will be able to download games as
well however I think the major great
thing would just be buying the you know
by going to the store and buying the
cards Unreal Engine 3 for iOS what games
will be made with it a lot now there
aren't a ton of games with Unreal Engine
just yet I'm use only it was only
announced anything it's only been out
for a fairly short time the Unreal
Engine I'm over as more and more people
kind of get ahold of it more developers
beside that that's what I want to do I
think we will start seeing a lot of
really really nice looking games on the
ipod in the iphone could you join up the
PSP you know learn a lot of people who
were able to hadley PSP before but i
think that someone who's really kind of
getting annoyed because a lot of that
was used just for piracy and I think
somebody's really trying to crack down
that kind of stuff because that hurts
them a big time you know when there's a
lot of piracy developers decide ed we
don't want to develop for this we'd
rather do it on some other platforms so
I really think that Sony is going to try
to crack down a lot harder on the the
NGP um well Xbox ever go mobile boy I
wish I could tell you the answer to that
um I honestly think that it will I mean
a couple years back I know they kind of
were talking a little bit about you know
more than just the xbox 360 maybe now
expanding it out into different markets
I would presume that would mean handheld
hell we really don't know anything about
it I haven't ever heard any you know any
any concrete anything pretty much just a
couple of hours here and there but I
really would expect to see a new xbox
anytime soon as far as a portable one um
but I wouldn't be surprised that it does
happen eventually maybe not now but
maybe in a year or two years or
something that we actually might see a
portable lights box that would be really
cool she but by an ipod touch 4g or went
for the buck fifth generation model uh
you know it's kind of a fish kind of a
hard question um the ipod touch they you
know release a new one every September
so it kind of depends
no it's September so pretty long way
away if you know how you can go ahead
and buy the 4th generation that's what I
have I really love it if you want to
wait you guys look good but I think lift
a few that's that's that's a long way
away they're probably better go ahead
just buy the full iteration now you can
see about maybe getting the fifth
generation later since the NGP has a
front facing cam and front and back
facing camera will you be able to mix
skype calls you've actually sony has
been a little bit kind of like AG about
that of course the psp-3000 does have
skype um i would imagine yes the next
NGP will have skype especially was of
course like you said the front and rear
facing cameras however somebody did not
say yes they didn't say no either but i
would guess yeah i would think that make
a lot cents per task I um do I've been
getting the iphone for verizon now or a
June where they'll update the iphones
yeah i think that go ahead i would
recommend not buying the iphone for
right now it just doesn't make any sense
on verizon wait until July when they had
won the new iphone 5 whatever they said
come out the next generation iPhone
comes out I would be really surprised as
it doesn't come out for AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon
so um unless you absolutely have to have
iphone right now I would recommend going
ahead and waiting anyway guys that's it
