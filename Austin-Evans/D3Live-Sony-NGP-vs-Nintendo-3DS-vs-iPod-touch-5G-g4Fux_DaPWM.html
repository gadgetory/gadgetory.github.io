episode of d3 live so today we're going
to be talking about a really big and
ambitious topic which is going to be the
pretty much the next generation of
handheld consoles it's gonna be the so
many NGP also known as the next
playstation in the PSP - whatever you
like to call it the NGP versus the
Nintendo 3ds versus the iPod Touch 5th
generation now this is gonna be a pretty
big deal like I said you know I think
that one of these three is going to be
the undisputed king in the next pie two
or three years so I just kind of compare
them and help you guys decide which one
is probably going to be the best so
let's one talk about the one that
everybody's been talking about this week
which is the Sony NGP now if you missed
out I can give you a quick recap the NGP
is the next-generation PlayStation P or
PSP I mean it's got some really insane
space it's got a quad core processor you
know it's it's really good graphics as
well I mean this thing is gonna have
very similar graphics to what you might
find on the ps3 maybe not quite as good
but in reality when you're playing it
you really won't be able to tell a whole
lot of difference consuming feeling
really good looking as far as the
graphics go he's got a 5-inch o le d
touchscreen really big nice display
everybody everyone who's ever seen it
just just can't just say enough about
how much they like it and it's also got
some other cool things such as a rear a
rear touchpad so almost kind of similar
to what you might find on like your
mousepad whatever well that's gonna be
on the back of the next PSP it's also
got analog sticks so you have dual
analog sticks you've got motion controls
like in the PlayStation Move
you've got 3G Wi-Fi I mean the list goes
on and on and on the next PSP is gonna
be just absolutely excellent so I won't
get into too much of any more of the
detail but I will say is coming to some
of the stuff I like and dislike one of
the things that I'm a little bit leery
about is the price with something like
this that has so much huge technology I
mean you know you've got processors and
this and that and everything it's
probably going to cost a fair bit more
than the 3ds
now that's kind of an important thing
because a lot of people think the 3ds is
a bit overpriced I think the price will
come down but I'll get into that in a
little bit but as far as the NGP is I
think one thing number
things somebody has to be careful of is
the price no one wants to repeat of when
the PlayStation 3 came out and was like
$700 and nope I was like oh you know so
as long as they can keep the NGP at a
reasonable price point I would say 400
would be the max hopefully more closer
to 350 or $300 I think if they can do
that and the NGP isn't just gonna be a
really solid player
now some of the things I really do like
is the fact that it no longer uses um
these this is kind of a little bit of a
disappointment obviously because you
know you know all your PSP games you
won't be able to play it but to be
honest I think that it's definitely the
right choice you know the the old style
of the disk the UM DS just wasn't that
good for gaming I mean you know it was
just there pretty large we had to have a
whole disk drive everything a handheld
so that just wasn't the most ideal
situation and then the NGP you'll be
able to download games and apps and all
that kind of stuff but you also be able
to use a an SD card like that's not
going to be an SD card but it's going to
be kind of someone's watching my time in
the 3ds you know just be a buy it the
store and you go and plug it in and
they'll work just fine so the n GP is
definitely I'm really looking forward to
that it's gonna be an absolutely
excellent handheld smash one we've got
to talk about is the Nintendo 3ds I can
go ahead and just roll through pretty
quickly here and you do have a three and
a half inch sixteen by nine not
touchscreen that's going to be a 3d
display that's pretty much one of the
major things about in 3d as is that
you're gonna be able to use without
glasses 3d this is gonna be a pretty
cool thing I think because obviously 3d
is really picking up and you hear more
and more about it every day every week
you know the more 3d TVs and this and
that now we're being able to have 3d in
your pockets so it's going to be a
fairly small console and you'll be able
to see it without any glasses it's going
to be a really cool thing now some
people have said that it's not gonna
make them all sick and this and that
which I definitely can understand I mean
a lot of people don't like 3d too much I
don't love it but I mean I don't like
having issues with it but the cool thing
is with 3d is there's a little slider
there you shut off the 3d and it just
turns into you know just standard 2d no
honey issues I mean moving on from the
head it does have a touch screen on the
bottom it is resistive so you guys still
need to use a stylus which is
I'm a bit of an annoyance but I don't
think it'll be a huge of a deal I will
have any joy yeah yeah let's cut it's
not exactly a touchpad that's going to
be kind of similar to what on the
original PSP yeah the little thumb stick
it's gonna be a little bit bigger and
nicer than that but it's still not going
to be a full you know have job analog
stick like on the NGP now this is gonna
have the same kind of design as the DES
so fortunate you have two screens I know
it'll be able to open and close you will
have to do cameras on the back which is
a pretty cool thing we actually go ahead
and take 3d photos and you can go an off
course the view it on the screen and you
have a front-facing camera as well now
the three es is not going to be nearly
as graphically intense as the NGP you
know most people says probably somewhere
around GameCube to wheat graphics maybe
not quite that good you know that's that
white is nuts Neville that's not it's
not nearly as good as the NGP and
probably the ipod touch i'm however it
still should be plenty good enough and
one of the really big things about the
des was you know didn't have that great
of graphical capabilities
you know developers really made up for
that with some really unique and
innovative games so I'm not really too
worried about that on the 3ds now the
videos will be available at the end of
March or actually the end of February in
Japan and the end of March and the
United States and Europe and I believe a
couple of other countries so pretty much
by the end of March permits everyone
should be able to pick up the 3ds you
know it's gonna bei price pirate price
through the countries hello from the
United States it will be run you 249 a
little bit expensive but I think it will
be pretty good and I do like the 3ds and
the last one is gonna be the wild card
then the hi pod Touch 5th generation now
the iPod Touch slowly becoming a better
better gaming platform I think with the
fifth generation Apple is really gonna
break it out and really gonna make this
you know just a major competitor to the
other two so obviously the iPod Touch is
really in a four step I phone but I'm
gonna be mostly talking about the iPod
touch here there's one major thing what
makes it so successful it the App Store
the App Store is just really really good
for gaming now if you're wanting to buy
you know some of the really nicer games
like you know you're not gonna find a
Pokemon or uncharted or any of these big
franchises
the iPod however there are a lot of new
ones a lot of cheaper games a lot of
ones that really be out picking up
staves for example Angry Birds you know
Angry Birds is turning into a really
really big thing and of course there are
a lot of other developers such as
Electronic Arts
they're bringing over Madden for example
Need for Speed hot pursuit on the iPod
Touch I've absolutely loved that game
I've been playing it probably more than
any game that you know I've had it the
last couple months so while a lot of
people say and I do agree that you know
a lot of the quality of games aren't
that great don't count it out there are
a lot of really good games coming out
and the good thing is they're really
pretty cheap so while you know what the
ng pay you'd probably be paying probably
forty to fifty dollars out of Majan
fifty dollars for games with the 3ds
probably forty dollars or so I'm put on
the iPod touch you're usually ten
dollars about the max you ever play a
for example dead space just came out and
that cost about $7 so you're getting a
lot a lot of content very close to what
you might find a console quality but for
a fraction of the price which allows you
to buy a lot more games for the same
money and so what if maybe wanted to
aren't the greatest you still got two or
three more games for the same right so
that's one of the big things I'd be like
about the iPod Touch now of course the
iPod is also really a wide-ranging
device so you know you will actually be
able to get on the internet it's got a
absolutely excellent browser you have a
full touchscreen you know with various
other apps that aren't gaming related
you got both a front and rear facing
camera you've got a lot of really cool
things that does it's just not a gaming
device obviously it's an iPod so you get
movies and music and all that kind of
stuff now one of the things that are
about the iPod Touch 5th generation that
should be new this year is the
possibility of a 3d display now this is
a confirm that's mostly just fitting
rumors however I wouldn't surprise me
that much if we do see a 3d display very
similar to what you might find on the
Nintendo 3ds only next iPod Touch now in
addition to that of course it's probably
being more powerful with no better specs
and you know the graphics are
continuously just getting better and
better and better you know I would say a
lot of games on the DSi I mean on the
iPod Touch right now are already PSP
quality and above so everything is
what's the next generation it should be
much much better soon hey that's my
brief wrap
of all three you know all three have the
pros and cons I mean the iPod Touch is
really good it's probably gonna be along
the cheaper I would say we're gonna be
about the same price 230 yes it might
vary it might be up or down just a
little bit but I thought Such is really
gonna be solid and I'm definitely liking
that the three es I think is gonna be I
mean after how successful the DS has
been I don't think we're gonna have any
issues ugh millions and millions of them
and you know as soon as I do that that
guarantees that the game's gonna come
and with that unique 3d display it's
gonna add a lot of new you know people
interested about 3d however my pick is
definitely going to be the Sony NGP this
thing is absolutely just gonna be
phenomenal
now hopefully we'll be out by the end of
the year maybe the early next year some
places they haven't been entirely clear
but from what we know about this it's
just gonna blow the others out of the
water as long as I keep the price right
anyway for the second half of d3 live
out taking live questions for everyone
in chat as always with every episode of
d3 live still in front of a live
audience we've got a lot of people in
here watching on blogtv so I just take
some questions do I think the iPod Touch
4G these gaming performance and the CPU
will improve yeah I do think so I think
that pretty much every year Apple likes
to improve it to you know add more
processing more RAM this that does that
I mean I definitely think that was a
dual-core processor it will really open
up a lot more better-looking gaming for
the iPod touch what's there between an
MB and NC model on the iPod touch
well it pretty much did a different
types of ipod touch the NFC model is the
newer and it's the iPod Touch 4th
generation iPod Touch 3rd generation and
the MC model of the iPod Touch 2nd
generation really the major difference
is just for jailbreaking
you know sometimes you can jailbreak an
MB and not an MC but really the best way
to kind of keep track of the iPods you
see if it's a second generation third
generation or fourth generation the ngpa
UND slot no it does not with other mg
pieces like I kind of mentioned a little
earlier it's almost like an SD card it's
not going to be it's some kind of
proprietary so anything but it's gonna
be a small chip where you just go ahead
and put it in just like you know what
you would do on a DS or 3ds so that's
the way you'll get the games you also
will be able to download games as well
however I think the major great thing
would just be buying with you know by
going to the store and buying the cards
Unreal Engine 3 for iOS what games will
be made with it a lot now there aren't a
ton of games with unreal engine just yet
I'm is only it was only announced our
thing it's only been out for a fairly
short time the Unreal Engine I'm over as
more and more people kind of get a hold
of it more developers decide that that's
what I want to do I think we will start
seeing a lot of really really
nice-looking games on the iPod in the
iPhone could you deal with the PSP uh
you know there are a lot of people who
were able to happily PSP before but I
think that somebody is really kind of
getting annoyed because a lot of that
was used just for piracy and I think
somebody's really trying to crackdown
that kind of stuff because that hurts
them a big time you know when there's a
lot of piracy developers decide yeah we
don't want to develop for this we got to
do it on some other platforms so I
really think that somebody is going to
try to crack down a lot harder on the
the NGP
well Xbox ever go mobile boy I wish I
could tell you the answer to that um I
honestly think that it will I mean a
couple years back I know they kind of
were talking a little bit about you know
more than just the Xbox 360 maybe you
know expanding it out into different
markets I would presume that would mean
handheld hello we really don't know
anything about it I haven't ever heard
any you know any any concrete anything
pretty much just a couple of them are in
there but I really would expect to see a
new Xbox anytime soon as far as a
portable one but I won't be surprised
that it does happen eventually maybe not
now but maybe in a year or two years or
something that we actually might see a
portable Xbox that would be really cool
she but buy an iPod Touch 4G or wait for
the buck 5th generation model you know
it's kind of a special kind of a hard
question um the iPod touch they you know
release a new one every September so it
kind of depends uh no it's September so
pretty long way away if you're not so
you can go ahead and buy the
fourth-generation that's what I have I
really love it you want to wait you got
to look good back they clip if
that's that's a long way away you
probably better go ahead just buy the
full iteration now just see about maybe
getting the fifth generation later
since the NGP has a front-facing camera
and front and back facing camera will
you be able to mix Skype calls you've
actually somebody has been a little bit
kind of like cagey about that of course
the psp-3000 does have Skype I would
imagine
yes the next NGP will have Skype
especially was it of course like you
said the front and rear facing cameras
however Sony did not say yes they didn't
say no either but I would guess yeah I
would think that make a lot of sense for
tasks Skype um do I've been getting
iPhone form Verizon now or a June where
they'll update the iPhones yeah I think
go ahead I would recommend not buying
the iPhone 4 right now
it just doesn't make any sense Verizon
wait until July when they when the new
iPhone 5 whatever they said come out the
next generation iPhone comes out I would
be really surprised as it doesn't come
out for AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon so unless you
absolutely have to have I program now I
would recommend going ahead and waiting
anyway guys that's it for this week's
