browsers Google Chrome 10 Mozilla
Firefox 4 Microsoft Internet Explorer 9
opera 11 and Apple Safari 5 to see which
is the fastest available before we begin
let me explain a bit about how I test
all five browsers are on their latest
non-beta release with the exception of
firefox 4 where i use the release
candidate all the browsers are tested
using a fresh install with no additional
options enabled such as hardware
acceleration each test was run multiple
times on the exact same Windows 7
computer
the first test Iran was the j/s
benchmark which is a good overall test
of JavaScript speed here you can see
that chrome is considerably faster than
the rest of the browsers due to the new
crankshaft compiler however what's more
impressive is the fact that all browsers
did really quite well a far cry from the
mismatched results I found in the past
next is the v8 benchmark google's own
javascript test here i found very
similar results with chrome delivering
much better performance than the rest
although again opera and Firefox put up
very solid performance as well now we
have the SunSpider benchmark and here
the results change quite a bit
Internet Explorer 9 shows huge gains
beating out chrome opera and Firefox by
a short margin getting out of pure
JavaScript tests now we have the
Peacekeeper benchmark a great overall
test of general browser performance here
chrome and opera do very well with any
Explorer Firefox and Safari falling
behind now we have the flying images
test from the Internet Explorer 9 test
suite this test is largely based on how
well the browser taps into your GPU to
display 100 spinning images both
Internet Explorer and Firefox get a
perfect 60 frames per second while
chrome and opera to get a much lower 20
and 22 frames Safari which likes any
hardware acceleration to speak of gets a
meagre two frames lastly we have the
html5 test which evaluates how well each
browser adheres to the latest web
standard chrome does the best here
however Firefox Opera and Safari also do
well so overall I was very impressed
with all five browsers however the
winner today is Google Chrome it remains
the king
of the hill and almost all speed tests
has the best compliance with html5 and
already has saw an optional hardware
acceleration that likely will become
standard soon something to keep in mind
is that no longer are there only one or
two standout browsers as all fire are
quite fast html5 compliant and have
their own unique features so it really
is hard to go wrong no matter what camp
