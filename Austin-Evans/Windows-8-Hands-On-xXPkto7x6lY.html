of Windows 8 now I've been looking
forward to taking out windows 8 for a
long time and I finally of course do
have it now so why give you guys a quick
hands-on and my first impressions now i
do want to mention before we get started
i am using a standard computer with a
mouse and keyboard so a lot of the stuff
is a maid for touch but go ahead give
you guys a little bit of a view of it
just from my point of view with you know
just using a mouse and keyboard so some
of the of course this is the Metro UI
and some of the ways you can control is
you can use your right and up and down
arrows to kind of tab between these if I
want to open up something and also use
the mouse wheel to scroll which seems to
run pretty nicely i am running it inside
VirtualBox right now so the performance
is not quite up to par with what will
probably be on normal computers okay
let's go ahead and take a look a couple
things so start with let's open up the
control panel now as you guys can see
this is a very different interface than
you know what you would typically find
in Windows it's very nice very style
like Windows 7 so there's a lot of
things for example I could turn on/off
wireless which I actually have wireless
in this but now it's okay i do
notifications and one of the cool things
as notifications have been redesigned in
windows and i'll see if i can maybe get
something to show you as that of course
i do want to keep this fairly brief so
you can just see all the more settings
knock on stuff now go ahead and hit the
Windows key which will back us up to
back over here alright so now if we want
we can take a look at a couple of things
for you so for example let's take a look
at 0 SE stocks we're always looking to
see what's going on with the stocks so
you can see here very colorful very very
nice looking interface now you guys can
see here on the bottom we have a little
scroll bar so no matter like even if
it's you know huge whatever instead of
having to you know scroll normally with
you know some big giant bars it's kind
of a little bit small it's out of the
way and of course we can scroll through
here and take a look where we want let's
hit the home button to back up and
scroll along here and see what else kind
of we want to jump into so how about a
note space so we can open this up you
guys here's guys very nice little
animations and stuff so we can go ahead
bring up the app bar and all that kind
of good stuff if we want to type in here
we just you know type whatever we want
hit the home button to back right out
now of course this is all fine and good
however a lot of people myself included
do like the old windows up
old windows interface so if you want to
do that all you have to click this
desktop button and bam we're right back
to a standard kind of Windows 8 can you
know experience so we want to open up
you know the standard Windows Explorer
we can go through our documents and
which of course I don't have any but it
looks very similar however you probably
notice one major difference with it
which is that it has this kind of ribbon
style interface from Microsoft Word um I
don't use it long enough to really have
a good opinion of it and it'll had a
major problem with this but it's just
fine if I go ahead and take this it
still works just like windows 7i can
resize the windows and do whatever I
want so guys that's going to be about it
of course you do have your full you know
interface if you want to use it like
this or if you want to go ahead and come
down here and a couple of things for
example can go to settings or search
whatever so let's just open this things
really quickly here and you can see here
some of the some of the newer kind of
style does bleed over so for example we
can go turn it off turn on not
notifications and all that kind of stuff
but if I guys it's going to be a my
quick first hands-on of windows 8 if you
guys enjoy definitely be sure to leave a
thumbs up and if you're interested in
more videos be sure to subscribe i'm
going to be posting a lot more windows 8
