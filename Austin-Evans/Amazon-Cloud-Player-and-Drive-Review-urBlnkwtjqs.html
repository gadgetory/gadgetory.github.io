Amazon's new cloud player and cloud
drive announced earlier this week this
marks the first entry by Amazon into the
online storage space market alongside
Dropbox and Windows Live SkyDrive cloud
drive is a fairly straightforward online
storage service that allows you to store
video music pictures and more online and
access it from any desktop web browser
if you have a u.s. amazon account you
get 5 gigabytes of free storage which
can be expanded to 20 gigabytes by
purchasing any mp3 album from amazon you
can also expand your online storage all
the way to 1 terabyte with pricing at
one dollar per gigabyte a year the real
draw however is cloud player for months
we have heard rumors about a cloud based
itunes that allowed you to upload and
listen to your music online from
multiple devices and I'm happy to say
this is exactly what cloud player does
just download the adobe air based
uploader select the songs and playlists
so you want uploaded and give you
internet connection something fun to do
for the next day or two you do share
storage space with your Cloud Drive
account though so the initial five
gigabytes will probably go quickly
speaking of purchasing from Amazon's
generally excellent online store all new
purchases can be automatically stored on
your Cloud Drive account and don't count
against your storage quota once uploaded
you can listen to your tunes on any
mainstream desktop web browser or on an
android phone using the amazon mp3 app
the biggest downside to this is the lack
of support for iOS Windows Phone 7 and
blackberry but this very well might be
fixed later on if you upload your music
in mp3 or AAC then Cloud Drive preserves
the bit rate meaning that if you're
coming from iTunes your music should
sound exactly the same after uploading
the online interface is generally
intuitive and quick allowing you to go
through your music and sort by album
artist etc you also have the option of
redownloading your music from the cloud
being this a great way to not only
listen to your music but also to keep it
safely stored it's certainly not the
most feature-rich music app you'll find
out there but it does get the job done
no problem amazon cloud player is
exactly what I've been hoping to see out
of itunes for a long time and cloud
drive is a decent online file storage
service especially if you need to store
or data then Dropbox can handle so be
sure to go check them out and let me
know what you think in the comments
