day inside a web browser but which one
is fastest to test we've got a mid-range
PC running the Windows 10 technical
preview and a 2013 11 inch MacBook Air
both of which are outfitted with SSDs to
keep things fair the reason we're using
Windows 10 is project Spartan this is an
all new browser Microsoft will be
including in Windows 10 to replace
Internet Explorer there's a very early
version of this included in the
technical preview which you can access
by going to about flags in IE 11 and
turning on the experimental features
this should give us a pretty decent look
at how Spartan will match up once the
Windows 10 comes out the first test
we've got is peacekeeper which is a good
general test of how a browser
performance on Windows it's surprisingly
closed between Firefox Chrome and opera
you can see Spartans slightly improves
from Internet Explorer but it still
trails quite a bit behind over on the
Mac side things are still closed but
here Firefox pulls a bit more of a lead
next we've got octane which is all about
testing the JavaScript speed of the
browsers here chrome and opera pull out
the wind which makes sense as they share
a lot of DNA however the big surprise is
partner it's a massive improvement over
Internet Explorer on Yosemite it's
basically the same story chrome is the
performance champ with Firefox and
Safari trailing behind now let's take a
look at the html5 test to see which
browser supports the most HTML features
again Chrome and opera pull up the win
here followed by Firefox and Safari
Spartan improves only slightly but this
of course is still a very early version
browser scope is a simple test that
checks how many common web threats your
browser can block and surprise surprise
chrome and opera do well here but the
really interesting thing is the fairly
poor performance of Safari and
especially Firefox a new test this time
around is the unity WebGL benchmark this
is all about checking out the gaming
performance and some of the latest
browser-based games the benchmark didn't
behave very well on Windows but on Mac
it's obvious that Firefox is the way to
go for WebGL content with the rest fall
and quite a ways behind next I tested
how long it takes to start each browser
and then load the Google home page here
we see project Spartan pull out a huge
win by loading in just over half a
second being out even internet explorer
thanks to being built into Windows on
that it's still quite a bit closer with
chrome edging out the wind but there's
still less than a 1 second difference
when all four to see how well each of
the browsers will run on older computers
I loaded up eight popular websites and
measured how much memory they each use
on Windows Firefox is impressively
lightweight needing quite a bit less ran
in the rest of the field
Spartan also does a good job improving
quite a bit over Internet Explorer on
thanks safari pulls out a slight win
where opera falls quite a bit behind
well it's hard to go wrong with browsers
these days chrome is still the most
solid choice for both Windows and Mac so
what browser are you guys using let me
know in the comments below and if you
want to catch more videos like this be
sure to subscribe to the channel anyway
guys thank you so much for watching and
I will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
