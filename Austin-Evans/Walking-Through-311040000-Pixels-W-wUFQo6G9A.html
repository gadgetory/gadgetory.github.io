in Berlin and Aoife 2018 for one reason
and one reason only see exactly what LG
has been cooking up little hint it's
very loud and it's got a whole lot of ol
ends so LG sponsor our trip out here to
take a look at some of the cool stuff
they've got in the booth including the
OLED canyon this is over 200 OLED TVs
that are all put together in a well
pretty crazy setup I mean come on
seriously this is ridiculous
I mean I can I can barely see the pixels
definitely the highlight this year
though is going to be LG's thinkyou
initiative if you think about it LG
makes a ton of different products right
then make TVs they make phones that make
speakers they make appliances there's a
lot there and with thank you all that
can actually talk to each other and be
actually smart now I'm sure you've heard
this many many times but LG's and one of
the very few companies who legitimately
makes almost all this stuff so if they
can get all of it to work together as
we're about to see it could be pretty
cool nothing shows this off better than
the insta view think you know obviously
this is going to be a very high-end
refrigerators with well a screen as you
can see but it also does have a LexA
built-in so if I say Alexa what's the
weather in Berlin it's 20 degrees
Celsius with mostly sunny skies
tonight's forecast has plans with alone
11 degrees they should give you a good
idea of what think he was capable of
when all the devices in your home are
all talking together it can make a big
difference to what you can actually do
plus you have cool stuff like that I
mean come on it's a transparent screen
on your fridge
I'm easily amused by these things the
fun doesn't stop there either so because
so many things here at the booth are
connected via think queue I can do some
fun stuff like this hey Google Talk tuna
Tootsie
how can I help you
I'd like to watch TV yeah there we go
well yes I could have reclined myself
like a normal person and use the remote
to turn on the TV but this does a good
job of showing just how think you can
legitimately make a lot of things
automated a lot of things a lot easier
play Austin Evans videos on YouTube my
friends this is definitely the future
well okay maybe I'll watching my own
videos is the future but you can imagine
that would think you on board your
entire house could be connected you can
do all kinds of really interesting
things just using purely the power of
your voice and a lot of technology but
you know it seems like it's just your
voice so you guys know I love myself
some LG monitors and actually have a
brand new line here at Aoife so known as
ultra gear they're pretty much all aimed
to being very high refresh rate and very
much focused on gaming they wonderfully
named 27g k75 0f aka
a super high refreshing mind I can't do
a straight face but it will run a full
240 frames per second my favorite of the
new ultra gear monitors is the 34 gk9
500g don't worry I'm not gonna remember
that it's the new ultra wipe so now is
this going to be a little bit of an
update as far as the actual screen and
whatnot it does look pretty nice it has
an IPS displays definitely to look a
little bit better than the other
monitors but we're still going to be
getting a full 100 Hertz 120 if you want
to overclock it and you do get that 34
40 by 1440p Reds now this guy I think is
a little more interesting mostly just
because you're going to be getting the
extra framerate without sacrificing
resolution or screen quality but all
three of these monitors do look
interesting and they'll be on sale at
some point right I'm getting a nod but
they will be on sale indeed at some
point you're probably familiar with the
LG G 7 thank you it's been out for a
couple months now it's about as high-end
as a flagship gets but today it Etha
they've announced a couple of other
additions to the g7 lineup starting with
the g7 1 this is going to be a slight
downgrade as far as some features so
you're going to be losing like the dual
cameras it's going to have a slightly
different design but what you're going
to be gaining is Android 1 so as opposed
to run
LG's skin with all of their software
instead you're getting a very pixel like
experience here which personally I
actually am kind of a fan of and
importantly this should be cheaper we
don't have an actual price just yet but
considering that they downgraded a
couple of the hardware things such as
the snapdragon 845 to an 835 while still
keeping a lot of the other stuff like
the screen and whatnot available
hopefully this is gonna be a pretty
interesting phone behind me is one of
the more interesting things of the show
an 88 inch 8k OLED TV or at least it
used to be behind me they've switched it
out with a 4k OLED but I got to take a
look at the real 8k yesterday and it
looks phenomenal so first of all this is
going to be the very first 8k TV that LG
has done
and the very first time that someone's
been able to do 8k with Olin which
obviously OLED if you guys aren't
familiar is like the best way of doing
TVs I'm not even like saying that in
like a biased way I mean like oh that
just looks really really nice but the
idea that you're going to be getting a
full 8k picture means that while yes
there's very little 8k content out there
if you're able to find something's gonna
look terrific and it will of course
upscale 1080p and 4k stuff to 8k so if
you want the biggest and baddest OLED TV
you could possibly imagine this is
actually going to be going on sale soon
and we don't have an exact price for at
least eight just yet but LG says this is
going to be production ready and well
it's gonna be expensive but you know an
8k OLED TV that's the size of your wall
it sounds pretty good to me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
