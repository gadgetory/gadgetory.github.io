at the AMD APU 13 developer event with
one question what is the future of
gaming for me I cannot do the next-gen
consoles with more optimized operating
system for gaming so what I've noticed
what everyone's been trying to do in the
industry is trying to bring PC and
console gaming closer together you know
Sony's approach this time around is
completely different than what they did
last time you know it's like really
developer centric it was like okay how
can we make it easier for you to make
games on
I mean console gaming these days it's
almost pretty much it's a PC but you
know a different platform but that's
that is what I see currently of what I
think is gonna happen to the future in
the next couple years I am a gamer I'm a
hardcore gamer and have been for over
thirty years
so I get excited when we talk video
gaming small form-factor PC is a big
deal small form-factor builds with a new
black in the DIY industry small
form-factor is becoming more and more
prevalent you know there's a lot of
really cool case designs they've been
coming out from various partners you
know we're really focusing on the gaming
smaller form factor because I think
that's the part of the segment that is
growing right now and we see that market
and we're trying to push through that
market so it's really cool to see this
happening gaming on the PC has the
chance to move more mainstream 4k
I think is going about to become really
really big we have some monitors in our
lab these sharp 32 inch 4k monitors last
year they were $7,000 the this year
they're four thousand dollars and of
course 4k is the current you know that's
I think that's like the
heat of the resolution you know you
almost can't distinguish beyond that and
you know going 3d from that point is
gonna be amazing
we really do believe it's finally the
time for Korea the oculus rift is
actually a relatively simple hardware
platform I mean there's a lot of work
that goes into the optics but from a
from a pure component standpoint it's
USB and HDMI it's really the our vision
is that virtual reality will be on any
any device anywhere it's not really
there yet but just seeing the beginning
of something that can really truly
become great
360 degrees and lockdown
I mean he literally just went into the
elemental world is no longer the proper
oculus for sure obviously you can see
the excitement in the industry and in
amongst gamers for this technology it's
really all about being there being
inside of a virtual world most people
haven't ever had the opportunity or the
experience of being immersed inside a
virtual reality world before and our
goal is just making things as immersive
and as real as they can be to really
truly blur the lines between reality and
virtual reality</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
