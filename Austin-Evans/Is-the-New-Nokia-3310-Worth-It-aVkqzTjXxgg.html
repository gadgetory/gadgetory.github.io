legendary Nokia 3310 now in addition to
being a lot of people's very first cell
phone it also has a reputation for being
basically indestructible
fast forward to 2018 though and Nokia
has released this a brand new version of
the 3310 so I mean it wasn't even like I
had a choice of course I had to get one
take a look at the box and you're gonna
see something that looks very very
similar to the original 3310 of course
one of the best features of this phone
was the games or well the game sake in
fact was probably the best game on any
phone ever fighting kind of care that
fight me I think he was gonna fight me
over snake everyone agrees on that right
put the new and the old 3310 side by
side you see they have a lot of
similarities but of course the new one
has a much larger screen but one of the
important things is that because it's
going to be so thin and light it's
actually kind of makes sense as a
secondary phone so maybe you just want a
backup phone or maybe you just want
something to go off the grid for a
weekend or something and not to worry
about people you know Facebook messaging
you and emails and I don't know can this
thing do email actually you probably can
rain these are not cheap by the way I
think the Nokia 3310 this one cost me
around $60 so you could get like a
low-end smartphone for that however you
definitely don't get that kind of cool
retro Nokia vibes from it turn you on
the first thing we get is the charger so
thankfully this is now in 2018 and well
2016 because we're using a micro USB
cable but it's a lot better than the
stupid barrel plug on the original 3310
we also surprisingly get a headset
that's actually kind of impressive
there you go got a headphone jack right
there I don't know how you actually get
music on this if I actually don't know
that much about this at all so it does
say on the box it's got the Opera app
store so we actually might have some
flexibility and what we're doing with it
pop off the back and the first thing we
see is the battery spot as well as a
slot for not only a micro sim but also
micro SD card you know for when you want
to store all your sick 90s jams okay so
that was the simplest phone setup
process ever so at least we're getting a
full-color display unlock press start
unlock okay oh wow so we actually have
snake Facebook camera we've got the
mobile store even have the Twitter I
this actually might not be that bad of
course though the only game that anyone
really cares about the snake oh wow that
was really generous oh I have like a
super wide head oh you don't even need
to hit it on the necessarily right on
the mark
it has snake but it's not the real snake
I will say though this actually at first
glance doesn't seem like it's going to
be that far off I was expecting
something with no apps something there's
gonna be super basic just for text and
calls but we do have some apps we have a
Twitter app we have a couple games that
aren't snakes
so let's actually use this for a day so
it is time to use the Nokia 3310 and
there's actually a lot of weird stuff
with this phone no the responsiveness
actually isn't too bad so I have a list
of apps well apps the mostly just web
apps because there is offer mobile on
this guy oh wow we have 30 megabytes of
phone memory free but I guess we could
use that micro SD card slot too but more
than three mp3s on it oh I've got a
flashlight
excellent revolutionary technology
there's so much weird stuff with this
here comes my favorite part
typing out my entire Twitter credentials
on the little t9 keyboard oh ho we are
on glorious twitter.com for mobile that
looks exactly like 2012 actually I mean
this kind of works it looks a little
broken it's definitely slow but I mean
it works alright let's let's wait Kai
reply where do you oh I think that's it
wait this button is replying oh wait dad
just retweet oh I didn't okay
let's reply so you have to consider what
you're going to text or tweet from this
because it takes a little while to text
if you're lame and you've forgotten how
to use a t9 keyboard like I have I think
Ken's getting frustrated with how long
it takes for me to type on this thing
I'm officially written out 123 character
tweets and I have proof this was in fact
written on a Nokia 3310 alright so it is
time to use the Nokia 3310 for real
it's gonna be a little too challenge but
honestly after playing with it for just
a few minutes it's actually not that far
out of date I mean some stuff seems kind
of okay so of course what better way to
test than with some proper retro looking
headphones so you do have to use a micro
SD card to actual wrong phone I meant to
grab the one in this pocket which
actually does have a headphone jack it's
a little tinny but it's much better than
we expect out of a tiny little feature
felt like this mostly like it's actually
not that hard to use everything is
pretty responsive I mean obviously we're
not running Android or anything but can
actually multitask oh I can so I can
move around while still listening in
music I really want to try is the camera
that's I would call not a lot of dynamic
range
yeah wait how do I do a selfie okay five
four three two
Wow it actually worked that doesn't look
like the worst thing I've ever seen oh
okay okay so what have we learned
well first of all this is definitely not
a replacement for a smartphone however
if you want something that's going to be
small light weight and hopefully should
survive a quick little drop it should be
fine right
hey it's fine I had no doubts any this
is a carpet to be fair but the nice
thing is because it's so small and
lightweight it's easy to be able to
carry this around as a secondary device
or if you're just someone who doesn't
really want to deal with the smartphone
and want something that's just gonna be
a little bit simpler to you know call
text listen to some sick 2003 jams the
Nokia 3310 actually not gonna be too bad
so as always I will find a link to this
guy and put in the description things
like 60 bucks or so from curious would
you actually ever want to pick up a 3310
let me know in the comments below and I
will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
