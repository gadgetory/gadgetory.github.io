overview of the latest code themed
update so as most of you guys probably
know I'm a big fan of code themed it's
probably the best website well it's
probably the only website that allows
you to go ahead and create full custom
winterboard themes straight from Z
websites so I've made quite a few things
before you know you know you have to
deal with near the images figuring out
what goes where all the you know the
complicated stuff but codeine really
does make it easy for you and they've
actually just recently updated just just
just like a bat believe about an hour or
so ago with a really cool new update um
so now when you create a theme in code
themes you can actually go ahead and opt
for it to be automatically sent to cydia
so this is really cool if you're wanting
to you know get your information out you
know you get your themes out you can go
ahead and create something in code
themed send it now do keep in mind that
it's not going to automatically do
everything they will it will need to be
reviewed you know if you make a terrible
thing with like one icon and I can
accept it obviously but if you know you
put some effort into it you make your
own stuff you can definitely get your
theme into cydia so look one you should
give you guys a little demo of it I'm
going to open it up here on the first
time you do this it will ask are you
interested in at one click sharing which
you can just say yes or no obviously
I've done this before so I've already
done that I'm sort of want you to give
you guys a quick little overview of how
this works I'm sure a lot of you guys
already know what code theme is all
about but in case you haven't I will
give you a quick overview so the first
thing a squad just go to icons now this
is one thing you do need to keep in mind
now if you're interested in making your
own thing and putting it on City you
will need to upload your own graphics so
well as so you just go into messages as
you can see here there are a lot of
presets and while you can use these you
can't use these to be uploaded to cydia
so like let's say I want to use this one
so I'm going to click on that now I can
use that and that can download this
theme and use it myself however if I
want to go ahead and upload cydia you
will need to go ahead by clicking here
and upload your own images so do keep
that in mind if you know you try to make
a lot of the presets you can't do that
however not a big deal because if you're
making your own thing odds are you gonna
go ahead and make all your knees icons
same goes for backgrounds go ahead just
show you there are quite a few already
preset I'm glad just upload one on my
own here okay so now go ahead Jews these
are just using from one of my old thing
but go ahead
at it up so I can just click this I'll
set it as both and now and I've got this
i can actually go ahead and choose what
pages to apply to you which is
definitely a really cool thing you know
if you want different pages to have
different backgrounds you can I'm go
ahead and just apply to all pages and
there we go as you can see here just as
simple as that I can go ahead and now I
now have my new background that's going
to move on to Doc's it's the same thing
guys if you've ever used coke thing
before not a whole lot has changed
although there is now a randomized
function but it pretty much all works
the same way go ahead just show you just
a couple of you can make a really awful
thing real quick just to show you guys
outdoors I'm going to label settings we
can now change the color we can just get
rid of the labels all together if we
like Josh I can't like that yeah let's
just leave it like that let's go ahead
move on to the lock screen now I like I
said guys same stuff goes you can go
ahead and upload your own sliders so
I'll go ahead and do that real quick
okay so now that added this I go ahead
and click on that and as you can see
here we got a little blue apple logo of
course this is not the greatest name in
the world but it's just really something
simple to show you so I'll go out and
continue on we can go ahead and change
the slider background so I should L is
kind of cool we just make it totally
transparent and then again we can go
ahead and go to the unlock text and we
can make it you know rainbow colored we
do all kinds of cool stuff like that and
lastly I just jump over to the status
bar as you can see you're up here we can
do all kinds of things we can make it
you know really bright we can make it
shadowed of course we can upload our own
so that's about it i would go ahead to
show you you can do the icons as far as
you know the batteries so if we want
like that color battery and we want to
do all kinds of different things we can
do that and lastly we can go ahead and
do a carrier logo so this is something
pretty cool so like let's say I want to
put Duncan 3303 I can do that set is
cured and there as you can see it when
just jump back over to the home screen
there we go so you can see that's a
little bit too much text but still not a
big deal and that's it so in just like a
couple of minutes we've already made
ourselves a winterboard theme obviously
you guys are probably going to do a lot
better by actually now creating the
theme from scratch and you know it's
been spinning a little time on it but as
soon as you do that you're good now this
point can go ahead and save the changes
you can download the theme we can
randomize which I was taught hence that
a little bit before we can
go ahead and you know I just make your
totally crazy random theme maybe you
know if you want to go that way I'm
betting like as soon as you hit Save
Changes it will go ahead and submit it
to cydia rather submit it to co themed
they'll take a look at it again should
take 12 days something like that for
them to review it and then as long as
you know you followed all the rules and
everything you will have your theme in
cydia so there you go guys that's it I'm
really impressed with code themed I've
blood this website for a long time I
definitely recommend guys go ahead and
take a look at it see if you know see if
you like it you know as long as you want
to put a little bit of effort into it
it's not all that hard to create your
own custom winterboard thing hopefully
something a little bit better than this
but yeah so anyway guys thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
