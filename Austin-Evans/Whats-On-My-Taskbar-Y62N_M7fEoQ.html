today I'm going to be doing a bit of a
different video I'm going to be doing a
what's on my taskbar video now I'm sure
a lot of you guys seen lots of these for
Mac but seeing as the new windows
taskbar is basically like a table I'm
gonna go ahead and do one of my own
so yeah let's just get started
okay guys so let's just go ahead and
move down here okay
so obviously everybody has the start
button oh you know you have all your
stuff okay so first thing I have is
Windows Explorer basically this is where
I can open up yeah just a second load
I came up my library's which is
something new in Windows 7 so I can find
all my documents and all that stuff kind
of like the finder I guess and oh and
Mac whatever
next I have Chrome Google Chrome which
is my favorite browser always use that I
also have Firefox installed I use it
occasionally mostly just for testing
websites everything saying with I have
operatin I also have Internet Explorer
bed do not keep it on my taskbar at all
because Explorer anyway
next I have tweet deck I use this
sometimes I usually just use it just do
it in the browser just have like just
the page open but this is kind of nice I
can open it and you just kind of like
minimize it to half the screen or
whatever it's kinda nice next we have
iTunes
everybody has iTunes you know you got to
have I mean having me only thing is
though is that my iPod I haven't even
had it installed
it doesn't even sync with iTunes anymore
because it wants to redo it not not
bothering with it so really the only
reason I have iTunes on here is just
occasionally do some stuff but
surprisingly what I've been using lately
for music is Windows Media Player I
believe it's 11 in Windows 7 I'm really
I'm really like it
it's uh it's pretty solid I've got all
my music kind of is a little glitchy it
seems to want to search for every single
for all your music every time which
takes a few minutes but uh no big deal I
actually like it and you can I mean you
have the controls like I'm listening to
something I can control live and having
to maximize it real good I've never used
really meaty play before so and next we
have Live Movie Maker this is the new
one that came out probably a week or two
ago I've been using the beta for a
little while
that's basically what I use for all my
editing
I've always used moviemaker and yeah I
know it's totally dumb but I've always
used moviemaker and now that live movie
makers out I'm kind of starting to use
that um I'm still not a hundred percent
it's actually a pretty good
definitely very full-featured I'm still
learning on it's um you know it's pretty
good from what I can see anyway
paint you know I like to use GIMP and
everything which I should don't have on
here and now but I always like to use
GIMP but paint I've always used paint I
mean since I mean windows 98 I've always
used paint so paints just kind of a
handy thing it's actually pretty useful
in Windows 7 ok so we come over here and
i'm using camstudio which is what I'm
using to record my screen right now
definitely pretty cool program you see
it's kind of messed up a little bit but
yeah next this is a pretty cool program
called exam basically this is where I
can use code and mock up websites on my
computer without actually having to do
anything
I won't go ahead and show it everything
but it's definitely a pretty cool
program or you guys can run everything I
want just right on my computer and
basically make it a full website for
school next is utorrent um I don't like
utorrent I very rarely use this just
torrents usually just mess up for me I
don't know why I was messing with it
this morning but just kind of keep it on
my dog everyone smile it's handy for an
occasional download of Linux of course
you know next we have OpenOffice I don't
have word and I've always on almost all
my computers I have OpenOffice running
OpenOffice I love it it's a little slow
but definitely great I you know I really
like it you know it definitely it's free
so it's cool
next we have WordPad which I rarely use
it's kind of I used occasionally it's
it's better in Windows 7 it looks nice
I'll use it to type something up real
quick but usually I use OpenOffice for
that it's actually I'm not sure what's
on here but lastly I have notepad
notepad is just something really simple
I used just for coding I know it's
pretty old school but I just you know
I need to just open up something and
code it real quick unless you can see
that my magnifier which is what I'm
running right now but that's actually
not on my dock but anyway guys that was
just a quick video just kinda I always
see all these what's on your dog so like
hey you know what I've got one two seven
I can do that now anyway guys let's just
bet it yeah thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
