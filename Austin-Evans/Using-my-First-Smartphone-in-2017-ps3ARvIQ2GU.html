here with my very first smartphone so
back in 2011 when I was rocking some
seriously sweet here I picked up one of
these guys for 50 bucks
and today it's time to give it another
shot so this is the palm pixi plus now I
was able to find one of these brand new
in the box and since I didn't have my
original one anymore I couldn't resist
as you can see smartphones have changed
just a little bit since then yo I
believe it not held one of these in like
five years
it's so tiny so this came out in 2010
and it's totally been sitting in the box
since then so let us enjoy
dudas pinky back I can't believe how
tiny it is so back in 2010 this was a
little bit smaller than most smartphones
but compared to today I mean look at
next to a galaxy s 8 and is absolutely
tiny even though it's small it actually
has pretty decent hardware so something
I really appreciate is the soft touch
rubber back it still feels good even
today but there are definitely some
weird quirks here for example the power
button is sort of tucked away on the
corner the actual microUSB charging is
underneath this flap on the side there's
definitely some weirdness you have to
remember this is sort of like the Wild
West of smartphone days this is just a
few years after the iPhone first came
out Android was brand new and this was
palms firs big foray into a more modern
smartphone with weather less white it
has battery this is legitimately been
staying in a box for probably seven
years now and yet it just fired right
back up no I'm getting like flashbacks
right now this is so cool I actually
really loved this phone it wasn't just
because it was my first smartphone it
was legitimately something pretty cool
back in the day obviously smart phones
have come a long way there's no doubt
that a new smartphone is much much
superior to this but there's definitely
some things they were not so bad back in
the day getting worse in only does it
work it's like already up and running
what 50 percent battery it even has the
date correct what it literally just
activated to just on I like the first
food was this thing actually brand new
so the downside of buying a new webOS
device today is it
the actual service to activate them or
off so for example if you try to turn on
like the app catalog or something
there's no way that's going to connect
because well it's not even on anymore
which is really weird this is already
activated Oh No the YouTube app doesn't
work come and I want to see what I can
actually still do with this so the first
thing is the keyboard is so much tiny
man it brings back memories though I
actually used to be kind of decent with
this keyboard oh that is an old YouTube
layout it works though actually
something kind of cool is the
responsiveness isn't bad I mean sure
it's not the smoothest and quickest
device in the world but one of the cool
things about webOS was it didn't
multitasking really well so I swipe up I
can go through my open apps I can just
swipe it away you can also use it as a
home button if you want but it's not bad
of course I mean inside this guy you're
talking about a single course 600
megahertz processor basically no memory
eight gigs of storage I mean this is not
a powerful phone to begin with but it's
actually reasonably smooth and that was
one of the cool things about whether
less so the problem is is that basically
all the apps are so old and have not
been updated in some years that a lot of
the stuff is I should not going to work
which is that sucks even though it might
not have apps it still does have a
perfectly functional web browser so can
I get on Twitter with this do it do it
do it do it
Oh 404 then I was so excited to finally
use the palm pixi plus again and
literally nothing works it's almost like
people don't want to support an ancient
phone with software that no one's
updates it's like 2011 I just give up
right now nothing works you have to rub
it in can I get it okay
this is a bad idea palm pixi plus is not
as functional opponent I hoped it would
be oh you know it does work though oh it
does work you know it does work camera
works there we go there we got ah but
okay that was a picture boy that's um
that's a picture so um
take a look an old-school selfie oh yeah
Joey took it though she's not that okay
well why shouldn't do man I'll just I'll
just I'll just uh yeah all right
now you've got that sick sick palm pixi
video yeah anything say now Ken you want
treat this huh
what treat this worker you say that was
uncalled for
I would like to officially and sincerely
apologize to Kimberly doe for the rude
manner in which I just treated him Kent
oh okay I see I see this video took a
hard turn we're having a great time look
how awesome the palm pixi plus is it's
my first smartphone now I'm like bitter
and hating life
Ken's like ready to leave the videos
probably never going to be finished but
if you want to make your own bad
decisions I have two of these because
I'm an idiot and thought that the phone
was going to be cool so if you want to
win your own palm pixi plus leave a
comment below subscribe to the channel
who knows you two might be the proud
owner of a very mildly functioning
smartphone from 2010 if that's a sales
pitch to subscribe to the channel I am
afraid to say I don't really know how to
do it any better than that so subscribe
to the channel stay tuned videos that
are not terrible coming soon hopefully
it can lets me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
