game boys
in 1989 Nintendo released the original
Gameboy making this the 25th anniversary
while everyone games on their
smartphones today it's easy to forget
just how awesome it was to be able to
play games on the go back in 1989 I'll
never forget the countless hours I spent
playing Pokemon and sneaking my gameboy
into school
the Gameboy really was something special
so while Nintendo made their last game
void in 2005 I want to see how close I
could get to making my own ultimate
Gameboy
so this is about as close as it gets to
a modern-day game board this is the
Nintendo 2ds and transparent crystal
blue so when I was a kid Nintendo used
to make a lot of transparent game boys
there's the Gameboy pocket the Game Boy
Advance they're really cool because they
showed off a lot of the cool internals
of the game boys
well this 2d s is kind of throwback to
that and in fact it came out in the same
day as the new pokemon ruby and sapphire
remakes which is why there's a red and
blue one of these so inside the box you
get a bunch of paperwork and the
operations manual all right this
actually seems a bit much I'm sorry how
many pages of this 77 pages so if you
need to spend 77 pages on talking about
your 2d s good luck yes this is the same
charger from the DSi 3d s3s XL and the
2d s now we get to the fun part
there we go that totally didn't take
three takes to do so this is the 2d s so
first of all that blue looks awesome Wow
you can see all the the SD card slot you
see the battery wow that's actually
really cool get the stylus which I just
mentioned that one of the things I like
about the 2-d is more than three DS the
stylus is a normal spot right here and
it's not some extendable thing on the
top which is complete garbage so
actually it comes with an SD card as
well see what it what you have in here a
four gigabyte SD card that's actually
not bad
I think the 3ds has a two gigabyte so
one of the things I've always liked
about the two DS is that actually feels
more comfortable in the hands of the 3ds
so even though it's the cheaper models -
one for kids where it doesn't have the
screens that you know fold in and get
broken but the grip is actually a lot
more comfortable you have normal adult
sized hands it feels a little bit big
definitely bigger than like an Xbox
controller or something but it has that
right kind of heft in that kind of feel
to it where I all my fingers and all my
fingers because I have a lot of them one
major difference between this and the
3ds is the flat design so well yes it
will kind of fit in your pocket you
really don't want to be walking around
with this thing in your pants all day
even though this is the 2ds it still
plays 3ds games so it's only really
lacking the 3d capability which to be
totally honest really isn't a major
problem so the 3d screen on the 3ds
really was never that great to begin
with and most of the games that use 3d
really didn't do it all that well so
they all work just fine here on the 2d s
games like smash or a perfect example of
why it still makes sense to have a
handheld console there's really no
substitute for having decent physical
controls and while yeah the circle pad
on the 2d S is a little bit mushy it
still miles ahead of anything you'd be
able to get on a touchscreen on top of
that the gameplay is awesome this feels
just like brawler melee with a smooth 60
frames per second and surprisingly
decent graphics considering that this is
a well it's a 2 DS and with games like
Pokemon alpha sapphire which originally
launched in the Game Boy Advance
it's easy to forget just how far we've
come since the days of the Game Boy so
back in the day we didn't have any kind
of backlit screens so you're always
walking around trying to find a little
bit of light to be able to play the
games and these things tour through
batteries I remember having to go get
another pack of double-a batteries like
once a month for this thing and while is
weird to still be using physical games
in 2014 it's nice to have the option to
share it with a friend or go trade in a
Gamestop and you do have a digital
download option so it's not really the
best so it definitely doesn't match up
with something like the App Store or the
Google Play Store but it is an option if
you want to go download only you can
also play DS games on the 2d s so
chamber ways of doing this
first of all by default it will just
play with them being slightly up scaled
and everything works just fine however
everything's just a little bit blurry so
you can also start the game by holding
start and select at the same time and
that will run them in a slightly smaller
window however will be pixel to pixel
exactly like playing on a normal TS and
of course it's not the ultimate Gameboy
intel can play actual gameboy games
inside the eShop you'll find quite a few
retro games including a lot for the NES
as well as some for the Game Boy and
even the gang gear of course the 2d s
has no problem playing a gameboy color
game and while a lot of these you can't
play with emulators there's definitely
something to be said about having the
physical controls plus you know that
music just never gets old for $100 the
2d s is pretty impressive not only does
it look the part but it'll play original
Game Boy games as well as a lot of the
newer stuff even better than the 3ds so
what do you guys think is the 2d s worth
it definitely be sure to let me know in
the comments below as for me I think
I'll stick with the real thing so let's
take a look ahh
