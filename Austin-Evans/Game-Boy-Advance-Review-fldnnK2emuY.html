review of the Game Boy Advance now of
course the Game Boy Advance was the
third generation Game Boy and indeed the
last generation Game Boy and it really
did bring a lot of new things to the
table
it's especially considering when you put
it in side by side with a gameboy color
I mean the difference is a really
apparent Nintendo changed a lot of stuff
a lot was really good some was for the
bed okay so let's go ahead and begin
with the tour around the console on so
starting from the beginning you will see
it actually does have that wide display
near the display while by today's
standards isn't that great back then it
was really pretty impressive especially
considering you know the gameboy color
screen etc etc and of course there were
a few downsides to this but I will get
to that a little bit later
um so over here on the right you do have
the standard a and B button you have a
speaker which was so-so
over here you do have this standard
Nintendo d-pad as well as a kind of
small start and select button I'm
flipping it over on the bottom here you
will see an on/off switch you will see
the headphones as well as the little
thing for the volume I now along the
side extra seat had these little grips
little grey grips I mean I actually was
kind of useful as you know when you're
holding the gameboy advance they give
you a little bit more grip and of course
mostly it was just for the looks but not
too bad either way so we go ahead and
flip it over here and you will see that
actually okay this way and you will see
that it's a you have two extra buttons
from previous Game Boy advances so you
have an Ellen R button both of which are
very nice very comfortable you know
you're playing it you know very very
nice to use I also did have a couple of
places for accessories and you do have a
link cable spot one of the best features
of the Game Boy Advance
absolutely is the game library you know
it's very very rare to see a handheld
console even the game boys that have so
many excellent excellent games on it and
of course the Game Boy Advance which is
really considered to be the pinnacle of
you know sprite based game play you know
where instead of having 3d models you
know the great 2d sprites and the Game
Boy Advance was an absolute powerhouse
now I mean as far as today you know
centering you know comparing against
modern consoles it's not that great
however you know it's probably close to
the Super Nintendo I would say but you
know it was unplanned run a lot of
really really nice-looking sprite based
games I'm so what I mean by this or
several games but I just pull out one
right here I'm you know pokemon ruby
that was a great franchise on the
Gameboy dance I'm another one that I
don't really think gets enough credit
was actually Harry Potter and the Goblet
of Fire um you know a lot of the movie
Bane games get a lot of flack but I
should this one was really quite good
and actually some of the best graphics
I've ever seen on the Game Boy dance
indeed though the Game Boy Advance
library was not limited to just Game Boy
dance titles of course as it is a Game
Boy it does feature full backwards
compatibility with previous games
um so for example you want to take a
Game Boy Color game and indeed a game
original Game Boy game you go ahead and
slide it right in now of course it does
stick up a fair bit however no big deal
you can't go ahead and play them however
there were two major downsides of the
original Game Boy Advance the first
which absolutely has to be that screen
and of course before I was talking I do
like the screen quite a bit you know
it's it's pretty clear the resolution is
pretty nice for a you know a console of
this era however through is a major
major downside and that was the fact
that it does not support any sort of
backlight now this is something we take
for granted today you know every cell
phone every game console everything has
a backlit screen however this gameboy
advance was the last Gameboy to not ship
with a full lit screen basically if
you've never applied an older Gameboy
basically what this means is that you
really can't play in the dark you really
need to be in well-lit areas in fact you
know outsides about the best place to
play your Gameboy especially the Game
Boy Advance that was a major major issue
really did a limit where you could play
the game with dance on the second thing
was it takes batteries I'm so go ahead
and just flip it over here and in fact
you can see mine's a little bit torn up
here of course the battery doors break
on these Gameboy Advance is quite a bit
um but as you can see here it does take
double-a batteries and really that's
that's you know that was okay for the
previous game boys
I'm however really is very good really
really annoying I mean the
life is not too bad on the Gameboy
Advance but it really did kind of take
away from you know how long you play it
you always have to buy new double-a
batteries so those are the two major
issues with the Gameboy Advance
however you know really Nintendo did fix
them with its predecessor with its
successor rather the Gameboy Advance SP
however I will get into that in a later
review so overall it looks when some up
the Gameboy Advance is a really really
great console I mean it's nice
comfortable to hold you know if you've
ever held a PSP it feels like kind of a
smaller version of that you know you do
have your very very comfortable L on our
buttons you know you have your a and B
button all the kinds of stuff that you
would expect to see in a gameboy is here
the Gameboy Advance is very very solid
however I really can't recommend to go
ahead and if you really want to go and
play through a lot of the Game Boy
Advance games I really have to recommend
to go ahead and pick up a Game Boy
Advance SP you know it's pretty does
practically everything the Game Boy
Advance does only that actually does
have a smaller design with the flip you
know it has an actual backlit screen
rechargeable batteries I mean the
Gameboy Advance SP is everything the
Game Boy Advance is plus some however if
you aren't interested in getting a Game
Boy Advance perhaps you just want to
start getting into them because the Game
Boy Advance is generally cost about half
as much as the SP variety I know you
will it won't be disappointed I mean if
you don't mind eating through some
batteries just like a standard Game Boy
and you know having to play in a
well-lit area you will not be
disappointed the Game Boy advances these
days are really quite cheap and you know
there are so many great games it's
really hard not to pass up so anyway
guys that's it for my review of the
original Game Boy Advance really saw a
console just pretty much overshadowed by
the SP so anyway guys thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
