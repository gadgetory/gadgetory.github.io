the brand new YouTube interface so I got
my hands on a little bit early and
definitely feel like there's a lot of
awesome stuff here so let's just go
ahead and jump straight on into it so
the first thing you'll notice is that it
is very new and very different looking
so if you replaced the white background
with the kind of grayish I think it
looks nice and on top of that of course
there's lots of dark you know blacks and
blues and stuff which gets a little bit
more color definitely looks more like a
site that was designed in 2011 as
opposed to the previous version so let's
go ahead and start with this left
sidebar so of course you have your
channel you can see your videos your
likes your history all that kind of
stuff but on top of that you now get
easy access to your subscriptions so up
top here for example if I want to see
who exactly who's been linking videos on
google+ all the people i follow i can
take a look at that you can also do this
on facebook it's not currently working
from you right now but i'm sure by the
time this starts rolling out to everyone
at will and hopefully they add a little
twitter at functionality as well beyond
that if we want to extend this we can
take a look at everyone that we are
subscribed to and of course we want to
take a look at some of them for example
we can just tap on them and see all of
the videos that they have uploaded which
i think is pretty helpful moving on
there is also a from YouTube section
which allows you to pick out a very
similar home page that you are probably
used to right now so this goes over is
some of the most popular videos of the
day so just like always you can see you
know the most popular videos and they'll
all pop up as well as you can see
exactly how many sites have embedded
them which is kind of neat however one
of my favorite bits is the suggested
channels now what this is all about and
I believe this whole really redesign is
all about really getting you more
channels to find more videos and all
that kind of stuff so we can take a look
at some of the suggested channels for me
so for example we can just take a look
at machinima by clicking on that it will
pull up all the videos that they have
uploaded so for example they favorited
you know uploaded all that kind of stuff
and if we like we can feel free to just
subscribe straight from here in addition
there's also a new add channels button
so what this allows you to do is
basically just like before get even more
content from different people so here's
a bunch of channels that recommends that
I subscribe to so we just take a look
for example here we click on preview you
I actually play the video but you can
see here gives a little information we
can subscribe see how many weekly videos
as well as how many subscribers that the
channel has and in the middle without
doing anything it will automatically
give you a subscriptions page which is
similar to what we have with activity
right now so what this does is it gives
Neverending thing of all of the videos
that your friends as well as the people
who you subscribe to on YouTube have so
for example these are people that have
uploaded videos or friends have liked
favorited etc etc now well this is not
bad in theory one major problem is is
that if you have any more than a dozen
or so friends this gets very very
complicated very fast for example those
people who liked and favorited all kinds
of stuff if you want you can simply
click on the manage tab and it will take
you over to your normal subscription
page where you can go ahead and take a
look at all your videos if it definitely
can be a little bit annoying all right
so enough of this let's go ahead and go
over the final new thing which is going
to be recommended videos very simple
very very straightforward it now shows a
lot of recommended videos that it thinks
you might be interested in some of them
are some of them aren't but of course
you're bored and why spend some time on
YouTube they are doing their best to
keep you on the site there are also
brand new channel pages as well now this
is actually opt-in so anyone can try
this out now i have a link in the
description of this video and it is very
similar to the cosmic pan to like lay
out so right here you have your featured
video and of course you can change it to
be whatever video you like over here we
have some links so you can add links to
your various sites your Twitter your
Facebook all that kind of stuff just a
little bit information about the channel
you can take a look at featured
playlists as well as other featured
channels for example your friends you
might want to get some us exposure to
lastly we have the new video watch page
this is largely the same we can still go
ahead and pick out in more videos
subscribe all that kind of stuff but in
addition there's also the new player
which allows you to change the size of
the player you can go full screen or you
can go back to large player or these
small players so these a little bit
easier way to go ahead and toggle the
different settings as well as of course
you can change the resolution of the
video from here anyway that's going to
be about it if you enjoyed this video
and you're interested in more videos
like this or indeed on anything
technology-related definitely sure to
subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
