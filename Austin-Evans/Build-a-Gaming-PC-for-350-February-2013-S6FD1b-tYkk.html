a PC bill for $350 so this is a great
entry level system for those of you guys
who are new to PC gaming maybe you're
coming from a console or something but
this is a very good starting point on
top of that this is also a very
upgradable PC so as is it's a very solid
computer but if you would like to
upgrade with SSDs graphics cards hard
drives all that kind of stuff it makes
it very very simple and pretty cheap to
do it as well to kick the build off
going to be using an AMD a10 5800 k APU
now apu is what AMD calls this basically
it is a cpu as well as a GPU built into
one thing so basically the way you can
think of it is instead of having to
spend an extra hundred two hundred
dollars on a graphics card you're
getting was basically a $50 graphics
card built in for free this is a quad
core processor clocked at 3.8 gigahertz
however thanks to the fact that it's
unlocked you can very easily overclock
it so all you need to do is go into the
BIOS and select the OC Genie button this
will automatically overclock it to 4.2
gigahertz which is a very nice game the
5800 K also has some pretty decent
graphics built in so even demanding
games like Battlefield 3 as well as far
cry 3 are both totally playable at 720p
and Skyrim is actually playable at 1080p
as long as you turn these things down to
low now while this might sound super
impressive if you have a really powerful
gaming PC if you're coming from a
console this is going to be a good step
up now on top of that pretty much any
other games it's going to be older than
battlefield 3 or Far Cry 3 is again both
of these games are some of the best
looking games and some of the most
demanding and intensive games out there
so for example Team Fortress 2 portal 2
that kind of thing you're going to run
with absolutely no problems with very
nice high settings so considering that
you get all this for about $125 the 1850
hundred K is going to be a great choice
for our build for a motherboard we're
going to be using an NS I FM to a 75 ma
II 35 so while I pretend that I didn't
actually ruin that take like 50 times in
a row trying to remember that long name
this is actually a very good board if
you can you know remember the name of
the board which I apparently can't so
one of the cool things about this that
you get a lot of features that you
usually do not get with budget builds so
for example you get USB 3.0 support
which is very nice but even more
important than that at least for me is
the fact that you have six SATA 3 ports
like I said earlier thanks to that a 75
chipset you have full access to
overclocking your CPU as well as your
GPU and on top of that if you ever want
to you can very easily add a graphics
card to the system which will allow you
to upgrade
even farther so between SSD and adding
something like a Radeon 7750 or 7850 or
something like that you can very very
very easily increase the performance of
the system for not a whole lot of extra
money so overall this motherboard is a
great deal for the system for about 60
bucks for memory we're going to be using
a gigabytes of Samsung ddr3 RAM now the
big fan of this stuff I use it most of
my builds as it's a very good performer
a good overclocker it's also a little
bit smaller than most memory which
allows you to fit some heat sinks that
you otherwise might not be able to fit
onto your motherboard Ram is especially
important for an AP based system like
this so this is not an area where you
want to skimp out and in fact if you
would like you can actually overclock
this memory some to get some better
performance now one thing I will mention
is that this actually memory has been
fluctuating in price a lot lately
so what I will do is add an additional
link to another different kind of memory
in the description so if it's more
expensive like for example this memory
right now is closer to $60 where it's
usually around 35 to 45 so I will have
two links in the description both are
fantastic memory and pretty much
whichever one you can get for cheapest I
would recommend going for that for a
hard drive going to be using a 500
gigabyte Western Digital caviar blue now
I use these things all the time in my
builds as not as a reliable but they're
also fairly speedy and give you plenty
of space for a pretty reasonable price
so with 500 gigabytes of capacity you've
got play your room for your games
pictures music media all that kind of
fun stuff and on top of that since it is
a 7200 rpm Drive you get some pretty
decent speeds of course I do recommend
that when you do get the money it's a
good idea to go with an SSD and again
I'll add a link to a good SSD in the
description as well as will pretty much
everything else I talked about but for
the time being for only $50 you really
can't beat this for a case we're going
to be using an NZXT source 210 now this
is a favorite of mine as for a budget
build like this you really can't ask for
a whole lot more it's not really flimsy
so it's going to be fairly well built
it's not going to be all that difficult
to work in thanks to the fact that it's
an ATX sized case and on top of that you
have plenty room for lots of expansion
in the future all for about 40 bucks for
a power supply we're going to be using a
430 watt corsair CX 430 this is another
one of those parts that i love to
recommend to my budget builds this is
going to give you some good reliability
good performance and a good price which
is a good combo so for starters it's an
80 plus bronze certified power supply
which means it's going to be very
efficient it's going to be a little bit
higher quality than what a lot of the
other kind of power supplies you'll find
at this price
top of that with 430 watts of capacity
this is going to be more than enough for
the build as is and it can even handle a
graphics card when you decide to upgrade
in the future so all this for about 40
bucks makes this a definite buy for an
operating system you have the choice
between Windows 7 and Windows 8 so I'm
going to leave this one entirely up to
you guys whichever one you want to use
is totally fine so Windows 7 is more of
the safe choice it's been around for
longer
however Windows 8 is a little bit newer
well obviously it's newer but it also
does tend to run a little bit quicker
especially when you're booting and on
top of that as long as you can ignore
all the Metro stuff I just use it like
typical Windows it's actually very quick
and very snappy so this wouldn't no
matter which one you pick is going to
add about $100 to the system cost so
there you have it an awesome $350 gaming
PC so since prices are constantly
changing I'll have links to everything I
mentioned in the description of this
video as well as some additional
upgrades so for example if you guys want
to add an SSD to your build or you want
to add a DVD drive or a more powerful
graphic card whatever you guys want to
do I'll have some additional links in
the description we should work just fine
for this build if you guys are
interested in more feel free to check
out some of my other recent builds
including the $600 gaming PC if you
enjoyed this video definitely be sure to
leave it a thumbs up and if you're
interested in more videos like this be
sure to subscribe anyway guys I will
catch you next time
