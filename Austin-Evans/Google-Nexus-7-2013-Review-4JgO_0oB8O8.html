here with the review of the brand new
2013 Google Nexus 7 the first Nexus 7
was an awesome Android tablet period
especially considering the $200 price
the 2013 model brings some very welcome
improvements but how does it stack up
one of the biggest changes with the new
Nexus 7 is in the size it's slightly
taller with big bezels top and bottom
but it's quite a bit thinner and lighter
which makes a big difference I'm still
not convinced that the smaller 7-inch
screen size is better than the slightly
bigger iPad Mini but there's no doubt
that the new Nexus 7 is a lot more
portable the back is covered in a soft
touch rubber which has a nice feel in
the hand and new is a 5 megapixel rear
facing camera it's a camera on a tablet
so don't expect much but for snapping a
quick shot or a bit of video it's just
fine one of my biggest complaints about
the original was the poor audio quality
however the new Nexus 7 is rocking
stereo speakers this time a Susan Google
definitely spent a lot on improving the
screen quality and it makes a big
difference it's now a 1920 by 1200 IPS
display and the quality is excellent
text and images are super sharp and the
colors are awesome viewing angles are
also top-notch and it works very nicely
for watching Full 1080p video when you
compare it to the low resolution iPad
Mini screen the Nexus 7 looks miles
better as the Nexus tablet on board
we're looking at pure Android 4.3 this
latest version of Android doesn't bring
too many improvements beyond trim
support to help keep the tablet running
smoothly but it's still a good
experience Android for tablets has
improved a lot in the last year with
many more apps being optimized for the
bigger tablet screens the quality of
mini apps doesn't quite match up to the
excellent iPad app selection however for
the most part there's really not much to
complain about inside you'll find a
quad-core 1.5 gigahertz Snapdragon s4
pro 2 gigabytes of RAM and either 16 or
32 gigabytes of storage
along with optional LTE connectivity
it's absolutely one of the quickest
Android devices I've ever used with
super smooth animations most everywhere
you can occasionally find hints of lag
here and there but overall it's a very
fast and responsive device
battery life is also solid I was able to
get two days of moderate use on a charge
which matches up with the last model
impressively it eats up almost no
battery while on standby the new Nexus 7
is one of the best tablets period right
now the screen performance build and
especially the price are all absolutely
nailed and even though it does lose a
couple things compared to the iPad Mini
mostly that awesome metal build as well
as the little bit bigger screen overall
if you're interested in getting a new
tablet the Nexus 7 is absolutely worth a
look so what do you guys think about the
new Nexus 7 is this something you would
pick up are you waiting to maybe you see
what the new iPad Mini is going to be
all about definitely be sure to let me
