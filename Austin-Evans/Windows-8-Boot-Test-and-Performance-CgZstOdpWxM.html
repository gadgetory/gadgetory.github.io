the performance in Windows 8 so I have
installed it here on my older gateway
laptop so some of the specs on this it
does have a dual-core Athlon processor
clocked at about 2 gigahertz or so it
has had 4 gigabytes of RAM the HD Radeon
3200 graphics and the 320 card drive
which is spinning at 5400 rpm so this is
a couple years laptops a couple years
old originally came with Vista rated it
to 7 and of course now it's running
Windows 8 so going give you guys kind of
a little demo of what the performance
would be on something that's not you
know particularly high-end so for one
let's go ahead and try our booting up so
we'll come down here instead of logging
in and let's go ahead and restart so
we'll go ahead and let it shut off now
one thing is in the power button
automatically for a laptop it will try
to put the laptop to sleep which Jim
that's one thing but anyway so it's
going to be shutting off and just one
second there we go
so this is the post screen it has
nothing to do with that but from right
now on it's all Windows 8 now this one
does currently run Windows 7 of course I
decide to replace that with Windows 8 I
want to have a system there's gonna be
dedicated to it but hopefully you guys
get a good idea of the kind of the
performance here yeah and this is a kind
of a slower hard drive and all that kind
of stuff on an SSD and all that kind of
stuff will be faster but she doesn't see
here I think it's about done and mmm
please wait yes so we're almost done
here and you know I can't really say
that it is a huge improvement over
Windows 7 I'd say maybe maybe 5 10
seconds still bit shorter but certainly
not bad so let's go ahead and unlock it
and see your everything is nice and
fluid unloads I should a little little
problem there but not a big deal
let's punch in my password alright so
once you do this does take one more
second just kind of like when you log in
on Windows 7 it does take a second to
boot up but as you guys can see here
we're pretty much done
so we can scroll with the mouse wheel
and it is very smooth so guys had any
you know problems you were afraid that
was not gonna be very smooth you really
don't need to be worried so let's go and
take a look at a couple things so for
example let's take a look the control
panel I'll open up and you can see here
no real problems at all
we do
scrolling so I'm game using the mouse
wheel and it's got a little bit of a
kinetic scrolling so very much you know
I like on well I'll guess on OS 10 lion
as well as on lots of smartphones and
stuff you know you scroll a little bit
and it kind of keeps going so really
quite nice let's go ahead and back up
and find something else to get into to
give you guys a good idea actually let's
switch over to the normal desktop and
back yes and see here it's a pretty
smooth transition I got to say there's
not a whole lot I could be complaining
about hard to tell bats it's pretty
close to sixty frames per second and
again - I don't know how well it looks
line the camera but to my eye it looks
pretty much as smooth as it can get so
let's go ahead and open up the
newsreader again she's going to open a
couple of applications up and once we
have this up there you know it's loading
not entirely sure if - can't use the
Wi-Fi right now but I mean alt tab again
we also hit dips and we'll alt tab now
no that's ctrl tab
home in the dark here trying to trying
to see here so of course the alt tab
works just fine windows tab no longer
has the error interface but just kind of
slide between the apps like this I've
been like guys it's gonna be about it
for my little performance demo of
Windows 8 running on a kind of older not
particularly powerful laptop if you guys
enjoyed the video definitely be sure to
leave it a thumbs up and if you're
