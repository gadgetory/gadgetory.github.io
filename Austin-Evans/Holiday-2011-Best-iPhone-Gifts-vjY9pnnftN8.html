with a holiday gift guide so it's about
the holiday seasons time why lots of
people want to get gifts and presents
and all that kind of stuff so I'm going
to do is make a little series for you
guys and go over some different devices
and some different things that you might
want to get as gifts for yourself or for
someone else to kick it off but then
take a look at some stuff for the iphone
you guys are not familiar this phone
called the iphone it's kind of a big
deal and you may or may not know
somebody who has one so it's glad just
go over some cool gifts for people who
have iphones the first thing is a case
especially if you have an iPhone 4 or 4s
a case is really really essential they
have a glass back as well as of course a
glass front and it's really easy one
drop on the concrete or something can
shatter it and then you've got a very
very expensive paperweight however there
are a lot of really good cases on the
market that won't break the bank and
actually keep the iphone nice and
protected my current favorite is the
switcheasy eclipse now this is a case I
just got recently and I've been
absolutely in love with you guys want
you can take a look at my review but the
short of it is it's a fantastic case
comes with lots cool accessories screen
shields a stand all kinds of stuff it
looks nice it protects well it's only 20
bucks so you know someone who has an
iphone 4 or an iphone 4s the switcheasy
eclipse is a fantastic way to go of
course one of the really cool things
about having an iphone 4 and iphone 4s
is the camera the cameras on these are
really not half bad you know someone
who's interested in photography or video
making or anything like that a great
gift would be the glyph the glyph is a
tripod mount for the iphone 4 as well as
the iphone 4s what allows you to do is
simply slide your iphone into the glyph
and then you can screw it on to any
standard tripod this is a great if you
want use your iphone photography of
course if you want to do some nice video
you don't have to have it all shaky it's
going to be great for that too and on
top of all that you can also you double
it as a stand so it's a really nice
all-purpose thing and it's a great gift
for about 20 bucks something that drives
me crazy is when I see someone with an
iphone listening to music on the in your
head buds yeah sure they would produce
something that's vaguely resembles music
but if you want to get something that's
much much better consider buying them a
nice pair of headphones such as the
audio technica ath in 30s these are
going to sound way way better than any
kind of bundled headphones going to get
with pretty much anything especially the
apple ones and on top of that they're
also going to have some awesome build
quality not sure you're not gonna be
able to fold them up
in your pocket the audio quality i think
really overcomes that and for about 50
bucks depending on where you get them
and no sales anything like that there's
some awesome headphones and of course
since we're talking about iphones we
can't go without talking about apps
there's a really cool thing with itunes
that you can actually gift apps to
people so even though it might be a
dollar here two dollars here or whatever
they make nice little stocking stuffers
to gift in that it's really easy all you
need to do is find whatever appens you
want to send and then scroll down and
you'll find an option to get this app
you can do it on iphone ipod touch ipad
as well as on itunes on your computer
then all you need to do is simply know
the person who you want to send the app
know what their Apple ID is usually it's
their email address and you can just
simply send a nap really simple really
easily as far as great apps to send one
of my favorites is jetpack joyride this
is a fun little game that allows you to
fly along you collect coins and on the
whole of it it's pretty short you can
usually play through it and about a
minute or two and then you can just
restart and try to get the best I've
score another really fun game is e boy
fix pics it's a game which allows you
it's kind of like a puzzle game but it
uses the accelerometer and your iPhone
to kind of line up all the different
pieces really awesome pixel art style I
love the game if you want to really get
somebody something that kind of wow
people not just amazing graphics but
just kind of how cool it is I definitely
check out eboy fix pics and of course
when all else fails you can just give
them an iTunes gift card please come in
all kinds of denominations everything
from 50 to like a hundred dollars I
think and you can just simply give it to
him and they can buy some music they can
buy movies apps or whatever else they
feel like and the last and probably most
important thing that you can give
anybody is how to jailbreak their device
of course jailbreaking is impossibly
difficult to do on your own and you
definitely need some awesome YouTube
tutorials to do it and there's this guy
I know called Duncan 33 303 on YouTube
and there's a button to subscribe up
there if you guys are interested who
make some really good jailbreak
tutorials all the time so you know if
you want to you know give somebody an

gonna plug myself getting married anyway

holiday gift guide for the iphone I'll
