the ultimate playstation comparison and
of course how else could we begin but
with the original playstation 1 in 1994
the world got this the original
playstation and what's interesting is is
that this actually almost didn't even
happened originally sony was developing
the playstation as they'd add on for the
Super Nintendo
but after Nintendo bailed on the deal
that figured hey we've already put the
work in we might as well make our own
game console and thus the original
playstation was born it's hard to
overstate just how good of an idea that
was the playstation was the very first
game console to ever hit 100 million
sales and after being sold for ten years
the games continued to come out for the
PlayStation all the way up until 2006
you know when the PlayStation 3 came out
now I have a special attachment to the
PlayStation as this was my very first
game console however it actually wasn't
the only version they also released this
the ps1 which was a much much smaller
version of the console so of course that
is the legendary PlayStation boot up
screen ah it's brings me right back so
this is Gran Turismo 2 and as far as
PlayStation 1 games I definitely spent
the most time with this one one of the
cool things about Gran Turismo and
indeed the PlayStation 1 in general was
the idea that this is one of the very
first fully 3d capable consoles look at
these car models I mean sure they might
not look incredibly detailed by today's
standards but for back in the 90s this
was pretty solid so one of the cool
things about this was that it was
actually pretty realistic I mean sure
the resolution is really low you could
see mountains and everything popping in
just in the background but when you
consider that the audio was actually
pretty accurate to what the car sounded
like and that this was a properly
performing game I mean there at real
physics yeah see you can see I pull into
the shadows my car gets darker I mean
this was seriously cutting-edge back in
the 90s funny the resolution is so
laughably low right now and yet it
doesn't really matter that much I mean
of course the cars a little blocky it's
kind of hard to see but you get the idea
and look at this I mean next we have
another retro classic and I say retro
cuz it's what I play when I was a kid
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone
this is back when you actually could get
a decent video game based on a movie
unlike today where they pretty much
don't even do it anymore
so something to keep in mind here is
that this game came out on the tail end
of the Playstations lifecycle and
because of that it is one of the more
technically advanced titles so while the
resolution might not be massively
upgrade over something like Gran Turismo
it actually does look pretty nice
something else cool about this is that I
am getting full voice acting I forgot
that this game uh she had that looking
for that owl of yours how careless of
you to leave it lying about but again
this is one of the major advantages of
using a CD you actually do have plenty
of space for things like actual audio
fast forward to 2008 season 2 now this
still holds the record for the
best-selling game console of all time
the next closest is the Nintendo DS but
at 155 million units nothing touches the
ps2 one of the main reasons why the ps2
is so successful is actually a little
bit of a weird one this at the time was
the cheapest DVD player that you can get
your hands on and while DVD was kind of
a big deal back in 2000 the ps2 really
pushed a lot of tech forward so not only
did a support online play as the very
first PlayStation to do so but also it
allow you to install a hard drive you
can even output 1080i signals from the
sky on certain games remind you that
with stuff like Gran Turismo 4 but
considering that the PlayStation 2 was
available at a time where high def TVs
really weren't even a thing it
definitely pushed the envelope there was
one big difference with the ps2 compared
to the ps1 it was much much larger
however it didn't take long for
something to fix that by releasing the
ps2 slim now this actually pretty much
took all the same features and took it
into a much much smaller form factor
while including things like the Ethernet
jack which used to need an actual
adapter on this guy well what's
important to remember is that both the
ps2 as well as the ps2 slim were fully
backwards compatible now these days a
little bit hit or miss but back in 2000
this is pretty much unheard of no real
game console would ever be able to play
the previous generation of games however
Nellie could you put a ps1 game into
these guys but it also fully supported
not only the controllers but also even
the memory cards for the ps2 we have
Gran Turismo 3
immediately you can tell that while the
menus are even weirder than they were on
the PlayStation 1 the graphics are
seriously improved not only are we
getting a higher resolution especially
when you look at the car model and the
lighting there's a big big jump
you also see obviously
the track got a huge graphical update
but the jump between ps1 and ps2 is
massive I mean it's really hard to sort
of overstate that now what's funny is
the car models actually don't look
wildly different I think a lot of it is
just the idea that because you have so
much power they pretty much overhauled
everything in the game I'll say though
the audio actually isn't as good as on
grant remote - I don't remember being
like this but the cars don't really
sound that loud I feel like the music is
cranked up way too high I could probably
change that though do that framerate is
such a huge difference I don't know what
the Gran Turismo 2 on the PlayStation 1
ran at but I want to say it's like well
below 30 frames per second a lot of
times whereas this is so much better
next we have grand theft auto vice city
now this is a game that also does I
should do a pretty good job of showing
off what the ps2 is capable of there's a
some pretty serious effects on these
headlights right now oh it's just jump
on okay it's funny to think how far a
grand theft auto is calm I mean when you
look back at something like this which
is like GTA 5 it actually I mean it
doesn't feel that different don't look
all that impressive today but the idea
that you have a full open-world game on
the PlayStation 2 is really something
the ps1 wasn't capable of I mean you
think about it grand theft auto on
PlayStation was just a top-down sort of
shooter style game whereas here we have
a fully modelled 3d world to work with
if I don't crash and I crashed ok move
on to 2006 and we have the PlayStation 3
not only was this a much much larger
console but in some ways at least in my
opinion it was a little bit of a flop
this was an incredibly expensive console
the end of the day was not successful as
a ps1 or even the ps2 a lot of that
comes down to price when the ps3 first
launched it had a base model it was a 20
gig hard drive for $500 but if you
wanted the full features and everything
included you're gonna have to pay $600
for the 60 gig version where the ps2 had
a lot of interesting new tech the
PlayStation 3 was absolutely loaded with
it now a lot of this stuff is easy to
take for granted today but the
PlayStation 3 had some really
interesting stuff including play ADP
over HDMI Wi-Fi that was built-in
Bluetooth wireless controllers that
didn't require batteries not like anyone
would still ship that today or anything
and on top of that just like the
PlayStation 2 made DVD
very very popular the PlayStation 3
almost single-handedly made blu-ray a
success which is especially impressive
when you consider that this was the
cheapest blu-ray player at the time
it likes $600 it's clear that Sony were
trying to make the most ridiculous
over-the-top console they could with the
ps3 so take things like these
slot-loading blu-ray drive it surely
cost a fortune for them to make for
things like having 4 USB ports more than
even at current ps4 and my personal
favorite is underneath this little flap
it has a series of different memory card
slots including compact flash because
you know that's what people want in a
game console unfortunately the ps3
really wasn't a huge success until the
ps3 slim came out now importantly this
was a much cheaper alternative to the
console but it did that by stripping out
a ton of features stuff like the extra
USB ports the card reader and one of the
really important things was the lack of
any kind of backwards compatibility with
ps2 games something that really only
they'll launch ps3 ever had all that
being said it's easy to see why the ps3
slim was such a huge sales success
compared to the original fad model so if
you take a look at it one of the very
first things you're going to notice is
that it's going to be a lot smaller and
because of that it's also not only going
to be more efficient which then makes it
quieter makes it take less power but
also importantly it had a lot fewer
reliability issues the original fat ps3
or I'll list for the most part better
than something like the Xbox 360 still
had his fair share of yellow light of
death issues but all of that was
absolutely second to the fact that the
ps3 slim was going to be a lot cheaper
than the og now this was by far the most
popular model however they actually did
make one more the ps3 super slam now the
issue here was just like how the slim
was not as good as the fat ps3 this was
not as good as the ps3 slim so my
biggest problem with it was this it was
just a stupid sliding door mechanism
which of course saved a lot of money but
it just feels cheap compared to the nice
slot-loading drives on the originals
something that all three models share
though is the Cell processor which was
enormously expensive to develop but did
make the PlayStation 3 the most powerful
console of its generation unfortunately
it was also the most difficult to work
with console of its generation so
especially in the early days with the
fad ps3 a lot of ps3 games just didn't
look as good as they technically
inferior
box 360 however toward the end of the
lifecycle as developers really got their
hands on it
titles like Last of Us really go to show
that there was a ton of potential in
this hardware it takes exactly 2 seconds
to realize that last of us is not only
one of the best looking games on the ps3
but is one of the best looking games of
this entire generation it's crazy that
this is running on a ps3 it's really
clear that Naughty Dog was able to push
this console to its absolute limit with
this game now of course some of the
Uncharted titles look really good
there's some awesome scenes and things
like God of War but for me last of us
it's pretty much the top and of course
Last of Us was remade on the ps4 and
while that's still a better looking
version of the game the fact that this
is running on ps3 at all oh look at that
the detail the motion blur oh man I love
this so much it's such an amazing game I
feel like if you've never played The
Last of Us you really owe it to yourself
to give it a try continuing the trend of
playing Gran Turismo on every
PlayStation ever we have GT 6 now
actually this is still the most complete
version of Gran Turismo that has been
made up until today oh yeah yeah so the
physics were majorly overhauled for this
version of Gran Turismo now part of that
actually is due to the fact that this is
going to be a much more powerful console
so with those eight SP es what you're
getting here is a system that has a lot
more power than the PlayStation 2 ever
did well my favorite parts of Gran
Turismo 6 was the idea that we actually
can play inside the cockpit view which
is always the way I like to play per
niche well any recent game now one of
the issues was was that actually did
have a lot of older car models so they
not all the actual interiors were
modeled some of them look just straight
out of the ps2 but I mean come on this
this is pretty good Gran Turismo 6
really is a game that pushed the ps3 to
its absolute limit now I like this
support high resolutions and high frame
rates but also the level of detail the
level of cars in here kind of pushed a
little bit too far sometimes but it's
still a game that holds up surprisingly
well even today
move on to the PlayStation 4 and you
will see a huge contrast with the ps3
whereas that system tried to do
everything well where is yes this does
have a Netflix app and a blu-ray player
just like it did the real focus here is
on being an uncomplicated simple and
straightforward gaming system what
you're not going to find is a giant leap
in graphics this sure ps4 titles are
definitely going to look better than
their ps3 counterparts but when you look
at some
like the ps1 ps2 transition we're
especially the ps2 to ps3 transition
there were huge huge graphical leaps
whereas the ps4 is a little bit more of
an evolutionary change now there were
some key updates first of all this had
much more powerful graphics which would
allow games to actually hit a full 1080p
pretty consistently and there's also
going to be a lot more memory as opposed
to 512 megabytes of RAM on the ps3
you're getting a full eight gigabytes of
gddr5 on the ps4 allowing it now I'd
like to be able to have much more
detailed worlds but also going to be
just bigger ones
now the original ps4 was actually a
pretty strong seller out of the gate
however with the addition of the ps4
slim as always with these kind of things
what you're getting here is going to be
a smaller console it's going to be a
little bit quieter and a little bit more
efficient which is also going to be
cheaper and instead of the four-hundred
price tag that you got on the original
ps4 this guy comes in at $300 moving on
from the ps4 and the ps4 slim we have
the ps4 Pro now this is the first time
that we've seen a mid cycle update that
actually increases the performance so in
a lot of ways you can think of this is
not a ps4 but as a PS 4.5 not quite a
full generational leap this guy is going
to be a lot more powerful the big
difference here is going to be in that
performance so the ps4 Pro is capable of
outputting a full 4k resolution and it
also includes support for HDR what's
really interesting about this is that
even though a lot of games are going to
be aiming at a little bit of a lower
resolution such as 1440p through the use
of checkerboard upscaling
the games are going to look really
really nice on a 4k display and of
course it's going to be a big leap over
something like a standard ps4 now in GT
sport which mind you is not a full Gran
Turismo game I guess it's got a lot of
the features it's got a lot of stuff to
do it expect but it's not maybe quite as
full features GT six you're still going
to be getting a lot and importantly
you're going to be getting the new
engine with the new graphics
unfortunately we don't have midfields
available here but we do have streets of
Willow which looks close enough to the
other tracks if you squint a little bit
Mille are the physics improved here but
also they've done a lot with the audio
so the cars actually sound like well
cars should I mean if I cook it too hot
into this corner here just a ton of Tyre
squeal
are you actually bump into a car it
feels like I'm hitting an actual vehicle
jump into the cockpit view and we're
going to be getting that full detailed
experience something else that Gran
Turismo sport includes is HDR support
now I really can't show you that in a
YouTube video like this but the idea
here is that if you're playing on an HDR
display you get a really impressive
range of brightnesses something about GT
support that really jumps out to me is
just how much better it sounds than
earlier versions of Gran Turismo instead
of that sort of vague vacuum cleaner
sound you're actually getting all the
different sounds of your tires your
suspension your tires off-road the
engine everything feels a lot more
realistic because of that also what is
that Raptor doing here a serious next we
have rise of the Tomb Raider and one of
the reasons that picking this game is
because it actually has selectable
graphics options so I was playing on a
normal ps4 it pretty much would just
look like the way it looks like however
we can play it not only 4k or rather an
upscale version of 4k but you could also
go for a high Freight version
essentially 1080p at 60 or you can go
for the maximum visuals with the same
1080p resolution it's nice about a lot
of ps4 pro games is that you actually do
have multiple options something that
well consoles don't usually give you so
raises the two later actually is it
games that was available on last
generation consoles if you count the
actually surprisingly decent Xbox 360
ports
however it does a very good job of
showing off just what these kind of
consoles are capable of now mind you I
actually do think that it looks a little
bit better on the Xbox one X and
generally speaking that actually is the
case with the ps4 pro across the board
you're going to be getting more powerful
hardware there and I died so it's
interesting about the ps4 Pro is that it
does give you somewhat of a generational
leap so sure it's not going to be as big
of differences going from a ps3 to ps4
game but we are going to be getting an
increased resolution and a lot of cases
there's going to be a lot more detail
and sometimes even better frame rates so
out of all four generations of
PlayStation which one is your favorite
