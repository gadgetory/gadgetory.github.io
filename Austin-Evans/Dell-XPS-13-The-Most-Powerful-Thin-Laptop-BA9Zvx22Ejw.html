box contains one of the most exciting
laptops I've seen in quite a while this
is the Dell XPS 13 I really do like the
LG cram so I've already done a full
video on this what's nice is is that
when I'm at the office I can plug it in
via USB C to a monitor and use it like a
desktop for stuff like email and notes
when I'm on the go not only does it have
some of the best battery life I've ever
tested but it's also super lightweight
and portable that's where the XPS 13
comes in
so the XPS 13 has been around for a
couple years now but this is the most
recent version what makes it really
special is that it is one of the very
first laptops to ship with the eighth
generation Intel Core processors now
normally that doesn't sound like it
would be any kind of huge difference but
in this case it means it is going to be
a lot faster at least I hope so one of
the nice things about the XPS 13 is that
it actually is made out of aluminum and
I can immediately tell that while it is
definitely a little bit heavier than the
gram
it feels really substantial pop this guy
open and one of the first things you're
going to see is the fairly large 13.3
inch display and a very very small
chassis so when the XPS 13 first came
out this sort of bezel was really
impressive now it's getting a little bit
more common but it still looks really
nice the outside of the XPS 13 is all
aluminum but on the inside it has this
carbon fiber finish it actually feels
pretty good it almost feels a little bit
more rubbery than you would expect at a
carbon fiber but it's nice and
comfortable there's also a nice
selection of ports so now that you have
our power end but we also have a
Thunderbolt 3 port which you can also
use to power the laptop a USB 3.0 port
headphone jack as well as the battery
indicator which looks like it's dead
which is cool
and if we flip it over to the other side
which we're gonna find is another USB
3.0 port as well as a full-size SD card
reader having that Thunderbolt 3 port is
nice as 9 doesn't double as a USB C port
but you can also do stuff like connect a
4k monitor to it except power N and in
theory you could connect it to an
external GPU for better gaming
performance although unfortunately it
only uses two lanes of PCIe which means
that that's probably not going to be a
great idea it will get bottlenecks
the display is 13.3 inches with a 1080p
resolution but it is not a touchscreen
if you want that you have to upgrade to
the 1800 P model which is a lot more
expensive
now I actually like 1080p as I feel like
it's a good sort of sweet spot between
room screen resolution as well as
battery life and this panel is decent so
the color is fine viewing angles are
solid however it just doesn't get quite
as bright as I would like the biggest
problem with the display is that means
that the webcam has to be put in the
left corner which means that it looks
really weird not only are you looking up
in my nose but I'm always looking to the
side of the laptop this laptop has
pretty decent speakers so one of my
issues with the Graham was that the
speakers were a little bit tinny however
here even though they're not from firing
they come up the sides it sounds a lot
better I also like the keyboard and
trackpad so the keyboard has a nice
spacing the feels good and it's backlit
and the trackpad uses Windows precision
drivers so no it's not quite as good as
something like a glass trackpad on a
macbook but it is right up there my only
real issue is that to get a touchscreen
you have to pay another $350 which to me
is kind of hard to justify what really
makes this new XPS 13 stand out though
are those eighth generation Core
processors now typically when you go
from one processor to the next as far as
generations go it's usually not a huge
difference with this guy we're going
from dual-core processors to quad-core
and then a small thin and light laptop
like this that makes a huge difference
this XPS 13 is powered by the IEEE 78550
you so the base clock is 1.8 gigahertz
but it's almost always above that as you
guys will see in a minute and it can
turbo all the way up to 4 gigahertz now
that's backed up by 8 gigabytes of RAM
and a 256 gig nvme SSD run this guy
through Geekbench I legitimately had to
triple check my results in only is this
one of the fastest laptops I've ever
tested as far as single-threaded
performance goes even with
multi-threaded it is right up there with
high end core i7s from gaming laptops of
last year one thing to keep in mind is
that this is still a 15 watt processor
so for longer sustained use such as
gaming or rendering you will see the
clock speeds start to dip but for most
stuff like video editing or web browsing
you're gonna see it be incredibly fast
unfortunately gaming performance doesn't
see the same kind of gains so here on
rocket ly you're getting anywhere
between 40 to 50 frames per second at
720p quality which is fine for lighter
titles but it's really not going to see
a major benefit over something like
skylake your cable under normal usage
the laptop is basically silent however
once you fire up something like a game
some video editing you'll see that the
fan does get a little bit noisy
tell claims that you can get 13 hours of
battery-life streaming video and about
22 hours of light usage which might be a
little bit of an exaggeration but with a
60 watt hour battery it should
absolutely last you all day there is a
lot to like with the XPS 13 so $1,300 I
feel like this Beck is a little bit
expensive however once you can actually
get a core i5 in this guy and especially
if they have a more affordable
touchscreen version this is gonna be
hard to beat I am really excited to see
these new processors roll out to more
and more laptops having this much power
in such a thin light laptop honestly is
a game changer for me so what do you
guys think about the XPS 13 as well as
these new 8th gen processors let me know
in the comments below and I will catch
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
