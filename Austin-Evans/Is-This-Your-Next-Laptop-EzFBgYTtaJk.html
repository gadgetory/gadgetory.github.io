of the thinnest and most powerful
laptops you can buy this is the HP
Spectre x-360 and huge hello to HP for
sponsoring this video so if we open up
the second box which i've got to say is
actually really nicely done we have the
laptop it's so I'm actually curious is
this real aluminum it looks like it oh
yeah that's real metal I actually like
the brush metal finish on the side here
the entire laptop feels very sturdy
considering how thin it is also included
in the box is the HP active stylus so
the idea here is that now I do you have
the sort of flexibility that you get
with being able to flip the screen
around but also does have what hopefully
should be a pretty decent stylus that
comes in the box I really do like the
way this computer looks having an
aluminum chassis and pretty much
aluminium everywhere you look in touch
feels nice and also having something
like a glass trackpad really does make
it feel like a much more premium product
in addition to the pair of Thunderbolt 3
ports you also have a fingerprint sensor
on the side you've got the volume rocker
and on the flip side now that do we have
a standard full size USB port but you
also get the headphone jack power button
as well as on micro SD card slots this
really is then so something that keeps
jumping out to me is that the thickest
part of the chassis is only barely thick
enough to actually support a full sized
USB port the new Spectre x-360 starts at
eleven hundred and fifty dollars but the
model I have here is twelve fifty and
comes with like Core i7
8550 you eight gigabytes of RAM and a
256 gig SSD because this guy is running
the new 8th gen processors it really
does transform it from being a normal
ultra book to something that feels a lot
faster one of my big issues with
previous thin enlight laptops was that
while they had great battery life
performance was just decent however with
these new 8th gen processors that have a
quad core chip inside it actually makes
a huge difference to how fast these
things feel especially when you're doing
stuff like heavy multitasking it
absolutely can keep up with a desktop
what you're still getting the great
battery life that you would expect out
of an ultrabook and you can absolutely
see that in the benchmarks and Geekbench
noise is this completely destroyed last
generation Core i5 2 nice 7s but it
really is just not that far off from
hiring gaming laptops as well as
desktops if you need even more this
guy's available with up to 16 gigs of
ram and a one terabyte SSD and if you
opt for the 15 inch version of the X 360
it also has dedicated NVIDIA MX 150
graphics this version of the spy
x360 comes with a 13.3 inch 1080p IPS
display covered in Gorilla Glass but
there is also a 4k option
I'm sure the 4k looks great but if I
could you gotta say the 1080p is not bad
either
and personally especially on a 13-inch
laptop I kinda prefer 1080p as a nice
sweet spot between screen resolution as
well as battery life as far as the
battery goes the x360 has a 60 watt hour
battery which combined with the ATM
processor and 1080p display means that
getting through a full day of use
without the charger shouldn't be too
difficult so hv claims that you can get
up to 16 hours of battery on a charge
and that combined with the fast charging
power adapter means the battery life
really isn't a problem with this guy
when it comes to a Windows 10 laptop a
touch screen really is the way to go so
a lot of the time I use the keyboard and
trackpad but so often it's just helpful
to be able to reach up and touch the
screen now because this is the x360
version of the spectre we also have a
fully adjustable display so we can flip
it around to use it in display mode you
also can flip it upside down and use it
in tent mode and because it's such a
thin and light laptop you can use it in
tablet mode most of the time when it
comes to a 13-inch laptop a tablet mode
isn't too useful but because this guy's
so thin in life it actually works pretty
well here and that is especially helpful
when you use the HP Pen I am finding no
means an artist but I've got to say that
doodling with the pen is actually pretty
fun of course you can use it for more
serious stuff than color I mean
sketching stuff like notes would be
really helpful here but it's a
definitely a nice thing to have included
with the laptop the rest of the input is
pretty good as well so the keyboard has
great travel
it has good spacing I like the
backlighting the only thing that
slightly tripped me up was the home page
up and page down keys on the right side
of the keyboard but ones that get used
to that it's no problem
now the trackpad is decent so hardware
wise it does have a glass surface and
the tracking is pretty smooth however
the problem is it doesn't have Windows
precision drivers something that really
jumps out to me is the audio now this
has a set of Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen speakers a
lot of time branding doesn't make a huge
difference on a laptop but this guy is
rocking a full four speaker setup
okay that is really good so now these
are a fair bit of base but there's just
a ton of volume and it really doesn't
distort either this feature also has a
1080p webcam you guys can just the
quality for yourselves I think it's fine
for a video call but you probably won't
want to start a new YouTube channel with
it the specter has support for Windows
hello with both a fingerprint sensor as
well as an IR camera for facial
recognition no actually really do like
the fingerprint sensor well it is a
little bit odd to have it on the side of
the device it's much preferable to not
having a fingerprint sensor at all you
know like a certain thousand-dollar
phone or something with Windows 10 on
board there's also Cortana supports what
is the meaning of life I've led portable
laptops like this Spectre x-360 for a
long time but now that you can get
quad-core power while still keeping the
battery life it makes them so so much
more attractive again big shout-out to
HP for making this video possible
you guys want to check out this Spectre
x-360 the link will be in the
description you should also check out
the holidays unbox channel over at
youtube.com slash unboxed we can find
some of the latest and greatest
unboxings this holiday season anyway
guys thank you so much for watching and
I will catch you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
