to trying to game on a Mac over this
time well we're taking it up a notch
this is a two hundred dollar MacBook
straight from 2009 to be clear this is a
terrible idea but also I don't really
care so this MacBook is straight from
ebay and it has had a bit of a hard life
the inside is actually fairly clean so
there's no major scratches on the screen
the keyboard and trackpad are all clear
however on the exterior of the shell
there's a pretty sizable crack here and
it looks like someone just attacked at
the bottom of it at some points
generally speaking the words Mac and
gaming don't go together when you put
2009 white MacBook together with the
word gaming you usually have a recipe
for some straight garbage towel inside
the specs are well not great it has a
2.3 gigahertz Intel Core 2 Duo processor
4 gigabytes of RAM and NVIDIA GeForce
9400 m graphics a step up from
integrated graphics but not by much
however it's not all bad the rest of the
hardware does feel reasonably modern so
it's running currently a copy of Mac OS
Sierra although you can't update it to
High Sierra and you've got stuff like
dual band Wi-Fi a good keyboard decent
trackpad it doesn't really feel that
slow so with an only 1280 by 800 display
don't expect to be blowing through 4k
YouTube on this guy watching almost 720p
video is no problem and because it is
running a modern operating system now I
do you still get stuff like patches
there's even support for things like
series with a resolution of 1280 by 800
the screen is definitely low resolution
by today's standards however the panel
of soap really isn't bad yes it does not
get quite as bright as I would like but
the color and especially some of the
viewing angles are a lot better than
other 10 panels that I've found on
laptops around $200 today you're also
getting a good selection of ports
including not only MagSafe but Ethernet
may DisplayPort and a pair of USB 2.0
ports and you get an optical drive
because 2009 I have to admit when I
first had the idea for this video I
expected this to be pretty much garbage
town but it really isn't however the
real test is going to be can I play any
games that
all on it minecraft is a game that runs
on basically every piece of tech on
earth and it runs just fine here on the
MacBook so yes you do have to turn the
graphics settings down especially you
have to return the chunk distance to be
a lot closer but it does work
now steam does work on mac OS so of
course i have to give csgo a try and uh
I'm not expecting good things 16 fps
all right let's uh No
okay so I'm going to give this a solid F
for failure csgo is not MacBook
compatible at least that 2009 over the
main reason I actually wanted to do this
video was a new thing from Nvidia called
GeForce now GeForce now itself isn't new
but what is is the Mac beta so
essentially what we can do here is we
can go through pretty much any game on
Steam and battlenet now they'll support
everything but a lot of the major games
such as dota 2 fortnight battlefront -
you can all play for free at least right
now during beta on the Mac the only
catch is that you actually have to own
these games the way it works is once you
actually log into GeForce now you log
into something like Steam or battlenet
and you can play the games on your own
accounts now back in csgo running in
GeForce now it is a huge difference so
because the computer and the cloud is
doing all the heavy lifting all the
MacBook has to do is essentially just
decode the video and pass through my
mouse and keyboard input over the
Internet I know that there is absolutely
a little bit of latency that is added
but because we're over Ethernet and
because we have fiber here at the office
it's really hard to see any kind of
major difference next we have player
unknowns battlegrounds this is a game
that you would never be able to run on
the MacBook in a million years but here
again it runs pretty well here with
GeForce now it's crazy just how far out
gaming gets come so it feels like not
that long ago that well you could do
stuff like this with like PlayStation
now in GeForce it really relied on
having a crazy good internet connection
without it it was super choppy and
there's a lot of latency even with a
good internet connection but here I mean
yes if I look closely I can see there's
a little bit of a difference as far as
not being able to fully get that sort of
instant response but it is not that
in here oh no no no no yes yes I did it
again overwatch works totally fine dude
I'm really impressed with this I've been
willing to try g-force now for Mac for a
while but there's really nothing to
complain about if you have a good
internet connection and I can't stress
that enough if you don't this is not
going to be as smooth of an experience
but if you do it runs basically just
like you're running it on your actual
MacBook the only real catch here is that
this is for you only in beta at some
point and Vidya is going to come to
their senses and start charging for this
but man as long as it's free it's
essentially like you're getting a free
high powered gaming PC that just happens
to run on a little tiny MacBook so
should you buy a 2009 MacBook to turn
into a gaming PC of course not but if
you want to get into GeForce now while
it's still for free on the Mac this is
not a bad way of going at all this is a
great example of how newer technology
can mean that you don't have to leave
older hardware behind and speaking of
the hardware this MacBook is a lot
better than I thought
most you're considering maybe doing a
few upgrades and doing a part two to
this video so you guys want to see that
let me know in the comments below anyway
guys thank you so much for watching and
I will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
