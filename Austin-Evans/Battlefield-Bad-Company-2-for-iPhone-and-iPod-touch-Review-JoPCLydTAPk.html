of Battlefield Bad Company 2 through the
iPhone and iPod Touch so I've got this
app it came out yesterday and I've spent
several hours blending and going ahead
and playing it testing it out no roll
I'm fairly impressed it's not perfect as
most first-person shooters aren't for
the iPhone the iPod I'm not going to
show you guys how it works it is
producing so there are two major things
is the campaign which I'll show you guys
in just a second and there's also going
to be the multiplayer function all right
now I've spent a lot of time playing on
the Bluetooth so you can actually go
ahead with two iPods or iPhones or
however you have it I should go ahead
and locally play against a friend or a
family member or whatever using
bluetooth now I actually have been
playing this for quite a while and
especially quite a bit of fun there it's
not perfect you know the controls are
really not that good which I'll show you
guys in a minute but overall it is
pretty fun so if you guys want go ahead
and check that out and of course there
is there is multiplayer over Wi-Fi as
well as online as well so definitely
pretty cool there let's go ahead and
show you guys the campaign show you how
it all works okay so this is the very
beginning of the game now I'm go ahead
and show you guys a little bit about it
the graphics are really really quite
nice especially this is ret optimized
for the Retina display so especially if
you have an iPod Touch 4th generation
iPhone 4 this will look really quite
nice so the controls are pretty standard
for first-person shooters there they're
pretty decent as far as you know for
touchscreen by still not a huge fan the
right side you can just go ahead and
look around anything and you also go
ahead and tap the fire and then the left
side you go ahead and walk you can
strafe left and right and if you pull it
all the way forward you sprint nice
let's go ahead and run across here now
one thing is quitting this run forward
here a little bit now like I said the
controls are pretty good for touchscreen
but generally I really do not like
touchscreen at all buttons let's go
ahead and pull up our iron sights
let's go to crouch
so I gotta try make sure that key this
there we go
and know pretty simple now we can go
ahead and tap the top right to go ahead
and reload and then with this gun we can
go ahead and actually switch to our
grenade launcher as well well we go
ahead if I tap that we could throw a
grenade so let's go ahead and kind of
walk over this way actually walk over
this way now actually if we want we can
go ahead and pick up this and by with
two weapons you can go ahead and
actually scroll through so that's pretty
cool
now there's also a vehicle I don't think
I'll be getting into the vehicles in
this point one thing I do want to
mention though is that the controls the
vehicles are pretty awful I'm not gonna
lie they are pretty awful you know
especially when you get into tight
places and stuff is really hard to
control so I think we bit here so then
go ahead and stand up and sprint a
little bit um so let's go ahead and jump
up here now I have I will admit I have
not played a field bad company too so I
can't really tell you you know how
accurate the story is but I do know that
all the characters are the same so
there's these guys out there it is a
little bit of auto lane so it's not too
bad as far as aiming but again not
anywhere near as good as you know using
an Xbox or even a you know I mouse the
keyboard now the game does run fairly
smoothly you guys can see this game does
run really smooth fairly smooth yeah
let's go ahead and sneak up on this guy
and get a nice kill due by running up to
them there we go
but there you go guys that's gonna be
about it for my review it's a pretty
cool game I'm not gonna lie it's pretty
good now there are some problems though
you know for one thing the sound effects
and the sounds in general are not very
good you guys probably can't hear too
much right now and you know just when
you're playing it normally but
especially when you put on some
headphones you can really tell that they
put some really low quality sound in
there especially when you're playing
multiplayer there is little and no sound
effects whatsoever no it's totally
silent until you fire a gun which is
kind of a little bit of a Down
in my opinion however overall especially
considering this is only a dollar right
now I definitely recommend guys go ahead
and pick this up of course this is
Battlefield Bad Company 2 you can find
go ahead and find on the App Store for
the iPhone and the iPod Touch anyway
guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
