today I'm really excited to announce
that spirit the untethered jailbreak for
the iphone ipod and ipad is out so yeah
guys on this is great on what it works
perfectly super fast i'm really
impressed with it and we'll go ahead and
show you tutorial it's not very hard but
uh show you guys how to do it anyway
let's get this one started Vince the
latest technology covering everything
okay guys so this is really simple to
show you how to do it now you will need
pretty much any device as long as on
three point one point two three point
one point three or in the case of the
ipad 3.2 okay now before we begin let me
go ahead there will be an annotation on
the screen right now to go ahead and
take a look at my auto sh-sh video this
is very important if you have an ipod
touch 3rd generation an iphone 3gs or an
ipad as it will as if you do not do that
go ahead and capture your SHSH blobs you
will not be able to jailbreak or rather
you will not be able to do it in the
future should Apple you know update the
firmware so go ahead check out that
video before you look at this one then
come back when you're done anyway it's
very very simple guys what I do is just
take your ipod iphone or ipad plug it in
wow that's fail plug it in then you guys
just take it to your computer and i
can't play anything in can i take it
into your computer plug it in and that's
all that's that let's go ahead and go
over to the screencast and show you what
else yet hey guys so now all you need to
do is go ahead and have your I device
Mike what's a all names but whatever
your jailbreaking right now have it
plugged into your computer via USB okay
now you're going to want to come to this
link its spirit jb calm I of course have
it in the description boy come here at
the moment it's lagging a little bit but
go ahead just come here and you'll be
able to download it it does work for
both windows and mac so just would pick
whatever you're using right then and i
go ahead and download it so as soon as
you're done with that you will have the
file okay this is extremely simple but
if you're using windows there's one
important thing you have to do right
click it then scroll down to properties
okay now come over to compatibility on
this this menu might be slightly
different if you're using XP or
something but you should sign that tab
then you need to click run this program
in compatibility mode for windows 98
kinda seems weird but this does work
okay so do it 98 then you're going to
hit apply and ok so you should do that
you get to go so just double click and
then it will say spirit they'll say
whatever your device reminds and I
pod touch 2nd generation and then go
ahead and hit jailbreak and that's it
really guys ok guys so now we have
everything hooked up just click
jailbreak go ahead and show you guys it
will say restore complete and spirit is
already done jailbreak succeeded now
I'll go ahead and stick with you guys
here you can see that it's like me I was
turning off everything but yeah guys
basically like I do is white right now
I'm little it does not take long as you
see here it's already loading up it's a
pretty cool bootloader I've gotta admit
but yeah guys that's pretty much it ok
guys sorry about that my camera battery
died in the middle of that but rest
assured guys it we only took literally
you know maybe 45 seconds from the time
I thought the button till is done so you
see everything that's saying this is a
restore but you know but as you can see
there guys city is now later it works
fine I've tested some but yeah guys
that's about it now there's just a
couple things I want to note real quick
if you do not know already this of
course works for the ipad iphone ipod
guys exact same process for everything
no matter what so don't worry you know
just because you have an ipad something
is going to work exact same also if
you're having problems windows 98 pad
building mode is not working for you in
windows go ahead try windows 95 i hope
that helps some people who are having
problems anyway guys that's about it one
of the simplest jailbreaks ever i'm
really impressed anyway if you have any
questions or anything like that be sure
to leave them in the comments and i'll
do my best to help anyway thanks for
