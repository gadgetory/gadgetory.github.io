Mac debate has been around forever but
how did things stack up 10 years later
starting off we've got the 2006 MacBook
with the classic white design even
though it's a decade old it feels
surprisingly modern build quality isn't
as nice as modern aluminum mags but
considering its age this one is
downright solid you've got max a4
charging which is still the best laptop
charger ever and things like the
keyboard feels decent if a bit mushy the
tri pad is still better than a lot of
laptops today with smooth two-finger
scrolling and it's got a decent variety
of ports like USB Ethernet and a couple
obscure ones like mini DVI and firewire
the screen is respectable too coming in
at 13 inches with a resolution of 1280
by 800 it might be dated but it's
absolutely usable on the PC side we've
got a 2006 dell latitude d620 in at
first glance it definitely looks at sage
you'll notice the little things like the
latch for the display unlike the
OneTouch hinge from the MacBook and a
tiny trackpad with two options for the
left and right click buttons the
keyboard feels a bit mushy but it's
still absolutely fine by today's
standards there are plenty of ports a
DVD drive and a 14 inch screen which is
downright good it's got an upgraded 1440
by 900 resolution which wouldn't look
all that out of place on a laptop these
days Windows XP has never looked so nice
one of the big advantages of PCs / Mac
has typically been priced but let's see
what you could get with your 2006 cash
the macbook started at $1100 with a 1.8
gigahertz intel core dual processor 512
megabytes of memory and a 6 dica gabite
hard drive the dell d620 came with a
slightly slower 1.6 3 hertz core duo
half a gig of ram and a 40 gig hard
drive for $50 more however this model
was fully loaded which puts the original
price tag quite a bit higher than the
MacBook today though the Mac has held
its value better running around $150
compared to $100 for the Dell and 2016
cache the big question though is how
usable are these computers after 10
years the MacBook has all the basics you
need like Wi-Fi and decent specs which
means it handles basic tasks like web
browsing just fine
since the newest OS it supports a Snow
Leopard a lot of apps aren't supported
but you can still download an up-to-date
copy of Firefox to browse and watch
YouTube while the webcam on the MacBook
might not be winning any awards it is
480p
which just happens to match
some other slightly newer MacBook the
Dell originally shipped with Windows XP
which while eight years older than Snow
Leopard is actually still fairly well
supported today thanks to the more
powerful Core 2 Duo it's able to handle
things even smoother than the MacBook
while browsing and video is totally
usable here neither laptop is equipped
to do heavier lifting like video editing
or gaming with a fairly anemic Intel GMA
950 graphics but they've got everything
you need to be a functional computer I
was curious though with a few upgrades
how far can you push these laptops I
started with the MacBook which is
incredibly easy to upgrade just remove
the battery and you can get at the
memory which I bumped up to two gigs for
ten dollars and install the modern SSD
give it a fresh copy of Snow Leopard and
it's surprisingly snappy the extra
memory helps with lots of programs open
and the SSD shrinks load times down to
modern PC levels when it comes to
upgrading the Dell it's a fairly
involved process that requires some
serious disassembly you're looking for
the high ground yeah
once you swap out the old hard drive for
an SSD and install Windows 10 things are
impressive basically everything works
right out of the box and the core true
dual really isn't that far behind some
of the lower end computers you can buy
today it might look a little weird but
with a simple hardware update and a
fresh copy of Windows 10 you've got a
solid laptop when you look at price it's
a pretty clear win for the MacBook not
only was it cheaper when new but while
use prices vary next to a solid job of
retaining value design wise it's also
clear that Apple was ahead of the curve
the MacBook holds up well today but one
of the big advantages of a PC is being
able to load a fully up-to-date copy of
Windows 10 so after 10 years which one
would you go for let me know in the
comments below and I will catch you oh I
gotta talk about team Krispy life hahaha
