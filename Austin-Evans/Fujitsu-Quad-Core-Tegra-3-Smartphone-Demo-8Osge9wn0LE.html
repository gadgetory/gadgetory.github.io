from CES 2012 with a little demo of the
Fujitsu quad-core smartphone so as you
obviously should have guessed from the
name this is one of the world's first
phones that we'll be shipping with the
NVIDIA Tegra 3 quad-core chip so we have
seen a couple of tablets with this
however having quad-core and phone is
really really awesome
so the other new specs include will have
an LT and will have support for LTE and
of course it does have HDMI out let's
have a fairly large screen I don't
actually have these specs on that but
doesn't it to be fairly large it also is
a waterproof foam so very very cool
stuff most of the Fujitsu phones then
here aren't here at CES are waterproof
so you can expect waterproof and
dustproof it'll have a thirteen point
one megapixel camera also looks to be
fairly thin unfortunately it's not
actually going to it's just mostly a
prototype right now I should be unveiled
next month at the bars and the Mobile
World Congress so I can't look get it
hands-on as hopefully should be able to
get a good look at it here of course it
is powered HDMI out so this TV right
here is Jason sear it's running one of
the demos that was running on the
transformer prime and let's so shy what
you guys can see in here as someone's
playing it via bluetooth right now using
a controller but the graphics are
absolutely fantastic really really nice
and a major step up from the current
dual core Tegra 2 of course
no word on price or release date but
more likely we should be able to see it
sometime summer and it will give us the
full name all the kinds of important
stuff at Mobile World Congress in
February</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
