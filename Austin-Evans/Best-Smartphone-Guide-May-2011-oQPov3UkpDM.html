the best smartphone well there certainly
isn't one perfect phone for everyone
today I'll be going over my picks for
the best two phones on each of the major
American carriers AT&amp;amp;T Sprint t-mobile
and Verizon pricing information and
phone selection will vary worldwide but
many of these phones are available in
other countries as well to start with on
AT&amp;amp;T we have the Motorola Atrix 4G well
this phone is a couple of months old now
it still packs a punch with a dual core
Tegra 2 processor four inch qHD display
and support for the Motorola laptop top
which gives you the option to turn the
Atrix into a computer on the go which
while less than perfect is certainly a
headlining feature for the phone with 4G
capabilities on the AT&amp;amp;T HSPA+ network
this is a great choice for anyone
looking for a solid Android phone next
we have the HP viewer 4G in my recent
review of the phone I was very impressed
with not only webOS but also just how
powerful the veer is while the small
size certainly isn't for everyone
it makes the fear unique among the
dozens of huge phones available today
inside you'll find an 800 megahertz
Snapdragon processor 2.6 inch display
with a resolution of 320 by 480 usable
physical keyboard and a quite reasonable
price the veer is a great choice if
you're looking for a smaller phone
moving on to sprint a great choice would
be the Nexus S 4G this Samsung made in
Google branded phone features the latest
version of the Android operating system
2.3 Gingerbread the version for Sprint
also comes with compatibility for their
4G network which means you should be
able to pull down some very respectable
speeds you will also find a one
gigahertz hummingbird processor and a 4
inch WVGA contour display with
practically guaranteed updates to future
firmwares
the Nexus S 4G is a great choice getting
away from the sea of Android phones
you'll find the HTC arrive this runs the
latest version of Windows Phone 7 and
features a slide-out keyboard which
should make it great if you prefer a
physical keyboard it sports a 1
gigahertz Snapdragon processor along
with a 3.6 inch WVGA display while the
rive does light 4G capabilities it
remains a great choice if you are
interested in Windows Phone 7
moving on to t-mobile we had the
t-mobile g2 X I could see yes when this
phone was first unveiled
I was very impressed and now that it's
out on the market is one of my favorite
phones period with a scorching dual core
Tegra 2 CPU and a 4-inch WVGA display
using the g2 X is a very fast experience
in everything from gaming to web
browsing while it still runs Android 2.2
instead of 2.3 it remains a great choice
for anyone looking for a top-notch phone
on t-mobile to the excitement of mini
the psychic has returned now running
Android and built by Samsung the
t-mobile sidekick 4G has a lot going for
it it has a nicely sized fibro keyboard
3.5 inch WVGA display one gigahertz
hummingbird CPU and Android 2.2 with
support for t-mobile 4G and a price that
won't destroy your debit card the
sidekick 4G is a great choice especially
for fans of the original moving on to
Verizon we had the Samsung Droid Charge
the Droid Charge has a lot going for it
including a fantastic 4.3 inch Super
AMOLED display support for Verizon's
blazing-fast 4G LTE network
the 1-cos hummingbird processor and an
included 32 gigabyte microSD card about
the only thing missing is the dual-core
CPU but beyond that you'll be
hard-pressed to find a phone anywhere
that's better than the Droid Charge if
you have to have a keyboard then the
Motorola Droid 2 global isn't a bad
choice at all it lacks support for 4G
but makes up for that with a quad-band
GSM radio allowing it to run worldwide
easily it features a 1.2 gigahertz CPU
3.7 inch display and of course a full
slide-out QWERTY keyboard with Android
2.2 it makes a solid choice if you want
a physical keyboard or need a world
capable phone on Verizon so there you
