trading power for portability that's
where the venom black book 15 comes in
take one look and you'll see it's much
more subtle looking than mini gaming
laptops sporting a chassis that measures
just over an inch thick it's a bit on
the heavy side at 5.7 pounds but it's a
nicely built piece of hardware the star
of the show here is absolutely the 15.6
inch 4k display with a ppi of over 280
it's incredibly sharp at any remotely
normal viewing distance you just can't
see pixels if you run it at native
resolution it's almost funny how tiny
things are so I kept the black book
scale to 200% which is a good compromise
between screen real estate without any
windows scaling weirdness most apps like
chrome recognized this no problem I'll
need to watch full HD videos inside the
YouTube player colors nicely saturated
contrast is off the charts and it's got
solid viewing angles as well this is the
best laptop screen I've ever used
there's not much point in having a 4k
display though without some serious
facts to back it up the black book 15 is
powered by Nvidia snoo gtx 980m GPU with
4 gigabytes of memory it's paired with a
core i7 4720 HQ quad-core CPU they can
turbo up to 3.6 gigahertz 16 gigabytes
of 1866 megahertz memory a 256 gigabyte
m2 SSD along with a one terabyte hard
drive this is about as good as it gets
for a laptop with the SSD especially
helping to keep the system snappy
opening programs and games noticeably
faster than a normal SATA SSD having 16
gigabytes of RAM is helpful for doing
work like video editing and you've got
the option of bumping this up to 32 gigs
supporting wireless AC and Gigabit
Ethernet for connectivity the Bible is
one seriously high-end laptop but how
does it handle gaming driving an 8
megapixel display is a challenge for
nearly any gaming PC especially for a
laptop that tops out around 150 watts
for the entire system you can run games
in native 4k but you'll have to bring
the settings down a bit Metro last light
Redux averaged 45 FPS on medium at 4k
shadow of mordor is also playable 4k on
medium at around 30 frames per second
considering just how pixel dense the
screen is dropping the resolution a bit
isn't a huge day on grading quality
shadow of mordor still looks great
running at 1080p ultra with a smoother
68 fps
there is a drawback to all this power
and that's battery life running the unit
in Valley benchmark on a loop was able
to drain the black book battery in 47
minutes
definitely a worst case scenario but for
hardcore gaming you're going to want to
be near a power outlet on the plus side
venemous struck a good balance between
temperatures and noise the CPU and GPU
both top out well below 80 degrees
Celsius with perfectly acceptable fan
noise the keyboard holds up pretty well
it's a little mushy for my taste but
it's really not bad and features three
stages of backlighting on the tripod
side it's usable and has nice clicky
buttons below but if you're even
thinking about gaming you're going to
want a mouse it's also got a pair of
built-in speakers which sounds good for
a laptop they get reasonably loud and
are easily enough to drown out the fan
noise gaming in 4k requires some serious
power but the 980m and core i7 are
mostly up to the task
what venema put together here is a solid
package that's at least somewhat
portable nicely built with all the right
choices on the hardware side including a
ridiculously nice looking screen as a
high-end laptop the black book 15
definitely isn't cheap although there is
another version with a 3k display in
970m graphics that my friend Linus
recently reviewed so what do you guys
think about the black book let me know
in the comments below if you enjoyed and
want to see more videos like this

for watching and I will catch you in the
