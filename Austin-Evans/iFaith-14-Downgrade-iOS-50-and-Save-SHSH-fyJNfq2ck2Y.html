here with the tutorial showing you how
to backup your SH message blobs as well
as downgrade your firmer on an iPhone
iPod Touch or iPad now the way we're
going to be doing it today is using I
faith now I think there's a little
different from something such as tiny
umbrella and what it allows you to do is
pull the sh-sh bulbs from your device
rather than relying on Apple to still be
signing them if you guys are not
familiar with what sh-sh blobs are I'll
be brief
basically what an sh-sh blob is is a key
that Apple is gives you and it is unique
to every device and every firmware so
the let's take for example I have an
iPod Touch here and it was on 4.3.3 if I
want to get back to that four point
three point three firmware I'm going to
need the sh-sh blob and the only way to
get that ordinarily is to have captured
it using some program while Apple was
still signing that but as soon as the
new firmware comes out apples stop
signing it and you have no way of
getting back to that old firmware
however with a bait that works a little
differently
instead of relying on Apple it actually
pulls the sh-sh blob off of your device
so for example I have an iPod touch on
5.0 point one here however it was on 5.0
for example we can pull it right off
there and not have to worry about Apple
not allowing us to downgrade to whatever
firmware we like so once you download
the program it is Windows only but once
you download it there's gonna be a few
options here but very simple ignore
everything else except dump sh-sh blobs
now once you get to this it will give
you a little information now this is
compatible with most but not all devices
so basically this is going to be
compatible with all I phones iPod
Touches and iPads with the exception of
the new iPhone 4s as well as the iPad 2
if you do have the iPhone 4s or the iPad
2 not you're a little add a lot but if
you have a pretty much any other device
that should work so need to go ahead and
click proceed and go through the credits
and thanks will ask if you were dumping
an Apple TV 2 which we are not and so
we're ready to begin so at this point
you need to go ahead and plug your
iPhone iPod touch your iPad in and I do
want to take this opportunity to mention
that you do not need to be jailbroken
and this will not jailbreak or anything
it'll basically just get a little
information off your device and by
information I mean the sh-sh blobs not
like anything personal or anything like
that
alright so all you need to do is show
off your device and be sure it is
plugged in and you know turn off iTunes
or anything like that if it was open so
hold the power button for just a second
until you get the slide to power
off this will take just a moment and I
will do want to mention that if you are
using a tethered jailbreak you will need
to boot as tethered after this but not a
huge deal shouldn't take just a moment
so once your device is shut off we can
go ahead and begin and what we're going
to do is enter DFU mode so if you've
ever jailbroken before it's gonna be
really simple very obvious you know but
I'll go ahead and walk you guys to it if
you've never done it before
alright so we're all done here we're
ready to click start so as soon as you
hit start it'll give you a little
countdown when he did hold the power and
the home button for five seconds so
ready set go
shouldn't hold them both together for
ten seconds and of course it has a nice
countdown timer but again if you've ever
done DFU mode you can probably do it in
your sleep but alright and we're gonna
release the power button and just
continue holding the home button and
it's as simple as that it always says
thirty seconds but in my expertise it
usually is more like 10-15 seconds
something like that we'll just continue
waiting here until it gives us the
go-ahead at this point you can set your
device down and just give I face a few
minutes to go ahead and go through all
of the different sh-sh blobs and dump
them so this is it's done with this I'll
be right back alright so once it's all
done it will ask you to save the sh-sh
cache so just save it in a safe place
you know preferably somewhere that you
won't lose it will take just a moment
and then it will save it on top of that
it will also save it to a server so if
for some reason you're not able to
actually get the physical goal file on
your computer you can always read
download it so there we go simple as
that we can click OK and it'll bring us
back to the main page now for most of
you guys you're gonna be done you've
backed up your sh sh blob whatever
firmware you were on but to make sure I
recommend go ahead and click click
available show of payable sh sh caches
so just allow it to give it a second
with your device of course still plugged
in and it'll pull up all the sh sh cache
as you have so for example you can see I
have four point three point three as
well as 5.0 point one which I just did
anyway guys that's about it if you ever
want to downgrade to that firmer all you
need to do is click build signed IPS WS
blogs and then just simply restore it in
iTunes and you will be back to whatever
firmware that you had the sh sh blob for
anyway guys if you enjoyed this video
