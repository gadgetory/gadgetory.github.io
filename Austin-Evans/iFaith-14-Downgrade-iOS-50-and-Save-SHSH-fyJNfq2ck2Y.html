here with the tutorial showing you how
to back up your sh message blobs as well
as downgrade your firmer on an iphone
ipod touch your ipad now the way we're
going to be doing it today is using i
faith now i think this is a little
different from something such as tiny
umbrella and what it allows you to do is
pull the sh sh bulbs from your device
rather than relying on apple to still be
signing them you guys met familiar with
what SHSH blobs are I'll be brief
basically what an sh sh blob is is a key
that Apple is gives you and it is unique
to every device and every firmware so
let's take for example I have an ipod
touch here and it was on four point
three point three if I want to get back
to that four point three point three
firmware I'm going to need the sh sh
blob and the only way to get that
ordinarily is to have captured it using
some program while Apple was still
signing that but as soon as the new
firmer comes out apples stop signing it
and you have no way of getting back to
that old firmware hell over with I bait
that works a little differently instead
of relying on Apple it actually pulls
the sh sh blob off of your device so for
example i have an ipod touch on 5.1 here
however it was on five point for example
we can pull it right off there and not
have to worry about Apple not allowing
us to downgrade to whatever firmware we
like so once you download the program it
is windows only but once you download it
there's going to be a few options here
but very simple ignore everything else
except dump SHSH blobs now once you get
to this it will give you a little
information now this is compatible with
most but not all devices so basically
this is going to be compatible with all
iphones ipod touches and ipads with the
exception of the new iphone 4s as well
as the ipad 2 if you have the iphone 4s
or the ipad 2 not you're a little add a
lot but if you have a pretty much any
other device that should work so need to
go ahead and click proceed and go
through the credits and thanks we'll ask
if you were dumping an apple TV 2 which
we are not and so you're at we're ready
to begin so at this point you need to go
ahead and plug your iphone ipod touch
your ipad in and i do want to take this
opportunity to mention that you do not
need to be jailbroken and this will not
jailbreak or anything it'll basically
just get a little information off your
device and by information i mean the
SHSH blobs not like anything personal or
anything like that alright so all you
need to do is show off your device be
sure it is plugged in and you know turn
off itunes or anything like that if it
was open so hold the power button for
just a second until you get the slide to
power
off this will take just a moment and I
will do want to mention that if you are
using a tethered jailbreak you will need
to boot as tethered after this but not a
huge deal shouldn't take just a moment
so once your device is shut off we can
go ahead and begin and what we're going
to do is enter DFU mode so if you've
ever jailbroken before it's going to be
really simple very obvious you know but
I'll go ahead and walk you guys to it if
you've never done it before alright so
we're all done here we're ready to click
start so as soon as you hit start we'll
give you a little countdown when he did
hold the power and the home button for
five seconds so ready set go going to
hold them both together for 10 seconds
and of course it has a nice countdown
timer but again if you've ever done dfu
mode you can probably do it in your
sleep but all right and we're going to
release the power button and just
continue holding the home button and
it's as simple as that it always says 30
seconds but in my expertise it usually
is more like 10-15 seconds something
like that which is continue waiting here
till it gives us the go-ahead at this
point you can set your device down and
just give I face a few minutes to go
ahead and go through all of the
different SHSH blobs and dump them so
this is it's done with this I'll be
right back alright so once it's all done
it will ask you to save the sh sh cash
so just save it in a safe place you know
preferably somewhere that you won't lose
it will take just a moment and then it
will save it on top of that it will also
save it to a server so if for some
reason you're not able to actually get
the physical gold file on your computer
you can always redownload it so there we
go simple as that we can click OK and it
will bring us back to the main page now
for most of you guys you're going to be
done you've backed up your sh sh blob
whatever firmware you were on but to
make sure i recommend go ahead and click
click available show of halo sh sh
caches so just allow it to give it a
second with your device of course still
plugged in and it will pull up all the
sh sh caches you have so for example you
can see i have four point three point
three as well as five point appoint one
which i just did anyway guys that's
about it if you ever want to downgrade
to that firmer all you need to do is
click build signed ipsw with blobs and
then just simply restore it in itunes
and you will be back to whatever
firmware that you have the sh sh blob
for anyway guys if you enjoyed this
