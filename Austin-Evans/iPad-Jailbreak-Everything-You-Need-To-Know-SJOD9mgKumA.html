today I'm here with a video discussing
the possibilities as well as the pros
and cons of a jailbreak for the upcoming
Apple iPad now if you know the iPad is
very similar to an iPhone or iPod Touch
has a lot of same hardware in Iran's a
very very very similar type of software
the same iPhone OS just tweaked of
course so I'm going to talk about what
what if that Joe ray comes what's going
to be all about as well as what you can
expect if it is going to come out at all
anyway guys let's get this one started
ok so to begin with the first question
obviously obviously has to be can the
iPad be jailbroken ok now we don't know
for sure obviously the iPad isn't out
yet nobody's really gotten their hands
on one to test it but my gut feeling is
absolutely it's got to be jailbreak
Apple if you look at you know the iPhone
iPod Touch the hardware is so similar I
just can't believe that you know with
something this big huge jailbreaking
community can't figure some way out to
get at it you know it now of course it
might be similar to the iPhone the
latest iPhones and iPod touches which
are a little bit more difficult to
jailbreak now I won't get into all the
technical details but basically if you
ever shut them off they all go all the
way off then you actually have to plug
it back into the computer which is
called a ton of jailbreak I absolutely
would not doubt that if Apple decides to
go that way they might keep the exact
same thing so that if basically it will
be just like jailbreaking an iPhone or
iPod Touch now I wouldn't doubt that
they've actually you know enhanced it
beefed up security but that's definitely
a possibility but in the short while we
don't know for sure I've got to say that
yeah it's going to be possible ok so the
next question obviously has to be would
you even want to jailbreak your iPad and
the simple answer is my opinion
absolutely
you know a lot of people were at this
point when the iPad was first announced
because it was missing a lot of features
and almost all of them are software
related so you think flash that could
possibly be added via jailbreaking you
think Multi testament that can
absolutely be added via jailbreaking
you look at you know different browsers
and more apps a lot of that stuff can
totally be added to jailbreaking
so in the short answer I've got to say
absolutely I would want a jailbreak mine
now of course I can see on one hand
where a lot of people move spending five
six seven even eight hundred dollars on
a new device you're not going to want to
go jailbreak it and risk you know
breaking it but jailbreaks have gotten
so easy these days they're so simple and
they're really not foolproof maybe but
they're really they're really pretty
solid so I don't think that would be a
huge issue especially if you want to
unlock the real capability of an iPad
now take for example multi tasking now
of course the iPhone OS doesn't support
it so basically multitasking if you
don't know what it is really simply is
basically allowing you to run more than
one app at a time now the iPhone OS
allows you to do this both on the iPhone
and iPad it allows you to do it
minimally so basically you could be
listening to like music and you know be
surfing Safari or something but it only
allows it on apps that actually come
with the device so let's say you want to
listen to Pandora radio okay that's a
really popular app that I know everybody
likes to listen to that quite a bit so
let's say you want to listen to that
okay now that's fine you can download
the app and listen to it but guess what
you want to maybe just share that maybe
you want to do something else maybe you
want to check the email do something
else well basically you're out of luck
you get basically have to kill the app
and go out and do whatever you can come
back later but you have to lie to reload
find the song all that stuff it's a big
mess now you can do this with
jailbreaking in your iPhone and iPod
touch
um it's not amazing it's a little bit
glitchy but you absolutely can do it as
long as you don't get a go way overboard
loading tons of that it works just fine
now the iPad is basically just a
different version of the iPhone iPod
they basically it's very similar except
it just is a little bit more powerful
and you know some of the specs are just
bumped up some more so I got a
absolutely a believe that multitasking
what runs decent on the iPhone and iPod
will run amazing on the iPad now I know
battery life you know maybe a little
glitches here and there but that is a
small price to pay my opinion for
actually being able to use it to its
fullest potential
ok guys so that's basically my thoughts
on a whole jailbreaking iPad deal so to
make this a little bit more fun I'm
going to have a little bit of a contest
here basically what I'm going to do is I
really strongly believe that the iPad
will be jailbroken in fact there's
already a program and there's team of
people working on it right now
or rather the pairing for it once it
comes out it's going to be called green
poison now I believe they they obviously
haven't gotten their hands on it but
they're getting all prepared and ready
to sue the iPad comes out and start
working on so whether it's them or
somebody else I think that the iPad will
be Jill working and I'm going to go
ahead and leave it up to you guys to
think when it is so basically really
simply leave me down here in the
comments leave me a comment of how long
you think from the time the iPad is
released how long do you think it will
be until it is ready to be jailbroken
you know maybe a week maybe a month
maybe two months six months maybe never
but just go ahead and leave you down in
comments and what I will do is as soon
as it will be jailbroken assuming it is
but I'm pretty sure it will be as soon
as it's jailbroken I will come back to
this video you roll through all the
comments and whoever or maybe there
might be metal people but whoever got
the right answer whether you know it's
two months five days whatever you want
to do whoever got the right answer I
will definitely give you a shout-out in
the video when I talk about because I
will cover it once it is your broken
i'll definitely cover it and i will give
you how many ever people get it right
give you a shout out on the video on
that video so hey guys Joe just let me
know
personally I don't want to you know give
you guys spoilers or anything
a bit I don't know anything more than
you do so I would probably guess about
two months but that's entirely a guess
and I'm definitely looking forward to
seeing what you guys think anything guys
