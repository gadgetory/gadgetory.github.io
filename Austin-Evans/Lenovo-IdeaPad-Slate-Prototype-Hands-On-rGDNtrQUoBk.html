doing tablets is going to be a big form
factor going forward this is prototype
stuff so fit and finish isn't gold but
this is a windows-based slate product
can I see the back of it yeah not very
nice
yeah she's not quite done yet not fit
and finish is not so like some of these
card base notes don't close very well
but what size of the screen this is a 10
inch screen and the reason we're doing
we're looking at a windows obviously
we're looking at everything in the
slaveholders that Android is is terrible
at and riding recognition so taking your
handwriting taking notes on this turning
it into a digital file android doesn't
do that very well windows does do that
well so we're looking at windows
products to do that one of the drawbacks
about Windows is battery consumption but
this product should get around five
hours a life a little bit less in here
it's streaming video or something like
that but not bad performance really for
Windows slate is it based on the Intel
Atom
you know I don't know what process yeah
I think that's to be determined that's
probably a good guess because battery
life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
