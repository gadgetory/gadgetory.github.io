quick video kherson bus really awesome
news and I didn't want to share it with
you all so basically soon hopefully
before the end of the month you actually
going to be able to buy your own iPhone
and soon a little bit after that you'll
be able to buy ipod touch case is based
off of your favorite winterboard themes
so you're actually going to be able to
go through city and actually purchase a
case so for example you want to go ahead
and get maybe like twilight HD it's a
really popular case and there will be
several others select cases we actually
go ahead and buy a case that's actually
made for the theme now it's really
really cool i love this idea basically
the way it will work is let's say you
like twilight HD which is one of the
first ones that will be available so
that's your favorite thing you have it
on your iPhone your ipod touch well you
guys should go ahead through city and
purchase a case that is designed to look
very similar so you know now can you go
ahead and skin you know the UI you can
go ahead and buy a custom case for your
device personally I think this is a
fantastic idea I mean not only can you
change the you know the look of the you
know operating system potentially go
ahead and change the entire look and of
course you can go ahead and swap these
cases as much as you like basically the
cases are going to be silicon or they're
going to be final or whatever you're
going to call they're not gonna be hard
cover plate cases however I think it's
coming great great great news and i love
how jailbreaking is actually developed
to the point where you can actually go
ahead and buy these physical cases in
addition to the awesome themes some of
the guys that just want to make this
quick video i'm actually doing it on the
front facing camera on my ipod touch so
if it's the quality's not that great you
know but yeah guys anyways I just wanted
to share that with you definitely let me
know are you interested in this would
you buy one of these cases I think I
definitely would I'm not a huge fan of a
lot of the themes in cydia usually I
like right now i'm meghan using one
however I definitely love the idea and I
would almost buy one just on the
principle of it so get Leslie let me
know and what you guys think would you
be interested in a lot kind of good
stuff anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
