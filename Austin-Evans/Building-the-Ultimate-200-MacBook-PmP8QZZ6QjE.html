video where I tried to game on this $200
MacBook and it actually kind of worked
but today we're with part two where I'm
going to give it a few choice upgrades
so this is a 2009 white MacBook
outfitted with a blisteringly fast Core
2 Duo processor 4 gigabytes of RAM and
currently nvidia geforce 9400m graphics
that might not sound impressive but this
guy's actually still fully supported on
the latest version of Mac OS High Sierra
which got me thinking can we actually
make this a usable MacBook for 2018
thankfully this is back when Apple made
mac books that you could kind of work on
so the first thing we see is our 250 gig
hard drive which that guy's definitely
get out of here
there's also the optical drive which
we're going to be replacing the battery
it still technically works in this
machine but it's pretty old so we're
gonna replace that get the memory this
is uh not that bad looking to work on
now depending on what you're doing
normally you actually don't have to
remove the battery but because we just
need to swap it out anyway is just gonna
make it a little bit easier to get some
of the other components you with that
out of the way now I'm going to remove
the hard drive so even though the true
particular card drive in here actually
does work just fine we've got something
just a little faster mind so next step
is to remove the optical drive now well
it is kind of nice to have it here I
actually want to go with raid SSDs
because you know we do practical things
on the channel there we go cable out we
have one optical drive that has been
freed from our MacBook now now we're
ready to start rebuilding the $200
MacBook so the main reason to remove the
optical drive is to use an O WC data
doubler the idea here is that instead of
being able to waste all that space on
DVD drive which honestly I'm never going
to use we can actually put an additional
SSD inside the idea here is that we
should just be able to drop it right
into place if I can flip it the correct
orientation
it should just sit like that and give us
our SSD one of the main things that
makes an older computer like this feel
slow is the mechanical hard drive but we
can fix that with a pair of 500 gigabyte
WD blue SSDs now one of these by itself
would probably be pretty quick however
two of these in raid it's gonna be a
little goofy
so we think with that we have our first
SSD installed all I need to do is put
this bracket back in place and we can
move on to the next one perfect so now
we have one terabyte of SSD storage and
our lowly $200 MacBook the next step is
to upgrade the memory so this laptop
originally shipped with two gigs of RAM
and at some point someone upgraded it to
four however it does technically support
eight gigs of RAM I'm gonna say there's
something cool about the idea of taking
a MacBook that for most people is kind
of considered old and obsolete and
actually giving it some love it's kind
of weird to think that in the future new
computers really are not this upgradable
it's pretty much like you get what you
get and that's all that there is to it
now we have the fun part this is a
replacement battery so this original
battery is totally fine but the issue is
because it's so old and it has so many
cycles well it does keep a charge it's
going to last 20 or 30 minutes and a lot
of MacBooks at this age the battery is
just completely flat but the good thing
is you can still order replacements off
of Amazon now generally speaking I don't
recommend getting third-party batteries
for laptops however in this case you're
not gonna have any luck trying to get
one straight from Apple so this should
actually work just fine
alright it is moment of truth time to
plug this guy in in case the battery is
actually dead out of the box she was
charging Hey
so it should give us yeah the disk error
because there's no OS installed but that
looks like we actually might have a
working MacBook now comes the fun of
replacing the keyboard now there's
nothing wrong with the keyboard that's
on this right now
coverts the older white style whereas
what we ordered here is a set of MacBook
Pro keys which should look a little
cooler there are a couple of ways of
doing the keyboard swap but what we did
was we just removed a bunch of the keys
and swapped them out with the black ones
if you really want to go crazy with it
you actually can't replace the entire
keyboard all in one piece however that
requires you to basically take apart the
entire computer if you guys caught our
first video one of the biggest problems
with this guy is that not only is the
back panel a little bit scratched up but
there's also a crack in the actual
screen assembly so what we could
actually swap out the entire shell
that's also a lot of work and instead we
can just cover it up so this is a
semi-transparent shell so first of all
it's gonna look a lot nicer than these
scratched up bottoms we have here but in
addition to the
keyboard cover which we don't meet
because we have a legit keyboard now we
also have a bottom shelf for it well
maybe this isn't the best looking back
book in the world it's a lot better than
it was before but my real question is
what exactly can you do on this MacBook
in 2018 after using the MacBook for a
week or so I've got to say it's actually
surprisingly usable through normal stuff
like listening to Spotify writing things
up with Google Docs and juggling a few
tabs it feels downright snappy I'll
totally admit using two SSDs is complete
overkill so I wanted to run the both in
raid however the way that high CR
actually handles raid right now is a
little bit buggy so I ended up just
installing the OS to a single drive but
it still makes a huge difference it's so
much faster jumping up to eight gigs of
ram also makes a big difference Mac OS
especially the more recent versions
really do appreciate at least eight gigs
one of my big worries going into this
was that the Core 2 Duo just wouldn't be
able to hold up and while yes a
processor from 2009 and a laptop doesn't
sound too impressive we actually run it
through Geekbench it's not bad it's
right up there with modern-day kind of
lower end parts such as Celeron and
Pentium now don't get me wrong throw
more than a few different tasks at it at
once and it will definitely start to
slow down but as long as you treat it
with the respect that a 2009 MacBook
deserves you can definitely get work
done on this guy and a big part of that
is because it is running a fully
up-to-date version of Mac OS hi Sierra
sure who knows if it'll ever receive
another major mac OS update and some app
just don't like the Core 2 Duo but for
the most part it's just like using a
modern MacBook you're pretty much
getting all the features including
iMessage and even Siri what's especially
impressive is that even some high-end
apps like Final Cut work and I'm being
serious you can load up some 1080p video
4k is a little bit too much for the
MacBook to handle and even the most
recent version of Final Cut 10.4 is
actually able to handle it pretty well
now you will need some patience when it
comes to the render side of things but
again this is a 2000 I Mac book that I
bought off of ebay for $200 and I'm
editing actual HD video inside Final Cut
so yeah while our keyboard soif really
isn't for anything besides show it does
still hold up today so now I doesn't
have a lot more travel but it just feels
a little bit more natural than the newer
butterfly switches and current Mac books
I've also been pleasantly surprised with
the trackpad somehow almost 10 years
later this is still better than most
Windows laptops
so you're getting everything you'd like
including that solid tracking you're
getting plenty of multi-touch gestures
like three fingers to swipe between
spaces and more importantly it just
feels natural something that so many
trackpads
do not get especially when you're paying
$200 porn-wise while I do miss USB 3.0
mini DisplayPort is nice if you on go
out to an external monitor up to 2560 by
1600 and resolution and MagSafe is still
one of my favorite ways of charging a
laptop ever even with that fresh battery
though you shouldn't expect 20 18 levels
of battery life so I'm averaging about
three or four hours with moderate usage
you can get a little bit more if you
turn the screen brightness down but it's
just kind of okay so should you go out
and load a 2009 MacBook with a terabyte
of SSD storage probably not but unlike a
lot of our builds this actually makes
sense picking up a used MacBook and
investing in some upgrades like the
battery memory as well as an SSD really
will get you an experience that is going
to be better than a lot of budget
laptops honestly I would rather use this
so what do you guys think about our
super awesome ultimate 2009 macbook this
is actually taking a turn I didn't
expect but it's actually kind of cool
anyway let me don't you guys think and I
will catch you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
