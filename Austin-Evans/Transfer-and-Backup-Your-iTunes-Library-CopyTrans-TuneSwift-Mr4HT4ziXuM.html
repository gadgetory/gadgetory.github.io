very cool program called copytrans tuned
Swift Tim's lips allows you to back up
your entire iTunes library so that
includes your music your videos your
apps even your full iphone and ipod
touch backups now one of the major
reasons why you'd want to use tuned
Swift is for example if you're
reinstalling your operating system or
perhaps you're upgrading to a new
computer all you need to do is plug in
an external hard drive or something
similar and you can just copy all of
your iTunes data very quickly and very
simply over to the new computer so let
me go ahead and give you guys a quick
demo of the program so the first step is
to open up the website which I of course
will have in the description of this
video now typically this is a pay
program however by using the activation
code that you guys see right here you
can use it totally free until March
fifteenth so definitely get on this as
soon as possible again I need to do is
just click the download here button and
just copy and paste that activation code
and we're going to be good to go so now
let's open up the program they let me
show you how it had to do it so the
first step is going to be open up the
activation tab and click the activate
button now at this point all you need to
do is just punching the activation code
again just copy and paste it from the
website you're going to be good to go
you don't need to you know giving you
information pay anything just paste the
code in you're going to be good to go
now let's go over to the main tab where
you'll see three things transfer backup
and restore and now the first step is to
go into the backup tab and there you'll
see full backup and latest changes full
backup is what you're going to probably
want to do first this is going to of
course just back up your entire library
you know just really quite simply
however it can take quite a while so you
know just chill like your you let your
computer go for a little while I mean of
course some libraries can be on the
hundreds of gigabytes so just be patient
with this one another also is another
option called latest changes which let's
say for example you got your computer
and you know you've been using it for a
couple of weeks and you need to redo a
new backup well you can just simply add
you know the four five new songs you've
got and it'll add it up no problem
without having to spend forever with a
full backup now the next option is
restored though this works just as you
would imagine it allows you to restore a
backup file so all you do is just select
the backup file and pick out your iTunes
library folder hit restore it will take
care of all the work for you so you can
just restore from a backup just like
that now the major part of this program
is the transfer now what this allows you
to do is from a Windows computer you can
transfer your
our iTunes library over to another
windows computer or an OS to machine
this is very handy is it allows you to
do it without any major hassle just
follow the simple step-by-step procedure
and you will be done in no time anyway
guys that's it for my video on copytrans
tuned Swift this is a very useful
program that allows you to move your
iTunes a data over really quickly and
simply so definitely recommend check it
out that do keep mind that you need to
do it before marks fifteenth while it
still is free anyway guys if this video
helped you out be sure to give me a
thumbs up because that really does help
me out anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
