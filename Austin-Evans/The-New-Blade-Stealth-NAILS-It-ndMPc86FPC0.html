blade stealth and it might just be my
perfect laptop what I've been looking
for is a thin and light 13-inch laptop
which has a quad-core processor
dedicated graphics and decent build
quality now the closest is something
like that I found will be the 13-inch
MacBook Pro with touch bar but at $1,800
it still lacks those dedicated graphics
fast-forward to 2019 though and we have
the Razer Blade stealth with pretty much
everything I've ever dreamed of it's a
20-19 lattice is the 2019 razor blade it
counts razor have been making the blade
stealth for a few years at this point
while they steadily tweak the design as
well as improved the performance it
still been an ultrabook and not a gaming
PC sure you could plug in a razor core
with the external GPU and be able to get
some decent gaming performance but up
until the 2018 model you were still
limited to the dual core and it just
wasn't quite the full package whereas
this guy can game right out of the box
because it does have those dedicated
graphics the base model does still come
with Intel integrated graphics but if
you opt for the mid spec or higher you
do get the NVIDIA MX 150 inside of
course you're not going to blow away the
50 inch blade as far as gaming
performance goes but it's a huge step up
over just having integrated graphics
another design unlock a fair bit of
gaming as well as video editing but
importantly this is not the standard MX
150 it is the higher 25 watt TDP version
which does come with four gigs of gddr5
memory for example fortnight is no
problem we're easily able to play at a
ap medium here and we're getting
anywhere between 45 to 60 frames per
second
black ops 4 is also totally playable
here at 1080p on low now the frame rates
pretty solid we're getting 45 to 50 if
it was me I would sacrifice just a
little bit of resolution to smooth it
out and get us saw it locked 60 but it
is totally playable this stealth has
also been updated with the latest
whiskey Lake processors in this case the
only option is the core i7
8650 you 86 60 80 565 you it's the new
one it's the one that boosts like 4.6
gigahertz so on top of it being a
quad-core processor the nice thing here
is that we actually have that extra
turbo boost speed to make it feel very
responsive now I take a look at a lot of
laptops lately and some of them do feel
a little bit slower when they don't
quite boost as high but this feels just
as fast as pretty much any kind of
gaming PC that I would try for normal
web browsing and stuff that you do every
single day
this mid spec model I have here is
outfitted with 16 gigs of dual channel
memory and that's backed up by a 268 m
vm e drive which is really quite fast
put it all together and if I was
building my dream 13 laptop this is
pretty much what I would choose a great
CPU decent GPU speeds as well as the
rest of the specs all wrapped up in a
nice aluminum package the entire design
is new this year so this means that we
have smaller bezels which means this is
the entire laptop is a little bit less
wide it's also got a more squared-off
design and it's all of course made out
of this matte black aluminum I think not
only does it look nice but importantly
it also feels nice part of the reason it
feels so good is because it does start
life as a giant chunk of aluminum which
is then CNC milled down to the actual
body that we have here
razor is one of the very few companies
who does this in addition to Apple it
does make a difference to the build
quality and just the general Hebden
we're not have to guess but the general
feel like it's a very rigid sort of
premium feeling laptop the only slight
issue is that with my pre-production
unit there is a little bit of flex on
the bottom of the chassis
however I actually did get to take a
look at another blade stealth and that
didn't have this problem so I'm assuming
it's just an early issue remove a few
Torx screws on the bottom and you'll
have easy access to the internals of the
laptop so there's not a lot that you can
work on here so the SSD is user
upgradeable if you would like
unfortunately the RAM is started down
but it is actually a really nice little
design here and importantly you can see
they have completely redesigned the
thermal solution mostly because you know
they added a full GPU inside so we've
got two fins there's also a decently
sized 53 watt hour battery and that's
good my experience for somewhere between
6 to 7 hours of battery life I just
realized why does it say Pro on the
inside it's like a prototype oh oh yeah
it as a prototype won't get Pro mean oh
right because they send me a
pre-production unit the ports have also
been slightly tweaked in addition to the
Thunderbolt 3 port and two USB AS we
also now have a secondary USB C port as
opposed to HDMI good stuff
then there's the screen now a paper this
is actually a downgrade so we're going
from an 1800 P touch screen down to a
1080p non-touch display
I actually prefer this though and a big
reason it is battery life so going down
to 1080p means we have to push a lot
less pixels and on top of that it's one
of the new ultra efficient
one-and-a-half watt panels which helps
to contribute to that pretty decent six
to seven hours of battery life now if
you do really want to touch screen a
more resolute
there is a 4k touch-panel option as far
as I'm concerned that this is the sweet
spot it's helped by excellent inputs so
now that do we have a windows precision
touchpad here but I don't know what kind
of wizardry razors doing this is a
monthly nicest I've ever tried on any
Windows laptop now that doesn't have a
very smooth glass surface but the
tracking is really really on par with a
lot of the best laptops on the market
then there's the keyboard now it is
using custom Razer switches and to my
taste I wish you'll be just a little bit
lighter but I think a lot of people will
be very happy now for typing but also
with gaming on the sky and of course it
does have the full chroma RGB support to
customize that however you want
the speakers are also great so specially
has like quad speaker set up so it has a
pair of 2 watt speakers on either side
as far as the laptop goes again it
sounds really good are you sensing a
trend here the razor blade stealth does
a lot of things very very well what's
not so great is the webcam as you guys
can see it's fine it is 720p but the
main issue here is if the windows hello
support which is included just doesn't
work all that reliably it's rare that I
review a laptop that does so much right
Razer definitely did their homework with
the blade stealth this year the only
thing I can really dig them for is price
to get that MX 150 which you really
should opt for if you do have the Razer
Blade stealth you have to get the mid
spec model which does come in at a
pretty expensive $1600 considering the
entire package though it's so dope that
really can't even complain it's so dope
I can't complain that's a the tagline
for the for the website there's if you
want to put that on the on the accolades
it's so dope I can't complain awesome in
2018 feel free</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
