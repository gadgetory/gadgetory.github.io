episode d3 live so today we're going to
be talking about a pretty big topic that
I think is going to be a lot of people's
minds this year which is a big title
comparison between the ipad to the
motorola xoom and of course the
blackberry playbook now last year was
definitely the year of the ipad there's
no question about it Apple pretty much
create a segment that was you know just
absolutely tiny and turned it into a
phenomenon I mean you really everywhere
you look people you know just buying
iPads people are using iPads I passage
you deal however this year I'm not so
sure it's going to be quite so simple as
there are a bunch of really really good
competitors namely the motorola xoom as
well as the blackberry playbook addition
to a lot of others however today I'm
just going to go ahead and focus on
these three tablets so to start out with
let's go ahead and talk a little bit
about the blackberry playbook now I was
letting able to go ahead and get a
fairly extensive hands-on of this at CES
this year and I came away very impressed
the BlackBerry PlayBook is a really
solid tablet it's got a really a lot of
really cool features so some of the
things that kind of stood out to me is
it has a 7-inch display I mean this is
not particularly revolutionary or
anything but when you consider it
against the the 9.7 inch display the
ipad the 10.1 inch display of the
motorola xoom it definitely does make a
difference you know so it fair bit
smaller however that's not really all
that bad of a thing in my opinion can
you go ahead but it's a lot easier to
move around doesn't quite it's not quite
so bulky you can put fit in smaller bags
and you know a lot of time I kind of
prefer the 7-inch form factor now in
addition to that though it still is the
full tablet experience it has a dual
core processor we don't know exactly
what it is but we do know that it's
really powerful I'm gonna do you
actually see yes I was able to watch or
actually I was able to use it opened up
a 1080p video and land a fairly
graphically intense game at the same
time which is pretty awesome just for a
compl at top in general much less a
tablet some of the other cool things
about the PlayBook is that it has a
1080p rear-facing camera and 720p
front-facing camera so overall I really
really looking forward to the blackberry
playbook I know we should be seeing it
here in the next few months it will be
available on sprint 4G movie scribe see
on more carriers as well as a Wi-Fi only
all I kind of stuff but
you know that at the very least it will
be available with the sprint 4G network
so the BlackBerry PlayBook is definitely
one to keep your eye on this year I'm
moving on with us go ahead and talk a
little bit about the motorola xoom again
this is another one the tablets it was
announced at CES or rather it was the
only tablet I one of the only major
tablets is announced at CES I was also
able to get a pretty good hands on of
this as well same story with the
playbook I really do like the motorola
xoom it's got a lot of really cool
features one of the biggest ones in my
mind is the fact that it does run
android 3.0 honeycomb now this unlike me
what you might seen in the galaxy tab is
a totally reworked version of android is
made specifically for tablets and the
zoom is going to be the first tablet to
go ahead and use this operating system
so some of the cool things about android
3.0 is that it just works really well
under the nice large screen no i just
said this but i really want to emphasize
you know if you ever saw the galaxy tab
you'll know that it's just the phone
operating system just kind of tweaked a
little bit we have pulled in you know
stretching everything just walk on a
tablet what if the zoo is made one
hundred percent and of course honeycombs
made one hundred percent to work on a
tablet this means that there are none of
those little kind of compromises and
kind of little just weird things that
are going on everything should run
really nicely and smoothly on the nice
10.1 inch display which is an
incidentally at 720p display so delta
should be a very nice screen but moving
on also does have the nvidia tegra 2
chipset so this is a dual-core one
converge processor should be plenty of
power to you know go through KP video
play a lot of games all kinds of those
things that you expect to do on a tablet
now the zoom is actually going to be
available on verizon 3g here in the next
few months again we don't have the exact
release dates but should be here you
should be out within the next few months
or so i'm going to be available with
verizon 3g and you can actually upgrade
it a little bit later on the year to a
verizon 4g potentially go ahead and just
update it fairly simply now as far as
the price we don't know about this one
either some people will said upwards of
perhaps eight hundred dollars i think
that might be just a little high i'm not
home to try i'm going to even believe
that so I'm glad news reserve my
judgment till they actually
but overall i'm also very impressed with
the motorola xoom now lastly let's talk
a little bit about the apple ipad 2 now
this is something that while it's not
official like the other two and I've
actually never seen one as well nobody's
really seeing one but we as well not
myself as well as a lot of other people
have really been speculating about it
doing research area things they look
like and give you guys a pretty complete
picture of what we should be seeing here
around April or so so the ipad choose
going to be looking mostly a incremental
upgrade it's not going to be some
revolutionary redesign where you're not
going to be run OS 10 and have a 35 inch
display a guy that's gonna be mostly the
same just with some important tweets one
of the first things is that it likely
will have a high resolution display now
I'm not going to get into what they're
going to call it you know retina display
or not Retina display it's mostly just
kind of you know talk but what I do
believe is it it very well we'll have a
much higher resolution display perhaps
somewhere in the range of about 2048 x
1536 don't quote me on that exactly but
I think that's about the resolution a
lot of people are talking about so I
wouldn't be surprised if it does have a
much higher resolution display should
look really really nice although I
wouldn't have sent guarantee on that one
some of the other cool things that
should be just kind of tweaked as far as
the design goes so it should be a little
bit thinner should be a little bit more
tapered on the ends kind of like the
change between the 2nd 3rd generation
iPod Touch to the 4th generation if you
ever seen one of those they just kind of
a just flatten the back and kind of
taper it off a little bit which I
definitely think should be cool I'd also
will have an SD card slot now this is
something that I'm really looking
forward to as I do a lot of picture and
video pictures and video so it would be
really nice to have an iPad with me so I
go film a video I take some pictures we
just pull the SD card right into the
ipad and be good to go and one other
thing is that it should have a dual core
processor so most likely the Apple a5
the AAA the a9 what are they decided to
call it but a dual-core processor very
similar to the other two tablets now
this one we know a little bit more about
we know a little bit less about so do
keep all this stuff you know with a
little bit of grain of salt because none
of it 100 confirmed but what I will tell
you is that we will see a new iPad
next couple months it should be a pretty
good effort okay so for the second
segment III live we will be taking live
questions from everyone in the chat so
we have a ton of people in here today as
always with every episode III lied it's
filling the block in front of blog TV so
I just take some questions from
everybody in the shed um what title has
the best display um that's a pretty good
question it's kind of it's kind of hard
to answer um the PlayBook has a decent
display but it's not going to be
anything spectacular so I'm going to be
a 1024 x 768 I believe but I do know
that it's not going to be particularly
high resolution now the motorola xoom
will have a 720p display which is pretty
good however if the rumors are true the
ipad is going to have a really really
nice display so i would probably bet on
the ipad and it ends up just having the
same display and probably the zoom well
I get any of the tablets I hope so yeah
on that hamster sure I've waiting to go
ahead and kind of see little bit more
about them you know the prices are kind
of stuff but yeah I absolutely plan on
getting my hands on as many of these
tablets as I can do I think that Apple
has a huge problem with all the new
tablets coming out you know that's
actually yeah that's kind of something I
was kind of talking a little bit about
earlier yeah I do think that they do
have a problem now problem is kind of a
subjective thing I don't think that all
these tablets are going to make it where
people are never going to buy it at the
ipad or anything like that but bit last
year that was pretty much the only
tablet I mean yeah the galaxy tab came
out get okay but nowhere near you know a
big enough rivals to the ipad so last
year apple just sold as many ipads they
could make pretty much this year um i
think there will be more competition now
whether that means that you know that
it's going to really hurt the ipad with
all these new tablets or not unless
that's just going to kind of just we'll
just have to see about that but i do
think that the very least will be a lot
more competition for apple this year um
what do I think of the multitasking on
the PlayBook is it a webos rip off now I
actually some oil that's kind of a hard
thing to say I mean you can say rip off
and all those kind of stuff but the
major thing is does it work and doesn't
work well and both those council works
absolutely phenomenally so the
blackberry playbook if you don't know
runs the cutest operating system it's
kind of custom made for the playbook and
from what I've seen is absolutely
excellent
you know the run and look quite similar
to webos oh that's not bad thing because
i'm also a big fan of webos in the way
it multitasks so somewhat guys they
definitely are fairly similar but they
both weren't excellently so I wouldn't
really know complain too much well the I
will Steve Jobs is will Steve Jobs's
what am I trying to say the word Steve
Jobs not being here going to hurt the
ipad 2 uh no I think it's going to say
how to help anything but the ipad 2 has
been pretty much done first well before
is the Steve left you need to keep mind
that he's not gone technically he's
still CEO and he's still going to be
involved in all the major decisions so
well he might not be around for the
day-to-day stuff you know when they say
hey Steve we're gonna launch the ipad 2
tomorrow he's gonna say sure or no you
know whatever so um I think that yeah
it's going to hurt Apple a little bit in
the long run if he doesn't come back but
for the short term I don't think it'll
make any difference at all i think the
ipad 2 is done it's going to be coming
out everything's already figured out so
i wouldn't worry about that which one
lad the best price again because we has
pretty much zero pricing information
about any of the three it's kind of hard
to say I would expect the ipad 2 to
probably remain about the same price as
the current ipad i actually would think
they're going to do it kind of like the
iPhone and make the current iPad go down
in price a little bit but I think I bet
you probably around five hundred dollars
in the United States and as far as a
playbook in the zoom it's going to kind
of depend on the normal price as well as
a subsidized so a lot of tablets if you
go ahead and buy a contract with the
carrier you're going to get a pretty
substantial discount so I would pluck
guessed the PlayBook would probably
probably be the cheapest just because
you can get it on sprint and I mentioned
it would be a pretty nice subsidy so
that will probably the cheapest but
again it's kind of hard to say right now
blackberry is going to ya blackberry is
probably going to be the better price it
is seems to be a look at a smaller
tablet which isn't a huge deal because
let's get a little bit smaller display
everything it's nice you know it's going
to make a big difference however since
it is smaller and since it will have the
you know the sprint which I imagine will
have a subsidy ya think the PlayBook
will be probably the cheapest on how
will the multitasking work on motorola
xoom mule is actually a good question
they have showed off a fair bit of the
cashing this far i'm at now the
multitasking but as far as a droid 3
point oh honey cone however i hadn't
actually seen exactly how it works now i
might be totally wrong they might have
already shown that but i do believe this
is probably somewhat similar to the way
the Android works but again I actually
did not see the multitasking in action
when I have my hands on it so I other
they can't say I think the ipad will be
thinner yeah I think it will be a bit
thinner I don't think it's going to be
you know razor thin or anything like
that but I do think it will be
substantially better maybe you know a
fair bet I don't think it's going to be
a lot thinner but it should be somewhat
there so anyway guys that's it for this
