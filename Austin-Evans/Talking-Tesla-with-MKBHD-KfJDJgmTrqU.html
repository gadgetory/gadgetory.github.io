a model three so now we're gonna do a
Q&amp;amp;A video because that makes sense
do it how long do you think it'll be
until smartphones will be able to shoot
8k video when will we get an 8k sensor
in a phone it's gonna be like Sonja's
gonna throw it in there in like a year
or two it's gonna be it's gonna happen
before we actually care what I mean
8k smartphone video probably will be
great like at all for any reason
probably should be like I'm going to
work with and probably look that much
better anyway but thank you think of the
Chris penis
how many pixel to excels can you fit in
your difference in height let's say it's
a 5 inches tall phone okay I'm just
ballpark
okay do we have more than one because I
think I got one and half of me right I
guess yes I'd say two we would try and
train this goes to here which is one
that's way taller than me too so it's
between one and two Austin you've never
talked about the Tesla Roadster
oh yeah you're she did a whole video on
the Roadster I did I I mean the hype is
super real but that that cars not coming
out for another at least two years to
2020 so you know if you're if you're the
type of person to buy a car without ever
seeing it and and just seeing at an
event then you'd be really into the
Roadster or ya know whatever model 3 for
real though the roadster is interesting
I'm curious I think the spec that
they've announced are crazy I mean like
actually crazy they're they seem like
targets because again we get model three
and we have all the numbers for it we're
kind of expecting a refresh from model s
where the numbers will kind of put
themselves somewhere between model 3 and
roadsters so not insane to me I'm just
excited to actually be able to drive so
when you get yours can I have already
absolutely oh that's gonna be a whole
video gonna be a serious yeah
howdy vs. Tesla we need a rates so D
versus Tesla I could beat you in the
model 3 if I'm pretty sure the Model S
of 1 well which out-eat is a question my
RS 3 oh well then yeah I hope you would
beat it yeah well I couldn't be dress
great though I think I could beat your
ass around a liquor right I like a
racetrack that look at a drag race you
definitely beat me in a straight line
hey sis I think that was videos I think
I would take him I really think I would
take you think you beat me on ER like an
actual like Road yeah because nothing
closes in us in a straight line on model
we definitely say you would have to have
some pretty dope turning cornering a
bill
to make up for that thought might bring
something hard to how did you guys both
first meet I'm gonna shoot a number that
I have an event in mind that I think is
this is the gala has three launch okay I
was gonna say a samsung launched in New
York City but yes sounds about right so
Samsung Galaxy s3 Samsung does this
thing every year they bring out in
influencers youtubers to their events
while the phone gets announced and we
get to play with it and this is the
first one I to everyone to see and I
think it we'd probably coordinated and
say how I'll be there I'll be there too
but we finally walk in and like down at
the corner at the end of the room Austin
like pops over and goes yo with my giant
stupid shirt yeah and it but it's always
weird cuz like people online you feel
like you know them already I feel like
you've met them and you've already had
conversations hey what's up how I'm good
how are you
but then you actually meet them and it
still feels like a continuation of that
and if you're me I'm like oh wow you're
tall well I get that a lot
yeah let's get in the car yeah let's do
it on the Sun it's pretty darn hot right
now what's your favorite camera for
YouTube I would say the a 6300 or 6500
especially I think that it is kind of
expensive but considering that you're
getting a great 4k image you're getting
the embody stabilization autofocus is
pretty good it's complete and good for
the price yeah eight so I a 6500 I've
shot with and it compares well to a 7r
if you've never used one
yeah which I've used a lot also for
video and do you know the way oh I know
to wait can you do this did you talk
about your best you did a best of CES
video but the gemenese favorites that
really stood out from this year or just
CES in general see the assumption oh it
wasn't actually that great this year
okay yeah I felt jaded saying that but
it's just there wasn't a lot of exciting
stuff like I feel like most years
there's like a couple things like oh wow
I can't believe this and this year there
are some good things but there's nothing
I just like lost my mind like oh man I
can't wait to get this like it was just
kind of it was decent a lot of decent
stuff I think what happened is companies
have realized that their biggest
announcements
deserve their own event in a sense so
they save those for their own event
later in the year now and as a result
you don't get those massive new product
announcements at CES among all the other
hype and noise instead you get these
sort of I don't want to call them
vaporware but these sort of fluff pieces
like I throw a work like that around I
mean I don't want to point any fingers
but like you see like razors
triple-headed laptop or like you see
this rollable TV and you don't really
know when it's coming tomorrow right
that's the kind of stuff you see at CES
yeah that's kind of a guess it's like
concepts yeah what do you want to see in
the pixel 3 ooh
I'm not garbage tone screen will be
pretty high up there that is definitely
something I'd want yeah as far as things
that are wrong with it because the rest
of the question is was the screen the
only thing that prevented it from being
the first perfect smartphone there's no
such thing there's it there you go
there's no perfect smartphone but that
was the biggest part of what I would say
turn people away from an otherwise
excellent phone I will see a pixel 3
like standard size with the almost bezel
is displayed because I feel like for me
the pixel 2 is actually like a really
nice size so true yeah so I would love
to see it's sort of like a middle ground
like that where it's still a couponer
dollars cheaper than the XL that was
question for you are you a fan of these
rounded corners every phone has now I
don't mind them I think it looks weird
on Sun like I feel like this because it
actually has its bezel less but still
has a reasonably big bezel I think it
looks a little weird it looks better on
stuff like the s8 or the iPhone I was
I'm not a fan yeah I know like every
phone has rounded corners now but I'm
still like a lady you do rounded corners
when you have to do rounded corners not
just as a design state razor phone is
that boxy phone it's got the boxy
corners and I think it works
you gotta get those 15 extra pixels
exactly what are the cheerio boxes all
about what are they all about you know
they represent
freedom freedom totally work the freedom
to choose your own breakfast cereal
without other people judging you for it
to put it wherever you want in the
background of your YouTube videos on
your channel no matter what the subject
that's what Cheerios represents I think
you're just a giant iOS fanboy and the
Cheerios are just your sub way of
playing it in their cheer I owe s what
are you guys's funniest tech flops or
disaster stories accidental drops saying
the wrong thing a video accidentally
deleting footage I mean that's I think
I've done all those things we definitely
drop do you delete an entire video on
her channel well or not from the channel
while we were like editing so the most
recent one was I went to go edit a video
I plugged the drive in and they like
ejected in the middle of loading the
project completely nuke the project yeah
we've also just accidentally like left
footage and like another drive Ocoee
where was that and it was like already
like wiped and stuff right okay so I've
actually excellent dropped them phone or
anything though opposite of you I have
accidentally dropped the phone ma as
recent as the 1+5 okay for my review I
had it before embargo oh no dropped it
didn't shatter it or anything but I've
had some good chunks out of the corners
of it before I even shot any of my
footage but luckily I had so much
meeting with them right after that in
between then and the review so I showed
it something I was like you mind if I
get another one and I actually did so
that was pretty cool seeing crispy Live
2.0 when no do I do another one I kind
of do I don't know about when but a lot
of work to put the first one together I
would love to like take all that effort
and put it somewhere like east like New
York or or another location we do that
LA one which is awesome yeah I think it
would be rewarding to do it again yeah
it was just a lot of work because
essentially if you guys aren't familiar
team crispy live was a live stage show
we did probably two years or so ago no
yeah at least we basically rented out
like a whole amphitheater is like 500
seats and we proceeded to be not
entertaining for two hours and say hello
to everyone so had questions we talked
to people you premiered a video right or
nope you showed off behind the scenes of
the video yeah we did it behind the
scenes we showed some never-before-seen
stuff
I signed a lot of people's phones
through that was so scary
are you sure I don't want to ruin your
family faced a lot of electronics oh
that was a fun time
yeah all right jeepers me too maybe so
with that I think we have a very
successful QA however we are not done
yet Oh No
because marques I think we're about to
go and have some fun in a Model 3 this
is a thing that's happening today
tomorrow the next day this is the whip
for the week we're gonna make a video
about it are you ready for that have you
subscribed yet I hope so
stay tuned you heard him</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
