of issues Microsoft really delivered
when it came to the surface pro 3 now
we've got a smaller and cheaper version
but is the surface 3 worth it looking at
the design Microsoft has a nice looking
package here it's solidly built out of
magnesium and it feels durable enough to
handle normal wear and tear easily we
now have a three by two aspect ratio
which goes a long way in making the
surface more usable as a tablet it's
still good for watching video but it's
now actually usable in portrait mode
you'll also find the built-in kickstand
and this is a big part of the surface
pair it with the type cover and you've
got a device that transforms from laptop
to tablet in a few seconds it resembles
the iPad Smart Cover but on top of
protecting the screen you've got a
surprisingly decent keyboard pop open
the kickstand and this is a pretty
decent little laptop although the stand
can be a little uncomfortable to use on
your lap after a while as you might
expect there's not a ton of travel and
it's slightly smaller than a normal
keyboard but it's totally usable and the
addition of adjustable backlighting is a
nice touch there's also a trackpad
tucked below the keyboard it works well
but it's a hoe most commonly tiny you've
got the touchscreen as well but I found
myself falling back to the trackpad
quite a bit when using the normal
desktop the biggest problem with the
type covers price it runs a steep $130
the surface is totally usable with a USB
or bluetooth keyboard but the type cover
really completes it which makes it
basically a must-have
unlike previous models the surface 3 is
running full Windows 8.1
that's upgradeable to Windows 10 later
on that means you can run basically all
Windows apps like Chrome and that's a
huge advantage for a more tablet
experience there's the modern UI
which is much more touchscreen friendly
and the app ecosystem is getting better
but I spend the majority of my time on
the normal desktop Windows might not be
the best tablet OS but it's easily the
best option if you want to get work done
performance wise this is definitely
closer to the tablet side of things
we've got a quad-core Intel Atom x7 2
gigabytes of RAM and 64 gigs of storage
which can be expanded with a micro SD
card for $100 more you can double it to
4 gigabytes of RAM and a 128 gigabyte
Drive which is pretty reasonable
cover throw in the tight cover and the
service can start to get expensive the
atom is reasonably powerful it's slower
than something like an ultrabook and you
won't want to spend all day in Photoshop
but it's good enough for lighter use
it's definitely not a gaming PC but you
can't play some lighter titles like
Minecraft and
of Legends if you don't mind playing on
lower settings the surface does have a
good selection of ports
we've got USB 3.0 which is useful since
with full windows you can plug nearly
anything in and it should work no
problem you can also power an external
monitor up to 1440p using mini
DisplayPort and there's a micro SD card
slot for expanding your storage tucked
behind the kickstand for charging
there's a micro USB port and while
having a standard port is nice it
charges slowly very slowly with the
included 13 watt adapter it takes hours
to fill up the battery and even longer
if you're using the tablet battery life
is good enough to get me through a full
day of moderate use but when it comes
time to plug it in you're going to be
waiting awhile get to the display and
you won't be disappointed
it's a 10-point eight inch panel with a
resolution of 1920 by 1200 it's got
great color and gets pretty bright
although I did notice the auto
brightness can sometimes get a little
confused in darker environments which
can be distracting while watching video
the surface also sports a pair of
front-facing speakers hidden away on
either side of the display they don't
get as loud as I'd like they sound
better than something like the iPad with
side or rear firing speakers the surface
3 is rocketing a 3.5 matrixyl
front-facing camera and actually
surprisingly decent so it's more than
good enough for things like Skype and
video calling and the rear facing camera
is actually not too bad either
well as long as you don't mind carrying
around the PC to take pictures with
anyway the surface 3 is a good tablet
it's also a good laptop the problem is
it's not really a great laptop and it's
not really a great tablet either at $500
it can do a lot more than most tablets
but add the tight cover and upgrade the
storage and it's solidly into laptop
territory it's not for everyone but if
you want to tablet the can get work done
the surface 3 is worth it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
