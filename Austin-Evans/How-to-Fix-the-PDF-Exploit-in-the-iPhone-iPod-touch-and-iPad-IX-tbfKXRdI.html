showing you how to prevent the big
exploit in iPhone iPod touch and iPad so
basically the way it works is that there
is a big gigantic hole and all the
iDevices will basically allow anyone to
totally overtake your device just like
you know you get a BIOS on Windows well
it's the worst the same way on your
iPhone and iPod touch and iPad basically
all you have to do is just go to any
website that is set up and it will
automatically without you having to do
anything besides just going to that
specific website will go ahead and
download your contacts literally do
anything it wants to do now actually the
jailbreak jailbreak me uses this hole as
well however this is okay as obviously
you're only going here and you actually
have to slide over this is actually
something you want to do and they're
only just jailbreaking they're not you
know trying to hack you
however after you've done this you will
probably want to go ahead and seal up
the hole or at least keep people from
activating it so easily contrary to what
a lot of people are saying right now but
actually this will affect anybody
whether your jailbroken or not now if
you're not jailbroken there is literally
nothing you can do than just to be sure
to stay on you know reputable websites
and just be really really cautious
however if your jailbroken throws a past
you can go ahead and download but while
it won't totally fix that bug it will at
least give you some warning before
someone tries to hack your iPhone or
iPod Touch so in-city go ahead and just
hit search come up to the top here you
can just type in P D yeah mm-hm so here
it is basically go ahead and just
download this basically it will give you
a warning whenever a PDF starts to load
somebody's go ahead and show you what
that means
so we're gonna go ahead and go back to
jailbreak me obviously this is this is
used as the PDF but in reality it would
probably be a website that would not
even give you wouldn't say slash
jeopardy it would just automatically do
it the second you touch the website
let's go ahead and just pretend we're
gonna do this and then here we go
instead of just automatically loading it
it will actually ask you do you want to
load the PDF as they could really give
you you know a lot of problems as far as
security and then people could hack you
know out kind of stuff if you I can go
ahead and continue to load if you know
someone you trust otherwise you're going
to cancel back out and you are totally
one
good to go anyway guys I just wanted to
share this a little bit of information
with you hopefully keep you know your
iPhones and iPods and even your iPad
safe I wouldn't really be extremely
worried about this even if you're not
jailbroken but still it's something that
if you are jailbroken it's really simple
to go ahead and add it and make sure
that you are secure and you're not just
going to be hacked and you know have a
lot of problems anyway guys thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
