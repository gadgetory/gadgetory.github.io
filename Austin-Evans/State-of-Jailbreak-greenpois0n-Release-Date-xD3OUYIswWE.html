another state of jailbreak video so
definitely some really good news the
release date for the next jailbreak has
been announced so basically what
happened is posix ninja the one of the
main guys behind the green poison
jailbreak recently let everyone know
that it will be coming out this Sunday
at 10 10 10 at 10:10 a.m. and I think I
might have added an extra 10 in there
but basically Sunday at 10 10 in the
morning
now I don't know what timezone or
anything like that but rest assured guys
it will be out sometime Sunday morning
so that's definitely great news I'm sure
a lot of you that absolutely myself
included with my iPod Touch 4th
generation right here um all of us have
been waiting it and really patiently for
the next jailbreak and so it's finally
gonna be here now just in case you guys
have any questions I'm just clearing up
really simply this jailbreak should be
able to pretty much do everything so it
should cover the new iPod Touch 4th
generation it should cover the iPod
touch as well as the 3rd and the 2nd
generation iPod touch I should handle
the iPhone 4 the iPhone 3GS the iPhone
3G as well as the iPad so guys pretty
much any device doesn't matter it should
all be work on four point one at least
perhaps and it might work on later
firmwares but the very least it should
work on four point one so guys that's
pretty much this is the jailbreak we've
been waiting for some people called it
shatter and which is the exploit that is
based off of but it will be called green
poison and it will be out this Sunday
barring any kind of crazy delays or
anything that the dev team has not has
not foreseen yet so pretty much just a
really simple video just letting you
guys know be ready Sunday of course I
will have this tutorial the second that
there the jailbreak is released I will
be all over and I will go ahead post a
full video tutorial showing you exactly
how to do it so no worries there anyway
guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
