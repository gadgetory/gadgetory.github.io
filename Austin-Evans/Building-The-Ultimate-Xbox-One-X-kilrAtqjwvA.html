the ultimate xbox one x now this has
been a very highly requested video so
much so in fact that we got an anonymous
letter from hongkong and giving us some
suggestions to include for the video so
with some of those in mind let's get to
building Nick Cage approves yeah so
everyone's probably familiar with the
wonderful look of the Xbox one x aka
it's just a black box which is where
this comes in this is going to be a scam
which is going to make our Xbox 1x look
a lot like an original Xbox which some
say it looks like an Xbox one so in the
picture they've got like the front of it
like it's got like the Xbox logo and
stuff but this is just a top skin
clearly wouldn't happen if this was deep
branch it's actually pretty much lined
up I'm slightly off center so you put it
side-by-side with the original Xbox it
actually doesn't look so bad I mean no I
wasn't a hundred percent precise but I
think it's close enough that uh I'll buy
that next up because we know just how
useful cooling fans and extra
attachments are for consoles we have
Natalie and intelligent cooling fan but
we also have a cooling dock with extra
USB ports so we've got three small
cooling fans it's going to plug in via a
USB and to be fair it does give us a USB
pass-through so I guess it just snaps on
something like this I mean that she does
kind of blend in whether this is going
to make any difference at all I am
incredibly doubtful of but luckily we
have a whole other cooling dock to keep
it even cooler for whatever it is that
we're doing on the next box which is
gonna make it overheat making it extra
it's pretty easy so we just do that wait
a minute so I see that there's a fan but
where is it pulling air from there's no
place for it to pull on the bottom on
the front on the sides why are the three
fans if they have no intake or exhaust
what this does give us is three more USB
ports up front one of the things we're
going to have to keep in mind with this
video though is that we have a lot of
things they're going to be requiring USB
so making sure that we have full USB 3.0
on as many force as possible is going to
be a challenge because a mere one
terabyte of storage space is not going
to be anywhere near enough the next step
is yet another
add on hub thing this is going to give
us not only the ability to plug in a
full 3.5 inch hard drive we're also
going to be getting even more USB ports
oh joy
that's pretty cool so it's actually got
a Scorpio on the front which would make
sense because this is a Scorpio version
of the console that now has a skin
covering all that up so people still
know we're cool so the idea here if it's
anything like some of the previous hubs
we used is that we'll be able to now I
plug in that three and a half inch drive
this is going to give us three more USB
3.0 ports on the front now with a three
and a half inch drive bay we can go
completely crazy and plug basically any
kind of desktop hard drive in here but
as opposed to doing a standard hard
drive instead we have a two terabyte
Seagate Fire CUDA and this is going to
be an sshd which means that in addition
to having two terabytes of capacity in
addition to having two terabytes of
capacity there's also a little bit of
flash storage on here which depending on
the game might not actually make a huge
difference to load time boo the very
least it should be a little bit quicker
than a standard hard drive one nice
touch is that you have everything you
need to do this as long as you have a
3.5 inch hard drive I do actually think
this will work with a two and a half
inch as well but you even have the screw
driver you have everything you need to
put on the sled and with that I think
you can well just put it in here so this
entire thing is going to operate using
the front USB 3.0 port on the Xbox so as
long as we're able to line that up we're
going to cover up the power button but
it has a little push button actually
it's clear too so you can see when it's
on and off it's gonna be a little tight
I guess it will work though huh the only
issue that I actually don't really like
with this is that as opposed to having
its own set of power cable which I will
admit is a little bit annoying instead
it's actually going to go on top of the
current power cable considering how much
power the Xbox one expose to just figure
eight cable seems a little sketchy also
our fan doesn't let this go in all the
way so following apart very quickly but
I it works right well three terabytes
might be enough for a normal Xbox one X
this my friends is the ultimate Xbox one
X which is where this comes in this
Seagate game drive with an additional
eight terabytes of capacity unlike the
rest of our accessories this is really
straightforward so instead of attaching
it directly to the Xbox it just needs a
USB cable but it does give us an
additional two USB
3.0 ports on the front of the Xbox to
think I was worried about not having
enough ports like five minutes ago so
with just an external power break and a
single USB cable we're now up to 11
terabytes of capacity which is where
this comes in
the Samsung t5 SSD this is actually
something we use on a daily basis here
at the office so all of our videos are
edited off of these t5 s and one of the
nice things is they come in really large
capacities this one is going to be a
full 2 terabytes of quick SSD storage
all running off of a single USB cable
almost said USBC cable but uh we got use
USB eight for this one I mean do you
need 13 terabytes on your Xbox one X
probably not do you need to build the
ultimate Xbox one X probably not are we
done building the Xbox one X absolutely
not
as far as controllers go we have a
couple of Xbox one design lab
controllers these are really cool
because you have a lot of customization
options for how the controllers look and
importantly there still is going to be
the same size which is important because
we have a dual charging station I mean
it doesn't really look pretty with our
design lab controllers but now we have
two controllers down and two more to go
if you really want the ultimate
controller for the Xbox one X though you
want the Duke so this is model almost
identically after the original Xbox
controller and while a little bit
controversial some might say it's a well
you'll see you'll see oh yeah that's
what I'm talking about
this is licensed by Microsoft even
though it's made by hyper Ken Wow that
looks almost identical to the original
for context this is what a standard Xbox
one control looks like and this is the
Duke it's massive I think you're
definitely going to be better at gaming
on a standard Xbox controller but the
coolest of this is just there's no way
to get around it now unfortunately this
is going to be a wired controller but
thankfully it's going to be a really
long cable and it is detachable with
micro USB as if all these controller
options weren't enough we also have the
commander this is actually something I
did a video on it's like two or three
years ago but the idea here is that this
is going to be an adapter that will turn
a mouse and keyboard into what the Xbox
thinks is a standard controller so
inside this little box well it gets a
little bit complicated but hopefully
won't be that bad so around front we
have a mouse keyboard and game pad I
think you actually have to have all
three plugged in because it pretends
to be the gamepad but it's actually
passing through the mouse and the
keyboard signal and then around back we
have another series of USB ports for
PowerPC game as well as data which looks
like a eighth inch check oh man this is
this is a lot welcome my friends to the
completed ultimate Xbox 1x and yes all
of these cables and accessories are
completely necessary so to start with
we're going to be showing you what the
commander will do we're going to be
spoofing it with the actual Xbox one
controllers you need to make sure this
is still plugged in but with that your
mouse your keyboard and everything
attached via USB we should be able to
play a game hey it works I mean it's
really really slow maybe we should've
turned out the mouse sensitivity a
little dude this actually doesn't feel
that different than playing on a PC I
mean there might be a touch of latency
if I try to move really quickly but it's
not that now there's definitely an
argument to be said this is going to
give you an unfair advantage but I mean
if you want to be more comfortable
playing with your mouse and keyboard
versus an Xbox controller and you don't
mind dealing with some Finnick enos it
is not the easiest thing to set up and
you do need to kind of keep it tuned per
game to make sure it has the correct
profile but you can download those
pretty easily now why do you have
weapons okay
well this is unfortunate this is very
unfortunate way my way I'm sure you know
nope wait I got that counts as a kill
right I blew up on them I would count
that as a kill Dave will be very proud
the duke on the other hand well it's
definitely a much larger controller
personally I do think that these
standard Xbox one controller is better
but anybody's kind of relative right the
Duke is a unique unique option it also
doesn't feel that bad so some of the
buttons are a little bit weirdly laid
out compared to the newer controller
especially stuff like the left and right
bumpers which feel kind of tacked on but
it works of course we're not here just
to play fortnight we have 13 terabytes
of hard drives to install a whole bunch
of other games if we want to as well so
right now if you go into the options we
have the internal hard drive we also
have another 7 point 2 terabytes from
that 8 terabyte drive over there we have
the 1.8 terabytes of our t5 and then we
have our 2 terabyte fire CUDA which is
in here
they'll actually show up and once you
give them a quick format I mean it kind
of works unlike a lot of the building
the ultimate series that we do this
actually all works all the accessories
are plugged in attached skins powered
USB Dwight ever you want to call it it's
all actually working now does it make
sense no of course not
am I going to put links to every single
one of these accessories that we used in
the description of course I am</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
