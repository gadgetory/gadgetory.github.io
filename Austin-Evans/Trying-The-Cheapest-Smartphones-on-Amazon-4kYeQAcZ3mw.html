cheapest smartphone available on Amazon
the poco phone f1 just kidding this is
for obscenely rich people these are the
actual cheapest smartphones we can find
on Amazon with prime shipping and huge
shout-out to LastPass for sponsoring
this video
LastPass relieves the stress around
keeping track of all of your passwords
and losing access to your accounts now
I've personally been using LastPass for
over five years now way before they ever
sponsored the channel with - pass you
never have to remember or write down
another password again not only will it
keep all of them safe and secure inside
your LastPass vault but on top of that
you can even generate random passwords
for each individual site you know if
you're one of those people who uses the
same one-two-three-four password on
every single site don't do that bad idea
use LastPass and LastPass even works on
sites as well as apps on mobile devices
such as iOS and Android you can even
unlock your vault with just your
fingerprint or face and with access to
advanced two-factor authentication
options such as a Yubikey LastPass it's
not only convenient but it's a safe way
of keeping all your passwords secure
online if you aren't already using
LastPass you should definitely check it
out at the link in the description again
huge shout out to LastPass for
sponsoring this video now let's get into
some cheap smartphones
starting out with we have the blue
advance a for one of the more popular
options on Amazon at $55 with nearly a
thousand reviews inside you will find a
quad-core processor but it's backed up
by only 512 megabytes of RAM eight gigs
of storage as well as the brand new and
incredibly cutting-edge Android 6.0 yeah
ok that's some very high-end packaging
but I hope the batteries in in this
because this is incredibly light Wow
so believe it or not this is actually a
4-inch display which at one time was
considered large for smartphone but this
this just seems tiny Wow we actually
have a lot of accessories Cinelli is
that our battery but there's also a case
we've got our micro USB for charging as
well as our power adapter and is that a
screen protector all right now bad 455
bucks
next up we had the kenzan v5 at a
whopping 51 dollars now this one this
one's got a little bit of a higher spec
I think yeah look at that we've got a
full one gig of ram a 1500 million power
battery as well as android 7.0
that's actually a lot better than six at
least oh wow that's that's very white
okay all right
oh wait it's gold on the back for style
it's definitely a little bit of a unique
look this is also another four inch foam
which by 2018 standards feels absolutely
tiny but I gotta say I actually kind of
don't hate it I miss the days of smaller
smartphones pop open the box and we had
the charger with an attached micro USB
cable as well look at that we've got
ourselves a headphone a pair of
headphones to be more specific it's very
impressive and what is I hope a package
yes that has a headphone jack
I need that last but not least we have
the do GX 10s now with a massive budget
of $62 this is the most expensive phone
here but if you take a look at the specs
it actually doesn't look too bad so on
top of having a 5-inch display instead
of 4-inch we do have a much larger 3300
milliamp hour battery and importantly
Android 8.1 or Yogo Edition wait a
minute oh I thought the phone was orange
for a second I got really excited so
wait so Nelly it has a case on it dude
this is actually a metal phone look at
that Wow so this does come with a screen
protector in the box as well as it looks
like to be a charger and the bottom we
have our micro USB cable and some random
accessories that I'm never gonna read so
with all three phones charged up and
updated let's start with the blue
advance a four
the issue here is that this just feels
ancient middle east made out of
incredibly cheap plastic but also the
hardware itself just feels really out of
date and I'm sure this is okay a couple
years ago but right now there's just
better phones even you're buying the
cheapest things on Amazon the Kin phone
I will definitely say has a lot of flair
kind of like the real Ken himself so
what I like about this is that it is a
little bit of a unique look right and I
think especially when you're talking
about a phone that costs you $50 it's
completely unlocked that you can get
straight from Amazon that's cool but
there are definitely some downsides and
the big one is the screen if you look at
it directly head-on it's okay but as
soon as you start tilting it off to the
side the viewing angles are well they
leave a lot to be desired on top of that
this is only a 480 by 800 screen that
resolution my friends should have been
left in 2010 where it belongs not in
2018 on a well to be fair $51
but which brings us to the do G a phone
which actually feels usable in 2018 so
first of all it's a bigger phone having
a 5-inch display instead of a 4-inch
panel looks a lot nicer and on top of
that it is a much nicer display it is
IPS and while the actual resolution is
still 480 by 854 the actual screen
itself it's much brighter it seems you
know usable and not garbage Talent like
everything else it also feels pretty
decent in the hand now yeah it is a
little bit on the heavy side if you pop
off the back what you do find is that
massive 3300 milliamp hour battery
you're sorry 30 360 million power
battery which is back here a little side
note with a digi phone you if you
actually buy one of these you actually
should take off the back panel because
there's a little plastic tab which keeps
the battery contacts from being
connected to the phone there's been a
time or two where I picked up a digi
phone and thought it was broken and I
just had to you know remove that piece
of plastic
protip of course we do have the included
pair of headphones that come with the
Ken phone which means that I've got a um
I guess I should listen to the radio
right does that seem fair I mean like
Jesus song I'm not doing this for no
reason I have to get serviced or I have
to get a radio station why am i
listening to radio on a $50 phone from
Amazon this is this is a poor choice of
my time this is running Android 8.1 go
edition now that's a fairly up-to-date
version of Android but importantly it
has almost no bloatware and there are go
specific versions of a lot of Google
Apps such as Gmail YouTube Google etc
now these are very very small versions
of the apps so you can kind of consider
them like lightweight versions and only
three to five megabytes for a lot of
them but what that means is that now is
it going to be nice on that small 8 gigs
of storage onboard but also gives you a
lot of other options to conserve things
like data what's nice about Android Go
is that it is specifically meant to run
on a very low-end device like this the
other phones are running standard
Android and while it kind of works it's
actually a bit of a smoother experience
here of course no phone comparison can
be complete without taking a look at the
cameras because you know a $50 phone on
Amazon to probably have a great camera
right so starting out with we have the
blue advanced a4 with a 5 megapixel rear
facing camera there's some color there's
like some blue and some black and a
little bit of
not spread not great not too
surprising but that's definitely not all
that impressive but we do have is not
only a two megapixel front facing camera
but it has a flash
Ready Set whoa that is straight potato
mode to be feared this is one of the
cheapest smart phones we can find on
Amazon but let's let's step it up to the
Kenji phone wow this is uh that's
impressive it literally took like five
seconds to take the photo and that is
awful that is that's not even funny
that's turn off HDR oh we've got the
makeup effects yeah let's turn on the
make-up effect I feel it that's gonna be
a good move hopefully that qualifies as
a makeup effect I think that qualifies
as the opposite of crispy that's the
softest photo I may have ever seen I'm
really hoping that doogee is able to
pull it out for us right now because
this is really depressing oh wow this
actually looks like a real camera so
take a shot here that's actually
perfectly respectable I mean it's not
super sharp it doesn't make any kind of
modern smartphone look bad but it is
much much better than the other two
switch over to that front facing camera
Wow look at that there's actual color I
mean there's not a lot of color but this
feels much more like a modern smartphone
I'm gonna say this do g4 a little over
$60 is really impressive especially
considering that it has that giant
battery inside going into this video I
had low expectations but I've got to say
considering just how much smartphone
you're able to get for so cheap it's
really actually not too bad and if
you're brave enough to give the cheapest
smartphones on Amazon a try the links
will be in the description but beware
it's actually not that bad
it just sounds spooky and scary if I
make it sound like they're all terrible
and in fact they actually just totally
reasonable sort of decently priced
respectful responsible clever choices
good way to spend your money</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
