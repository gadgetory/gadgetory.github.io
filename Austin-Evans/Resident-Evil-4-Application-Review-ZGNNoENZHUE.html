this duncan in state and here it's a
really cool application to you on a
really great app called
Resident Evil 4 I'm sure most of you
guys at least know about Resident Evil
PlayStation 2 and GameCube but this is
the mobile version we've been released
on some cell phones and stuff but this
is the first time spent on catch the
iPhone iPod Touch and it's it's really
quite good so uh let's get into it
hey okay so the first thing you'll
notice is that this has some really cool
graphics um they are really pretty cool
it's got some problems like the controls
but in general it's it's a pretty good
buy for $8 so you know let's just go
ahead and show you guys it's pretty
simple um there's two modes there's
mercenary mode which is somewhat like
individual like challenges almost and
there's just the story mode I'm just
going to show you the story mode it is
this is a lot of fun try might be a
little difficult you see great loading
times a little difficult for me to
control here but you skip through all
this stuff
nice try to show you guys some of the
gameplay and first thing you see they're
not you control so basically if you look
right here this right here is the entire
control idea you pull out your gun right
here and then you're moving stick turns
into a aim and obviously you can plot
your knife and anyway so let's just go
ahead and get just get it right into
this you see that really nice graphics
looks various books see this guy let's
just show you guys seen zombies see them
a lot of fun but yeah and then of course
as in all Resident Evil when they die
it's upset anyway so basically you can
walk around here and do later you want
like let's say let's try it opens for
it's locked like mr. was off basically
the story Resident Evil is pretty mean
pretty general and I squint got this
ladder probably pretty bad isn't trying
to play the game while talking here
right start that's that okay okay well
basically what my ejected is is I've got
to figure out what's going on here
they're zombies and there's a whole
backstory better that way um and you can
see here I'm kind of looks I got some
acts that mean I actually here let me
get a close I'll show you what happens
when they try to grab your hands to get
real close to him Wow
there you basically you gotta break free
that's kind of a cool little dynamic
Misha okay here we go here's a ladder
now if I want to race it up it's neat
little cutscene I just climb it up and
as you can see here he's kind of holding
himself because he's hurt
let me get this yeah climb up here and
then what's really cool is you can knock
over the ladder so they don't follow you
anyway so let's just go ahead and go
into the menu real quick you can go
through all the kinds of stuff I've got
like an animal or thing let me use my
first eight for eight to something a
little injured from that one guy and
they spent a time so now what I do is
just look around like these boxes I plot
my knife tag it I think somebody shoot
me
yep somebody is hanging from where I
don't know but someone was I think yeah
here is okay who use got rapid fire
attack it pretty much okay let's turn
around
similar injured um it's not a big deal
go pick up your nade nice reach down
here and blow this knife open you can
and you do it with my gun you waste ammo
but not Matt much ah what are these guys
comes Martha I'm not that far down okay
let's grab this shotgun yeah and I use
the fun part yeah shut your an area now
it's real simple to just scroll through
my shotgun just put it now is hitting
the fun stuff
now we got shotgun tonight I'll be not
got one messapus are they okay so now my
here's perfect are you dead there we go
yeah I love a shotgun anyway so let's go
and pick up whatever he dropped and
that's getting us going so um you can
see that this is just the first level
obviously oh great yeah you can see that
the battery works anyway okay
whereabouts
there's a gate around you're someone
actually and you walk by it but you can
see that the game is now you only
problem is the controls you can see her
not that great at all I mean there I
don't know I just don't think like it
that much
no I'm at heel no I'm good oh that guy's
still alive I mean anyway find anything
good um so basically sort of scum huh
you're trying to concentrate you can
sell the oh no I'm good great I'm dead
oh well I'm sneaking cuz one problem is
there's pretty long times in between the
between the levels when you have to when
you die and stuff you actually basically
started four until you get the
checkpoint takes well I don't want to
say yeah
I'm not a play if I try to show you guys
Danny I just die again and take a while
but Resident Evil 4 is a pretty good
game I'm liking it quite a bit right now
it's a little difficult the controls I'm
not a fan of the controls at all you
know they're kind of I just don't like
them I mean they're just a single pad I
mean you have to turn and do everything
I mean no you know they're not horrible
they're playable but they're just not
fun um that said though the fast-paced
game style is really great the story is
looking really good so far
like I said this one came out just just
I mean just very very recently so I
haven't gotten a chance to play through
it but for for just a little bit but and
you've got to say I do like it um
it's $8 little pricey but I'm liking it
definitely recommend you guys at least
go check it out it's a lot of fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
