announced a brand new keyboard more than
a few of you guys were interested in it
so when they announced a brand new
keyboard which is not only silent but
also much cheaper of course we have to
take a look at it this is the Razer
BlackWidow Lite keyboard now in ninety
bucks it's less than half the price if
that huntsman elite and with this you're
getting something that's a little bit
more focused on normal use as well as
gaming pop this guy open and we have the
keyboard itself now this is a little bit
of a smaller when compared to the elite
so it is a 10 keyless design but
personally I kind of don't mind that I
would rather have a little bit of extra
space wait a minute wait a minute so in
the box it says it has silent switches
with included rings but I didn't think
that the o-rings actually have to be
manually installed ok all right this is
not a super cheap keyboard so it should
be a surprise but that decklid feels so
sturdy so we do have the detachable
micro USB cable now I would prefer to
see this as USB see but honestly I feel
like that's still a nice little portable
package I guess we it's time to remove
the keys remember I was signing up for a
bunch of work with my keyboard here so
we do have our little key removal tool
here I'm not sure why this is included I
mean maybe the feeling isn't quite as
nice with the o-rings on let's uh let's
pop it out for a WASD Keys ok so if I
wrap the o-ring around the switch I
guess that works let's pop back on and
see alright so this is what a normal
switch sounds like and the new one I
mean it makes it a little bit quieter I
guess some people will probably want to
install these for me I don't see a huge
difference unless maybe I'm working in
an office so I really want to keep it as
quiet as possible it's much quieter this
is how people type
spreadsheets excel kpi's plug the Black
Widow in and you'll see it's a little
bit more of a subdued look so it is all
white LED lighting unlike the higher-end
razor models which do have full RGB by
considering the price and considering
that this is supposed to be a little bit
more of a grown-up keyboard that's no
problem now we do still have full razor
set up so we can't change the lighting
if we like so right now it's pretty much
a sort of dimming it or brightening it
you can do the breathing effect which is
fine but I mean for the most part it's
either do you want it on or do you want
it off I will say the lights actually
are really bright this almost feels like
it's maybe just as bright if not even
brighter than some of the RGB stuff so
another keyboard that I really like is
the Tomoko now this is a very very cheap
keyboard it's got the blue knockoff
switches and they're only $28 usually
this has been my main recommendation for
people who are wanting to get into
mechanical switches but if you listen to
it versus I mean there's a big big
difference in the noise there what the
hell
wait I lied there's one RGB key it's the
caps lock huh okay well I guess that's
that RGB it's just G its G key so for
gaming it's fine but my main thing is I
don't quite have that same kind of
tactile feedback that I do on something
that's a little bit more clicky like the
blue switches I mean it simply usable
and I think some people actually might
prefer something that's a little bit
quieter when gaming but for me I don't
know it's it's a little bit on the lipid
on the subtle side we switch over to the
Huntsman elite keyboard well I mean
there's a reason why this is my favorite
gaming keyboard out right now first of
all it's gotten the sound and but almost
more important than that it's a little
bit more of a tactile feel so I click
the button I know that I've hit it right
there's no sort of I don't say vagueness
but it's not loose it's all very very
tight and it feels like I'm actually
properly losing an overwatch that's my
favorite thing is when I lose an
overwatch are you serious right now
there you go at $90 the razer blackwidow
light is something that's a little
different than a lot of the mechanical
keyboards I take a look at instead of
being purely focused on gaming this is a
little bit more of a subtle design so
it's got the white LED the all matte
black plastic and on top of that it's a
very quiet keyboard so you want
something that's great for typing the
light is definitely worth a look
you want something a little bit more
focused on gaming though there are
definitely other options</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
