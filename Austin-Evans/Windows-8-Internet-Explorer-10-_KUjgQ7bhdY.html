Internet Explorer 10 running in Windows
8 now there are two different modes the
first is the standard mode for your
normal desktop now and this mode looks
practically the exact same as in an
explorer 9 does you have your tabs over
here on the right if your address bar
and all that kind of stuff however if we
go ahead and switch over to the Metro UI
quite open it will be a very different
experience so as you guys can see here
one of the big things is there's really
nothing on the screen all you see is
your browser I know this is not quite
ideal for something you know if you have
a large display and a desktop and
everything for a tablet I can really see
that you know having to have a most
amount of real estate is the best so
what they call it is the chromeless
experience where there's no chrome
around your browser certainly that has
nothing to do whatsoever with any other
browsers but as you guys can see here
and this is my channel you will notice
that the flash is not enabled flash is
not working quite yet on Internet
Explorer rather on yeah on Internet
Explorer 10 just yet so it's not enabled
by default but of course by the time
windows 8 comes around everything should
be working no problem so as you can see
here you can scroll really easily you
can also use your arrow keys but if you
want to go ahead and pull up anything
else you right-click and it will pull up
two things so on the bottom here is your
URL bar now you know you can go ahead
and back up actually pull that up as you
know you hit back and go to just the URL
she actually don't really want to do
that you can also right-click it again
you can we can refresh it we can also
pin it so if we want we actually go
ahead and pin it to start menu so we'll
take a look at that in just one second
you also can pull this up use desktop
mode or find on page i'll lastly up here
we can go ahead and switch between our
tabs so works pretty well again it is
more focused on your tablets and whatnot
but you have the normal desktop
interface for that so we can add
anything new but let's go ahead and jump
out of here and if we scroll down toward
the end we now see we have that new tab
so just like in Windows Phone 7 we can
go ahead and move this around so I want
to direct link to my channel for example
we can go ahead and load that up no
problem now as it loads I don't know if
you guys notice but I'm here on the
bottom there's a little kind of
interface or Narad and as they face but
a little bit of a loading bar kind of
looks nice but because it's gonna be
about it for the most part when Internet
Explorer 10 is not
then yet they will be doing new things
and you know enhancing it whatnot in the
next coming months but anyway guys it's
gonna be about it for my hands on up
Internet Explorer 10 and windows hey if
you guys enjoy the video definitely be
sure to leave it a thumbs up and if
you're interested in more videos be sure
