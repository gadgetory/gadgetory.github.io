showing you how to jailbreak your iphone
ipod touch your ipad on the latest four
point three point three firmware now
before we begin there a couple of things
i do want to go over first of all the
program we are using redsnow is
available for both windows and mac and
the destroy is almost 100 identical
there's one slight thing i'll show you
guys that not a big deal in just one
second so if you have Windows or Mac
you're going to be good to go in
addition also to support most but not
all devices I'm so what this will work
for is the iphone 3gs the iphone 4 the
ipod touch 3rd generation the ipod touch
4th generation and finally the ipad 1
this does not support the ipad 2 just
yet it's on the way but it's not quite
out and of course this isn't on to the
jailbreak which means you don't be
worrying about anything like plugging
your device in rebooting and all kind of
stuff really none of that nonsense you
were able to work just like you would
expect so anyway we want you need to do
use two things to do this jailbreak
first of all is the resident program
itself like I said it's available for
both windows and mac and i have it
linked in the description where you can
download whichever one you need and
secondly you're going to need the ipsw
also known as the firmware file for your
device now this is not real trick you
tell the kid I almost said it was but no
it's really not all you do is hit the
link in the description I'll have a
couple in there basically find your
firmware file you may already have it on
your computer in which case you can just
drag it onto your desktop or whatever is
most convenient for you or you can have
two or if you don't you can go ahead and
download it but either way be sure you
have both of these before continuing I
know there is one additional step and
this is only if you are using windows
seven so if you're on an earlier version
of windows or on Mac you can till let's
get this bit a boy what you need to do
is right-click redsnow come down to
properties and then if you guys can see
here come over to the compatibility tab
which should be the second from the left
and that's going to be two things we
need to do here first we need to run
this program in compatibility mode for
windows XP service pack 3 and now
different people have had different
success rates for all these kinds i
think as far as I've been able to test
service pack 3 is always work of course
windows XP service pack 3 has always
worked perfect for me but if you have a
problem with that try vista or perhaps
try windows 2000 whatever works for you
the second thing is you need to be sure
to click run this program
as an administrator now of course that
only applies if you have a Windows 7
computer not if you're on vista XP or of
course OS 10 so let's move this down
here and show you guys so once it opens
up there's going to be really simple a
week go ahead and click browse on the
ipsw that we downloaded and/or found we
can continue on so just let it
successfully identify but next you know
take just a moment to do to prepare the
jailbreak data and while it's doing this
I do want to mention that you should not
lose any of your data in the jailbreak
but i highly recommend that at this
point or even if you know before you
even begin hook it up with itunes let it
fully sync all of your data and you
should be good to go you have to worry
about anything like losing data even if
something does go wrong in the process
alright so once it's finished doing our
jailbreak data there are few options
here so number one is install cydia
obviously the points that we want to do
that I'm you also see install custom
bundle if you don't know what that is
just skip it down more for advanced
users allow boot animation I recommend
going ahead and doing that is that
allows you to get some animated boot
logos nothing fancy and you don't have
to but I recommend doing it just because
you know why not um we also have enable
battery percentage if you're on an ipod
touch and we also have enabled
multitasking gestures which allows you
to do some cool things once you're done
with the jailbreak go into options
there's going to be a new setting their
enable it and allow you to do some cool
things like four finger gestures to you
know switch between apps and whatnot
pretty cool stuff but of course that all
these are optional though only things
the most important thing is to have make
sure that install cydia is checked
alright so the next step is to actually
do our jailbreak so if i can do this
without knocking my microphone over i
will show you guys what you need to do
is you need to have your ipod iphone
ipad i'll be showing you guys with an
ipod touch 4th generation but of course
the procedure is the same no matter what
i mean line that up a little bit better
so you guys can see everything else you
need to have it off so I all did go
ahead and do this right now so and of
course I'm on four point three point
three you need to have it plugged in so
now would be a great time to let itunes
backup all your data but once it's all
backed up you're good to go plug your
device in and then hold the power button
so it is for just a second here and then
slide to power off make sure that that
pinwheel sometimes it takes
sometimes it doesn't I don't really know
why but I make sure the screen is
totally off you're good to go then we
can continue alright so the next step is
we're going to put it into dfu mode it's
if you basically you hold the power
button then you hold them both then you
release the power button very simple I
will walk you through it and of course
the program will as well so click next
again holding the power button for three
seconds I'm going to start holding the
power and the home for 10 seconds and we
were going to release the power button
and continue holding the home button
very simple if you drop a button or for
whatever reason I just hold both the
power in the home and let it cycle
through not a big deal but you know it's
easy especially have a case like this
where buttons are kind of hard to get at
but anyway once you see all this you see
it says downloading jailbreak data we're
good to go we just let it the computer
run for a few minutes and how will we be
right back as soon as it's done alright
so just finished up so if everything
went according to plan and of course it
should have you will now see a new
option called cydia get this nice and
close to the camera so you guys it's
really simple um now at this point we
can open up cydia and we'll say pirate
preparing file system this will take a
little while it'll reboot and all that
kind of stuff but as far as where as far
as you know doing any work we're all
good just give it a little at a time and
we can go and download all the cool city
of bits that we want so anyway guys
