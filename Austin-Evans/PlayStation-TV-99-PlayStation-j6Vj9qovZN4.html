at e3 2014 with my good buddy Lou from
unbox therapy and we just tried out the
PlayStation TV so what is a PlayStation
TV PlayStation TV is a little box that's
going to fit under your television sort
of looks like an Apple TV even smaller
actually but the killer functionality is
that it's going to be able to play
PlayStation Vita games or stream
PlayStation 4 games like a Vita can do
on your local network but we tried out
driveclub there's a beta so we can go
easy on it and also it's a super crowded
space and who knows what's happening
with the networking but tiny bit of lag
yeah so I mean I noticed the I was a
little bit laggy it wasn't bad I could
still totally playable and it did dip
below 30 frames per second every once in
a while I did notice it was a little
choppy but it's an alpha game running on
a beta yes and it's it's kind of you
can't give it up the Vita they just
released a new like slim 2000 version
that's 200 bucks which is still cheaper
than the original Vita but now that you
can actually get a the PlayStation TV
for a hundred dollars for just the
console or if you want to get in a
bundle I believe it $140 for the Vita
I'm sorry the PlayStation TV you get a
PlayStation 3 controller and it does
work with ps3 and ps4 so if you have any
of those controllers that'll work I
actually I think it'll be better on ps4
since you actually can use the the
touchpad just like you would be able to
use the touchscreen on the Vita one
thing though no internal storage a
little not that much though I think it's
the Vita mm has like a gig of storage
that you can't really use like for
anything more than save games so your
are going to have to go and spring for
those PS Vita memory cards which are
kind of expensive and they're kind of
lame I did see a USB port on the
PlayStation TV though so maybe they let
you hook up an external hard drive
you're probably right though they'll
just be for like charging the
controllers and stuff but I mean for
hundred dollars this is something that
especially if they get all the media
stuff like the YouTube and the Netflix
and Hulu and a lot kind of stuff you
look at something that's the same price
as an Apple TV same prices like you know
typical you know kind of streaming boxes
and it actually can play real games not
like oh it plays like a
a game from 2009 like it plays legit
like they had minecraft they had
obviously like ps4 stuff I think it'll
be pretty cool
now the release dates fall so we'll see
exactly like when it comes out but I'm
pretty pumped yeah I completely agree I
think that the living room space for
sort of casual gamers that's something
that's we all think is going to expand
in a big way
apps took over our pockets you know in
our smartphones etc and everybody has
been wondering what Apple's going to do
are they going to really develop the TV
space because right now Apple TV is a
pretty straightforward device right yeah
I mean the software etcetera me only
does a few things and it could probably
do a lot more with an app store etcetera
but here you have a really mature gaming
ecosystem with Vita titles and of course
the streaming functionality from other
consoles so you've got your traditional
TV type of multimedia applications etc
at gaming to it maybe this is the killer
package so what do you guys think about
the PlayStation TV would you pick one up
definitely let us know in the comments
below also definitely be sure to
subscribe both here as well as over on
Lu's channel of course links will be in
the description like always so we've
done we're actually going to be covering
III together pretty much all week if my
voice doesn't die which we'll see on
that one but he actually did a video not
only talked a little bit about the
PlayStation TV but also the white ps4
which I just like say that I would like
because it's pretty nice looking that's
nice
so controller a camo controller it's
going to be uploaded while you are
watching this so that link will be down
below go check out that video subscribe
in both places it's a smart thing to do
there you go anyway guys thanks for
watching and we will catch you in the
next one later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
