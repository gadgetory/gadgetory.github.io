the review of the razer blackwidow
gaming keyboard as a mechanical keyboard
with reasonable price the Black Widow
has a lot going for it before we get
into the keyboard itself let me quickly
explain what a mechanical keyboard is
all about a normal keyboard uses a
membrane and is fairly quiet but you
don't get much feedback and they start
to wear out after a couple years a
mechanical keyboard like the Black Widow
has a spring mechanism in each key
giving it a much better feel and
allowing you to type faster and get
better feedback while gaming with cherry
MX blue switches you get a middle ground
option that's got a decent amount of
tactile response while still being
clicking one thing to keep in mind is
that the keyboard is really quite loud
personally I like this but it definitely
is something to get used to something
else get used to is the layout for the
most part it's a standard keyboard
however there are some quirks like the
Escape key being offset as well as a row
of programmable function keys on the
left side it took me about three days
before I get used to moving my hands
over an inch or so to keep from hitting
the function keys I do have to say I'm
not a huge fan of the Razer synapse
software on Windows I had to reinstall
the software once for detected the
keyboard on OS 10 it's not much better
as it leaves an annoying icon in the
menu bar it does allow you to set macros
as well as reprogram or disable any case
you'd like though and I found this to be
a pretty helpful feature even though it
is a nice feature to have your settings
backed up in the cloud having to sign up
for an account just to download drivers
is a bit much in my opinion the Black
Widow comes in several varieties what I
have here is the Mac specific version
which works just fine on both windows
and OS 10 but you can also choose a
Windows version in addition to an
Ultimate Edition which gets the keyboard
backlighting and another USB port you
can also get the black widows stealth
edition with Cherry MX brown switches
which as the name implies are much
quieter overall for the price the Razer
BlackWidow is a solid mechanical
keyboard with a few quirks but certainly
nothing that's a deal-breaker if you
