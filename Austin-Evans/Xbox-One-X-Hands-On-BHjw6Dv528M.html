and this is the Xbox One X.
So, Microsoft just unveiled it here at E3
and we get a super-secret hands-on,
even though sadly it's
not actually plugged in.
So, one of the first
things that you'll realize
with the Xbox One X is that it is tiny.
So, even though this is
significantly more powerful
than the Xbox One, the Xbox One S,
even something like the PS4 Pro,
it's still a really small console.
So, even though it looks fairly
similar to the Xbox One S,
pretty much everything
inside has been changed.
Inside the Xbox One X
is the Scorpio engine.
So, this is an evolution of
what was in the original Xbox One.
So, not only does it have
the same eight CPU cores,
which have been improved
and are clocked higher,
more importantly it has
a much more powerful GPU.
Honestly this is one of
the biggest improvements
on the X, so it's going from 1.3 teraflops
of computing power to six teraflops.
Not only is that more than something like
the PS4 and the PS4 Pro,
but I think more importantly
it is a huge upgrade over the Xbox One.
Games that were playing at
720p, 900p, or even 1080p,
should easily be able to
be handled at 4K here.
The X is also rocking 12
gigabytes of GDDR5 memory,
which is a big step up over the
8GB of DDR3 on the Xbox One.
What's cool is you're
really not giving up a lot
by with going up with
the X, besides price,
which we'll get into in a minute.
So, the size, like I said,
is roughly the same as the S.
It's very slightly smaller,
but more importantly,
it is much smaller than
the PS4 Pro, and also
pretty much has all of
the same ports, the I/O,
the Blu-ray drive, and what's
cool is if you actually look
at the back of the Xbox One
X, everything is pretty much
the exact same orientation
as the One S, so in theory
if you want to upgrade,
you can just unplug,
replug it in, everything's the same,
and that even includes the power cable,
which is still the tiny
figure eight power cable.
So, all of this noise right now is because
we're actually shooting
in the skybox right above
where we actually watched the E3 demo,
and in about 30 minutes, they've
torn down the entire stage.
It's like gone.
I really do like this matte
black finish in person.
So, even though I think the
Xbox One S looks really cool
in white, just having a
little bit of sheen on the top,
and we still have the vents
on the side, it looks nice.
Speaking of the vents,
they actually have done
some really cool stuff
to get so much power
in such a small space here.
So, it pulls air in here from the sides
and runs it through a
vapor cooling chamber.
That's actually really
cool, and it makes sense
how they're able to get so much power
in such a small console.
So, that's kind of what you would find
on stuff like a GTX 1080, or something.
So, essentially, it pools
the air in from the side,
cools it and then sticks it out the back
through the vents right here,
which has the added benefit
of you can actually stack
stuff on top of the X
without it overheating and
exploding in your face.
Speaking of the size,
even though it's around
the same footprint of an Xbox One S,
this guy pulls a lot more power,
as you would expect from a
much more powerful console.
But, what's cool is you
actually really don't notice
that from the outside,
and Microsoft claims
that it shouldn't be any
louder than something
like an Xbox One as is.
Of course, all that power
doesn't mean much without games
to actually play, and
there were a fair few
that were announced today at E3.
So, the big one that I was
excited about is Forza 7.
To be honest, I'm a huge Forza fan.
I love racing games,
and I feel like Horizon,
especially the Motorsports
series is awesome,
so that looks really
cool and the best part is
it runs at full 4K at 60
frames per second on the One X.
So, Metro Exodus I think is probably one
of the top ones that I'm excited to try.
I was a big fan of Last Light
and this looks like a great sequel.
There's also Middle-Earth: Shadow Of War,
which again is another sequel to a game
I'm really excited to try.
It did look really nice
looking on the Xbox One X.
There are also some cool surprises,
such as PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
is coming to the Xbox
One, Minecraft is getting
a super duper texture pack to support 4K,
and there are other
cool things like Cuphead
finally getting a release date.
It's not just new titles
that will see a benefit.
So, things like better texture sampling,
as well as a faster hard drive should make
all Xbox One games run better on the X,
and there's also the fact that
it's just a more powerful console.
So, say an Xbox One game
had a low frame-rate
or had dynamic resolution scaling,
all that should be pretty much cranked
all the way up when
you're playing on the X.
About 30 games, including
the Forza Horizon 3
and The Witcher 3 are going to see updates
to support 4K running on the One X,
and that's the cool thing.
We're talking about true 4K here.
So, the PS4 Pro is undoubtedly
a very powerful console
but very, very few games run at proper 4K.
These rely on upscaling,
or cool features such as checkerboarding,
which get you close to
4K, but with the One X,
you have that additional
power to make sure that
supposedly, all games will run in true 4K.
The big elephant in the
room, though, is price.
So, the Xbox One X is going
to be coming in at $499
and it'll be on sale on November 7th.
That is a lot for a console.
So, when you look at
the original Xbox One S,
right, it's not original,
but the standard version
of the Xbox One, that's
going to run you $250.
Even if you jump up to
something like the PS4 Pro,
that's $400, which means
that you're definitely
paying a big premium for the One X.
Don't get me wrong, the One X
is an impressive piece of hardware.
Getting proper 4K gaming
for $500 is no small task.
Building an equivalent
PC is probably going
to be pretty difficult, which brings me
to my next slight criticism of the One X.
I wish it ran Windows.
It wouldn't have been totally crazy.
The Xbox One actually
does run on Windows 10,
just with a different UI
on top, but I understand
that that Microsoft
likes to sell Xbox games
and not games inside Steam,
but I just can't help
but imagine if the One X was a $500
absolutely killer little gaming PC.
As is, it is just a very,
very powerful Xbox One.
The Xbox One X is an incredibly
impressive piece of hardware.
If it was $400, I think it
would be totally killer,
but as is, it might be a
little bit of a tough sell,
especially with the PS4 Pro around.
So, what do you guys
think about the One X?
Let me know in the comments below,
and I'll catch you on the next one.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
