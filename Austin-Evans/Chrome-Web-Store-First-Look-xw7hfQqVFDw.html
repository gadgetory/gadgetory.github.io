busy day for Google they announced two
major new projects the first of which is
the chrome is now getting an app store
or as they call a web store basically
this is going to be for both the chrome
browser which obviously is for Windows
Mac and Linux and also for Chrome OS
once it launches later this year this is
going to be a pretty cool thing they're
actually going to it's going to
basically pull up somewhat similar to
like a bookmark whatever that's actually
going to be for your web apps so
automatically we'll go ahead and pull in
all the way back so you usually use
let's say you like Gmail or whatever
well that'll automatically be put on
there because you can also go to the web
app store and you can go ahead and buy
web apps now they showed a lot of
different ones and this this doesn't
like anything like that normal web apps
you're thinking of I have a lot of
really cool ones such as Sports
Illustrated which will be free Sports
Illustrated is very very cool because
you go ahead you can go ahead and just
read through the magazine just as you
would on your browser August 11 problem
this looks really cool guys I'm pretty
impressed with it another really cool
thing was that there's going to be a
Lego game now Lego games well any game
really at all is obviously uses 3d is
going to be really graphically intense
and so you really before now have never
been able to really run that in the
browser very well but with the Google
Chrome Web App Store you can go ahead
and download
well you don't download it but you buy
it and I guess it runs through Chrome
and you can run on any Chrome computer
as you have and then you can go ahead
and play the game and just use it a
little plug in so that they can write it
all is native code um this is a really
cool thing guys it's a lot of these apps
look better than some on the iPad and of
course a lot of iPad apps everybody is
loving them because they just look so
great but we're not that you can run it
on Chrome on your browser on your main
computer you can also run on your Chrome
OS machine once it comes out it's gonna
be a really cool thing so they're
rolling this out currently right now
they'll be doing it working on it
probably throughout the year it'll be
especially noticeable once it hits the
Chrome OS once it comes out but anyway
guys this is pretty cool
