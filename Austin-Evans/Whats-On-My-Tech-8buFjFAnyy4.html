here's the video going over what's on my
Tech so my friend marques recently did a
what's on my Tech video and a ton of you
guys tagged me in it so I decided let me
go ahead and show you guys what devices
I use what I have on them and just kind
of show you what my setup looks like for
my main phone I use the HTC One m8
Google Play edition so I absolutely love
this phone I like metal build quality
and phones it's a big plus for me the
front-facing speakers are also awesome
and the fact that it runs stock Android
is also a big plus I'm really not a big
fan of skins and float wear and all that
kind of stuff pretty much the only thing
that lets it down are the cameras so I
mean it's not bad it's not terrible
especially in low light but compare it
to something like an iPhone or LG g3
does kind of fall flat however
considering just how good the rest of
the phone is I'm kind of willing to
overlook that so I like keep things
fairly basic fairly minimalistic so I do
have a clock widget okay let me know the
date and time all that kind of stuff I
have a lot of boring app select the
phone and hangouts I do use Google Drive
a fair bit as well as photos I
definitely use Spotify all the time so
it's actually something you'll find and
basically all of my devices so listen a
lot of music there's also YouTube big
surprise i watch youtube videos I have
reddit news which section is probably
one of my favorite Reddit clients just
for any device it's actually really
really nicely designed especially for
Android of course moving down to my dock
you'll see Chrome which is pretty much
the best web browser for Android in my
opinion the next thing is Phoenix so I
use Twitter an absolute ton so having a
good client is a big deal and this is by
far the best thing that I found on
Android so definitely recommend Phoenix
have Gmail as well as the Google camera
app pretty self-explanatory there move
over to my second page you see I do have
a widget goes over all of my calendar
information which is helpful just to the
glance of a couple folders here so I use
pocket casts for podcasts of Netflix and
Hulu I usually don't watch a lot of
video on a phone however the HTC One
it's got those good front-facing
speakers as well as the decent sized
screen so everyone watch a show or movie
on my phone I have audible when I'm
listening to audiobooks as well as
Kindle for when I want to read again I
generally don't read on my phone but
every once in a while I don't want to
have to take a tablet or something with
me I'll maybe read just a little bit
wolfram alpha is a great app for
calculations and whatnot Firefox and
opera just against any an extra web
browser I do have other benchmarks on
this phone so I do a lot of benchmarking
even though all that information doesn't
necessarily go into the video but
anytime I get my hands on a new phone
I've got a benchmarking guys see how it
all runs everything so it's just kind of
helpful for comparisons I have a folder
full of kinda like work stuff so flight
track so I fly a reasonable bit so
that's hugely hugely helpful at for me
some boring stuff inside here I do
actually like Snapseed a lot so anytime
I need to edit a photo snaps he's
definitely my go-to I also go ahead and
pop this back open here UPS uber that
kind of normal stuff moving down over to
the games I don't really play a lot of
games on Android but when I do it's
usually going to be something like
threes or Osmos YouTube studio is an
amazing app I absolutely love this so
kind of allows me to skip the 301 so
when you guys see like 301 views I can
actually see in real time how my videos
are doing which is just a nice little
thing for a nerd like me then I have
Facebook pages manager Instagram
settings pretty much boring stuff beyond
that I also use the iPhone 5s so I
bounce back and forth between this and
the One m8 all the time but the main
thing that keeps me coming back is the
camera so now I just have great optics
and a great sensor but iOS does a really
good job processing images and apps like
Instagram are just much much better on
the iPhone so because of that this
pretty much always gets a spot in my
pocket now the rest of the layout is
actually very similar so I have the same
sort of apps like Drive YouTube hangouts
that sort of thing a couple differences
are though I do use alien blue is my iOS
retic client and I keep the Google app
on here at all times because I do really
love having Google now like furniture
everyone with an iPhone I have a folder
full of apps that I never used I just
kind of stuff in here and pretend that
they don't exist as far as utilities
it's actually pretty much the exact same
as on Android I do have a few more games
on the iPhone so things like Thomas was
alone I've been really enjoying I still
have flappy bird on here as well as
Minecraft which I've actually been
trying to get back into since they added
the new update with the infinite worlds
besides that pretty much to all that's
left is my dock so I do use Safari /
Chrome because it is quite a bit faster
on the iPhone I use Tweetbot is my
reddit client this actually syncs well
with other Macs
I want to kind of bounce back and forth
I can do that and I have Gmail client as
well as the camera app for my editing
computer I use a new Mac Pro alongside a
sharp 4k display in a new Dell 1440p
monitor so I love having a 10 screen
real estate for when I edit and having
that six core Mac Pro makes chewing
through video and absolute breeze so for
the software it's nothing too crazy so I
do use Safari / Chrome on OS 10 I feel
like it's just a slight bit more
polished and for Twitter not reddit
almost set reddit for Twitter I do use
tweet BOTS so I like it because it does
have decent integration with the iPhone
version it's just a nicely designed app
overall so as far as the editing stuff I
pretty much all Adobe so I do use
premiere actually used it for the last
couple years solid solid editing program
I also do use After Effects not as much
as I used to before I need to go and
like blur something out or some
compositing or keying that kind of stuff
it comes in handy for coloring I do use
speed great I'm really bad at colors so
speed grit makes it a little easier for
me I have Photoshop pretty much just to
make thumbnails because I suck with
graphics I also do have Spotify on here
like I was saying earlier I use Spotify
all the time pretty much always
listening to music so very nice to have
i had the app store Pages Keynote all
that kind of stuff nothing really too
impressive down here however I do have a
nice little widget that actually is very
very helpful called ice dad so this is
something that wish windows had it kind
of allows you to see at a quick glance
all kinds of different features about
your device so for example I can see
memory usage and go ahead and see how my
SSD is doing what kind of programs are
needing to take up you know the read and
write speeds and see CPU usage I mean I
can see all kinds of these really nice
little things I can take a look and see
you know for example my CPU temperatures
over time but you know getting really
kind of drill down into the memory and
the graphics and all kinds of really
cool stuff so I status actually one of
my favorite parts of using OS 10 weirdly
enough for my gaming PC had actually
already done a video going over
everything so you guys can check that
out if you want to see things like specs
but for now I pretty much use it as a
steam box so I have a fair few games in
my Steam library so now all of them are
installed but I've collected quite a few
games over the last four or five years
I've also been playing some console
games so I actually missed the last of
us when it came out for ps3 so with the
remastered version for ps4 I've actually
been really enjoying not only the single
player but the multiplayer is actually
pretty fun as well the game is Just
Cause 2 so this is one of the
PlayStation now streaming titles mostly
been playing this just kind of test out
how PlayStation now is and I might
actually end up making a video on it
resogun is a really fun spaceship
shooter not gonna lie this is actually
probably the most played game on the ps4
I've had just because it's just really
really fun and also watchdogs so I've
actually played more watchdogs on the
ps4 than anything else mostly because it
had a definitely trouble punch on the PC
so ps4 versions seem to be a little bit
better sorted at the beginning anyway I
also have an Xbox one although this is
more of a media box than anything else
so this is where I watch the majority of
my YouTube as well as things like Hulu
and Netflix and blu-rays and all that
kind of stuff although I do have some
games for it so 4 to 5 is easily my
favorite racing game right now I've
always been more of a fan at the
simulation style like Gran Turismo so I
have a lot of fun with Forza and also
titanfall I've got a lot of hours into
titanfall you know it's funny I'm not
usually a huge first-person shooter guy
but titanfall is kind of fresh enough
that really kind of sucked me in
actually it sucked me a little too much
to be honest
so what's on your tech it could be a
phone tablet desktop laptop game console
whatever it is let me know what you're
using in the comments below
or you can make a video and tweet it to
me at Austin not Duncan now already
tweet some of my favorites over the next
couple days anyway guys thank you so
much for watching and I will catch you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
