wouldn't be taking a look at the new
Samsung lineup most notable going to
take a look at the samsung galaxy s2 on
the galaxy tab 2 now these are both
scheduled to be announced tomorrow at
Mobile World Congress over pretty much
everything that we need to know about
them has already been laid some point
just give you guys a first look at them
so to begin with let's talk about the
samsung galaxy s2 now I'm sure is a lot
of you know I was a big fan of the same
the current samsung galaxy s you know
this screen is great the it's really
quite fast there's a lot of really good
things about it he'll over the samsung
galaxy s2 looks to improve on this with
some key improvements so one of the
biggest is the screen it's going to now
be a 4.3 inch super amoled ahead plus
display now while the resolution is
going to remain the same for a by 800
what really kind of sets this apart from
the previous one is just the new screen
technology and of course if you guys
have never seen a samsung galaxy s phone
person yeah well if you had you'll know
that the Super AMOLED display it is a
really nice screen you know the colors
are really vibrant comets it's a really
really good display however they've been
proved this even more with the super
amoled plus display which is actually
able to take a look at a pre and
engineering sample at CES of the 4.3
inch variety and it looks really even
better I'm super super nice colors on
they've done a really good job so I
expected the all the new samsung galaxy
s2 phones will be looking really really
good moving on from that they also will
have a dual core 1 gigahertz processor
most likely made by samsung themselves
so course just going to keep up with all
the other major smartphones that are
getting dual-core processors should
absolutely scream and I should have an
android 2.3 gingerbread I imagine with
the same kind of customizations that
Samsung likes to do on the phones and it
also will have near field communication
and Bluetooth 3.0 now NFC also known as
near field communication I want to get
into technical too much but you're going
to be hearing a lot about this this year
basically what allows you to do is take
your phone and actually use it you know
to pay for things to log in to you know
to get to places there's a lot of really
innovative things that you're going to
able to do with this perhaps you might
already be using it today if you're a
student you know you have it may be in a
pass or something or there's a variety
of different things but what you're
going to be able to do is actually use
your phone to do this all this so really
cool thing that will be included in the
samsung galaxy s2 and then the last I'm
going to talk about is the thinness now
then this is obviously something that
everyone's always continuously working
at trying to get it smaller thinner
lighter this one's going to be even
thinner than some of the finished phones
in the market namely the iphone for the
Sony Xperia art so really really thin
phone and it should be a really solid
package all together anyway this one
course will be announced tomorrow at
Mobile World Congress really looking
forward to seeing I'm sure they'll have
more info public a variety of different
things with keyboard without keyboard
just like the current Samsung Galaxy S
line so there that's the galaxy s2 now
let's talk about the galaxy tab 2 I know
they get into these great names uh-huh
so the samsung galaxy tab 2 is going to
be a big departure from the current
samsung galaxy tab now don't get me
wrong i do like the samsung galaxy tab
currently it's a 7 inch display it's not
the greatest tablet but certainly
probably one of the most successful
tablets short of the iPhone the iPad
available so you know they did a pretty
decent job however is going to do a lot
better with these galaxy tab 2 so the
first thing I need to do is get rid of
the 7-inch display replace it with a
10-inch so this is going to put it much
more in line with you know the motorola
the apple all the major tablets are
going to have a nice large display I'm
it's also going to have these standards
stop android 3.0 honeycomb release so
not it's going to be actually a google
experience device so you're not going to
worry about some kind of skin over it or
anything like that it's going to be used
to be this pure stock android which in
my opinion looks really good I'm so
moving on we don't have all the space
but we do know that it will have a 1
gigahertz processor almost certainly the
same dual-core from the galaxy s2 but
some of the other things are just going
to be you know really solid tablet as
far as just the screen display which
actually go well Michigan ish it does
have a 10 inch display with a resolution
of 1280 by 720 or frats 800 you know
actually I preciously look that up but
I'm anyway it's going to be a really
nice display should be really
so both of these devices are looking
really quite nice anyway for the same
kind of d3 that I will go and I'm
everyone in the chat as always with
every episode be through the IV this
film in front of a live audience and
blog TV we've got a lot of people in
here today so just one take some
questions 800 guests 1 18 gals in tattoo
or iPad well I think the galaxy tab 2 is
probably going to be better than the
ipad personally however it's not really
fair comparison to make by the time the
galaxy tab 2 is available to purchase
you it's probably going to be going up
against the ipad 2 and i mentioned the
ipad 2 will probably have a lot of the
same you know enhancements so i think
it's a little bit of a hard comparison
to make the current generation ipad
versus the next generation galaxy tab um
what about better android or iOS
software i like them both to be honest i
know a lot of people kind of you know
kind of complain like we gotta pick one
of the other I'm plenty that pic one a
pic iOS but really on the minor things I
like Apple Design iOS is really simple
and really clean and really responsive
but on the other hand android is a lot
more open so a lot easier to get apps on
it's got a lot of really cool features
and i like a lot about and how Android
works so it's really pretty close to a
tile though I think iOS has slightly hit
my opinion but again I like them both a
lot do you think the galaxy s2 will have
a 3d screen let's actually a good point
on actually heard some rumors about that
actually might be a four-inch three
phone maybe a I'm not exactly sure of
the specifics but they actually are
working on a 4 inch 3d display I'm i
don't think the galaxy s2 will actually
had this right off the bat but there
might need a variant of it may be a
little bit later who watch to have a
glasses-free 3d screen should be pretty
cool I'm gonna think the galaxy tab will
have flash drive ports if you're talking
about us be no i do not think so i think
it's a possibility but most of the
tablets tend to connect to your computer
not connect stuff to the tablets Cass
Eames like a little bit of an odd
distinction but it is fairly important
because you know it's it's a big deal
whether your tablet 6 with your computer
or you know I an ipod 6 with your tablet
it's a little bit of a complicated issue
but just enough sort of it no I don't
think actually
have any USB ports when does the ipad 2
coming out probably in the march to
april time frame oh it expected in april
we're getting pretty close to where we
should be expecting an announcement so
yeah i would expect to see the ipad out
no later than maybe april which will
come first galaxy tab 2 or ipad 2 again
i'm not really sure i do know the ipad
should be out april time frame on the
gods attempt to my view might be
available a little earlier a little bit
later so to cos i really have no idea
iphone4 vs windows phone um well the
thing is Windows Phone I would like the
idea of Windows Phone and I like the
execution what of what they've done
however what it's really a very new
operating system and if you don't get
iOS four plots iOS four they had four
major updates I mean you look at Android
they've had multiple big updates but
Windows Phone 7 is pretty much brand new
I mean there's a lot of things that have
not are not there yet there's no cut and
paste support I mean I'm not even get
into I mean there's no html5 that's kind
of out of this that is that there's a
lot of things that need to be fixed on
windows phone 7 however that said
there's also a ton of potential I really
like the idea of what Windows Phone said
it is going to pick it and become and
how it's going to work I'm really
looking forward to seeing it but today I
would definitely pick the iphone I just
don't think windows phone 7 is there yet
well that was a tattoo have fast
internet speed yeah I will the galaxy
tab rather the I don't know about the
galaxy tab 2 I don't know it's gonna
have Wi-Fi 4G written like that but I do
know that the samsung galaxy s2 these
names you're kidding me um yes you
should have hspa+ so that is going to be
good for tmobile as well as a CMT their
4g network so yeah I should have pretty
fast food recipe um will there be an
iphone nail yeah that's actually a good
question i've heard a lot of people
talking about it if you guys are aware
there's a big rumor going around this
week that there might be a iphone nano
or a smaller version of the iphone that
would be much cheaper with lower part
with cheaper parts personally I'm a bit
skeptical I think they Apple can
definitely go after the low
in smartphone market but I'm a little
bit skeptical whether the action would
do that with a smaller iPhone or rather
make the current iphone larger and just
use the current size of the iphone to go
after that market so not really sure
about that one idea it's possible but I
definitely wedding your plan right um
yeah samsung deaths s2 or Atrix 4G well
I will tell you this right now I love
the motorola atrix 4g if you guys want
check it out on my channel i have a
hands-on of it from CES the atrix is a
really cool phone i like the idea it's
got a really nice display it's got a
dual-core processor but the fact that
actually runs pretty much full linux
well not quite full linux but you know
you plug it into the keyboard dock or
just a normal doc and you practically
have a laptop it was really really
impressive so that by that alone I would
probably go with a matrix just because I
was really cool um there are some other
things that the samsung galaxy s2 will
have on it mostly it will have
gingerbread and to be honest Oh be
surprised at the atrix never gets
gingerbread just the way that Motorola's
has been not updating their android
phones lately but yeah i probably with
the atrix just solely based on that
keyboard dock it's a really really cool
feature um well the galaxy's bait
hackable yeah I don't only think that's
going to be an issue pretty much most
most android phones eventually get
hacked in fact i think the vast majority
of them eventually get hacked a rather
rude I'd rather stay rooted um yeah I
don't see any reason why this samsung
galaxy s or a galaxy tab would be any
different um do you think that the
galaxy s the gas cs2 is going to be
better than the nexus s most likely it's
going to be the next generation the the
Nexus asked me at least names of the HP
today the Nexus S is based on the
previous generation of galaxy s so it's
just the original galaxy s this is going
to be the newer gonna have a larger
display it's going to have faster
processor I'm just going to have some
updates so yeah I do think the galaxy s2
will be a more up-to-date phone than the
nexus s so on that day I will go ahead
and sign off guys if you're interested
