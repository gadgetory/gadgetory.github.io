rumors about what we might be seeing
next month at the apple ipod event now
in case you didn't know every September
usually around the first to the middle
of September apple announces a whole
slew of new ipods well sometimes two new
Macs and stuff but generally it is very
much focused on the ipods so this year
it looks like we're actually going to be
a pretty substantial deal as thanks to
AI lab today and their sources and
generally they are they've been pretty
credible there's actually going to be a
really really big update this year so
start with what is probably the biggest
and it is the ipad mini or the ipad
micro whatever you want to call it it's
going to be a seven inch version of the
current ipad i know this one we have
very few specs on or anything like that
however we've heard about a you know 7
inch tablet or something roughly about
that size for a very long time predating
well before the original ipad came out
earlier this year so i would not be
surprised at all if we do see an ipad i
put me out in September I'm not entirely
sure about this though guys just because
the ipad is selling so huge that i doubt
that they will be even able to you know
keep the ipad 2 standard ipad stall so
to add another ipad that will probably
sell it even faster i'm just not sure
about that however it is pretty possible
now some people have said that it might
have the retina display or something
similar with a really high resolution
display or i really doubt this as while
it's one thing to have you know a 3.5
inch on an iphone it's an entirely
different deal to have you know the
display of apples one-thousand-dollar
you know monitor on to a 7 inch screen
and try to get it in and you know
anything less than thousands and
thousands of dollars just been a
ridiculous price so i would expect the
reply stay fairly much groups the same
as the standard ipad very well i have a
front facing camera and it may be just a
slightly cheaper price but that's
probably going to be about the same ok
so let's move on to the ipods so
according to I lunch we will see three
redesign iPods this year the ipod
shuffle the ipod nano and of course ipod
touch so it's going to start with the
shuffle so according to them actually
will probably be renamed probably
something else
maybe like the ipod nano shuffle touch
got no idea but it will be probably
renamed actually will be given a 1.7
inch touchscreen the one we saw earlier
in the year ah actually I have no
trouble believing this I said I've been
on record several time to say that the
ipod shuffle is a bad as small as it can
get I mean they've removed everything
there's really not a whole lot more I
mean you think it's a smaller do you
mean people just be losing it way too
easily so I think it's about time
actually gets a little bit bigger and
having a very very small touchscreen
make the only bike on a one button or
two buttons on the screen time a very
very very simple interface I think it
would be fantastic now they said
actually the ipod nano also might be
getting a touch screen now they said
something about they've got apples
ordering some three inch touch screens
which if you didn't know the ipod touch
as well as iphone have a 3.5 inch so
maybe a smaller version of the ipod nano
actually might evolve which may be like
a smaller version of the ipod touch i'm
not so sure about this i do think that
the ipod nano will eventually get a
touch screen maybe then go ahead and
move over to iOS but i don't think it's
going to be quite this year i think it
might be you know a year to once you
know the really the current ipod design
villagers starts to get old but of
course you know who knows we actually
might be seeing a really substantial
upgrade to the ipod nana this year
lastly we're going to go ahead and just
talk really briefly about the ipod touch
now if you want know more about this
i'll go ahead and check out the link on
the screen right now i've already done a
full video discussing all about why
expect to see in the ipod touch 4th
generation so guys really is not that
nothing new about that right now anyway
guys I just want to share these rumors
with you um I really as always with
rumors me you really have to take them
for grain of salt I'm not so sure about
a lot of them I think that the ipad
definitely makes sense i think having a
smaller ipad would be really good
especially with the front-facing camera
as far as the ipod shuffle aadmi no
problems believing that I expect I
pretty much expect that if I would be
pretty surprised as they don't you know
do something with the ipod shuffle the
nano knows and of course the ipod touch
should be getting pretty substantial
redesign definitely let me know in the
comments below I'm definitely curious to
know anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
