live at CBS 2012 with the hands on of
some Intel Windows 8 tablets so if you
like to go ahead and take it away
hi my name is Rakesh and what I'm
showing here is I'm showing you at the
two devices the first one at the top is
the Samsung c7 running 2nd generation
Core i5 on Windows 8 Microsoft Windows 8
Developer Preview and the one here at
the bottom is the atom 32 nanometer SOC
platform which is optimized for the
power so while this device is optimized
for power this is optimized for
performance so here what you see is the
Windows 8 Metro UI and I will show you
some of those cool looking Metro tiles
and applications and then for example
the stock market application where you
see what's happening latest in the stock
market right let's look at the weather
application as an example you know as I
said very nice
full screen immersive applications that
you see on the Metro and another example
would be a local media playback right
from the Metro here that you see alright
and what I'm going to do next here if
you do a basically swipe from left the
swipe from left gives you a very fast
and fluid you know method of switching
between applications that you see here
and then what else you can do is you can
actually click on the desktop and this
is the famous this is a very popular
look that you are used to running on you
know Windows 7 and previous operating
systems right so on the Intel
Architecture that one the key advantage
you get an angel architecture is that
any application that you have built on
the windows 7 like I say four million
applications on Windows 7 on Intel
Architecture will all of them will run
hit on Intel Architecture Windows 8 so
that legacy compatibility that that will
come the compatibility with the desktop
applications that have been built for
the previous versions of OS that's the
great advantage that you get on the on
the Intel Architecture and back to the
little bit of you know
click on the desktop metro desktop I
draw yes sir
and now the next cool thing I can show
you is if you do like if sorry if you do
like this one or second okay so this is
very interesting and cool thing where
you can actually see a metro and another
metro application you know at the same
time you can even do this you can do a
metro on the desktop at the same time
and what do you see here for example you
can have a nice stock application
running here at the background or a
metro application running here and then
you can see the whole desktop running at
the same time and you can do mix above
yes that's that's mostly about the
windows
windows 8 here from the functionality
perspective and going back to the two
device that I'm showing here this is the
you know as I said the device to
optimize for performance and the device
optimized for for low power</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
