today I've got a special tips and tricks
video for your iPhone and iPod touch
poor begin though I just gotta say Wow
yesterday when I made my video I had 47
subscribers and I was going to I was I
was gonna say hey thanks for making 50
like nah well I don't have 50 quite yet
I was gonna wait till today to make the
video well today I reached 100
subscribers I'm not kidding
thank you guys all big big thanks to
Ironman / city things for helping me out
I cannot believe how I got I've been
getting maybe 2 subscribers a day how I
got 53 in one day I don't know but I'm
not complaining
so they thanks guys a lot and so let's
get this one started
okay so the first tip I will show you
will be the music trick now before I
begin I was just real quick note this is
uh this is just for the to book to point
to burn lawyer or above I mean you know
2.2 or 2.2.1
anything below or anything below on the
I don't know some of these tricks might
work so tonight I'm I don't really
remember and same with this is not I
don't know what works and what doesn't
on the 3.0 beta so just a quick shout
out okay so the first trick and most of
you guys probably know this one is to
double tap the home button it will bring
you up the your music so this is really
handy for two two ways like let's say
you've got your ipod in your pocket or
your iPhone obviously you got it in your
pocket and you're listening to music
well you know in the old like iPod nanos
everything I'll have to do is just pull
out it pull it out and you know just do
the click wheel whatever and it can be
kind of a little annoying with iPhone
everything because then you have to you
know unlock then go hit the music and go
into that well there's a simpler trick
and all you have to do is just when you
pull out your pocket or whatever double
tap the home button then you'll get a
little prompts with a small thing on the
top it'll give you the forward button
the next I mean the next song reverse
song pause and then your volume that's
pretty cool and it's it's a nice thing
and what most people I know know about
that but something that's might some of
you guys might not know is that that
double double tapping the home button
will work pretty much any time you can
be on Safari surfing and if you're
listening to music double tap the home
button
he won't don't worry about it you know
exiting Safari if you hit once obviously
would but you double tap it the little
dialogue will come up with it'll should
say the album the artist the song that
you're listening to and it'll do the
same you go to the next song you can
pause and all that um it's a pretty nice
little trick I'm sure most you guys know
it but yeah it's something pretty cool
that you'll definitely want to know okay
so for my second tip / trick whatever
you like to call it and this is okay
I'll be straight this is not a really a
tip or trick this is just a feature that
a lot of people don't really pay
attention to on their iPhones and iPod
and this is the ability to watch and
download podcasts
I'm sure practically all you guys know
about this but a lot of people tend to
forget they'll open it up the when they
first see it or whatever and then kind
of forget about it so just in case you
don't know basically all you got to do
is open up iTunes the iTunes application
and then hit podcasts which is believe
the fourth one up from the on the bottom
and then basically you can pull up all
kinds of podcasts from iTunes just like
you would on your computer it's kind of
set up a little sort of like that we're
coming very very vaguely you can you
have like what's hot and you have the
top tens everything go through the
categories and you just look for
yourself
now I won't get into much too into too
much of it it is the I mean it's just
podcasts obviously if you're I mean if
you're really odds are if you're really
into podcasts you probably already know
about this but it's pretty cool because
one of my favorite things about it is
that obviously you're limited on your
space on your iPhone or iPod or if
you've got an 18 or 16 gig I mean maybe
if you had a 32 G that wouldn't be too
bad you would mind downloading a lot of
podcasts but still you got a limited
amount of space on the device so what my
favorite really one of my favorite
features is for with the podcast is that
you don't have to download them you can
just watch them slash listen to them
depending on if they're video or audio
but you can just watch or listen to them
without having to download at all and
obviously you can download them if you
want so like I said not really a it's
not something most you guys probably
you'll all know about it so it's not a
big deal but it sounds like kind of a
lot of people forget so I know I just
figure I just toss it in here okay so my
third tip / trick is going to be the
ability to watch videos / mp3s or
whatever music on the Internet
now obviously everyone knows that your
iPhone or iPod Touch comes with a
built-in YouTube which obviously you
know you can watch YouTube and
everything but what a lot of people
don't realize is that just it has
YouTube but any mp4 or any kind of video
that the iPhone or iPod Touch can play
you can if it's on the internet you can
watch it so now I do know that if you
jailbreak you can get a Flash Player but
I'm not talking about jailbreaking this
is just this is just anybody can use no
matter what it's really simple
now I will say most sites are set up to
have flash so not all of them it all
really will have mp4 but I wanted the
bigger bigger ones that bigger sites
that does have mp4s that you can watch
is break and that's a really popular
site you can go ahead and watch just
like on YouTube all you have to do is
just tap the tap the little box and
it'll be you know just like the YouTube
it'll appear and obviously if it's gonna
be used as flash you can't watch it but
a few places will have it so it's kind
of nice and on the second thing is that
you can do mp3 mp3s and whatever else
music that the iPhone or iPod Touch to
play it's also kind of cool um you know
whenever you like on the computer
whatever and you see Apple thing where
you want to listen to just to listen to
some music or whatever well it's like
sometimes like a preview of a song or
whatever on the internet or what any
kind of mp3 really well you can if you
can listen to it on your computer
odds are you can do it on your iPhone or
iPod touch assuming that it's a standard
format not something kind of you know
different you could probably go ahead
and listen to it on your iPhone or iPod
touch and uh not necessarily download it
obviously but you could at least listen
to it those a couple tricks that I like
to know just because that actually gives
a lot of the functionality of your
desktop or your laptop or whatever your
main computer in your iPhone so it's
kind of nice to be able to do some extra
things that you know it's it's kind of
nice to do okay so my last tip is
probably something again that most of
you guys know but it's definitely
something handy and I used I use these a
lot and this is in Safari you can create
bookmarks that will be out on your
actual iPod instead of inside Safari
these are handy for when you have sites
a lot of like some whatever site like
district whatever site that you like to
check maybe like every day or whatever
you can just instead of happen to go
into Safari and pull out your bookmarks
like that it's really simple - all you
have to do is just tap it on the front
page just like an application and it'll
low in
pop up and it'll load it load the
website you want up it's very simple all
you have to do is just hit the plus
button and it just hit Add to Home
screen
and then all you have to do is just you
can name it whatever you want one
problem is a lot of sites don't really
don't really account for this and so
instead of having a nice icon like some
some places do instead of having a nice
icon that will appear it'll be just like
a kind of like a screenshot of whatever
the page it was which won't won't look
like a real app icon but you know it'll
get just looks a little weird but some
some places do have the good icons I'm
just throwing it out there cuz you know
if you don't want you don't want your
home screen whoever's to look all
cluttered with these weird looking links
um I said this is not for I mean you
don't want what obviously wouldn't want
do this with all your bookmarks you I
mean your iPod or iPhone will be full
but it's definitely a really handy trick
when you want to go to a lot of websites
like I know like whenever I get up I
always plot my iPod and I do this and
this and check this and everything
there's really nice to have instead of
having to go into Safari and scroll
through everything just one click just
along with all your applications and
you're all set
so that's just those are just a few of
my tips and tricks I'm sorry most you
guys probably knew most of them are all
of them but you know that's just just a
few things that you know on the iPhone
and iPod touch there's a lot of people
just don't notice be sure to check out
