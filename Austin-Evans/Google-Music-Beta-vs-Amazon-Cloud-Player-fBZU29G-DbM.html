between music beta by google and amazon
cloud player now these are two of the
newest and best ways to store your music
online since you listen to it on your
computer or a wide variety of mobile
devices so what I like to do for you
guys today is give you some of the pros
and cons of each kind of tell you why
you might want to use one over the other
and all I can get stuff so the first one
I'm going to take a look at is music
beta by Google which I am just going to
be calling google music because that is
way easier to remember so Google music
works very similarly to cloud player and
again if you're not familiar with how it
works it's very simple download a
program to your computer it picks out
you know your songs from your iTunes or
your Windows Media Player or wherever
you keep your songs it allows you to
upload it to the cloud and then listen
to it from a wide variety of devices now
there are a couple of key differences
though I want to go ahead and show you
guys this one of the number one ones
that are between them is the fact that
Google Music beta google music whatever
I know I'm going to scream about name a
bunch but google music allows you to
upload up to 20,000 songs now that's
really quite impressive amazon cloud
player on the other hand ism is max of
20 gigabytes as far as the free if you
buy an mp3 album it's only five
gigabytes if you don't buy anything and
you just get the totally standard free
version so I definitely have to give the
edge to google music here but of course
that's not everything now another really
cool thing i like about google music is
the fact that the interface is really
quite nice so you have quite a few
things you can go through your songs
artists albums so so we want to take a
look at some blue öyster cult click on
it we can take a look at our songs you
know it's very simple if you want to
play double click if you can see you're
on the bottom here we have our previous
song next song can scrub around through
the song we can thumbs up it so if you'd
like to do it through your ratings you
can do thumbs up and down and take a
look at your automatic playlist which
have the thumbs up and down songs on you
can also you know shovel songs repeat
volume all the kinds of standard stuff
now one thing I really like about Google
Music however is the fact that it comes
with a lot of free songs so while amazon
cloud player is just strictly for you
know uploading your own stuff google
does give you a fairly decent selection
of free music when you first download it
so the first thing you'll see is when
you it when you first get google music
is that it's going to pull up a little
prompt saying what kind of music do you
like do you like you
maybe techno rock or metal or whatever
there's quite a few different genres and
varieties and you pick whatever you want
you can pick them all and then we'll
actually you have automatically
downloaded quite a few free songs so I'm
as you guys can see here this is just a
small selection see there's some blue
öyster cult system of a down Incubus
five for fighting Elvis Presley Santana
I mean there's a lot here and it's
really pretty cool because this is all
just totally free now we'll say that
most of this right here is live music so
it's not going to be quite the exact
same song as you would expect you know
the standard studio versions or whatever
but still it's free and of course it is
the legit music it's not like you know
covers or anything like that so it's
definitely really nice now let's take a
look at amazon cloud player now before
we begin I do want to say one thing I've
actually been using amazon cloud player
almost exclusively for my music for the
past month or so so I've been using you
know itunes or anything like that just
to kind of test to see how it works on
the cloud I'm guess they've really quite
impressed I use multiple computers on a
daily basis and it's really nice to have
all my data and all my music online on
the clouds so that's less to do with
amazon just is the general kind of thing
if you guys are kind of on the fence
about switching to either of these
services you really ought to give them a
shot but getting away from that let's
talk a little bit about what are
specific to amazon cloud player so as
you can see the interface is fairly
similar that's a little bit more basic a
little bit more plain but you know to be
honest it's not that huge of a deal so
along the bottom you'll find your
playlist so if you're listening to a
song porch you can hit play and do your
volume all that kind of good stuff now
of course you have your songs menu here
so you can scroll through all your songs
I'm you take a look at the artists use
the time all that kind of stuff but one
nice thing about cloud player is let's
say Kelly's last and well if I want to
click on this I can add to a playlist I
can delete it but most importantly I can
download it now that's very nice course
since it's your music it's not like it's
happy to be locked up or anything you
can just download it and do whatever you
like with it very simply so that's
really quite nice I know there are a
couple of things you can take a look at
albums artists genres I mean all that
kind of stuff um I've noticed that the
scrolling in the performance will mean
that scrolling but just the performance
loading is a little bit better on google
music but again it's mostly kind of
splitting hairs there everything works
pretty nicely and with no major issues
now there are a couple of key things i
do like about cloud player for one you
well it's not you know have 20,000 songs
like on google music you do have five
gigabytes standard and you have 20
petabytes if you buy any mp3 and album
on amazon now i really like buying my
music on amazon that's the only place i
really buy it from so i was able to do
that pretty quickly and is you guys to
see here i have about 19 to buy so
even though 20,000 songs is really good
for them vast majority of people I would
expect that you could get in with that
20 gigs but of course you know it's
entirely up to you now another thing is
this is kind of not extremely related to
cloud player but of course it is
connected with the amazon mp3 store so
again if you guys are like me and you
like to buy all your music on amazon you
have the option to have it immediately
just go into your cloud player account
and it doesn't count against your
storage so you can buy as much as you
like it's not going to hurt so of course
it really kind of comes down to you know
what platform are you on what kind of
where you like to buy your music all
that kind of stuff personally I like
Google music well I still will buy all
my music on Amazon I still do like the
general interface google music is just a
little bit faster of course they both
have support for android but google has
a little bit better and more integrated
support for android and on top of that
it's really nice to just be able to have
all my stuff in one place that happen to
worry about running into any you know
storage problems or anything like that
and of course it's a big bonus that
comes with a lot of free song I mean hey
who doesn't like free music so no guys
that's but if my comparison if you're
interested in either of these services
I'll have links into the script in the
description you can sign up for cloud
player all you need is an amazon account
which i'm sure most of you guys have but
if you're interested in getting google
music you can go ahead and sign up for
an invite like i said it took me a
couple weeks to get mine so hopefully
you guys should get yours about that
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
