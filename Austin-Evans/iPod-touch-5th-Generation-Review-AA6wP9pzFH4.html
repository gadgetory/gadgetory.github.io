here with a review of the new iPod Touch
5th generation with a bigger screen and
better camera this is clearly the best
iPod Touch yet but is it worth the hefty
price of entry the first thing that will
jump out at you is the more colorful
design the iPod Touch is available in
several colors and thankfully all of
them are much more durable than previous
models it's also less than a quarter of
an inch thin and weighs in it is super
light three ounces using it feels great
in the hand and that light weight means
gaming is absolutely no problem take a
close look and you'll see the same
attention to details on the iPhone 5
with incredibly tight tolerances on
bottom you'll see the headphone jack
lightning port for charging and syncing
along with the speaker it's still
nothing spectacular but as long as you
don't accidentally cover it up it's all
right around back is the iPod Touch loop
which is a little pop up button to
attach a lanyard it works fine but I
imagine most people will use it once and
forget about it
above is your antenna for Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth which does stick out a bit and
the camera LED flash and microphone I'll
get into performance in a minute but one
thing you should keep in mind is that
the lens sticks out by about a
millimeter so it's best to get a case
you're protected up front you'll see the
FaceTime HD front-facing camera and the
new 4-inch Retina display unlike
previous iPods which used an inferior
panel the iPod Touch 5th generation
screen looks practically identical to
the iPhone 5 this is definitely a good
thing as not only our viewing angles top
notch but colors and resolution are
among the best of any mobile device out
there the larger screen also pays off
while watching video compared to
previous versions you get much more
screen real estate used iOS 6 comes with
the new iPod Touch and in general is
very similar to previous versions you
have access to the excellent app store
with tons of great apps and games pretty
much all of which work on the iPod you
also have access to iMessages FaceTime
and practically every app from the
iPhone except for the phone app the iPod
Touch 5th generation now includes Siri
so as long as you connect you to Wi-Fi
it's going to work just like on the
iPhone - item 8 all you do is hold the
home button Siri tell me a joke yes but
it also is useful for other more
important things like for example sports
scores when is the next Chiefs game
okay sports fans let's take a look the
Chiefs Raiders game is October 28 2012
3:05 p.m. audio quality is respectable
with the included Apple earpods
if you're serious audiophile you
probably won't be happy but then again
you're probably not interested in an
iPod either the camera is a 5 megapixel
shooter with 1080p video and here it's a
massive improvement from the last iPod
quality isn't far off from smartphones
like the iPhone 5 and galaxy s3 with
decent color and plenty of detail with 5
megapixels to work with video on the
iPod Touch is really impressive so is
Sam here what kind of demo as I give
them a big old belly rub yeah you like
belly rubs huh yeah that's are nice but
yeah does shooting Full 1080p and the
video quality is almost identical to
what you'll find on the iPhone 4s as
well as the iPhone 5 which is really
impressive considering this is only a 5
megapixel camera ok enough talking let's
get back to the belly rubbing battery
life is absolutely excellent with no
cellular radio or GPS to worry about the
iPod Touch should last through a day of
all but the most demanding use and if
you keep gaming to a minimum you should
be able to get a couple days between
recharges easy the iPod Touch remains in
a league of its own no doubt
I do wish Apple had made a 16 gigabyte
version at a slightly lower price but
considering you're basically getting an
iPhone without the phone along with 32
gigabytes of storage for $300 I don't
think it's an unreasonable price at all
if you're looking for a great way to get
into iOS this is a fantastic way to do
it don't forget to hit up that like
button and if you're interested in more
videos like the unboxing gaming demo and
more be sure to check out the rest of my
ipod touch coverage here anyway I will
catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
