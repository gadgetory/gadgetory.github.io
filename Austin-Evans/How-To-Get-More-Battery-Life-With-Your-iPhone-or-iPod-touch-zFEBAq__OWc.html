battery seems to drag all too quickly in
the 3.0 and subsequent updates and
certainly have not helped things either
there are lots of different ways to
improve your battery life such as
turning off push notifications disabling
extra processes if you were jailbroken
among many many others however there's a
much simpler way to get more after your
battery calibrating let's get this one
started
to understand why calibrating would work
first you need to understand how
rechargeable batteries indeed for any
advice uses it or chargeable battery not
just iPhones and iPods work generally a
battery will be made to last a certain
number of charges the force starts to
lose a considerable amount of storage
capacity however the battery's capacity
is constantly changing as you use the
device so your device might hold a
certain amount of charge right now but
in three months it could be somewhat
higher or lower inside each battery
there's a small charge meter that checks
the amount of charge and or reports it
to the device there's a preset low point
where it knows it must shut off and a
max charge point where it the battery
knows that cannot take any more power
however because the overall battery life
constantly changes you must reset these
preset numbers if you don't then your
battery meter will become wildly
inaccurate within just a few months it
makes you think the battery is almost
dead when in fact you could have perhaps
even hours left while it may sound
complicated it's actually quite simple
all you need to do is burn your battery
entirely down until the device shuts off
by itself then immediately plug it in
and let it fully charged to 100% what
this will do is reset the lowest and
highest numbers in your battery
effectively recalibrating it this isn't
a terribly time-consuming process doing
it three or four times a year should be
fine and more if you think you can to
demonstrate how much this can help let
me give you some admittedly rough
estimations
how far off your meter could be I hadn't
done this in nearly six months and my
battery meter would go up and down all
day I usually like to charge it when
it's around 15 to 20 percent now I was
usually getting down to that after about
four hours of use both of them Wi-Fi and
playing games when I went to calibrate
it the results surprised me the battery
didn't quit for more than two hours
after getting to 15% the inaccuracy of
the meter was easily apparent after
going down to 8%
he suddenly jumped up to 30% and slowly
made its way down until dying a two
percent after recalibrating it there was
no more random skipping of the battery
and it easily lasts well over six hours
now so before you go killing off
everything in sight and search at that
extra hour of battery life you may want
to try calibrating the battery</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
