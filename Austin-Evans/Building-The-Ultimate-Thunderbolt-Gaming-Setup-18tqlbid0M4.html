thunderbolt set up this entire project
started a few months ago when I had a
conversation with Intel's thunderbolt
team about what really to me felt like a
very obvious use case for thunderbolt a
single cable powering an entire crazy
over-the-top gaming setup
luckily they agreed and alongside Dell
Intel was able to sponsor this entire
set up and make it happen
the set up is built around the Dell XPS
13 this is a terrific ultra block not
only is it powered by the latest eighth
generation Core i7 processor but you
have great battery life a good screen
all the normal kind of laptop stuff but
what it lacks is some dedicated graphics
for gaming which is where Thunderbolt
comes in the HP S is connected today or
as GT X 1080 gaming box this little
enclosure here houses not only a full GT
X 1080 graphics card but it also has a
power supply to power down of the
graphics card in the laptop but it also
has USB ports for the rest of our
accessories what's great about this is
that with a single Thunderbolt 3 cable
your thin and light Dell that you carry
around all day long turns into a full
proper gaming setup there are a wide
variety of Thunderbolt 3 enclosures
available most of which have graphics
cards built in and those started around
$350 or so but there are also other
options without the GPU that you can add
yourself so these started around $200
and one of the ones I recently took a
look at was the Razer core X this
supports a full sized graphics card with
plenty of power for pretty much anything
you want to put in there the reason we
chose to go with the gaming box is for a
few reasons
first of all at GTX 1080 is a lot of
power paired with an ultrabook like this
but it also has some additional features
so first of all we have a series of USB
ports on the back which is helpful
because we wanted to make sure that all
of our accessories could be wired in
with just that single defender volt
cable and on top of that this does
support a full 100 watts of power
delivery which means that we don't have
to charge our laptop either it really is
one single Thunderbolt 3 cable to make
this entire setup work to take advantage
of all this gaming hardware we have
three full monitors and by monitors I
mean TVs
these are TVs they're 55 inch 4k HD are
panels
so this in hindsight may have been a
little bit of overkill but I mean come
on we're building the ultimate
Thunderbolt set up overkill is kind of
what you're here for right
pair with this are my favorite gaming
peripherals right now first of all we
have the Razer Huntsman elite keyboard I
did an entire video about this you
should definitely go check it out this
is straight up my favorite keyboard that
I've ever tried alongside this we have
these Zowie
what is it the the BenQ Zowie that's k1
I knew it the FK one this is actually
the mouse I've been using for like two
years now not only do I use it for
editing and general use but it is really
great for gaming as well I probably
should have known the name of the mouth
should nayeth all this is backed up by
my favorite gamepad right now the Xbox
one wireless controller now this is seen
a few revisions over the years most
notably it now has bluetooth and you can
also do a cool design lab version which
maybe doesn't match with the setup but I
don't care because it's my custom Austin
not Duncan one but the cool thing is
this is going to be a nice benefit for
when you want to play racing games or
stuff that doesn't work well with the
mouse and keyboard what's really cool
about this is when you sit in front of
it urea is just how immersive it is I
mean look at this we've got three
displays all running in surround it's so
seamless I mean yeah the TV's have a
little bit of a border but I mean come
on this is so cool almost like sitting
with like a VR headset on as opposed to
three giant TVs oh dude what this is the
point of the video where I'm just like
freaking out the whole time so we're
playing on full epic settings too so
right now the resolution is set to 57 60
by 1080 but it's full epic basically
everything and framerate wise we're
doing pretty solid I mean we're pretty
much around 50 to 60 fps see I do a lot
of videos with fortnight right a lot of
the time I'm playing on like $200 pcs
they're like seven frames per second on
ultra low settings but this totally
feels like cheating
I mean sure when I'm looking ahead it
looks like a fairly standard field of
view but I look left and right I can
have such a competitive advantage go
it's like downside is that some of the
information is all the way over to the
left or all the way over to the right
such as the mini-map I mean sure you
could go build an incredibly expensive
gaming PC and get this sort of permanent
setup going but the greatest part is the
students are done with this game I
unplug a single cable and I've got my
normal Ultrabook that's completely
portable that I can take with me to
school or work or whatever whoa this is
like chippy it's like all those enough
to get you motion sick at summer
of all right let's do this I'm coming
there we go
I can be helpful you have a very cool
cape too so immersive I mean it's crazy
just how into the game I feel this feels
incredibly dangerous
I shouldn't be hiding underneath this
tree right now I'm just gonna run
running us always a good option right oh
yeah haha I like this
[Laughter]
no no no no no no no no no no no no no
that's not how this works
that's not how all right well it's fine
we we came in number two I cannot go
back to playing games on a mere single
display or a phone or a switch or a 200
laptop can't don't let me go back can I
can I just do this now actually might
get good at Porton I have a play on this
set up next up we have Forza horizon for
not only is this one of my favorite
games out there but the PC version is
actually really good this year which is
especially helpful when you have three
giant TVs in front of you if you want to
be lame you can drive outside the car
and I mean yes that's fine but nah this
the way do it you have something I'm
noticing is that the mirrors in the game
I've never really paid that much
attention to playing on like Xbox but it
makes a big difference here on PC not
only are the reflections nice and high
quality but I can really see especially
with this right-hand mirror when people
are behind me it's a small thing but it
really kind of goes to show just how
useful a setup like this can be Hey nope
nope that was too aggressive that was
too aggressive that's okay I made it huh
no you don't there we go little pump
never heard anybody rate I do have the
same problem as I did with fortnight and
that some of my information like the HUD
is way too far away but I mean come on
it's fine it's like a real race I don't
need my my mini-map I could just kind of
drive by the seat of my pants and the
voice of the GPS of course Thunderbolt
is useful for more than just purely
playing games so not only are we adding
a ton of extra graphics horsepower to
our system but we do have all the extra
USB ports and power and stuff and we
also have the ability to hook up
multiple 4k monitors so that's something
that's going to make a big difference in
things like video editing and racing
games but mostly the old video editing
and creative professional activities
like drifting and that is the ultimate
Thunderbolt setup a lot of work went
into nellie our brand-new set to getting
this all together it's a huge out to
everyone here and of course massive
thank you to Intel and Dell for
sponsoring this video if you excuse me
I'm going to go do some real work on my
tiny XPS 13</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
