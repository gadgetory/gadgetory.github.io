tutorial on how to make an OS 10.8
mountain lion install drive or DVD this
can be helpful for several reasons you
might have multiple macs to upgrade or
want a quick way to install mountain
lion without having to download the
entire OS apple will most likely make a
10.8 restore drive however why spend $7
or more when you can make one yourself
first step is to buy mountain lion in
the App Store if you've already got
mountain lion on your Apple account you
can go over to the purchase tab and
download it from here once it's
downloaded the Installer will
automatically pop up instead of running
it just close it open up your
Applications folder and find the
mountain lion installer right-click it
and select show package contents then go
into contents and finally shared support
you should see Install ESD GMG here now
open up Disk Utility grab the dmg and
drag it into the sidebar now you can
either make a disc or a USB Drive if you
want to create a restore DVD all you
need to do is select the dmg and click
burn on the other hand if you're wanting
to install it on a USB Drive you have a
couple of options this will work on any
USB Drive that has at least 5 gigabytes
of storage free however you can do it a
couple different ways I'll be using a
SanDisk Extreme USB 3.0 Drive for this
tutorial and I do recommend that if you
have a newer Mac with USB 3 to use a
drive like this as it's much faster once
you've plugged your USB Drive into your
Mac we're ready to go if you only want
to use this Drive for mountain lion you
can skip ahead if you'd like to also put
other data on the drives you'll need to
partition it select your drive and
navigate to the partition tab select two
partitions then choose mac OS extended
journaled for the format and name it
whatever you like then select five
gigabytes as the partition size for the
other partition you can format this
however you like but keep in mind that
any data you have on it will be a race
now once you're all set hit apply and
give it a minute now let's finish up
click on the mountain lion dmg and click
open to mount it a window will open but
just close that now select the partition
on your USB Drive and drag the Mac os10
installed over to the destination then
click restore and then erase depending
on your drive this could take quite a
while but once it's done you're good to
go now anytime you want to install OS 10
simply insert the driver disk into your
Mac and hold option while booting you
should see a recovery part
tincho up select it and then install
mountain lion anyway guys if you enjoyed
