incredibly stylish suit for one reason
I'm about to go into this cleanroom to
take a look to see how Dr savers is able
to save everything from a hard drive to
an SSD to importantly 4 we're going to
be doing today how to save the data on
your smartphone so probably savers
sponsor this out to take a look at their
entire facility including this two
million dollar cleanroom so I'm all
suited up I'm afraid of about to destroy
everything but that's so inside the
cleanroom what we're going to be able to
do is look at a wide variety of
different ways of saving the data on a
hard drive so you can see they have
these systems set up all along the wall
with the power supplies and have various
different connectors but essentially the
main goal is to figure out once you get
the hard drive what's the problem and
how to fix it so the ideal goal is to be
able to just copy all the data over and
clone it to another drive so sometimes
that actually is going to be possible
drive savers has a variety of different
tools and different pieces of software
to do that kind of stuff but as you'd
imagine it's not always going to be that
simple sometimes though you actually
have to get a little bit more creative
so we actually have tools that will be
able to not only be able to reflash the
firmware on a drive so sometimes that'll
be enough to save it and sometimes you
actually have to do surgeries you're
actually going to have to open up the
drive swap out different pieces in fact
actually I think you're opening a drive
right now yes what's the deal with this
one it's a clicking hard drive that's
never a good sign so this is something
that you're going to have to do some
surgery on the drive to be able to save
it you're gonna need a donor drive gacha
gacha it's funny I deal with a lot of PC
stuff but I never actually see open up
hard drives because you really do need
something like a cleanroom like this to
be able to actually access them couple
specks of dust will absolutely kill
something like that so once you get the
drive up and running and you have all
the hardware sorted the firmware sorted
the next step is to actually clone it
all off as you can imagine with some
drives it can take quite a while
anything from 30 minutes up to a couple
weeks depending on how badly the drive
is damaged and how much data you
actually have to copy this is so cool
there's so much interesting tech here to
be able to say drives from all kinds of
sizes all different kinds of types but
that's only part of what drive savers do
they also work on phones SSDs memory
cards USB is they've been bitten by dogs
so step out of the cleanroom and we have
the drive inventory so you've got some
cool stuff here
this is a 10 megabyte hard drive it is
it is we purchased this for a recovery
for it and they have to equate a
proprietary system that was running a
robotic arm look at that so what year do
you think this is from
I'm guessing very late 80s late 80s I
look at that you can see the old-school
Seagate logo 10 megabytes it's insane
that this is 10 megabytes so what you're
looking at here are 20,000 hard drives
that are valued at about 2 million
dollars you're gonna find all kinds of
crazy stuff so one of the things that
they really have to keep in mind is that
you never know what kind of drive is
going to come in so sometimes you might
have to have a multitude of the exact
same model number because maybe there's
gonna be slight differences in the
firmware or the slight differences in
the hardware so once they're done with
the drive before it's recycled they want
to make sure that there's absolutely no
chance that there's going to be any data
left on it there's a couple fun tools to
do that first of all is the data
Eliminator or the degausser which it
just sounds really cool this essentially
will just basically EMP it right say
goodbye to this drive it's about to be
degauss alright so just push it in I'm
sure when these is not cheap I think I
feel I can say that about literally
anything in here like everything looks
expensive yeah what's that it what that
array success will remove media I wasn't
paying attention it sounded like a bomb
went off so now that's bendy gallows the
next step is to physically destroy the
drive which we don't have to do but I
kind of want to do so we put the drive
in here close the door and now I'm gonna
hit destroy oh you can see it's just a
little you're gonna bend the drive in
half oh no no wait
oh man this drive has had a rough day
has it been a impede but now I'm pretty
sure it's safe to say you're gonna get
any data off of this these guys I don't
think we'll be able to save this one so
assuming that you don't crush your drive
the next step in the process once you
leave the clean room is to come
downstairs so each workstation is going
to have a whole series of pcs as well as
drive bays so for example if I want to
just drop a drive in here ah I I knew
that I know how to hard drive so at this
point they've gotten all the days that
they can tan off and it's been cloned
into a drive so normally you might think
oh yes I just want everything but do you
think about it what's on a hard drive is
going to be your Windows install but
your programs that you're not
necessarily going to want so when you
first contact drive savers they're gonna
ask hey what's on this Drive do you care
about photos documents pictures whatever
the case is photos and pictures are the
same thing I'm gonna keep going
so essentially they'll start looking
through and say oh look we found all of
your wedding photos or whatever the case
is make sure that can be prioritized so
that you get the stuff that you actually
want all right so this is what I've been
waiting all day for now of course it's
great to be able to recover stuff on
hard drives but one of the main things
that drive savers also does is recover
data off of smartphones so this is my
victim a samsung galaxy s6 all right all
right all right so I'll see here just
with my fingernail okay so get the
battery so I don't electrocute myself
okay all right so this is getting to be
a little bit more manageable so we've
got Hernan
so this is our NAND right here right so
I do see the individual pads here so it
doesn't really it's like I can kind of
see it so hopefully it's not gonna be
too hard to give it like a silicon layer
in between so I have well I just realize
how many people have gathered around to
watch this disaster okay so at this
point I've got the phone disconnected or
and disassembled and all ready to go
it's all lined up I can see in the
microscope exactly what I'm doing
so next step is to take a heat gun sort
of melt the solder and basically just
need to get the NAND flash off okay well
I got like the first corner up I
surprise to just work my way down now
right
go through oh there we go okay
still we're not gonna put it back in the
phone right we actually have a special
reader for it but we're gonna take off
all the silicone there clean that off
reball it so that if it's gonna be
perfect okay so as it should be a
surprise to knowing I am a failure so
that's why you send your phone to dry
favors not Austen savers so the thing
was I got it like what maybe forty
percent ready something like that yeah
forty percent fixed however forty
percent will not get your phone up and
running I brought you the hopefully
fixed reball NAND flash nice okay this
is from an Essex in my crew a galaxy s6
yes I'm legitimately nervous if I ruin
this chip or not I think I did but we'll
see
oh hey alright so you notice that's
right off the bat we've got we've got
some good signs here is this partition
here is going to be our user data
partitioning okay coming in at about 30
gigabytes of data the good thing is at
this point once everything's dumped the
sort of the danger zone is over we're
like the chip can go and then light on
fire who cares whatever all the data say
no matter we can step on it by accident
we've got a copy of it so for right now
I think it's safe to say that this has
been a successful recovery of a phone
that I did not break even though I came
really close so that is our totally
better than Linus's tour of the drive
savers facility of course huge chodes
drive savers for sponsoring this video
if you guys ever have any problems with
your data you definitely know who to
contact just make sure that you don't
ask for Austin</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
