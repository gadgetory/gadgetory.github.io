of the logitech c310 high-definition
webcam it features a fixed focus 5
megapixel sensor for Stills along with
720p video capabilities for both
recording and video chatting speaking of
video chatting the c310 supports all the
major services including Skype gchat and
anywhere else that supports a typical
webcam alright so here's a quality test
of the logitech c310 I am using of
course the webcam and I am using the
inboard microphone so just can give you
a little bit of an idea of where I am
right now I'm going to have my fairly
loud computer just about a foot or two
away from the microphone so if you guys
are hearing that the background noise
that's definitely what you're hearing as
far as lighting here it's very very
standard I just got a standard light
above me nothing particularly bright I
do have my window with the shades drawn
will just give me a little bit of light
there so hopefully this gives you a good
idea of what it is normal conditions I
not go ahead and turn off the lights and
let you see what does in lower light ok
so this is a very very dark room I've
got the shades drawn I've got the light
off everything pretty much the only
light in the room is illuminating from
the monitor Jason's here of course it's
going to be fairly grainy everything but
it is still usable especially if I got a
little bit closer to the screen my
brightness turned up a little bit so
even in low-light situations well it's
not going to be perfect but for things
like Skype video call night kind stuff
you're going to have no problems
mounting the webcam on a monitor is a
snap just align the rubber strip on the
front of your display and push the rear
down and it's good to go
the c310 comes with logitech webcam
software an application that allows you
to capture Stills and video as well as
control digital panning and zooming the
webcam software is quite good overall
allowing you to get a decent amount of
control over your webcam without being a
huge blow to program that's always
running the c310 is very compact however
it still delivers quite good
high-definition video quality the audio
certainly leaves a lot to be desired
however it's quite easy to use an
external USB microphone along with the
webcam if this is an issue for you MSRP
on the logitech c310
is $50 however you can frequently find
it for far less and for that cheap I
really find it hard to recommend
anything cheaper so I've got no problem
in recommending to logitech c310 if you
