a review of Infinity Blade 2 for the
iPhone iPod touch and iPad selling the
original Infinity Blade was probably one
of the more popular games of last year
and this is the sequel which is now
optimized for the iPad 2 as well as the
iPhone 4s with some really really nice
graphics so if you guys have ever played
Infinity Blade before this is very very
similar I'm not a big fan of the
gameplay it's mostly consists of you
watching its cutscene you tap on the
screen and you go into a boss fight you
swipe punch on the screen then some
repeat all the time but if you're into
these kind of games it is really quite
awesome that's great alright so anyway
so let's go ahead just jump right into
it and apologize in advance if I'm
really bad it is very hard to do this to
the camera without noting that iPhone
all over the place but it's one do it so
the controls are very very simple you
swipe and you just there we go so I try
to explain it to you while not dying but
what you need to do is you need to do
lots of swipes and all kinds of stuff
and then you have a couple buttons on
the bottom so for example who wanted it
this we block someone hit this we can
dodge the right and if he wants to take
this again dodge left and then you just
swipe a bunch off the top left in the
top right and sorry I'm talking about
fast got to try to sure this is what
best I can but top left and right we
have magic as well as tanks so do you
guys see very very simple we're like
what he's the Hat help ish good but work
through some of this help and see if we
can get up welcome and very great there
are a lot of different kinds of moves
that you can do for example eyes are
good combo right there like that and
slicing away there we go but it's
nothing particularly amazing and like I
said it's not my favorite type of
gameplay so I'm probably the best person
well I will say there are some awesome
things about this game the cinematics
are good and it's all in-game so let me
just kill him real quick
like that but you guys to be able to see
that the cinematics I think it's all in
real-time so it's not like you're
watching cutscenes and pre-rendered
video and all that kind stuff come on do
it okay there we go
so there you go that was magic so you
guys can see here you fill up these do
soon it's next to experiences and
victories here we go
but as you guys saw there is no was
magic so if you tap on that it will
allow you to do some cool moves and also
on the left side there's also another
thing basically what it is it's kind of
power-ups so they would go drop and here
we go so once you finish it boss fight
well I don't know this is not stating
the boss light it's just a fight you get
a few things of whoops
actually it works fine so we go through
our items we have rings all kinds of
stuff like that
we have inventory as well as we have the
store where you can buy some new things
and over here you do have stats so let's
hop back out here hey guys it's gonna be
about it from my review overall if you
like the first Infinity Blade the second
one is definitely going to be for you
personally I would just prefer some more
substance to the game so for example we
can swipe the screen and take a look at
the great graphics and they are really
quite nice but beyond that there's not a
whole lot that you can do of course you
know walking around or anything you go
you watch cutscene
you swipe on the screen to bunch
cutscene swipe on screen etc etc but if
you like that that's the kind of games
that you like definitely go ahead and
pick this up but I really don't really
recommend it for the $7 if anything if
you want to take a look at it wait for
maybe a light version or perhaps it to
go down in price anyway guys if you
enjoyed this review definitely be sure
to leave it a thumbs up and if you're
