discussion about windows 8 and today
I've got two special guests so Adam
Lewis you wanna go ahead and introduce
yourself hey guys my name is Adam you
can find me at youtube.com slash tech
tech man TV I make all kinds of tech
videos and yeah and lewis and you can
find me at youtube.com / lluis Macintosh
and I just make technology videos in
general alright so today we're going to
be talking a lot about our thoughts on
windows 8 if you guys missed it earlier
this week Microsoft did announce and
release the windows 8 not I guess
developer previews the correct word for
it and it's just basically a very early
version of windows 8 and all three of us
have had a few days to go ahead and get
it and kind of try it out and everything
so let's go and give you guys some of
our thoughts so probably the biggest
thing not probably it is the biggest
thing is the Metro UI no no you guys
have been coming from OS 10 or did your
thoughts on metro UI and what do you
think it really brings to windows so I
think it really brings another factor to
Windows it kind of is like having two
os's even though you know it's not I
think it gives a lot of use for a tablet
and that's the main thing i really see
going towards metro UI i think it's
going to really be great on tablets on
the look on the desktop a little bit
awkward still but I think it'll get wall
get used to it for a while I think it
opens up a new market for Microsoft in
just tablets because usually their
windows seven tablets just suck and with
this new metro I Metro UI it looks so
much better and then I found myself
basically having a switch between
Windows 7 desktop and the Metro you want
it so you can probably integrate that a
little bit better kind of feel just like
multitasking two different operating
systems yeah absolutely yeah one of the
things is I it's good and bad i think on
the one hand being able switch between
they want all the standard Windows 7
desktop and your Windows 8 you know
Metro UI that's nice because you still
have your full functionality that you
have in windows 7 on the other hand
though I don't think it's quite as a
cohesive experience as it could be i
think it's kind of a little jarring to
go from you thinking y'all horizontally
scrolling this kind of stuff to being
able to go back to your normal desktop
and i don't know i'm not i'm not sold on
the implementation of it yet i think
that Microsoft I definitely do well I'm
sure they definitely well I mean you
know windows 8 supply a year will show
away from release but I think there's a
lot that they could do to know kind of
make it a little bit better of an
experience
now beyond that there are also some
other new changes for example the
windows App Store what do you guys think
kind of course you have the mac app
store everything what do you guys kind
of think about you know something like
the windows app store and so the other
changes that kind of jumped adds you
about Windows 8 so with the windows App
Store I think it's going to be honestly
better than the mac app store for the
main reason is that there's a lot more
users on the pc there's a lot more apps
made for Windows and that's one of the
reasons why I don't use the mac app
store too much you know there's just not
that many applications compared to slang
like the android market or the iphone
app store and on the Windows Store I'm
sure it's going to be a lot better and
pretty much on the mac app store there
aren't that much applications compared
to windows so it's pretty much gonna be
like the opposite on the mobile phone
where Apple has a ton of applications
and now those has little some be the
total opposite and plus it'll be just a
much safer place to get programs without
getting viruses or scamming getting
scammed or anything like that yeah I
agree one of the big things about at
with no windows is there's lots of free
programs this kind of stuff but you
never know where they're gonna you
install toolbars or you know like
spyware and just just kind of just junk
on your computer and that really drives
me crazy so those guys it's going to be
about it for our brief thoughts on
Windows 8 overall I'm pretty excited
about Windows 8 I think it's gonna be a
really solid operating system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
