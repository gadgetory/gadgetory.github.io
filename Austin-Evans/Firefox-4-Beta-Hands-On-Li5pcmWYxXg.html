on Firefox 4 beta 1 i'm says this just
came out a couple hours ago I've had
some time to run a few tests and to play
around with a little bit and overall I'm
pretty impressed so that let's go ahead
and just start whisking of the most
obvious thing which is the interface I'm
so as you guys can see it is Firefox has
made a big jump in this direction it's
actually gone away from there having the
tabs on the bottom and now it looks very
similar to Chrome but mostly opera on so
as you guys can see here you have the
Firefox menu button which will go ahead
and pull up a lot of your buttons and
options and stuff then you have your
tabs on top and then you have you know
your back buttons and address bar and
all that kind of stuff so guys this
looks extremely similar to opera and
also chrome which is not a bad thing
guys just because the tabs on top idea
works one small quibble about it though
is that as you guys can see here with
the Firefox button it takes up this
entire upper section of the browser and
really there's nothing else there so i
prefer the opera's way of doing it of
you know actually having the tabs right
beside it or even chrome of just not
having a button there at all but you
know it's not a huge deal it's just a
little bit of screen real estate I'm so
as you guys can see windows Aero glass
is really heavily and integrated so as
you guys can see here the tabs or
transparent everything is transparent
when you're using windows seven on this
is a great touch in addition you also
arrow peak so all you have to do is just
come down here and just hover over it
and you can go ahead and take your look
at your different tabs which is a great
feature but guys in case you're wanting
to you know go back to the same way
Firefox used to be of course it is
Firefox and it's totally customizable so
let's go ahead we can do a bunch of
things come down to customize we can go
ahead and get rid of the tabs on top so
it's a more of a you know like a
standard Firefox layout and if we want
would go even farther we can go ahead
and customize put the menu bar back so
as you can guys can see within just two
clicks we're pretty much back to where
you know Firefox used to be just with a
lot of aero glass so guys it's very
customizable let's go ahead and just put
it back to the way it was so and just go
through here and so yeah guys so course
Firefox and that's not even counting
their themes and looks pretty good
already I'm so guys let's go ahead talk
a little bit about speed so as you guys
can see it's a pretty fat
things listed quite and pick on a page
I'm guys I've run a couple of tests on
it now do keep in mind that you know
this is just come out I will have a full
browser comparison test before too long
here but just with my preliminary tests
it is a pretty decent step up so as you
guys can see I ran the Peacekeeper
benchmark on Iran with several browsers
around with opera 10.6 on the latest
beta build of google chrome safari five
the 3.66 3.66 of firefox and then the
beta for as you and as you guys can see
firefox beta 4 is quite a bit faster I'm
sorry not beta for Firefox 4 beta all
these crazy names so as you guys can see
it's a decent step up but guys actually
I wouldn't really pay too much attention
to this of course you know opera is
almost twice as much but actually I
really like the speed on it it is
actually really quite fast so guys I
mean this is kind of something hard to
show you guys in a screencast it's
really something that you need to
download it for yourself but in general
guys I'm coming off of chrome and I
really haven't noticed any kind of major
difference yeah maybe a half second here
a third a second here but really guys in
practice you're not really going to
notice anything so guys of course one of
the bigger things was just released on
the main build of Firefox was crash
support that guys personally this was
one of the major things I've always had
against Firefox or at least in recent
years is that it is very crash groan I
mean you know it's always crashing here
usually because of flash and stuff as
you guys can see here which go to my
channel of course flash ports just fine
but the thing is well say i'm watching
this video and halfway through flash
dies which is you know something pretty
common well instead of you know crashing
the entire firefox browser it will
basically just wait a few seconds and if
it's still not responding you basically
just get a tad page very similar to in
chrome or just says you know it flashed
died or whatever and you're all set you
know you know you don't lose anything
which is really great I'm so yeah guys
that's about it there's not a whole lot
to say I will of course have a full
speed test because I do think there's
more to it I think that's peacekeeper
it's a pretty good benchmark but you're
just in real-world testing Firefox 4 is
pretty fast I'm so guys go ahead if you
want to go ahead and check
and this is of course the beta go ahead
and hit the link in the description you
can go ahead and download it for
yourself today try it out sootch think
so yeah guys anyway thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
