hey guys Boston this is the Samsung
Galaxy Note 9 if you go all the way back
to 2011 when the first Galaxy Note came
out it kind of changed smartphones in a
big way quite literally a big way as not
only is it one of the biggest
smartphones of its time but fast forward
to 2018 and that has kind of become the
standard this has a massive six point
four inch screen but the real question
is as the note 9 even worth it with an
eye-watering lehigh thousand dollar plus
price tag at first glance the note 9
doesn't look all that different than its
predecessor however that's not
necessarily going to be a bad thing the
previous phone was one of the nicest
builds and designs of any smartphone in
2017 and that definitely follows through
in 2018 with an all-glass aluminum build
there's no one who's gonna complain to
the note 9 is an ugly-looking smart
phone annoy problems and this is
actually kind of shared with the note 8
is that it is really really big now I
know I just talked all about how the
note was one of the very first phones to
bring phablets to the mainstream but
this is just really tall as you'd expect
from the Samsung flagship you are going
to be getting ip68 water assistance
wireless charging and if you look on the
bottom what's very unique with this
almost no other phone has it actually
open this up here you're going to see a
little round port now this is actually
not all that common in phones these days
but it's known as a headphone jack it's
not really something that most people
have this is back in the days before
Bluetooth where you use like wires or
something to connect your headphones I
know it sounds really weird I don't
think anyone actually uses it but if
theory if you wanted to plug in your
headphones to your note you can do that
there's also an S Pen but no one cares
about that one of the big upgrades on
the Galaxy Note 9 this year are stereo
speakers which is especially helpful
concerning that before having a single
speaker on the bottom of such a giant
phone scene ridiculous what they're
doing here just like on a lot of other
phones including the s9 the iPhone is
they're going to be using the earpiece
as well as the Bond speaker to give you
a pretty convincing stereo effect it
also helps that it's properly loud
you're also going to find the Bigsby
button I'm still going to complain about
it and Samsung is still going to do
absolutely nothing to fix it but luckily
I have a much better solution one thing
I have had some issues with is the
fingerprint sensor now thankfully
Samsung has moved it to below the
cameras as opposed to right beside it
which is a nice change however the
problem is is it actually isn't all that
accurate what's new this year is that
you swipe your finger across the sensor
wants to be able to enroll it as a
fingerprint
now that sounds great it's a lot faster
to set up so the problem is it's just
really an accurate for me now sure being
able to tap your finger on a bunch of
times when you first set up the phone is
kind of annoying but at least you know
the fingerprint sensor is pretty good
whereas here no matter how many times I
try to reinstate fingers it just isn't
all that accurate for me maybe it's just
an issue with my note 9 whether it's the
software or the hardware but the good
thing is the facial recognition is going
to be pretty solid so you have a form of
base ID known as face unlock as well as
iris recognition which in combination
should be able to unlock pretty quickly
that's not going to be quite as fast as
something like to be one plus six but
it's around on par with the iPhone 10
and honestly security wise just be okay
it won't unlock for can it'll unlock for
me so I guess that's a good thing with a
snapdragon 845 onboard just as you would
expect this is going to be right up
there with the rest of the Android
flight ships of this year and while on
paper it's going to fall a little bit
behind the iPhone 10 and it's crazy fast
AAA 11 chip you're definitely not going
to be disappointed with the performance
of the note 9 what this isn't at least
based on my first impressions is as fast
as the one plus six and considering that
this is going to be about double the
price that's not really going to be a
good sign now a big part of that has to
do with software oneplus has a fairly
stock looking skin which doesn't have a
lot of extra bloat so I don't want to
say that the note 9 is full of all the
old-school TouchWiz of Samsung's past
but it is definitely not going to be as
speedy and that high-resolution screen
doesn't make things better one of the
big advantages of the note 9 that has to
do with its gaming capabilities so of
course there's the biggest hottest games
of 2018 which are available on the note
and of course we have to talk about the
Battle Royale that everyone is playing
right now
pugsy mobile who are awesome enough to
sponsor this video this is the official
mobile version of player unknowns
battlegrounds if somehow you haven't
heard of it it's a free-to-play Battle
Royale game on both Android and iOS
which features a hundred players
all dropping into a massive Island for a
winner-takes-all battle I don't need to
tell you that you played pop G right
well pup geez now on your phone I should
expect with a high end phone like the
note 9 it's going to have no problem
playing pub G at fairly high settings
but since its Android you can actually
customize it all the way up to Ultra HD
you can change the frame rate cap you
can even change the style of the game
it's especially impressive considering
that you're getting the full experience
with both of the games huge maps and
it's all going to be powered by Unreal
Engine and give you full 7.1 audio hours
Meli can you play with four people on a
squad but they're going to be faster
paced arcade modes which are over in 8
minutes for a quick game I'm always
going to be partial to a mouse and
keyboard but the controls really are not
going to be bad especially for a mobile
shooter the moral of the story pop G
mobile is fun regardless of where you
play it that's especially good on the
note 9 with a six point four inch 20 960
by 1440p AMOLED display it shouldn't be
any surprise that this is one of the
nicest smartphone screens on the market
now so when you put a side-by-side with
the iPhone 10 it looks very similar and
to be totally honest Samsung has done on
top of the panel game for a few years
now so even something like an s7 or s8
looks good but this this is about as
good as it gets one of the more
surprising upgrades with the note 9 it
has to do with the battery and no it's
not that it's going to catch on fire
anything cuz that's totally not what it
used to happen instead the Galaxy Note 9
has a much larger four thousand milliamp
hours sell maybe because of that Samsung
was a little conservative last year with
a fairly small 3300 milliamp hour
battery but this year with a full 4,000
on board now these are going to easily
last through a full day something that
couldn't always be said about the note 8
or even the s9 but also get some
differentiation which has always been
one of my big issues with the note if
you're not into the s-pen a lot of times
it just makes sense to buy the normal
galaxy s so at its core the note 9 still
has a pair of 12 megapixel cameras one
wide-angle camera with a variable
aperture as well as a telephoto option
now I've always felt like especially on
the s9 the variable aperture is nice but
doesn't make a huge difference no it's
not necessarily a new camera feature the
s-pen has been upgraded with the ability
to use it as a selfie
pen remote I guess just snap selfies by
pressing the button it's pretty cool so
we do have the live focus mode which is
going to be the same as the galaxy s 9
and while it works for the most part it
does have some problems with some pretty
major differences in contrast that's not
great I've noticed a lot of overexpose
in the background with this especially
in some of the pictures that I've taken
it definitely has that issue one of my
big issues with the note 9 is that you
get about the cheaper and almost
identical galaxy s 9 + 6 months ago now
sure smartphone is definitely evolving
and there are some advantages with going
with the S Pen and with the notes but
when you look at other phones like the
Oppo find X which brings terrific design
and somebody that's legitimately
different around this price point this
is kind of a harder sell especially when
you consider that the 1 plus 6 is equal
to this in a lot of ways at half the
price on top of that there's some
serious competition coming up with the
next generation iPhone a pixel right
around the corner now sure if you really
need that s-pen by all means go pick up
a note 9 but at $1000 plus I just don't
think it's worth it for most people and
of course huge shout out to pubsey
mobile you guys wanna check it out the
link will be in the description and let
me know would you actually want to pick
