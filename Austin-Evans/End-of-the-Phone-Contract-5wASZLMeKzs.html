an event in New York City the CEO of
t-mobile got up on stage and proclaim
the death of contracts on paper it
sounds pretty good
you can pay pretty much any phone you
want including the HTC One the galaxy s4
even the iPhone 5 offer only $100 most
of the time your bill should be quite a
bit less and on top of that since you're
not bound by a contract you can leave
t-mobile at any time and switch to
whoever you like however let's actually
take a closer look to see if this is any
good for starters what a lot of people
don't realize is that phones are much
more expensive than they think they are
so here in the United States if I wanted
to go buy a brand new iPhone 5 from a
carrier right now it would cost me $200
however if I wanted to buy one directly
from Apple without any kind of contract
it would run me 650 dollars this is
called a subsidy in return for giving
you a $450 discount on your brand-new
phone the carrier will then ask you to
sign a contract whether it's 1 year 2
year 3 years depending on where you live
in the world as it is right now
contracts do make some sense as if
you're going to be staying with a
network for a couple years anyway you
might as well get the discount on your
phone but of course a carrier isn't just
going to give you a massive discount on
your phone and then call it even to make
their money back they then make the
price of the subsidies into the price
you pay every single month so whether
it's 10 15 or 20 dollars more you never
see it but the prices were higher than
they otherwise should be that's where
t-mobile comes in since there are no
contracts to sign you can feel free to
leave whenever you want and because
there are no subsidies built into the
price that means it's typically going to
be cheaper than other options as well if
you're bringing your own phone to
t-mobile then it makes a lot of sense
for example if you have a nexus 4 all
you got to do is toss a t-mobile SIM
card in there and then you're paying $70
a month for unlimited everything however
if you're buying a phone from t-mobile
then you lose a lot of this advantage so
let's say I want to go buy a galaxy s4
so get into the store I pay $100 up
front and I get the phone however you're
also going to have to pay $20 a month
for the next two years to pay off the
rest of the phone now the math works out
that this is actually slightly cheaper
than just buying the phone outright
however you are basically tied to a
contract of a different kind you're
still free to leave t-mobile but you're
still gonna have to pay off your
t-mobile phone hopefully you guys found
this helpful and understanding exactly
what all this crazy stuff is about so I
know it's complicated but in general I
think these new t-mobile plans are step
forward for everybody now if you're
bringing your own phone to the network
they make a lot of sense if you're
buying a phone from t-mobile
they're not really that much cheaper
than anything else however I am glad to
say the t-mobile is charging you exactly
for what you're buying as opposed to
just saying oh here's a 200 ollar phone
now you gotta go pay $100 a month for
the next two years I'm curious to know
what do you guys think about these new
t-mobile plans pretty much the only
thing holding me back from switching is
the fact that t-mobile really isn't all
that got around here whereas a Verizon
is much much better but I know the
t-mobile is a lot better in many places
so definitely be sure to let me know
what you guys think in the comments
below if you guys are interested in more
feel free to check out my hands-on of
the brand new Samsung Galaxy s4 if you
enjoyed definitely be sure to leave this
video a thumbs up and if you're
interested in more videos like this be
sure to subscribe anyway guys I will
catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
