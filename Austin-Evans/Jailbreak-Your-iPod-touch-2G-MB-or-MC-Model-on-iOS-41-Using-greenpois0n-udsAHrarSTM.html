show you how to jailbreak your iPod
Touch 2nd generation using green poison
so of course green poison has been out
for just a little while but recently it
was updated with support for the iPod
touch same generation as well as the
iPod Touch 3rd generation a gigabyte MC
model whatever you want to call it
basically it will support all iPod
touches except for the first generation
so I have a couple questions that I
would do one answer before I begin this
is a fully untethered jailbreak so no
worries it should be just fine you go
ahead and shut it off turn on any
however many times you want you will not
have to worry about it being a tethered
jailbreak other than that it should be
really simple all you need to do is make
sure that your iPod touch is on iOS 4.1
the latest firmware in you're ready to
begin so the first step is going to be
to download the program itself so all
you need to do for this is to go to
green poison calm of course we'll have
the link in the description below so go
ahead and go to green poison calm and
you're gonna go ahead and have three
options
um so basically you just go ahead and
pick from depending on what kind of
operating system you are running on your
computer
so if you have Mac click Mac if you have
Linux click Linux and of course if you
have windows click Windows so for this
tutorial I will be using Windows however
it pretty much works the same way no
matter what so now at this point we're
pretty much ready to go I know there's
one last thing before begin that I do
want to let you guys know about you
should go ahead at this point plug your
device in to iTunes and let it fully
sync now by doing this you will backup
all of your data now you should not lose
your data in the jailbreak so nothing
should change however there's always a
possibility of something going wrong and
since you go ahead and synced with
iTunes you should be okay so no matter
what a quick restore will get you back
to normal so go ahead and just go ahead
sync with iTunes and now we're going to
go ahead and need to shut your device
off so simply go ahead and hold the
power button go ahead and slide to power
off and wait for the pinwheel and there
we go so we're off ok so now at this
point let's go ahead and do the
jailbreak itself so should not take just
a minute go ahead and open it up here ok
so now we're going to go ahead and put
it into DF
I know this is gonna be a really simple
process you basically hold the power
button for three seconds then you start
holding the power and home for ten
seconds and then you release the power
button and you keep holding the home
button it's very simple I will go ahead
and walk you through it as well as the
program has very clear because it's
instructions on how to do this if you
drop a button or for whatever reason go
ahead and just hold both the power and
the home button it should cycle back
through and you can go ahead and try it
again okay so let's go ahead just do it
so we can go ahead and click prepare to
jailbreak let's go ahead get ready to
Jilly run three two one start holding
the power button three two one now then
go ahead and hold the power and the home
button I'm gonna do this for seven
seconds so of course we're to go ahead
and just walk I mean just go ahead and
watch it as it goes three two one now
when we go ahead and remove that and
continue to hold the home button so it
says 15 seconds but soon as the little
message disappears we will know that
it's done so there we go okay so at this
point once you have successfully entered
DFU mode on your device and the way to
tell is it will say just jailbreak
everything else will disappear on the
green poison screen then you are going
to be good to go so at this point you're
basically all you need to do is just set
your device aside and click jailbreak so
now we'll go ahead and take just a
moment so as you see here there will be
some loading bars and I'll go ahead and
just show you your screen will turn
white but it will only take just a
minute and your device will be
jailbroken
so guys I'll go ahead and give this a
minute's go ahead and cycle through and
I'll be right back as soon as it's done
okay so just finished up so simply go
ahead and open it up we will see a new
application on our home screen which is
called loaders well and just press on it
this should be really pretty simple so
all it's gonna be is do you want to
install city or not and of course that's
the whole point so I'm going press it
hit install Cydia okay so after just a
minute we went ahead and respring to our
device and now we have Cydia on our
device so there you'll guys it's as
simple as that now all you need to do is
go into Cydia start downloading all your
great jailbreaking applications and in
fact if you don't know what to do watch
and have an annotation on the screen
with some of my favorite personal
favorite and jailbreak applications so
kind of help you get started so guys I
hope you found this helpful and if you
did feel free to subscribe I'm
constantly making videos about
jailbreaking showing you know all the
new firmware the devices all that to
keep you up to date about jailbreaking
