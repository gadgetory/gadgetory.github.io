discussing the benefits as well as the
downfalls of the three major smartphone
platforms today of course we do have the
iPhone as iOS we have Android with the
many many many Android phones you see
and pretty much anywhere you look and
the upcoming Windows Phone 7 so
basically I'm going to go ahead and talk
a little bit about it I do get quite a
few questions like what's why should I
do this what's the benefit of this
etcetera etcetera so I'd only do is I'm
going to try to break it down for you
guys explaining the benefits as well as
the strengths the weaknesses all the
kind of stuff of each platform so to
begin with let's just go ahead and start
with the iPhone which is probably what
most of you guys are more familiar with
so basically the iPhone is a single
unlike the other two is a single
platform so it's not like you can go
ahead and find iOS on you know maybe I
can Motorola device whatever
Apple has only got on the iPhone itself
and of course Apple since that is Apple
of course the iPhone is a really really
solid piece of hardware in fact the
iPhone 4 is probably one of the
best-looking smartphones available right
now so
with iOS you get a very very polished
interface everything is really nice and
smooth they're really nice transitions
and it really solid OS to work with you
know it doesn't get really laggy or
anything like that whereas sometimes you
know other OSS do so that's one really
major strength of the iOS platform on
the iPhone is that it just works and
that's something that you know that's
what you're looking for in a phone it
does have quite a few other good
features obviously the app store which
has over 200,000 apps I mean literally
there are so many apps in the App Store
it's not even funny it does have
multitasking now in the newer iPhones
multitasking it's a little bit different
from the standard know Android
multitasking where you know everything
just stays open it's a little bit of
different it's Apple's own take on
multitasking and I found that it works
pretty well it's not perfect but it
actually does I think the trade off and
a little bit better battery life for
just a little bit less successful
multitasking I guess kind of is worth it
so some of the other features in iOS
include that it does of course have you
know like I said the full app store you
have a pretty nice interface all the
menus like I said it's a really polished
interface one downfall or there are a
few downfalls about the
i OS on the iPhone one is that of course
it is only on one phone so unlike with
Android and Windows Phone 7 if you want
it you're on going to be stuck with just
one phone so you're not going to be able
to do if you want a keyboard and there's
nothing you can do you know if you want
maybe I could find a 4G again nothing
you can do so you are really locked into
just the iPhone 4 now of course if you
like iPhone 4 and it is available on a
carrier that you like and whatever
country you live in
that's right will not be a problem and
that's thing about the iPhone is that
well Apple is really really closed so
I'm sure a lot of you guys will have
heard of jailbreaking which is basically
the base when you plug your iPhone in
and of course this does count for iPod
Touches and iPads and you allow it to
you know run different programs other
than that Apple allows so you can tweak
the look of it you can you know do all
kinds of different things that allow you
to just get the most out of it Apple
does not allow by themselves so third
upsides and downsides to the iPhone but
in general it is a really solid platform
and probably it's just you know taking
the whole package in by itself is one of
the best available now let's go ahead
and move on to Android now Android is
actually an open source OS which
basically means that it is free for
anyone to use modify it do everything
you want with it's actually made by
Google so basically Android is a really
really open platform so like I was just
talking about the iPhone iOS with Apple
is very closed you really the only way
you can gets things or just through the
App Store whereas Android is much more
open but generally it's not that big a
deal so you know you can go ahead inside
load applications so you you can get
them through the App Store for Android
which is called the app marketplace but
you can go ahead and get it through
there but you can also go ahead and you
know download apps through other methods
you're not just locked into just the one
way in addition there are a lot of
customizations
available for Android so now you can go
ahead and put it up change anything you
want whereas you know on the iPhone -
jailbreak usually on Android you can go
ahead and just download applications or
do whatever you want and it's a lot
easier
in addition Android is a really really
fast growing OS so what this means is
that well actually does have its
benefits and its downsides
on the one hand it gets a lot of new
features very very
quickly I mean just in the past year i
meanit's jumped up a bunch of scattered
so many new features it's been really
really just you know just taking off
like crazy on the downside however is
that because there are so many different
phones and all these upgrades you know
with all these really cool and new
features sometimes can take a while so
just take for example the light is 2.2
update on so it is out on a couple
phones but honestly it is taken out
quite a while and some phones might not
even get just because it takes so long
to trickle down so even though there are
a lot of really cool new features that
are coming out just because you buy an
Android phone does not necessarily mean
that you will be able to actually take
advantage of those features um so one of
the biggest strengths of Android is
absolutely the amount of hardware that
it comes on because unlike the iPhone
you can get it and pretty much any sort
of size shape for them pretty much
anything I'm sort of everything from
really small phones like the Sony Xperia
x10 mini which is I believe has only
about a two point six inch touchscreen
all the way up to you know the Droid X
which has a massive 4.3 inch screen a
one gigahertz processor really really
powerful and high-end so you can get
physical keyboards you can get pretty
much anything you can imagine
Android is part of and in addition it
also is on pretty much any carrier
anything so if you're looking for an
Android device you will not be
disappointed as far as you know
different hardware options or whatever
so pretty much any kind of style that
you like is definitely going to be
representative by Android some of the
downfalls hood is that the OS is not as
generally as quite as polished or quite
as quick as iOS on the iPhone so what
this means is that well I don't mean
that you know it's gonna be like clunky
you know look like you know it's five
years old or something but just just in
general the iPhone tends to look a
little bit nicer on there it seems to be
a better a better unifying style just
across everything which of course it is
to to the fact the Apple does keep
everything locked down also Android
devices tend to be a little bit slower
than on the iPhone especially when you
consider that a lot of Android phones
have custom skins now what custom skins
mean basically you know they you know if
you buy like for example a Droid X it
will be standard Android but you know
they'll add just a couple little
features maybe like you know a little
bit here a little bit bear which can
sometimes slow down the phone so in
general again on
love Android it's a fantastic platform
and really if you're looking for an
Android device like I said this huge
huge strength of Android is that you can
get anything you want to couple that
with it being totally open it's
definitely a great way to go so the next
platform we're going to take a look at
is Windows Phone 7 so this is
Microsoft's entry into the whole phone
space and it really really does look
impressive so one thing about Windows
Phone 7 however is that it is actually
not out yet so it likely will be coming
out in the next two months to two or
three months with a lot of new hardware
but we don't actually have an exact date
however we absolutely do you know what's
coming and we have seen a lot about it
so let me go ahead and explain a little
bit about to you so one really
interesting thing about Windows Phone 7
is the interface it's nothing like
you've ever seen on anything actually
the closest thing is if you've ever seen
a Zune HD it has a really you know
graphically really just an interesting
looking interface it looks kind of you
know like something you'd see on you
know I act in the future movie or
something it's a really really cool
interface where you know a lot of the
text is you actually pushed out of the
screen where you know it's just gives it
a really nice stylistic look an addition
also is going to be supported of course
by Microsoft who is doing a big big job
they're putting all kinds of money into
making sure that is a really solid
platform and all the phones are going to
be have to be have very very high specs
so you're not like unlike on Android
where a lot of phones can actually be
kind of slow and kind of little you know
not all that fast and everything you can
go ahead and go with Windows Phone 7
every single Windows Phone 7 device is
going to have to have very very bad
specs so all these Windows Phone 7
devices and anymore all these devices
are going to be very very fast so to
send up there's a lot to like with the
Windows Phone 7 and there are a few
problems that you know might remember
may not be an issue to you
so among the really good things is that
of course it's going to have that really
nice UI now I will say that I have never
personally used it obviously it's not
quite out yet but from everything I've
seen it looks really intuitive and it
looks really really unique which is
something you really can't say about you
know iOS and Android they both look
fairly similar you know they carry a lot
of the same things in addition there's
also going to be really deep integration
with Xbox Live so you can go ahead and
with different
games on the Windows seven platform
Windows Phone 7 platform rather you
actually go ahead and get gamerscore or
you can actually go ahead some games
will even be able to hook up to the Xbox
360 so you actually can go ahead and you
know have like mini games on your phone
that can't come over to the Xbox there's
gonna be a lot of really interesting
integration as far as that goes in
addition it's going to also have a
pretty wide variety of hardware
available so there should be different
phones you know in different form
factors with keyboards keyboards etc etc
and it should be available on at least a
few carriers it launched and it should
be spreading out just like Android so no
matter what carrier you're on you're on
and what countries and all that kind of
stuff
you should be able to get a Windows
Phone 7 device that will suit your needs
some of the cons include there are a few
things missing in with is from 7
compared to the other two platforms so
this includes third-party native
multitasking so just like the iPhone it
will not be able to multitask your
third-party applications I mean will not
have cut and cut copy and paste at the
beginning although they have said they
will be working on that probably will be
included in a update before too long and
in addition also will not have html5 or
flash support in the browser so there
are some problems with Windows Phone 7
it's not gonna just be perfect right out
of the box but I do expect that they
will go ahead and add pretty much all
these features you know here within a
few months a year or so so I don't think
that you know you really have to worry
about too much it's got all the basics
down and the few things that it is
missing should be coming pretty soon ok
so to sum up basically all three
platforms to of course have their
strengths and weaknesses you know the
iPhone is really solid in most
categories you know it's a really mature
OS you know they've had a quite a few
years to go ahead and add all these
little features that people have been
asking for
so I OS as far as your feature
standpoint is pretty much just I mean
not perfect but it's really really solid
and among the best OS is so if you
decide that you're really interested in
iPhone don't worry about it I mean
although the other two platforms do have
good stuff the iPhone you will not be
disappointed with now as far as Android
goes it is really a great OS and the
fact that you can get it in pretty much
any sort of hardware you want it's even
coming in tablets it's really really
impressive to me so I think that if
you're looking for iPhone again with
Android you will not be that this
well if whatever reason maybe the iPhone
is not on your carrier or you're just
really not liking apples you know it's
style you don't like how Apple works
then Android is absolutely a great
choice you know of course like I said
there's so many different varieties of
hardware that you can get it on it's a
really solid OS in general so if you're
again if you're interested in Android
then that's absolutely a great way to go
because really there are just so many
different choices it's really open you
can customize it so much the angel is
really hard to go wrong with now Windows
Phone 7 is a bit more of a question mark
now the other two o West's have been out
for quite a while we've you know had a
lot of hands-on time I've been able to
use them both very extensively Windows
Phone 7 however is not out and like I
said it won't be out for the next at
least two or three months so I really
don't know what to say about it
I'm just looking at it on paper it looks
like this otherwise I won't rehash it
everything that I've said already but I
think it has a lot of potential however
until to actually see Hardware we
actually see some actual phones running
it I'm a little leery to go ahead and
recommend it I think that if you're
buying a phone right now and if you
don't would and I might be waiting a
couple months I'm to take a look at what
Windows Phone 7 looks like absolutely I
would suggest it you know go ahead and
get a hands on the store see if it's
something that you like on until then
however you might want to go ahead and
just you're not interested Android or
iOS both are really solid platforms and
if you're interested go ahead you can go
for I visit anyway guys I really hope
that answered all your questions about
the different platforms I'd like I said
I think all they all have strides they
all have weaknesses but in general you
know you really have to kind of try them
out and see what works best for your
needs anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
