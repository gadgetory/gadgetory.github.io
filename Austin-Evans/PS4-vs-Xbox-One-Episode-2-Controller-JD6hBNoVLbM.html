without a good controller it doesn't
mean much both the Xbox one and ps4 have
made a lot of changes to their
controller since the last generation
unlike the DualShock 3 which is mostly
unchanged from the original PlayStation
the ps4 gamepad is a huge step forward
it's wider and more comfortable with a
subtle pattern on the grips which is
nice especially for extended gaming
sessions the thumb sticks are now
concave to give your fingers a nice
place to rest and they've got a grippy
rubber coating this feels good while
gaming but there have been issues people
like my friend Lou from unbox therapy
have had the rubber wear out and peel
with plenty of others having the same
problem this seems to mostly be an issue
with launch ps4 I haven't had a problem
with my controllers so unless you log
some serious hours it shouldn't be an
issue the Xbox one controller might not
be such a huge change but it's seen some
improvements as well the grip feels a
bit bigger and more comfortable in my
hands but the 360 controller didn't
leave a lot of room for improvement the
thumb sticks have been updated with a
nice textured grip which feels tighter
than the smooth finish on the older
controller after a year and a half of
use my left thumb stick has started to
get a bit loose but other than that it's
held up fairly well the triggers on the
ps4 are nicely shaped with decent travel
and I definitely prefer the shoulder
buttons to us on the Xbox one but the
Xbox triggers are larger and have a
nicer feel the big advantage though are
the impulse triggers in addition to
having Rumble motors in the controller
Microsoft to fit an extra motor and each
trigger to give you feedback in game
it's especially noticeable in racing
games like Forza where you can feel the
triggers vibrate as you start to lose
traction but it's also useful in other
games like shooters to give you more
detailed feedback than just shaking your
entire controller you get used to it
quickly it's a really nice feature that
I've come to appreciate on the ps4
you'll find the traditional X square
triangle and circle buttons on the right
side along with the solid d-pad which is
about as good as it gets for a console
controller where you used to have start
and select buttons you'll now find share
and options options is basically the
pause button and share allows you to
grab a quick screenshot or video clip
along with streaming your game square in
the middle of the controller is the
touchpad similar to what you'll find on
the back of the Vita this is used in
games to pull up a quick option but some
titles like tearaway unfolded do a much
better job of taking advantage of the
sensitivity there is also a speaker in
the controller to listen to ingame audio
logs for things like a radio speaking of
audio every ps4 controller has a built
in 3.5 millimeter headphone jack to be
able to gain quietly with headphones
there is a port you can use with a
Playstation headset but having the
option of using your own headphones is a
big plus the Xbox one has needed a
proprietary headset for a while however
they've recently released an updated
controller that includes a headphone
jack but bigger news though is the elite
controller this brings replaceable
thumbsticks which can easily be swapped
and interchangeable d-pad with a cool
faceted design and for programmable
paddles for easier access to things like
your face buttons it also has a
hair-trigger bump stop for shorter
actuation and a dedicated switch to move
between setups
it's a legitimately cool controller but
with a hefty $150 price tag it's not all
that practical all three versions of the
Xbox one controller come with double A
batteries considering the ps3 shipped
with rechargeable batteries nearly ten
years ago this really isn't cool having
to pay an extra 15 dollars for the play
and charge kit is a big pain on the
other hand it is usable as a wired
controller on both the Xbox one and PC
which is really useful the DualShock 4
is bigger more comfortable and adds a
lot of features that range from decent
to downright useful the Xbox one
controller takes one of the best game
pads of all time and improves it but at
the end of the day the PlayStation 4
just barely takes this one of course
there's more to it than just controllers
so stay tuned this comparison is far
