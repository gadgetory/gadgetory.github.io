of d3 live so today we're going to be
talking about the best tablets available
right now so a lot of you guys are
probably a little bit confused about the
other to hear these tablets so there's
this is that your manufacturers that for
know Wes there's all kinds of really
confusing things so what I need to do
today explain a little bit about you
know the best tablets the pros and cons
all that kind of stuff so the first one
is pretty much what we've got to start
with is the ipad 2 and the ipad 2 of
course the original ipad is arguably
what really kicked off all these tablets
you know nobody really ever use tablets
or anything Apple came up with iPad also
never buy you know it's just scrambling
to get their own version now the ipad 2
i'm just gonna say the straight front is
the best tablet across the board right
now you know there are several really
good tablets that are out right now but
most of them don't measure up and as far
as the future tablets go we'll have to
see about that but as far as if you're
just you know a really simple user you
don't want to have the crazy stuff you
just want a nice tablet that works gets
on the internet tricks your email
watches movies all that kind of stuff
the ipad 2 is going to be the way to go
very thin now has two cameras admittedly
they're both really pretty bad but it
does have cameras and that's better than
not having anything at all and it's
really nice and thin and it just works
that's why i really like the ipad 2 and
i really do recommend it if you're you
know a very basic user you don't really
need to be doing crazy stuff you just
want to have something simple young here
and all that kind of stuff with however
there are other alternatives and some of
them actually are better than the ipad
depending on who you are so the first
one won't start out with is the motorola
xoom this is the latest Google tablet in
fact it's the first official google
tablet that runs the android operating
system love you guys might have heard of
android it's what runs a lot of phones
such as the droid and a wide wide
variety of phones and it has now been
expanded and tweaked to work on a tablet
now the official operating system is
called android 3.0 honeycomb and it does
work really well it's got a lot of
really cool features i'm yours a lot of
potential there however one of the major
things that kind of hurts the zoom and
indeed a lots of other tablets will be
running the same software that there is
not a whole lot of apps the ipad 2 has
hundreds of thousands of apps available
whether it's for the iphone which it
does run
order for the iPad itself however with
with the zoom and of course like I said
the rest of the Android tablets it can
still run other Android apps for the
phones but as far as tablet specific
apps there are very very few so that's
one of the major things another is the
price zooms a little bit more expensive
and finally what really hurts it my
opinion for a lot of people is the fact
that it's not fully baked I know that's
going to hands down a little bit weird
but as far as just the usability the
overall polish and everything the zoo is
definitely down quite a bit from the
ipad so those are the two major tablets
that are on sale right now however there
are if you're interested maybe waiting
and has a couple of months or indeed a
couple of weeks I'm there are going to
be many many more tablets lots of
different choices available someone goes
through these a little bit quicker
obviously they're not out yet but the
first one is the blackberry playbook now
I've had a hands out of this earlier
this year and we've been hearing a lot
about it and this is BlackBerry's tablet
and it's got a lot of really cool things
going for it so it's got of course of
seven inch display which is a little bit
smaller than the ipad in the zoom
however that does give you some
Vantage's as far as it being easier to
put you know carrying around all that
kind of stuff it's got a really cool
operating system really nice smooth and
responsive I'm definitely looking
forward to taking a look at the playbook
which comes out in a little over two
weeks so that's definitely want to keep
your eye on another a couple of others
HP is actually getting into the tablet
market with the HP touch head this is
again going to be a very unique device
it's going to be about the same size as
an iPad but the software is really solid
runs webos which you guys might have
heard of that is on a few phones and it
also has been expanded out to work on a
tablet this is going to be coming a
little bit later in the summer but again
definitely want to keep an eye on it
it's got a lot of really cool things
going for it hey guys that's it for this
