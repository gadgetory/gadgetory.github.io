New York City for the launch of the new
Samsung Galaxy Note 8 my first thought
with a note 8 is that it actually does
feel a little bit different to the
galaxy s 8 and s 8 + so when you look at
up front it looks very very similar yes
it does have a 6.3 inch display instead
of 6.2 on the s8 + but in hand it
actually has a little bit more of an
edge before it was very much sort of
like a tapered thing all the way from
the screen to the back but now there's
actually something to grab on to the
note 8 still has the infinity display so
this means that it has super small
bezels on top and bottom it does have a
curved display on the edges and it also
does have the sort of wraparound edge on
both the left and right side all this
jargon means it actually does feel
really nice in the hand the Galaxy Note
8 is still going to be water resistant
which is nice and taken as a whole the
hardware does feel very similar to the
galaxy s 8 and especially the s 8 plus
it's not going to be a huge jump what
you're really getting here is the S Pen
especially that new dual camera setup
this guy is rocking a pair of 12
megapixel cameras that are very similar
to the iPhone 7 plus so there's one
wide-angle lens as well as one telephoto
it's a 2x crop and there's a lot of cool
things that you can't do it Meli do we
have the wide-angle lens but you can
also jump into the telephoto and if we
had live focus essentially what we
should be able to do so we actually just
took three photos so now I did use the
wide-angle shot but we also do have the
telephoto and we have a version with
background blur so it's interesting
about the no days you can actually
adjust this so you basically turn all
the way off or go maximum blur looking
at it closely it looks decent but he's a
little bit soft now I think that's
actually an issue I've found a lot with
the iPhone 7 plus with the portrait mode
and this is a sort of similar setup but
in theory they actually have done a
better job of implementing it by
actually allowing you to take multiple
photos over this while it did a good job
of sort of isolating him from the
background it looks very similar to what
you get on the iPhone now beyond that
it's a fairly similar setup like I said
they're both 12 megapixels and to my eye
it looks pretty similar to the photos
you're getting on the galaxy s 8 but
thankfully there is no camera bump
what's not great about that is that it
also means the fingerprint sensor is
still going to be around back so it is
still very very easy to accidentally
touch your camera when you really mean
to unlock the phone so Jimmy what are
your thoughts on the Galaxy Note 8 dude
it fits in my hand that's crazy
it's fine like I like iPhone but the
screen is really nice and it's fast
I think I'm gonna take over the video
again the new date is rocking a 6.3 inch
Super AMOLED display now I think
honestly this is probably one of the
best smartphone displays around but
Simpson has kind of been on top of the
game for a couple years now here I gotta
admit when the galaxy assay came out I
felt like that was the best Hardware on
any phone and the note is super similar
so it still does have nano USBC but also
a headphone jack which is nice to see
but of course being a note it does have
the s-pen this bin has gained a few new
features like you can use it to
translate text as well as of course you
can use it to doodle and sketch and that
kind of stuff now I know a lot of people
do really like the s-pen but personally
I don't find a ton of use for a stylus
on a phone and that actually brings us
to one of the downsides of the note 8 it
has a fairly small 3300 milliamp hour
battery now for comparison the galaxy
has a plus with a slightly smaller
screen has a thirty-five hundred million
power battery the note 7 was a big part
of the presentation today so in case
you've been living under a rock the
Galaxy Note 7 was kind of a big deal and
by big deal I mean it kept exploding and
yeah did not go well so of course the
battery is smaller here I think they're
being a little more conservative and I
think that is a good thing but also
means that with such a giant display and
pretty powerful specs I'm curious to see
what the actual battery life is going to
be inside the note 8 is rocking a
Snapdragon 835 processor as well as an X
notes option in some international
markets it has six gigabytes of RAM 64
gigs of storage as well as a micro SD
card slot this is very similar to what
you're getting on the Galaxy s8 the
biggest difference is you do have that
two extra gigs of RAM but to be totally
honest it's going to be a very similar
experience the note 8 also has a bixby
button because you know that was a huge
hit on the s8 it launches bixby which
still exists it's slightly better now
moving on what is a little bit cooler is
Dex so this is Samsung's solution to be
able to turn your phone into somewhat of
a desktop so if you get the Dex doc you
can hook up a monitor mouse keyboard
kind of like some of the Windows Phone
stuff that taking a look at recently now
this says she worked pretty well on the
galaxy s 8 and they've done even more
improvements with more apps and more
features on the no-date it's still not
quite there for me as essentially you're
just running windowed Android apps but I
feel like as this gets better and better
it's going to become more and more of a
reason to pick up a Samsung device which
brings me to my next point the rest of
the software it's exactly the same as
the galaxy s 8 kind of a trend with this
video I think so it's not bad it's not
like TouchWiz back in the day but it is
nowhere near stock Android and because
of that this guy is shipping with
Android 7.1 nougat as a post Oreo which
of course is not quite out yet but still
expect a little bit of a delay on
getting updates with this just like
every other Samsung phone one cool thing
Samsung did with the note 8 software is
a pair so this is kind of like spaces on
your desktop you can have a pair of apps
set to automatically open together and
it will have the correct sort of
multitasking setup and that is kind of
cool
for example you can have YouTube
launched with say Twitter or whatever
you want to do and you can have that
kind of custom it's not a huge feature
but I guess it's something with the
no-date Samsung they've taken what is
arguably one of the best designed phones
out on the market right now and added
the s-pen as well as the dual camera
setup now if you're looking for a large
screen smartphone honestly kind of a
no-brainer over the si plus I feel like
the dual cameras alone are going to make
it worth it but what do you guys think
about the Galaxy Note 8 let me know in
the comments below and I will catch you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
