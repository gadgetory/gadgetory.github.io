like a weird comparison but there are a
lot of reasons why you might want to
consider picking up an Xbox 360 or ps3
and 2017 it might seem obvious to pick
up a ps4 Xbox one but only are they both
way more expensive than these guys but
they also like true backwards
compatibility so the Xbox one comes
closest as it does support some Xbox 360
titles but the issue is not is it not
the full library but you still have to
actually download the game even if you
do have the 360 disc you have a slow
internet connection that can take a
while the ps4 is even worse now
technically you can't play some ps3
games using PlayStation now not only do
you have to buy that and pay for every
month but it's also streaming is really
not the same as playing it on the native
console these are the final additions of
the consoles one of the nice things
about having such a long life cycle with
it there are not only three editions of
both the ps3 as well as the 360 there
are also years and years of great games
and they're actually both still
supported with a lot of their online
services this is the Xbox 360 II it came
out in 2013 and well is a pretty minor
improvement over the slend mostly we
just a little bit smaller and drop the
USB port but it is still the full 360
package the PlayStation 3 super slim on
other hand is a noticeably cheaper
version of the original ps3 now to be
fair it is quite a bit smaller and it
was a bit cheaper but the issue was and
says having a slot loading blu-ray drive
instead it has cheap feeling door it
just doesn't feel like quality or sound
like quality while by today's standards
the hardware isn't amazing it's easy to
forget that these consoles really were
the first ways a lot of people
experienced HD gaming if you've never
tried the ps3 or xbox 360 you're missing
out on a ton of amazing game the nice
thing is these are incredibly cheap
today so you're going to pick up a used
40 you like that ps3 it's only going to
cost you about $60 sure it's going to be
big and a little bit loud however when
you consider that these super slim with
a 12 gauge drive is about $100 60 bucks
looks like a great deal the 360 is also
pretty reasonable so you can pick up a 4
gigabyte 360 for about $80 or what's a
much better idea is to pick up something
like this 250 gig version which is only
going to cost you about 100 and is way
more usable what's easy to forget is
that you can pick up an entire stack of
games for these consoles for really
cheap so games like rise of the Tomb
Raider are about $20 make up a Red Dead
or
for 15 Forza horizon for 10 and real
classics like modern warfare 1 for 7 in
Halo 4 for $5 there is crazy crazy value
in getting a last gen console the real
question here is what is it like to use
an xbox 360 and ps3 and 2017 first off
we have the Xbox 360 this interface is a
lot better than it used to be so you can
go through all the different apps and
music and games and whatnot but more
importantly it is much much faster than
the stupid blade interfaces launched
with back in 2005 there actually been a
lot of major revisions to the Xbox 360
where it's that now is actually pretty
decent one nice thing about the 360 is
it still supports most of the major
video apps so there are a couple missing
but for the most part you have all the
basics like Netflix and YouTube
there's Hulu Amazon twitch look at the
crispy HD video for mr. Jimmy champagne
who may or may not be editing this video
right now and it's probably putting an
obnoxiously large call out to this
channel on the screen right now so here
we have Gears of War 3
and this is a game that well yes it
looks a little bit dated compared to
modern standards is really impressive
considering that this is running on a
console that came out in 2005 I look at
the light effects here this looks really
good for an Xbox 360 game next we have
the original Forza horizon this is
another games I feel like runs way
better than it should considering the
hardware yes it doesn't match up to
Forza horizon 3 running on the Xbox one
or PC but it's still a lot of fun I feel
like these are some of the best
open-world racing games ever to be fair
a lot of these games including Forza
horizon is actually going to be
backwards compatible on the Xbox one
they look fairly similar but there's
definitely something nice about playing
these games on the original hardware
next we have rise of the Tomb Raider
this is one of the last major triple-a
games that came out for the Xbox 360 and
it holds up surprisingly well seriously
it doesn't look quite as good as
something like falling down a mountain
for QuickTime events but it actually
holds up reasonably well compared to
something like a PC or ps4 next we have
the ps3 one of my favorite parts of this
console was always the XMB not only is
it super fast you can fly through a
middle E a lot of different menus one of
the cool things is it's all natively
1080p so a lot of the Xbox 360 stuff is
actually 720 that's upscale as far as
games on the ps3 first we have Gran
Turismo 6 it's weird to think that this
is the most recent Gran Turismo however
it looks decent
it might not be quite as nice looking as
Forza but it's hard to argue with the
physics and just how nice this game
feels to drive make sure we have the
last of us not only is this one of the
best games for the ps3 but it is one of
my favorite games ever it really does go
to show what they were able to pull out
the ps3 I know we keep saying this that
oh look the graphics look better than
you would expect this is really one of
those cases where you can really see it
they pulled every little bit of power
out of the ps3 a big reason for this was
the cel processor now it made the ps3
very powerful but it also made it really
difficult to actually take advantage of
that power because it was so different
which is why some games don't look so
grand ps3 but exclusive like this can
actually look really impressive thanks
for the power of the Internet both the
ps3 and 360 are surprisingly usable
today if you missed out on the full
decade worth of amazing games to these
consoles it's pretty cheap to pick it up
you should give it a try so what do you
guys think about these consoles in 2017

will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
