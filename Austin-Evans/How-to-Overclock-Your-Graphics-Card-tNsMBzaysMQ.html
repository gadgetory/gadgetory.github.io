here at the tutorial showing you how to
overclock your graphics card who wants
to run it stock anyway overclocking
while it can be a little intimidating is
actually very straightforward when you
buy a graphics card you have a few
sliders to play with that allows you to
get the most out of your card I'll be
doing this tutorial using a couple high
end graphics cards that are designed for
overclocking the msi r9 290x lightning
and the EVGA gtx 780 with ACX cooler
however you can overclock most any
desktop GPU some graphics cards do
overclock better than others as when you
start to overclock you're putting more
strain on things like the power delivery
as well as the cooler however even
entry-level cards have at least some
overclocking Headroom you also need to
keep in mind that the rest of your
system also needs to be able to handle
overclocking make sure there's good
airflow in your case to keep things nice
and cool and that you have a decent
power supply with enough overhead to
handle giving your GPU some more juice
one thing to definitely keep in mind is
that overclocking while very easy to do
is officially supported by the
manufacturers if you crank everything
all the way up in your card breaks don't
expect to get a new one from the
warranty that said things are pretty
safe assuming you don't go completely
crazy it's no coincidence that a lot of
the graphics card companies actually
create a lot of the overclocking
software my favorite utility is MSI
Afterburner which supports both AMD and
NVIDIA graphics cards even if they
aren't made by MSI inside you'll find
all the sliders you need to overclock
your card as well as taking a look at
things such as fan speed and temperature
to overclock our r9 290x we need to pay
attention to three of these sliders the
power limit the core clock and the
memory clock changing the power limit
will allow the GPU to pull in more power
which is usually a necessity depending
on how far you want to push the
overclock the core clock is the most
important thing is the higher this is
generally the better performance and
lastly is the memory clock which also
plays a big role in getting the most out
of your card once you're ready to begin
it's best to start slowly bump up your
power and core clock slightly and then
give it a try while testing in actual
games is always important while we're
working out settings combustor is a
great tool that comes with afterburner
load up the GPU burn in 10
and let it run for 5 to 10 minutes
definitely keep an eye on your
temperature to make sure it's not
exceeding the max of your card as well
as watch the test itself closely if you
see artifacts like this randomly showing
up in the image you're pushing the
overclock too high so it's a good idea
to pull back a bit and try again once
you're looking at the stable core clock
it's time to move on to the memory it's
pretty much the same process just slowly
bump it up until you start running into
artifacts or crashing now once you have
both of them roughly where you want them
definitely tweak a little bit more is
sometimes even though a core clock might
be stable on its own once you start
cranking up the memory it might kind of
mess with things and vice versa so
definitely be sure to test both of them
together to make sure that everything is
nice and solid
since the 290x lightning is already
overclocked nicely out of the box
I settled on 1,100 and 40 megahertz on
the core 1500 megahertz on the memory
with a plus 25 bump to the power limit
with the GTX 780 set to 106 percent on
the power limit I got an extra 90
megahertz on the core and 300 megahertz
more on the memory taking a look at the
results in 3dmark fire destroyed both
cards see a nice little gain with the
290x pulling in an extra 6 percent and
the gtx 780 seeing nearly 8 percent more
performance in BioShock Infinite the
290x gets an impressive 10 percent
improvement where the overclocked 780
gets a 9% boost jump to Metro last night
and here again the 298 lightning
improved with an overclock by just under
10% and the 780 pulls in just under 8%
if you're willing to spend a little time
overclocking can get you as basically
free performance there are some risks
but as long as you don't go crazy it can
really pay off so what do you guys think
is overclocking worth it let me know in
the comments below also in case you guys
missed it I recently reviewed the HTC
One m8 Google Play edition probably one
of my favorite phones I've ever tried so
if you guys wanna check out that video
it will be linked in the description of
this video anyway guys thank you so much
for watching and I will catch you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
