Nintendo console wars in the previous
installment we went over the design of
each of those four latest Nintendo
consoles the Super Nintendo in
Nintendo's 60 for the GameCube and the
week in that video I went over all
features of the design but in this video
we will be going over the controllers of
each of these consoles to see which one
did well which ones didn't so stay tuned
as we delve in to the second round of
the Nintendo console
okay so let's begin with the controller
for the Super Nintendo which is pretty
much the simplest the controller
Nintendo ever made by a long shot so
let's go and take a look you see here
it's really quite small thin but a major
problem was it was not very hard if you
hold it you're meant to hold it and your
palms like that now you have your two
L&amp;amp;R buttons up here your d-pad you have
your a B X and why you should like to
start now this was designed at a
different time you know back when you
know the early nineties really when the
Super Nintendo was came out and
everything you know people weren't
playing you know you know Halo or
anything like that
basically it was a lot of you know like
Mario side-scrollers and for that it's
really quite fine you know you just you
know use this use this you know ucation
might do that you know it's not like
there's a lot of intricate controls or
anything like that you of course will be
needed for today's games so if you look
just like that you know this control did
a really good job you know a lot of
people kind of dogged on it because it
was looked like a dog bone so I called
it but you know it was a really simple
controller you know it was very it was
very smooth it was very you know pretty
user-friendly as long as you know you
walk your hands in there like that and
for the games it was actually a really
solid controller so yeah guys Super
Nintendo controller was really solid not
amazing but it was pretty good so the
next controller is obviously from the
mint
now this controller to be honest was
probably the clumsiest looking
controller I've ever seen
you have your two handles here along
with the third right here you have your
joystick d-pad punch buttons over here
start and you flip it over Ln R and then
put it over another but not here ball is
an expansion slot but that wasn't
usually used so just by looking at it
it's a lot of stuff to look at probably
the most buttons you've seen since you
know like maybe the Xbox 360 but
surprisingly it actually worked and it
works in a couple different ways so
generally you know you played it like
this and you know you use like this or
you know maybe you sometimes you held it
like this or whatever the problem was
that it was hard and you couldn't use
these buttons this and this at the same
time you had to hold it like this hold
it like this or stop it hold it like
this because it's just thumb couldn't
quite reach over there and that was a
problem you really couldn't uh
there weren't a whole lot of shoe games
and that kind of stuff in 10 to 64 at
least they weren't really prevalent so
you know it wasn't a big deal usually
you know all your buttons were here or
here or something
but it kind of got weird but on the
other hand there was actually some
pretty interesting ways to hold this for
some games you hold it like this put
your thumb right here and then you have
your button right here so you can
actually you know like like for a flying
game that we switch hands you know
you're so you're flying you're shooting
you know you're pressing these buttons
everything and for that it actually
worked really well and that was a pretty
clever design unfortunately though it
was a large control or I mean you can
see the size of my hands
you know it's a very very large
controller and especially I mean I've
got pretty decent-sized hands and you
know obviously I can't really play it
very well like holding like that you
know just really stretch stretch your
hands so it was kind of a little
difficult to play with some games but
still it was a pretty unique controller
I know I can't say that I'm not that sad
that it's gone now but it's a pretty
unique controller and it did work fairly
well
so the third controller is obviously
going to be from the Nintendo GameCube
now I'll say off the bat this was
probably one of the least light
controllers ever as you can see why it
has a very narrow shape so no you hit
basically like a boomerang shape you
know you have these you know for a lot
of games it didn't work too well it was
kind of cramped your hands cuz you know
put them up there you could reach it
unlike on the in Nintendo 64 you could
reach everything pretty well but you
know your hands can sometimes get you
know a little cramped or something
because you're squeezing it pretty tight
because it's very very narrow right
there that said though I actually did
not mind it one bit I thought it was
really solid controller as good as the
original put the PlayStation 2
controller but I still did not mind this
at all I'm so let's go ahead and run you
guys to the buttons you have a main
joystick here he had a secondary
joystick here but yeah I was like doing
that you have your d-pad here which
actually was not that great I will admit
sometimes you could hit like this button
and something else would pull and you
know obviously in games hit the wrong
button that can mess you up a lot you
have your be a lie and eggs which I
actually kind of like the arrangement of
that but it's it's a little dirty
you start pause your Z and your l and r
buttons which were nice short buttons
and then nothing on the back except the
and like that it was a very oddly shaped
controller as you guys can see it was uh
it was kind of weird definitely like
when the first came out and they were
showing it off people were like what
that's terrible and a lot of people
still think that but you know I've
played it for a long time I've played
three or four years and you know I never
really had any problems with it I mean I
don't know if it was just me or not but
I thought it's a bullets all controller
I mean shoulder buttons were great you
can really use it well none of buttons
luck exception of the d-pad sometimes
and I thought eyes are pretty cool
controller that says though and you know
you just look see I'll narrow those are
you see how oddly shaped it is I can
definitely see where a lot of people
have problems with it that said though I
would definitely take this older than
the Tendo 64 controller any day I
thought it was pretty solid okay guys so
the fourth and final controller has got
to be for the Nintendo Wii now this is
probably one of the most unique
controllers have never been made and I
really think is a huge huge part of why
the Wii is so successful today and it of
course is the Wii Remote or the remote
is a lot of people call so we just
unplug this right here dementia this is
the Wii mote itself and as you see here
it's totally wireless and with motion
controls I'm sure everybody knows you
know the motion controls the bowling and
everything like that and you know that's
a huge part of the ways of people so if
we want go ahead and look at it it can
it connects to the Wii via bluetooth I
believe so if you know you turn on and
it will wirelessly connect so has a lot
of special features now you have a pad
up here you have a button
well well plus and minus they worked for
different things I also had a speaker so
some games you know you click something
on screen and it will actually you will
hear from the Wiimote which was pretty
cool I gotta say you have your one or
two buttons on the back we didn't have a
whole lot of anything we have or you
could hook up a lanyard but you know
nobody
wrist strap nobody really like that and
then you can hook it up to you know a
secondary control or a motion plus a lot
of different things could connect to the
bottom you have your B button lets you
know just hold like that and then if you
look at the front you have a little
sensor which shoots to the Wii sensor
bar which allows you to you know point
and I click it stuff as well as that so
it's pretty cool
so if we look like here plug this in
real quick if we look right here you
will see that this is the main secondary
thing which is the nunchuck very simple
obviously it connects here and very very
simple you have just a couple just have
basically two buttons and a joystick and
you know together you know you could you
know this also had motion control so you
know you could punch and do different
things shake into whatever anyway it was
pretty cool they also have a couple
other things such as a classic
controller which looks very very similar
to the NES I mean that Super Nintendo
controller I do not have one of those so
I can't show you guys this but when you
bought a wii these this is what come in
the box and so everybody pretty much
should have that at least so the Wii
controller pretty solid I gotta admit
I'm not a huge fan of all the motion
controller thing
and full of gimmicky but there's no
doubt that it's been a huge sale
successfully so and you know it's lots
of fun to use so it's kind of hard to
say no to that so guys it should be no
surprise to you that the Wii has an
absolutely fantastic controller that
just brings packs just so much
innovation in with the sensors with the
Bluetooth with the speaker with the
motion controls I mean it really has the
whole package especially as you can hook
up secondary controllers such as the
nunchuck or the plastic bowl which
really just give it a huge huge appeal
and it's probably the number one reason
why the Wii is as good as it is now each
of them had their pros and cons but I
got to go with the way on this one
really just a revolutionary controller
anyway guys be sure to subscribe to the
channel as I will be continuing the
Nintendo console wars with part three
coming soon anyway guys thanks for
