seen a lot of tech under videos so all
the tech I'm going to take a look at
five items in total cost less than $30
the twist is I have no idea if any of it
is remotely good this is the ZTE Maven -
how much is this $30 exactly okay all
right this guy is rocking Android
marshmallow 6.0 point one which is only
like two years old so not that that
habit gets a gigs of storage a 5 inch
touchscreen which actually looks like a
pretty decent size for 30 bucks you know
it always surprises me how much you can
get for so cheap especially when it
comes to smartphones so last year I
spent a little while with a $20 mark
phone and while it probably was not as
good at this it was kind of usable
it's definitely plasticy although to be
fair doesn't have the battery yet so it
might help a little bit the first thing
that jumps out to me is that the screen
actually is pretty decent
so yes it's definitely lower resolution
but it gets pretty bright and that same
thing goes with a build quality
it's not perfect it definitely is very
plasticky but it feels reasonably
certain ok yeah that's a lot of
bloatware get shot
savage Kenny oh wait no you know we got
switch over to fun mode oh I totally
worked
so I actually take the picture when you
smiled that's looks kind of cool all
right I'll give that okay there's
nothing fiction to me okay all right so
we're recording this is the 720p video
can your looking not as savage as usual
I'm done so is the Maven to worth the 30
bucks yeah my saw a $30 smartphone I had
pretty low expectations
well you consider that this is one
twentieth the price of a flagship and it
does basically everything maybe it's not
quite as fast or not quite as sexy but
at the end of the day it's hard to argue
with a smart phone at this price all
right so that is she wasn't bad what do
we have for item number two
the Roku Express so for reference this
is about five dollars cheaper than a
chromecast so we have the Express itself
which kind of like an IR receiver we
also have a USB wall adapter some
batteries and what you don't get with a
chromecast is an actual remote this is
actually a lot of stuff for $30 I will
say that navigating through the
interface actually is reasonably snappy
it's a little bit of a different thing
than a chromecast because that really
does rely on you casting things from
like a phone or a computer or something
whereas this is more meant to be used
with the remote and as a proper
streaming box this totally works so
there's really not that much exciting
about the Roku Express for 30 bucks you
are getting a pretty solid standalone
experience homeboy the mini wired
controller for Xbox one and Windows to
be there I have not used a third-party
controller for a console since like the
PlayStation 2 days but this just looks
really cheap oh boy that's some shiny
plastic oh it's a wire you can killer
okay I guess that makes sense
pointing the mini controller side by
side with the full-sized one it actually
isn't a huge difference in size it's a
little bit smaller but what really jumps
out to me is that this doesn't feel that
bad so the glossy plastic definitely
looks super cheap but having the
textured finish on the back actually
feels pretty nice more importantly it
feels like you solid controller so it's
really no flex in it they just a little
bit if I really torque it adds a lot a
lot of way the controller so feels
pretty good it definitely is a little
different from the normal Xbox one
controller and for $20 less I don't know
if the difference is really going to be
worth it
maybe if you're just playing on PC you
don't care about a wireless option it's
fine you even do have the impulse
triggers and you love the death that's
more important you have the death the
Corsair Qatar fps and mobile gaming
mouse and has a $30 actually did a good
job of getting everything exactly on
point so we have four programmable
buttons and we also have on the slide
dpi tuning that sounds exciting
for $30 Oh actually isn't too bad that's
going to be pretty solid for a gaming
mouse
she feels pretty good so the entire
thing is coated in a sort of soft touch
rubber oh yeah that actually feels
pretty good it's a little bit on the
smaller side though what really jumps
out to me is that this feels a lot
better than most sort of cheap low-end
mites the tracking is nice and
responsive and I think it might be a
little bit on the smaller side for some
people but more importantly it feels
really nice so far I actually think
we've been doing pretty good but it's
time to see what the final item is mr.
Pulido Cinderella girl ha ha very funny
lightning earpods oh cool something I
actually wanted to these sony MDR VX 110
a powerful high quality sound how much
were these fourteen alright fourteen
bucks it is it's been a while since I've
tried cheap headphones even those were
usually earbuds so Oh the folding
mechanism actually doesn't feel that bad
hmm
I mean they're definitely cheap and
plastic what for fourteen box you really
should expect anything too crazy plot
our super cool ZTE maven find out the
greatest headphone amp but I'm curious
what a bag of Doritos what why does it
smell so bad okay what are these a USB
cable and some really terrible
headphones lately while you're crunching
on the bolt is smack in the universe
plug your headphones straight into the
front of the bag play and rock out two
songs from Marvel Studios guardians of
the galaxy soundtrack there's a
headphone jack on the bag okay hold on
hold on so I just plug it in and just do
it what did you get this bag
oh the Ken and Jimmy special huh yeah
all right that's actually cool um so the
headphones sound good when you plug them
into a bag of Doritos something I never
thought I would say hey okay that looks
you got a cool let me try it with some
real music
so are these going to match really
expensive headphones absolutely not
especially if you're coming from
something like a headphone that's
included with your phone you sound a lot
nicer there's a little bit of lack of
clarity especially when you get toward
the base your side of things but for $14
this actually might be my favorite thing
year as always I'll have links to all
this stuff in the description of this
video with the possible exception of the
Doritos bag which I don't think cost $30
anymore but let me know in the comments
which one of these pieces of tech would
you guys pick up for 30 bucks let me
know in the comments below and I will
catch you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
