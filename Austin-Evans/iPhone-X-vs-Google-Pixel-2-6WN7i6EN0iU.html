launch of the iPhone 10 which could be
the most hyped phone of the year well
unless you count this of course I
recently did a video on the pixel 2 and
I came away with it thinking that it is
one of my favorite phones I've ever
tried but how does it stack up to the
iPhone 10 so if we pop this guy open we
see designed by Apple in California who
cares about that what I care about is
the iPhone 10 Wow it actually it's a
little bit thicker than I thought it's
probably about the same as something
like the 8 but interesting the black
looks really nice so that along with the
metal band that's sort of this dark
chrome this is a good looking phone but
before we get too far into it let's see
what else we gets surprise surprise
inside the box is the standard power
adapter even though you know the cyclone
supports not only wireless charging but
also fast charging but you know this
works we also get a pair of lightning
ear pods as well as the Lightning two
three and a half millimeter adapter same
as pretty much all the iPhone 7s eights
that kind of thing and there is a
lightning to USB cable so with the
iPhone 10 powered up the first thing I
notice is the knotch
now to be fair the bezels around the
rest of the phone are really tiny
probably smaller than pretty much
anything besides maybe something I think
Alex yes 8 but the knotch
it's noticeable although I don't think
it's gonna be that big of a deal just
using it for three seconds of almost
forgot it's there put the iPhone
side-by-side with a pixel two and the
pixel 2 XL you'll see it's actually
fairly similar to the size of the
standard pixel now that is even
including the fact that this has a five
point eight inch display which is nearly
as big as the six inch display on the XL
- all this being said I actually prefer
these standard size of the pixel - for
reasons that I'll get into in a minute
but it is hard to argue with just how
nice of a piece of hardware the iPhone
10 is my only slight issue with the
hardware is the camera homp it's a lot
larger than I would expect maybe for the
pixel XL - does have a little bit of a
camera hump but compared to the iPhone
10 which just kind of rattles around
it's a lot bigger on the other hand the
iPhone 10 does support wireless charging
or the aluminum back pixel - does not
both phones are ip67 rated which means
that in theory they should survive under
one meter of water for 30 minutes
however if you watched my iPhone 7 plus
video last year it died in about 7
seconds of being in a bowl of water so
here goes nothing all right
iPhone 10 is in now let's get the pixel
in okay well water's going over the
table what the screens are on I'm going
to leave them in for one minute because
I don't want to break my phone's hey I'm
just being honest right so coming
everywhere it looks like both phones are
fine ah sweet I don't have to spend a
bunch of money inside the iPhone 10 is
the Apple a 11 Bionic chip which has
three high power cores and three low
power cores three gigabytes of RAM and
either 64 or 256 gigs of storage on the
other hand the pixel 2 has the
Snapdragon 835 which takes for
high-power cores and for low power cores
puts them together with 4 gigs of RAM
and either 64 or 128 gigabytes of
storage when you take a look at the
performance in Geekbench though it is
not even close the iPhone 10 is hands
down the fastest phone out there on the
graphics side with GFX bench well it's a
little bit closer it's still really hard
to argue with the iPhone 10 which is
really impressive considering that the
iPhone has two fewer cores at this point
not only is it faster than pretty much
any other phone out there but it's
starting to approach a lot of high end
laptops of course benchmarks are one
thing and real world use is another so
the pixel 2 is hands down the fastest
Android phone I've ever tried even
though yes on paper it might not be
quite as fast as the iPhone and actual
practical use it's really hard to see a
difference some of the iPhone 10 drops
but the pixel 2 still has a fingerprint
sensor I've got to say this one is great
always a place on the back of the phone
which is really simple to get at but
it's also incredibly quick so to set a
face ID on the iPhone it should be
pretty simple all I need to do is look
all the way around and it should scan my
face so raise the phone and swipe up and
it's unlocked
that's actually pretty quick I'm curious
though how well face ID works when it's
laying flat on something like a table if
i unlock it here swipe up oh it got it I
still have my reservations about how
good face idea is going to be in the
long run but at first glance it actually
does seem to be pretty well implemented
well it's not the most practical thing
I've got to say that an emoji on the
iPhone 10 are kind of fine so if I hit
record here hey guys this is lost
are an emoji worth it now you do need to
learn some new gestures on the iPhone 10
so instead of having a home button
instead you swipe from the bottom to
leave an app and then you swipe up into
the right to pull up your multitasking
from here you can go between your
different apps or you can use the little
thing on the bottom to actually scroll
between which app is open it does say a
little bit of getting used to but it's
actually not bad in comparison the pixel
2 feels downright normal so there are
some cool features such as they're
always on display which I like to be
able to see stuff like time date
notifications at a glance the pixel also
has Google assistant which I like a lot
more than Siri so that activate you
should need to squeeze the frame of the
phone the main feature of the iPhone
tendo is absolutely the display it's
rocking a 5.8 inch 24 36 by 1124 AMOLED
display now not only is this the first
time that Apple's gone with OLED but as
you can see the bezels are absolutely
tiny what this means is that you're
basically getting an iPhone 8 sized
chassis but with a much much larger
screen I've got to say it works it's
right up there with the galaxy s 8 no
date as far as some of the best screens
out there so it's nice it's saturated
it's pretty sharp well there is just a
little bit of color shifting when you
look at it off angle it is nowhere near
as bad as the pixels the standard pixel
2 has a pretty decent 1080p 5 inch OLED
display and while it's something
spectacular it totally gets the job done
when you switch to the pixel 2 X
although that's where you take a hard
turn into garbage town you look at it
dead-on the colors are ok but stuff like
Reds look awfully Brown when you look at
it off angle it looks very blue and
there been a lot of reports of issues
with screen burnin now Google will be
releasing an update which will
supposedly help some of this stuff but
when you compare it to the iPhone 10 it
is no competition at the very least
audio is an area where neither of these
phones have major issues they both have
stereo speakers you know what I think
they both sound good but actually do
have to give the lead to the pixel it's
a little bit louder and a little bit
clearer of course that's not a big deal
when you plug in a pair of headphones as
both of these have headphone jack oh oh
right it's 2017 neither of them have a
headphone jack cameras is where both of
these phones really excel so the pixel 2
has a 12 megapixel camera and the iPhone
10 has a pair of them one wide angle one
telephoto well it might only have a
single camera some of the energy
I've gotten from the pixel to really are
incredible the auto HDR does a great job
of bringing a ton of dynamic range into
a shot and it does a really good job of
being very very sharp it's also
optically stabilized just like the
iPhone and the low-light performance is
not bad either
there's really not a lot to complain
about with the pixel when it comes to
the iPhone 10 you're also getting solid
dynamic range and because it is the same
camera from the 8 as well as the 8 plus
you're also getting nice saturation I
love the image just look a little bit
punchier than on the pixel both cameras
also have a portrait mode so let's start
with the iPhone 10 that's not bad
so the advantages of this phone is that
both of the cameras are optically
stabilized which actually does make a
pretty big difference for portrait mode
compared to the 8 plus on the other hand
the pixel to sport mode is purely based
on software so if you look closely
you'll see that it's not quite perfect
so some of the edges are a little bit
soft and it doesn't fully blur the
background in this shot but a lot of
times I actually prefer the results from
the pixel too which is really impressive
considering that it doesn't have that
second camera where it really shines is
with selfie portrait mode yeah look at
that that's great
so now it doesn't do a really good job
with the hair but the background is very
naturally blurred and we take a look at
it on the iPhone 10 yeah that's just not
as good so you can see that my hair is a
little bit blurry it didn't really
perfectly cut my shirt out of the
background either video is also solid so
this is what the 4k 24 looks like from
the iPhone 10 and especially you look at
stuff like stabilization in color it's
nice if you switch over to the pixel it
is also pretty solid one of my big
problems with this mode the auto just
very good both the iPhone 10 and pixel 2
are incredibly expensive phones so the
pixel 2 pairs one of the best cameras on
a smartphone we saw an audio and a
really impressive build of Android the
iPhone has my favorite Hardware of any
phone ever and the screen is right up
there with the best like the Galaxy s8
and the node 8 which is where the pixel
falls apart when it comes to spending
$850 on a smart phone a bad screen is a
straight-up deal-breaker for me which
leaves the standard pixel 2 and when you
consider that it is $350 cheaper than
the iPhone 10 I'm willing to put up with
the less impressive screen and the giant
bezels it really is a crazy crazy good
phone if you have the budget you're not
going to be disappointed with the iPhone
10 but for a lot of people the standard
pixel 2 actually makes a lot of sense so
which one would you guys go for let me
know in the comments below and I will
catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
