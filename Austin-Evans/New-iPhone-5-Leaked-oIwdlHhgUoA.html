with a video going over the new iPhone
so it's just a video on this the other
day however this morning a lot of new
stuff about the new iPhone has been
leaked including pretty much exactly
what's going to look like as well as
several of the major specs including the
screen so let's take a look to start
with let's go over the design of the new
iPhone so around back you'll see that
looks fairly similar to the iPhone 4 and
4s but with a couple of major
differences for starters there is now a
large aluminum band around the back so
of course was the four of the 4s it was
all glass and while this looked nice it
was definitely very easy to break and it
wasn't quite the best as far as
fingerprints and smudges and all that
kind of stuff so with the new iPhone
looks like they're actually going to
replace most of that with some kind of
aluminum you can still see there is
going to be a little bit of glass on the
top around the camera as well as on the
very bottom now I will say in this
picture looks a little bit odd
I think the black looks really sell it
but the white looks a little bit weird
I'm not going to go ahead and judge it
just on one picture and on one angle
taking a closer look you can see the
camera in the flash look very similar to
before however what's new is what looks
to be a microphone which most likely be
used for rear-facing video recording
moving over to the side looks like
Apple's kept the same design from the 4
in the 4s with a metal band running
around the phone you can see that there
is a little notch for the antenna as
well as a spot for the mute switch as
well as the volume buttons it's hard to
tell from this angle but a little
slightly black eye foam may actually
have a black antenna whereas the white
keeps the same metallic finish coming
around to the back of the phone there
are also some major changes here so the
most notable of which is that there is
definitely no 30-pin connector on the
new iPhone instead there looks to be a
much smaller connector perhaps microUSB
or some kind of new Apple proprietary
port you can also see that the headphone
jack has been moved down to the bottom
so just like on the iPod touch
instead plugging your headphones in on
the top of the phone it will be on the
bottom you can also see the grilles for
the speaker and microphone now these
look a little bit odd I definitely will
say so whether this is exactly what we
wanted to see when the new iPhone comes
out or perhaps this is just some kind of
early development model we'll have to
wait and see carry on to the front of
the phone you can tell the screen is
much larger everything we've heard
points to the new iPhone having a 4-inch
display and this seems to fit that
perfectly the width seems to be the same
over the screen and the phone itself
seemed to be a bit taller
you can also see a couple of other
differences here so for example the
FaceTime camera looks to be relocated to
above the speaker as opposed to off to
the side where it wasn't quite
on top of that you can very clearly see
there is going to be a home button on
the new iPhone now we've heard lots of
rumors that there's going to be a home
button list iPhone or iPad however I
don't think this is going to be going
anywhere anytime soon so this is not a
complete leak we don't have the exact
specs or the exact release date or
anything like that however I do believe
this is a very good look at what the new
iPhone is going to look like when it
goes on sale so what do you guys think
Dan Apple go far enough did they get a
really great redesign with the larger
display the new banking all that kind of
stuff or is it to conserve did they not
change enough from the 4 the 4s
definitely let me know in the comments
below if you enjoyed this video tell me
be sure to leave it a thumbs up and if
you're interested in keeping up with the
latest on the new iPhone definitely be
sure to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
