Are you ready for
a $4000 gaming Mac Pro? With the Vortex it’s
clear that MSI had a pretty clear benchmark
in mind while designing. Put it next to the
Mac Pro and you’ll see it’s a very similar
concept, you’re getting a small chassis
that’s built around packing some serious
power. Where the Mac Pro is rocking a single
aluminum shell the Vortex looks a bit more
like a gaming PC with an LED that runs up
and over the case. The idea is the same on
both, you’ll find a powerful CPU along with
two graphics cards that are built around a
central heatsink. There’s a fan that pulls
in air from the bottom and exhausts it up
top, it’s actually a fairly interesting
take on the traditional PC tower. The Mac
Pro makes it simple to open it up but there’s
really not much you can upgrade beyond the
memory. As similar as they are in theory though
they’re aimed at very different audiences,
the Mac Pro has options for up to 12 core
CPUs and more professional oriented features
like ECC memory where the Vortex trades that
in for more consumer grade hardware that’s
better suited for gaming. Even though it uses
a lot of custom parts to make a form factor
like this work inside you’ll still find
a Core i7-6700K, 16 or 32 gigabytes of DDR4
memory and either a pair of GTX 960s or GTX
980s. However there’s a pretty massive price
difference depending on which spec you go
for. If you opt for the 960 model the Vortex
will run $2200 where the 980 model is nearly
twice as expensive at $4000. Considering the
only other difference is the jump from 16
to 32 gigs of memory this is a hard pill to
swallow especially when you consider just
how cool the rest of the hardware is. On both
you’re getting 256 gigs of PCIe storage
in RAID which delivers ridiculous read and
write speeds in addition to a normal one terabyte
hard drive for storage. You’ve also got
a huge selection of ports too with four USB
3.0, two HDMI, a pair of Ethernet along with
two USB-C based Thunderbolt 3 ports and two
Mini DisplayPorts. Even though it’s a bit
larger than the Mac Pro it’s still absolutely
tiny when you consider the kind of hardware
you’re getting inside, it should fit in
easily on nearly any desk. You can also adjust
the LED lighting to make it fit in with your
setup or just turn it off altogether if you
like. When you boot it up you’ll find a
bit of bloat including a Norton subscription
but it’s fairly minimal, you’ll even get
a year of XSplit included and everything else
is easy enough to clean up fairly quickly.
I did run into an odd USB bug with my Samsung
T1 drive that I keep my Steam library on,
it alternated between freezing up the Vortex
and just not being recognized until I used
a USB-C adapter where things worked perfectly.
You do get MSI Afterburner preinstalled if
you’d like to give overclocking the GPUs
a try along with the Dragon Center software
for the CPU but considering the form factor
and 450 watt power supply there’s not a
ton of headroom left. MSI has aimed this at
being a solid VR ready gaming PC and with
a pair of GTX 980s this really shouldn’t
be a problem but is it really worth the extra
upgrade cost? It depends on what you want
to do. With graphics horsepower like this
maxing games at 1440p is no problem and even
4K gaming is totally doable. The Vortex also
works well for VR, you’ve got enough ports
to run basically any headset out there and
with the minimum spec being a GTX 970 a pair
of 980s gives you plenty of headroom. It is
a bit behind the dual GTX 980 powered Electron
build I made a while back but considering
the form factor that shouldn’t be a huge
surprise. At $4000 though you really are paying
for the form factor, as cool as it is you
could build a system with similar performance
for a lot less. The GTX 960 model is actually
a bit more interesting to me, at $2200 it’s
fairly reasonable for all but the most demanding
gaming and you’re still getting the same small
case and beefy specs. There’s no denying
the Vortex is a unique gaming PC that would
be difficult to build yourself but you’re
definitely paying for it. So what do you guys
think about the Vortex? Let me know in the
comments below and I will catch you in the
next one!</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
