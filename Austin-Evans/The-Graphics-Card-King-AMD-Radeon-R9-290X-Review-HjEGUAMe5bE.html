here with a review of the brand new AMD
radeon r9 290x so the question is has it
stack up taking a look around the card
you'll see this has the same nice
looking design as other reference 200
series cards for display outs you'll
find a pair of dual link DVI HDMI and
DisplayPort and for power it needs an 8
&amp;amp; a 6 pin PCI II connector unlike the
rest of the new AMD r7 + r9 cards this
is a brand new GPU codenamed Hawaii
which is really made to go head-to-head
with the NVIDIA GTX 780 spec wise it
features two thousand eight hundred and
sixteen stream processors a clock speed
of up to one gigahertz and four
gigabytes of RAM with a 512 bit memory
bus that 4 gigabytes of memory might
sound like overkill but the 290x is
designed to game at up to 4k resolutions
at AMD's GPU 14 event I was able to play
around on a system with a pair of 290
X's and crossfire on three 4k monitors
playing dirt3 and it was really
impressive
unfortunately I don't quite have a pile
of money to go spend on a 4k monitor for
testing
however the 290x definitely is designed
for some really crazy setups so with a
new card comes a new way to control your
fan and overclocking the BIOS switch on
the card goes between quiet and uber
mode which capture max fan speed at
either 40% or 55% quiet mode hits a good
balance between performance and noise
where uber mode is a lot louder but
works well especially if you're
overclocking
to overclock instead of dialing in a
specific speed you instead bump up the
max speed that's available to the card
and it will run as close to that as
possible I was able to push the 290x in
uber mode to 1095 megahertz on the core
and 1310 megahertz on the memory which
is just under 10% and 5% respectively
with a better cooler and cranking the
fan higher I'm sure I could have gotten
more on the flip side you can also use
these same controls to make the graphics
card run cooler and quieter you can now
set a max temperature which is 95
degrees Celsius that default something
AMD says is totally safe for the card
and you can also adjust the maximum fan
speed manually what this means is that
you can customize the 290x for you
so if you don't mind giving up a little
bit of performance you can let the card
run much cooler and quieter on the flip
side if you don't mind about noise and
give it a little bit more power you can
also get more performance out of it
crossfire has also been revamped on the
290 X as you no longer have any external
connectors instead everything is done
through the motherboard which could also
improve crossfire performance in theory
however unfortunately I only have a
single 290 X so I'll have to test this
later trueaudio is also including the
card which should help improve audio
performance however this is more of a
future-proof thing than something that
you can actually really use right now so
let's jump right on in and take a look
at the benchmarks
so the Radeon r9 290x is an absolute
beast especially considering the $550
price tag
even on quiet mode it outperforms the
GTX 780 and it does it for $100 less
it's really this simple if you're
looking for a high-end graphics card the
290x nails it of course
Nvidia is going to be striking back soon
with the new 780 Ti so what do you guys
think are you going for a 290x are you
gonna hold off for a little while longer
definitely be sure to let me know what
you think in the comments below anyway
guys thank you so much for watching if
you enjoyed definitely be sure to
subscribe to the channel so you're
always kept up to date with the latest
and greatest anyway guys I will catch
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
