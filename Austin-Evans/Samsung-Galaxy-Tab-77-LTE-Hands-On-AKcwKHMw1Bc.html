here with I hands-on of the Samsung
Galaxy Tab 7.7 LTE and this is an
awesome little tablet of course as the
name implies that's had a seven point
seven inch display but also is a very
very thin so you guys can see that
probably one of the thinner tablets
don't quote me on that but it seems very
very thin in the hand some of the
features on this includes it does have a
1280 by 800 display and it is super
amoled plus and that's so sure how well
the cameras picking this up but it looks
really great even under this bright
light some of the other specs it does
have a 1.4 GHz dual-core processor and
this one I believe has 16 gigabytes of
storage on board although I'm not sure
if that's going to stay the same way
when these do you start shipping so glad
just give you guys a little tour back
here of course it does have the verizon
4g LTE branding and it does of course
have 4G LTE installed so go ahead and
just give you guys little sneak peek
around the tablet here one of the cool
things is if I can find it is it does
have an IR blaster so you guys can see
that little black bit right there so it
actually will be able to use it as a
generic remote control there's also a
nap we called peel on board here she can
go ahead and pull up so if I can just
find it here for you guys there you go
so if I had a TV here I can demo it for
you but you can just simply you know
pull up and you know go through all your
different channels and all that kind of
stuff straight from your Galaxy Tab 7.7
somebody guys no word on a release date
or price on this one it is running
honeycomb right now but it will be
upgrading most likely to ice cream
sandwich in the near future anyway guys
going to be about it for my hands on of
the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 LTE</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
