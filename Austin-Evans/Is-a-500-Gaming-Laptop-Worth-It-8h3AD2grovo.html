laptop actually any good so this is the
Acer Aspire II 15 so crack open the box
and inside will find the laptop itself
unboxing actually looks really
straightforward it's literally just the
power adapter so this is a 15 inch
laptop which is actually not crazy
when you consider that it actually has
some pretty reasonable specs it doesn't
feel super premium it looks interesting
even though it's definitely plastic it
doesn't feel super premium or anything I
think it looks nice and especially when
you open it up and you realise that it's
got a nice little contrast with the
white so looking on the laptop it's a
little old-school and we get like a VGA
port here but I think the funnier thing
is there's a spot for an optical drive
which this is not come with however that
actually can be a cool thing because
that might mean that we could say put an
extra hard drive in or probably in this
case put an SSD inside what really makes
the aspire a 15 special though or the
specs it's rocking a core i5 6200 u
alongside an Nvidia GT 940m graphics
card the rest of the hardware is pretty
solid as well you've got a 15.6 inch
1080p display which while still a fairly
cheap panel with ok contrast and viewing
angles it's a step up over what you'll
usually find at this price point the
speakers get reasonably loud but they
sound teddy you'll probably want to
invest in speakers or headphones for
gaming you're getting solid AC Wi-Fi
with Bluetooth 4.0 though which is
awesome there's just no excuse for low
end Wi-Fi these days the rest of the
chassis is shared with a ton of other
Acer models with different specs
reaching back to the 300 dollar range
the keyboard is a bit on the mushy side
but it's totally usable same goes for
the trackpad it's a decent size and
sports gestures but the tracking feels a
bit less accurate than I'd like the
webcam is completely average at 720p and
wants a little soft it's totally fine
for something like a video chat while it
comes with Windows 10 you'll find
bloatware the second you turn it on
there's just tons of pre-installed
software like Norton it's definitely
worth spending a few minutes when you
get the laptop to clean everything up
one unsurprising cost-cutting measure is
the one terabyte hard drive well it's a
decent amount of space it is seriously
slow if you want to upgrade though it's
not too difficult there are quite a few
screws around back but with a little
careful prying it's easy enough to get
into you've got access to the second M
slot if you'd like to upgrade to 16 gigs
of ram and you can also see the fairly
small battery along with the heat pipe
that leads to the surprisingly quiet
single fan the
both the CPU and GPU from here you can
swap out the hard drive or even get an
adapter for the optical Bay and put a
drive there while a skylight base Core
i5 is definitely appreciated it's a dual
core 15 watt part which is typically
found and thin and light ultrabooks it's
paired with the GT 940m which nvidia is
pretty vague about beyond the four
gigabytes of ddr3 memory but in game
this ends up being a good combo lighter
titles like Minecraft are totally
playable at 1080p which should be no
surprise as is dota 2 which has no
problem playing on Macs at 1080p at
around 30 fps you're getting solid
performance in csgo to bump the settings
down to medium at 1080 you're getting a
pretty smooth 50 to 60 frames where
rocket League also works when you play
on quality settings for more demanding
games like GTA 5 you'll need to notch
the resolution down to 900 P on normal
but it's still totally playable with
only a single fan though I was curious
about thermals even under sustained load
there really isn't any throttling in
temps top out around 70 degrees Celsius
the keyboard does get a bit warm
especially near the exhaust but for what
started life as a budget laptop it
handles the heat well one thing that
doesn't hold up quite so well though is
the battery under a full gaming load
with max screen brightness it only
lasted about 53 minutes which is pretty
disappointing that small battery doesn't
help in normal use either you're
probably going to want to stay close to
an outlet the Aspire a 15 might not be
able to touch data k caming desktop but
at this price having dedicated graphics
is a big deal upgrade it with an SSD and
you've got a surprisingly solid gaming
laptop so what do you guys think about
the aspire let me know in the comments
