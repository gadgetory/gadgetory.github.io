phone and the razor phone to 2018 is
shaping up to be an awesome year for
gaming smartphones so with both of them
on the desk at the same time why I think
a good old-fashioned comparison is in
order first up we have the razor phone -
now a couple we scope we were able to
get our hands on this but it was a very
brief sort of hands-on where's this this
is going to be a little more of an
in-depth feature comparison review
gaming benchmark
are there other words I can put in the
title you see how shiny this glasses
it'll never be the shiny again saying I
put my dirty fingerprints on it not only
do we have a fast charger included in
the box something that a certain fruit
themed company might want to take note
on but we also have a series of cables
and dongles but what's actually kind of
interesting about the razor phone is
that we have a USBC headphone adapter
now this might not sound impressive in
fact it's included on most phones that
don't have a headphone jack which is
basically everything at this point but
this actually does support full hi-fi
audio and supposedly has a pretty good
DAC inside next up we have the ROG foam
and I actually don't know how to open
this box oh wow okay that's all right
that's a box all right first up we have
the phone itself so the ROG phones kind
of unique in that Nally does it have it
USB C and a headphone jack on the bottom
but as to more us pcs on the side which
are meant for accessories so the last
time I tried the ROG phone it was still
a fairly early prototype and I've got to
say immediately this feels really nice
so we do have that actually it's that
aluminum it's got to be aluminum it's
incredibly heavy
Wow it really feels nice it's got such a
heft in the hand and unlike the Razer
foam which is basically a giant squared
off brick this is much more rounded a
little bit more of a hand friendly shape
something unique about the ROG phone is
that unlike basically every other gaming
phone out there there's a wide range of
accessories that are either including
the box such as this fan or other things
will be available for purchase you know
I feel like right now I feel like ROG is
trying to make the ultimate ROG phone
right like when we do building the
ultimate we try to find the ridiculous
and crazy accessories but they're just
selling all of the accessories like you
could literally get everything you need
to build the ultimate ROG phone straight
from the store
malee does it have the RGB but it also
has a fan USB C headphone jack all that
stuff which is rearranged to the bottom
this is cool I really push
they put this in the box I don't get to
into the dock right now but the idea is
that when you're using the phone and
landscape mode your hand is naturally
covering up now in the headphone jack
but also the USBC so in addition to be
able to get a little bit of cooling you
also have those ports on the bottom of
the phone so you can easily plug it in
plug your headphones in and you won't
get in the way of your hands wait a
black shark wait are you trying to add
another phone to the comparison in the
middle of the video your gamer
let's shark oh boy this this looks
exciting what's the deal with this oh oh
this is not the original black shark at
all okay this is an unprecedented move
in that there's a brand new one really
smart phone on my desk and I literally
don't know anything about it except that
it looks kind of cool that's something
to know about it right so it's kind of
got a combination of aluminum on the
sides but it still does have that glass
back panel and I'm assuming that looks
kind of like an RGB logo oh wow that's
uh that's quite the gamer skin and oh
yeah we do have a RGB logo on the back
like how we had this great comparison
look it's the ROG foam was the raisin
phone it all makes sense and now I'm
like wait a minute there's this totally
new phone that I have no idea about I
have to figure it out on the fly this is
cool though I guess they've definitely
up to the RGB game I mean that's a
that's a look right there so it looks
like you can individually change not
only the logo color but also the the
little shark mode thing on the side by
pressing the shark button your full will
become a game console what a game
console and a smartphone that's crazy so
after spending some time with the black
shark a few things come to mind first of
all probably the most important for the
video is that this is not a final phone
it's certainly not final software
there's definitely some tweaks they're
going to need to go on before this is
released and also a lot of the
benchmarks and stuff don't even work yet
so we're gonna take some of this with a
grain of salt there's also the
controller which actually doesn't attach
to the phone it attaches to the case
that comes with the phone so it's maybe
not the most elegant way of doing it but
it's sort of like what you would expect
with a joy pond the only problem is that
the controller only works wirelessly so
even though you can slide it on
something like
it actually doesn't attached with any
kind of wires or whatever so you still
need to separately charge now like the
controller but the phone itself the big
problem is that this is a Chinese market
phone which means that here in the
United States well it doesn't have the
Google Play Store or any kind of Google
apps at all now there will be a global
version of this phone and hopefully that
will include you know the fundamental
apps that you would expect like YouTube
but for now it's kind of hard to get
apps on this unless of course you want
to play a little bit of a fortnight by
chance all three phones have the very
familiar snapdragon 845 inside so the
ROG is slightly clocked higher but the
main difference between the three is
that the black shark has an optional 10
gigabyte of RAM option whereas the
others only top out it a measly eight
gigs of memory coincidentally they all
have the exact same size four thousand
milliamp hour battery which is a good
thing for gaming but from here the
differences start to stand out just a
little bit more the first big difference
is with displays so the black shark has
a perfectly respectable 6 inch 2160 by
1080p panel it's good but nothing
spectacular especially when you compare
it to both the ROG phone as well as the
razor phone move over to the ROG phone
and well it does have that same size as
well as resolution of the black shark it
is an OLED panel ranked at a full 90
Hertz as far as I know this is the first
time that any phone is hit 90 Hertz with
an OLED panel the razor phone has a
slightly smaller 5.7 inch display but it
is a much higher resolution at 2560 by
1440 and importantly it runs at a
whopping 120 hurt refresh rate hurts not
hurt it doesn't hurt to refresh it hurts
to refresh your real downside is that
this is a very wide phone specifically
gonna put it side-by-side with the black
shark um the ROG it's just not quite as
comfortable to hold
but that screen is really well optimized
for video so let's talk about these
screens for a second
the ROG phone has a very accurate OLED
panel and even though it's not the most
well calibrated thing in the world
it looks nice to the eye the razor phone
thankfully is much much brighter than
the original version of the razor phone
again it's not quite a hundred percent
there but is a lot better than the
previous generation and the black shark
looks nice but again it's not quite
final so it's hard to run any kind of
real tests it looks good but I really
feel like the winner here is the ROG
just purely based on the looks one of
these phones really shine is with the
higher refresh rate so it's really hard
to show him video
but even the 90 Hertz of the ROG phone
really does make a big difference and
small things like scrolling through a
webpage you're moving between menus it
really does seem a lot more fluid and
that definitely does apply to the razor
phone now to my I actually can't really
see a major difference between 90 and
120 Hertz theoretically this is a little
bit smoother and I will say it looks
maybe a little bit sharper when you're
moving between things but realistically
both these phones are big step up over
the black shark or well every other 60
Hertz phone out there basically all
three have dual front firing speakers
but there's a clear winner as far as
which one sounds best with everything
from a desktop all-in-one with the
surface studio all the way down to the
cheap and tiny surface go there's a lot
to like
I guess thorough G foam wins by default
here that's not what I was expecting so
the problem with the razor phone is at
least with my specific unit even though
it is very loud and very clear there's
definite little bit of distortion on the
very high volume something the ROG phone
definitely does right are the extra
features and accessories that come along
with it
well the main ones is the squeeze
features so this is somewhat similar to
what you'll find on the pixel but if I
squeeze it what happens is it turns into
ROG gaming X mood the thing with X mode
is you actually can customize it to do
whatever you want but I just like going
X mode not X mode smooth it's just kind
of fun to do but it's not only just for
show so if you flip the ROG phone over
on the top are the air triggers this
essentially adds physical controls to
the top of the phone giving it a little
bit more of a controller kind of feel so
the way it works is that each of them
can be mapped to a specific button on
the screens the way it works is that
inside the X mode software you can
adjust the actual touch point of where
you want it so for example my right
trigger is the actual trigger in the
game and my left is to go on to the
sights you can do it however you want
but the thing is this is a really really
nice addition to give you a little bit
more of a physical control on a phone
without having to carry around like you
know a controller or accessories one
downside to the ROG phone is that this
is one of the hottest devices that I've
ever tested now it doesn't get
uncomfortably warm but after a few
minutes of gaming it does get a little
bit toasty which is where the included
fan comes in so what do you do is slap
this on to the USBC ports on the bottom
of the phone
as soon as you clamp it on not only will
the RGB logo light up it'll start a
pretty easy little fan which will cool
the back of the phone now in testing
this doesn't make a massive difference
to performance what it does do is cool
off the back of the phone to make it a
lot nicer for when you're you know doing
extended fortnight gaming sessions and
not sweating your fingers up keeps put
your fingers up is that a is that I
can't say that kinda adds weird so
what's the best gaming phone of 2018
well I really like a lot of what Razer
is done with the Razer phone - I've got
to give it to the ROG phone Natalie
doesn't have great performance
it looks nice it's got a lot of really
cool features but really what kind of
sells this to me over everything else is
this the first gaming phone that's not
like good at gaming but it's also good
at being a phone and that that kind of
means a lot
