us our first look at Windows 8 for
tablets as expected it draws a lot of
inspiration from the Metro UI on Windows
Phone 7 in Windows 8 there are two modes
one for standard windows and the other
for tablets in classic mode windows 8
runs in a desktop very similar to
standard Windows where it gets
interesting is with the tablet mode
which runs like Windows Phone 7 on a
large display these apps will be run in
full screen and be written in JavaScript
and html5 making it simple to get apps
up and running Internet Explorer 10 is
the first step to work in this mode and
there are already several widgets that
allow you to check various things such
as Twitter weather and much more taking
a closer look at you'll find the UI
looks fantastic come honor of the days
of the Start menu now replaced by tiles
that allow you to jump from app to app
with minimal effort the multitasking
also looks great with a swipe from the
left allowing you to drag in more apps
and snap them into place if for some
reason you want to go back to the
standard Windows desktop and look at
apps just like you do in Windows 7 is
just a quick switch away on the
technical side of things there have been
quite a few changes from windows 7 the
first of which is full support for ARM
processors allowing tablets to run with
slower and more power efficient chips
such as the NVIDIA Tegra 2 this is
already in several Android tablets today
this also means that several
improvements will be shared with the
desktop and laptop side including an OS
that you run easier on computers than
vista or seven did as well as a new
windows App Store overall I've got to
say that Windows 8 or whatever the file
name ends up being looks nothing short
of awesome how about you guys what do
you think about Windows 8 be sure to
leave your thoughts in the comments
