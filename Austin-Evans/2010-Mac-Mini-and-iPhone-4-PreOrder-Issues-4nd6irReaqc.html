news day we've got a couple more things
both apple-related the first which is
the Mac Mini has been totally redesigned
from the ground up with a really cool
new design and in addition the iphone 4
pre-orders have gone terribly ramen guys
is a huge mess I'm so first guys I will
start with the mac mini and yes guys it
has been totally refreshed with a new
aluminum unibody design so the specs are
it has a 2.4 gigahertz intel core 2 duo
two gigabytes of ram a 320 gigabyte hard
drive and the nvidia geforce 3200 am
graphics so guys it's a moderate step up
with that part but the main thing is
that it has been totally redesigned with
a very very cool unibody look I'm so
guys it's even thinner now knowing 1.5
inches tall and then also add hdmi out
so this is going to be an even better
solution if you already have a mac mini
me are you hooking it up to you know big
screen TV or whatever well now that has
hdmi i'll be even better because there
are some downsides and that the price
has gone up so the base Mac Mini is now
six hundred ninety nine dollars which is
100 hours more expensive than the old
based mac mini guys that that's a lot of
money for a little computer especially
in considering that you know doesn't
come with the monitor doesn't come with
a keyboard it doesn't come with the
mouse you're basically just getting the
computer I mean guys it's not that bad
if you lose 500 all to think they would
do here would be a fantastic computer
but for the price yeah just a little bit
too much I think ok guys so now on to
this whole iphone for pre-order deal
guys it is messed up big time now i
don't know how it is around the world i
do know though that in the united states
is a huge mess so guys literally this
morning people were standing in line to
pre-order their iphones to stand in
another line here in a couple weeks if
it's just ridiculous and it gets worse
this guy's basically what happened and
this is a lot of speculation but
obviously you know that there is the big
problem so apparently what happened with
AT&amp;amp;T was redesigning their system or
there somehow setting up with how to
activate your new phones all that kind
of stuff so they've been recently doing
that well apparently they were not ready
at all the shoe
stream of people who are waiting at
midnight you know to go ahead and
pre-order their brand new iphone 4 so it
has gone totally down practically you
know you couldn't do it online you
couldn't even people going into the
stores it wouldn't work and guys it gets
even worse so if you go in so let's say
earlier today you win and you know that
you actually go to a store because
online was really not working at all so
go to the store so Pellinore a 32
gigabyte iphone 4 okay so you go ahead
and do it and then basically it's like a
four five step process and it was not
working so like they click on it let
more click on it maybe you hit on a 20
30 40 times hopefully you get through
the problem was is the first step was to
add two more years to your contract so
vote for a lot of people they all they
got today was that they got two more
years of the contract and nope no new
iphone too has a huge mess there and it
gets even worse than than that so it
looks like there was a big glitch the
system was totally down and some people
when they go to log into their AT&amp;amp;T
account they were going into other
people's accounts then of course if
you're into someone else's account you
can look at you know all kinds of
personal information I mean guys it is a
huge mess so they've totally taken down
the system you can't walk online
anywhere stores or on your computer
basically right now what they're doing
is they are is going to the store you
can preorder one they will write your
name down and your information out on a
piece of paper and apparently they'll do
something with that one that once the
system is fixed you guys huge mess with
reporting the iphone four you know
personally if it was me just hold off
wait a day or two a little bit until i
get this all sorted out as this just a
huge mess but anyway guys hopefully that
guy gave you a little bit more insight
what's going on hopefully you won't have
any troubles like a lot of people did
this morning anyway guys thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
