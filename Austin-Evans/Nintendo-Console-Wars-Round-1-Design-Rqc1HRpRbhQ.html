some of the best consoles around the
Super Nintendo brought with it true
classic games in Nintendo's opening
salvo into the 16-bit console wars the
Nintendo school came in instant favorite
and major competitor against the
PlayStation when it was released
bringing full 3d graphics at last the
Gamecube was Nintendo's big foray into
the realm of optical discs dropping
support for the cartridges that had
served their consoles for so long and
lastly but certainly not least there was
the Wii the Wii is undoubtedly the
biggest selling console of this
generation packing in a potent
combination of motion controls and
wireless Bluetooth and Wi-Fi all these
consoles left their mark on the video
game industry as a whole
so let's begin and end depth look at
each one to see how they have progressed
throughout the years
welcome to the Nintendo console wars
the first segment of the Nintendo
console wars is the look of the consoles
here we have consoles spanning an age
some 15 years and as you can clearly see
much has changed
the Super Nintendo was a major step up
from the console that replaced bringing
with it improved graphics and a much
smaller form factor indeed it took
Nintendo two whole generations to get
another console back down to the very
small size of the Super Nintendo the
console is made entirely of grey plastic
which while looks fairly dated today
still was a major improvement from the
original Nintendo on the front you will
find two ports for controllers which
somewhat oddly plug in opposite of each
other on the top it's quite simple with
a purple on/off switch as well as a
reset button above this you will find
the game slot where it's quite simple to
slide in the game cart both sides are
free and clear of ports and vents on the
back you will find a narrow vent and
connections for both the power cable and
AV out the Super Nintendo was a very
simple console that packed a serious
punch for the time even though most
models now are approaching 20 years old
they were built to last and assuming
it's not been treated badly odds are
most of them are still working that
alone is a testament to house all the
Super Nintendo is and how they will
still be played for many many more years
next is the Nintendo 64 here you can see
the console underwent a radical redesign
growing in size and adding several
features such as for controller ports as
opposed to 2 and a choice of colors
transparent orange being the best
obviously it's a very oddly shaped
console filled with lots of long rounded
corners but it's still distinctive even
to this day the Nintendo 64 was
available in a wide range of colors
including black orange purple blue green
and several others in addition there
were several different special edition
versions the most interesting being a
pokemon theme version that entirely
changed the look of the Nintendo 64
removing many of the busy lines in
exchange for adding a giant Pikachu
pretty good trade-off if you ask me on
the front you'll find 4 controller ports
and a small light indicating when the
console is on the top has an on/off
switch reset button along with a slot to
insert the expansion pack which
increased the RAM and improved the
graphics and some games at the rear you
will find the a/v out as well as a very
large intention where the power supply
is inserted the Nintendo 64 was the most
advanced console of this generation
capable of some impressive for the time
3d graphics the majority of the consoles
around today are more than 10 years old
but good examples aren't hard to find it
shouldn't be difficult to find a nice
model for a reasonable amount and so
long as the numerous events aren't
clogged with grime and dust they usually
have a very solid console on your hands
moving along now we come to the Nintendo
GameCube the Gamecube went in a very
different direction than its predecessor
dropping many of its key features such
as the cartridge format moving instead
to a mini DVD another major difference
was the change to a unique form factor
of a cube and it's the name the gang
cube
obviously the Gamecube was available in
a range of colors although most of them
were less crazy than on the Nintendo 64
the front of the console was taken out
by four controller ports as well as two
slots for memory cards looking at the
top you'll see buttons for power reset
along with a button to open the disc bay
both sides have large vents for cooling
with the fan residing on the left side
the back is largely taken up by a handle
which actually allows you to pick up the
console and make it somewhat portable
there's also a power connector along
with both digital and analog video out
the games you tried several new things
but was held back by its lack of DVD
support something both the original Xbox
and Playstation 2 had just one look at
store shelves will tell you who won this
generations console war as the GameCube
has been out of production since 2007
and Sony still gets millions of
PlayStation two's out a year used
examples are both cheap and plentiful
with the way being able to replace it
entirely even down to controller ports
and memory card slots game cubes are
everywhere
they are quite reliable and considering
that even your oldest ones you can find
are only about 7 years old the Gamecube
is a pretty safe bet lastly we have the
Wii the Wii has gotten bagged on for
being little more than a Gamecube with
motion controls and Wi-Fi but it hasn't
sold nearly three times as many consoles
as its predecessor for nothing it
features a lot of unique features such
as a form factor similar to the ps2 slim
the motion controls and full emulation
support for all kinds of older games
from the Nintendo 64 to the original
Nintendo
now bad considering they can play every
game from each of the pilot consoles in
this video
among many more now over three years
into its life the Wii is actually
somewhat limited in options it comes in
a few colors though you can get it in
white it'll as well as white I know yeah
gems of white too hopefully this gives
remedied soon enough with some of the
cool colors that it was showing before
it was released the front is largely
taken out by its slot loading disk drive
which accepts both game cubes and Wii
games but sadly nothing else it has
power reset and eject buttons as well as
the hidden panel which hides a control
or sync button and space to insert an SD
card both sides are completely clear
while the top has bases to insert up to
four GameCube controllers as well as two
GameCube memory cards the back has two
USB ports a small fan along with
connections to the sensor bar video out
and power the Wii while lacking graphics
anywhere comparable to either the Xbox
360 or Playstation 3 has still managed
to handily outsell both its competitors
it has a lot of shortcomings but also a
lot of unique strengths currently the
Wii costs $200 and used models have
dropped considerably in price in the
last year or so thanks in major part to
the fact that people no longer fight
over them when the source finally get a
couple so there you have it the first
installment of the Nintendo console wars
be sure to stay tuned for future
episodes wire will covered games
controllers features and much much more
do you have any of these consoles which
is your favorite Nintendo console of all
time be sure to leave your thoughts in
the comments anyway thanks for watching
