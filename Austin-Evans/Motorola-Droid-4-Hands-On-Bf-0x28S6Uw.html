from CES 2012 I'm here with a demo abdi
motorola droid bore so Michael you won't
go i'd take away so this is the motorola
droid 4 up until this point customers
who have wanted a 40 keyboard on their
smartphone have had to sacrifice
something whether it's a smaller screen
size lesser processing power 3g when
they really wanted a 4g the motorola
droid 4 takes care of all of those
problems for the customer the phone
features a 4 inch qhd screen it's got a
1.2 gigahertz dual-core processor as
well as a gigabyte of ram so when you're
cycling through your UI web browsing
multitasking you don't have to worry
about any sort of lag from the device
the phone features all the same fun
applications that we introduced on the
razor including Smart Actions where
you're able to customize your phone
without having to think too much about
it where you can set rules where the
phone will actually interact based on
something that triggers in the device
for example when your display is off and
it's not charging the device can turn
off its GPS and the background sync as
well the phone also features moto cast
so you're able to stream your music your
movies your pictures and your files
directly through the device wirelessly
from your PC it's also webtop capable so
you can dock it at any one of our web
top solutions including the laptop where
the HD dock the biggest call out on the
droid 4 is the actual slide out physical
keyboard this keyboard is more PC like
you'll notice it's got a number of a
dedicated number at the top as well as a
shift key to give you that for pc
keyboard experience the keys themselves
are raised up and separate it and you
can notice the the backlight really
comes through strong thanks to the laser
etching that we've done around the keys
the phone's got an eight megapixel
camera on the back 1080p video recording
and an HD front-facing camera so users
who are looking for a qwerty keyboard
smartphone don't have to concessions now
and how about price or release date as
of right now we haven't announced the
release date or the pricing it does of
course have LTE on Verizon yes
lte-capable thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
