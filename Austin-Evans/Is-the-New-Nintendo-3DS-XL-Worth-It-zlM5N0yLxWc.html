been around for four years now but that
means it's time for midlife update and
that's exactly what we've got with the
new Nintendo 3ds XL crack it open and
you'll find the cards for the built-in
AR games instruction manual and
paperwork along with the new 3ds XL
itself what you won't get in the box is
an AC adapter which means you'll have to
buy one separately or use one from the
DSi or earlier 3ds take a look at the
new 3ds and you'll see it's the same
size as the last 3dsxl meaning this is
no small handheld it's got a similar
footprint to an iPhone 6 plus but it's
nearly twice as thick making it tricky
to fit in most pockets personally I
always preferred the normal size DS
models but this time around Nintendo
decided to go 3ds XL only here in North
America they also brought back a glossy
finish which looks good out of the box
but makes it hard to keep clean of
fingerprints one thing about the new 3ds
XL is that the bottom screen is
incredibly reflective now the top story
isn't quite so bad but because the
bottom screen has a resistive
touchscreen layer that means that if
you're trying to play this thing outside
it's almost unusable even with the
screen brightness all the way up there's
now a micro SD card which makes sense
however it's hidden behind the rear
panel which you'll need a tiny Phillips
screwdriver to open inside there's a
four gigabyte card included but for
around $10 you can pick up a 16 gig
microSD to give you a bit more room for
things like digital downloads speaking
of if you're upgrading from an older 3ds
the transfer process is a serious chore
after going through menus for about five
minutes I was able to transfer a single
3ds game and a couple virtual console
titles over to the new 3ds and about 30
minutes over Wi-Fi so if you have a
serious collection this could take quite
a while it's not all bad though there
are some solid upgrades here there's now
a new second directional stick which can
come in handy for games like Super Smash
Brothers to quickly use your smash
attacks it's an interesting design the
stick bully doesn't move very much but
after a few minutes I was able to get
the hang of it there are also an extra
set of shoulder buttons to give the new
3ds basically all of the controls from
the old Circle Pad Pro there's also been
a big internal upgrade the new 3ds XL is
sporting twice as much memory and a quad
core processor menus are just as snappy
as before but the real difference is in
loading times for optimized games like
smash it gets into the game in 17
seconds compared to a very slow 36
seconds on the 2d s the key here though
is
normal 3ds games aren't any faster that
I could tell but most newer games should
load faster or even show improved
graphics we've also got support for
amiibo on the new 3ds it works just as
you would expect drop the figure on the
touchscreen and it brings it right into
the game again this is mostly geared
toward smash right now but I imagine
this will be popular with a lot of
upcoming games one of the biggest
upgrades for me is actually the 3d
screen it now tracks your face to adjust
the 3d effect depending on where you're
sitting which is a huge improvement over
earlier 3ds a--'s which made you sit in
a very narrow field of view before I
never really use 3d but now it finally
delivers on the promise of the original
model back in 2011 if you've never owned
a 3ds your choices really come down to
the 2d as a new 3ds XL for the extra $70
you're getting better specs extra
controls and proper 3d which is going to
make it worth it for a lot of people if
you already have an earlier 3ds though
it's not such an obvious upgrade until
games really start being optimized for
the new 3ds you're not getting a
massively better experience and if
you're still holding on to an original
small 3ds the added size might be a
hassle so what do you guys think is the
new Nintendo 3ds XL worth it let me know
