of Google Translate for iOS Google
Translate is a really cool app this is
the of course the same Google Translate
that you know from you know the PC on
you know the Internet you know you can
go ahead and check out you know a
website you can translate a foreign
website or find out what a couple of
words or a sentence means and another
language
I'm however Google Translate for a
mobile device really does change it
actually works a lot better it gives you
a lot more opportunities so look one
just jump straight on into it um we can
just do the standard thing we can
translate so let's just translate from
English to Swedish what hello is so
something pretty simple it should yeah
then no problem at all so that's what it
means in Swedish however what's new
about this what is really Kwon mobile
device is actually supports voice so
let's just do the same thing using voice
hello nice to meet you
so really simply there I just go ahead
and said that and with any luck it'll
translate it properly um I will say
there are this is not perfect it can
definitely be some issues in addition
the microphone is faced down with my
ipod touch doing this demo so it's not
super accurate but still is pretty good
and of course you see it got pretty well
um again I don't speak Swedish I assume
that that's correct the it did recognize
the words pretty well so this is really
cool does support a wide variety of
languages I've been messing around with
a few but I mean there are all kinds now
it does not support voice for all as you
see the ones with a little gray I mean a
speaker that's those are the ones that
actually supports for your voice so it's
a good one probably most of the most
common languages you'll see here so that
definitely works quite well so that's
just Pig Japanese um let's do something
else let's do yeah
anyway guys thanks for watching there we
go so huh see if it recognized my
trademark here anyway guys thanks for
watching in Japanese is let's actually
see what it says so if you were
wondering how to say anyway guys thanks
for watching in Japanese that's how to
do it um and that really is about it you
guys this is a really cool app I love it
um
this is really especially if you're
traveling you know in a country that you
might not know the language this is be
fantastic and of course you can
translate from you know I'm just using
English to Japanese there's a wide
variety of languages that you can use
and you of course you can just use the
text or for example for just tilt it up
like this it'll actually make it
fullscreen where if maybe you know you
don't want to use the microphone or
whatever you can still the person can
read it so very very cool app Google
Translate definitely recommend you guys
check this out it is free in the App
Store so of course you will need for the
voice you will need a microphone you'll
obviously need an iPhone or an iPod
Touch with a microphone or a headset
microphone but anyway guys very cool off
and definitely recommend check it out
anyway guys you heard it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
