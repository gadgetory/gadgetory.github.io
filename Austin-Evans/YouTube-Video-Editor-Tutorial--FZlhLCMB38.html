youtube videos I obviously - then this
new feature will be excellent for you
and it is the YouTube video editor so
guys now you can go ahead and have all
of your videos that you have on YouTube
you can now edit them seamlessly on the
site itself so it's really guys with
this is feasible to go ahead and instead
of you know editing a bunch of stuff
before you get it especially if you have
a slow computer
I know video the editing can be really
really bad so guys all you have to do is
just upload your videos to the site and
you can do you know any kind of videos
you want you can mix and match the
videos and then you guys you go ahead
use a YouTube video editor put them all
together and you'll be good to go
now that eyes before we begin I will
note it's not an super in-depth ed or
you know I mean it's it's good for just
cutting and pasting and adding some
music to it but beyond that you're not
gonna be able to be doing a lot of your
really an in-depth stuff so you don't be
thrown away Sony Vegas or anything yet
so guys let's go ahead and just start so
as you can see here the video editor is
pretty basic all of your videos will be
automatically added or well most of them
I've got more videos than that but
hopefully yours is in the first you know
15-20 videos they show so guys let's go
ahead and just make a video so guys I
have two videos I'm going to combines
today I've got one which is about the
Xbox 360 Kinect so I'm go ahead and drop
that in down here to the timeline and
then go ahead and do the video that I
made after it came out explaining
everything about it so we hadn't dropped
this one down so guys now I have my two
videos I will note guys even if you have
an older account that can put videos up
long than two minutes or you are a
partner and you can't actually do it in
the video editor so the way I'd like add
like 11 that video as you can see guys
total duration is too long remove or
shorten a video clip so not a big deal
just keep your videos short under 10
minutes so guys we have these two videos
but I don't want to just do put two
videos together I'm gonna go ahead and
edit them so go ahead and just click the
scissors and then go ahead and open it
up so guys the video editing is actually
pretty smooth you can actually pan
pretty much anywhere you want and it
goes really well no like this
a little bit like you here but it got
it's not like you're having to wait for
a whole video to buffer or anything you
can pretty much skip around and it will
load it up pretty smoothly you can see
you guys the quality is not very high
but it's not a big deal it's just for
the preview so let's go ahead and back
up um let's see here let's go ahead and
go to where's this I'm gonna keep
skimming along here to uh find it and
let's point here I doesn't want him at
this is just a test so we're at 31
seconds so now we come down here and
let's grab this trim handle and drag it
to about 31 seconds so that looks good
because this is where our video will
begin so now let's go ahead and say we
want to end it 38 seconds unless so we
just want to use a small clip from this
video so we just drag the second handle
drag it back to right there that looks
good so guys now we're going to be we're
getting rid of all this video except
seven seconds so that's about it no big
deal so now we have seven seconds now
let's come to the second video clip and
of course and the first one we already
talked about a lot of the stuff that we
talked in the second so let's go ahead
and just scrub all the beginning out so
right here okay so looks good and let's
leave the rest of the video in okay so
guys now you can come over here to this
preview window and go ahead and hit play
so give it just a moment that's going to
show the first few seconds of the first
video and then in just a second there we
go
so guys now it will go ahead and do the
second one now guys it doesn't feature
any you know really in-depth you know
like transitions or anything like that
but for you know for home movies and for
basic stuff it's pretty decent so guys
now we have our rough video but let's
say we want spice it up a little bit
let's say we want to add some music so
guys you can go ahead and add any music
this in the audio swamp so all I have to
do is come up to audio tab and then go
through the pretty decent library of
audio swamp music so say we want this
one so just click it and drag it down to
the audio guys I will mention that by
doing using audio swap music usually you
will have ads on that video so you know
just something to keep in mind and of
course if you're a partner you don't
want to do this but I'm not going to
publish it so it's not a big deal so go
ahead and play it and see now
and guys so you actually can't hear it
right now but I'm I'm pumping out some
pretty good techno music instead of
listen to my voice you guys it works
really well
once you're done with that you can go
ahead and of course you can swap audio
as much as you want and then just punch
in the title of your new video so let's
say it's just gonna be a new video and
then we can go ahead and hit publish
then you'll be all set so guys I figured
that'd be a really helpful video for a
lot of you guys I know I'm gonna
probably start trying to use this of
course I use my normal video editor on
my computer but you know for something
like this you know if your just need to
cut a little bit out or whatever reason
you know the videos not right this is a
perfect way to do it especially I mean I
could even see maybe editing home movies
you know you had a vacation trip or
something this could be pretty handy for
you anyway guys hopefully this helps you
out if you're interested in learning
more and actually testing it out go
ahead and hit the link in the
description you can go ahead and open it
up and do the whole thing it's pretty
cool anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
