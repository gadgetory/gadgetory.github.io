the iPhone 7 with the next iPhone right
around the corner there are leaks all
over the place and thanks to my friends
B sound you guys should definitely go
check them out and make some cool
lightning headphones okay we'll get my
hands on this guy so at first glance
this looks a lot like the iPhone 6 and
6s however if you look a little closer
there's some pretty major differences so
if we compare with an iPhone 6s the
first thing that jumps out to me are the
antenna lines I've never been a huge fan
of the way the 6 and 6s look from the
back the antenna lines have always felt
a little ugly over on the 7 it looks
like they're cleaning it up a bit
probably the most obvious difference is
in the camera so while the 6 and 6s
added a camera hump which is actually
fairly small the 7 has a much larger
camera so for comparison if we measure
the iPhone 6s we get a thickness of 6.9
millimeters however if we jump over to
the camera hump it's actually seven
point six millimeters thick now if we
measure the iPhone 7 we see that
actually comes in and I think this is a
six point seven millimeters so it's very
slightly thinner over I'm curious on the
camera we're getting seven point seven
millimeters where this really matters is
when you put the phone flat on a table
so with the 6s there's a little bit of
motion that's not too bad however on the
iPhone 7 there's definitely some wobble
that bigger hump likely means that
there's a bigger sensor inside so Apple
has actually done this before when they
went from the 5 to the 5s while it was
still an 8 megapixel camera the sensor
itself was bigger which meant that each
individual pixel could pull in more
light by iPhone 7 will probably keep the
same 12 megapixel resolution however if
you have a bigger sensor need a bigger
lens to cover it thus bigger camera hump
if we look at the back of the phone
we're gonna see a pretty major change
just like the rumors have been saying
for a while there is no headphone jack
on the iPhone 7 instead it's place is a
second speaker now this isn't a terrible
idea the iPhone has always had a pretty
bad speaker so we have to even though
they might not be front-facing that's
got to be an improvement however no
headphone jack is definitely not an
improvement so to be fair you can use
lightening headphones on the iPhone and
in fact these actually have already been
out I recently did a video on them and
there are some advantages of using
lightening headphones but that's mostly
on the high-end as far as normal
headphones that you probably already own
right now you're kinda back
look on top of the mock-up I was also
able to get my hands on an iPhone 7 case
so you can see if we pop the phone in
here it's a pretty much perfect fit
around back you'll see a bigger cutout
for the new camera as well as the flash
and microphone for comparison I have a
normal iPhone 6s case here so while the
seven will fit inside we take a look at
it it doesn't really quite match up so
the camera is not even remotely in the
same spot and while on bottom the
Lightning port still matches up that
headphone jack is absolutely not there
so what do you guys think about the
iPhone 7 that will be sure to let me
know in the comments below and if this
video hits 25,000 likes I will be giving
away a brand new iPhone 7 when it comes
out so you can go my buddy Jon from TLD
went even more in-depth on the new
iPhone 7 said it'll be sure to go check
out that video and I will catch you guys
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
