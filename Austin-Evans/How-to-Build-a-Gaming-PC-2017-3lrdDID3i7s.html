here with my 2017 gaming PC build
tutorial so if you guys have never built
a computer before it is really
straightforward but I'm going to walk
you through step by step also I sound
like some infomercial guy call now for
your three quick tips on how to build
yourself a gaming PC for tools it's
pretty straightforward all he is a
Phillips screwdriver now beyond that you
need to have a decent size workspace so
I'm going to be using this table as long
as you have an area that's big enough to
set out your parts you're fine beyond
that you should if possible do this in
an area without carpet as static
electricity is not a good thing with PC
parts so first step is to grab your case
and pull it out of the box now this is
by far our biggest component and this is
as the case name applies where all of
our parts end up going so this is the
case now the first step here is just
going to be opening it up so around back
they're going to be four screws and all
it's going to allow us to do is take off
the side panel inside here all we do is
get all of our cables out so this is
what's going to go into the motherboard
later we also have a little bit of
hardware as well as some cable ties for
our cable management the first thing to
install is going to be our power supply
so this is a literal heart of our build
and one of those important things when
picking a power supply is to get a high
quality unit there are lots of very
cheap units that say they have a lot of
power but really you should be looking
for something within 80 plus rating
whether it's 80 plus bronze gold silver
whatever that means that you're going to
at least get something with decent
quality so inside the power supply box
nandu we actually have the supply itself
we also have the cable as well as we
have a few extras little accessories the
most important thing here is we have
four little screws that we were going to
use to actually mount the supplying
something else to keep in mind when
picking up a power supply is modular
versus non modular so this guy is non
modular and these are typically cheaper
and the only thing that really means is
whether the cables are attached or not
so over this system we have plenty of
room for cable management inside so it
really doesn't matter that we have a
bunch of extra cables but we aren't
going to use especially if you're doing
a smaller system where every little bit
of space matters anyone spend just a
little bit extra to pick up a modular
supply and so on the power supply is
pretty straightforward one thing you
need to watch out for is where the fan
is this always needs access to cool air
so cases actually will handle this a
little bit differently sometimes so some
cases will actually put it on the top
which means that you should have the fan
facing upward but for this guy since
we're going to be putting on on the
bottom as simple as putting the stand
face down lining it up and it should
just slide right into place to give this
guy in place all we do is use the four
screws that comes with and they're going
to be corresponding holes on the case
plenty to do is just get this in let's
do it super tight or anything but once
we get these guys in place the power
supply is not going to be going anywhere
one little tip when it comes to printer
screwing anything in is you want to use
a cross pattern so I'm going to do this
one then this one and this one and this
one this just helps that pinch anytime
you're mounting hardware to make sure
that you're applying even pressure
instead of just doing like one side
maybe like slightly out of place so that
is all we have to do with the power
supply for now the next step is to move
our case out of the way and grab our
motherboard so this might not look like
much but it is essentially what
everything in the computer connects to
this is the motherboard so there are
different sizes of motherboards and
that's something that you definitely
want to pay attention to before you
actually pick out all the parts for your
build so this is the sort of medium size
known as micro ATX now thankfully with
this case it actually supports full
sized ATX so pretty much any size
motherboard will fit but it's definitely
something you want to look out for
before you actually buy all the parts
for your build before we give this
install let me quickly run you through
all the different sort of slots and
ports and things that we're going to be
using for the build so start with we
have the CPU socket pretty
self-explanatory this is where our CPU
is going to go beside that we have our
memory slots this board has two but some
do have four essentially that's where
our RAM goes we also do have our PCI
slots down here different motherboards
will have different amounts of PCI slots
but this is generally speaking where
you're going to put a graphics card and
sometimes you're going to put other
adding cards just like a network card or
Wi-Fi card beside the memory we have
four SATA ports so these are going to be
used for things which is installing our
SSD maybe a hard drive region an optical
drive and over beside that we have our
into slot so this is a newer motherboard
not all motherboards are going to have
this but this is going to be if you want
to install a newer faster SSD we're not
taking advantage of it for this bill but
the motherboard does support it now if
you actually want to flip the
motherboard around you're going to see
that over here we have all of our ports
so these are going to be what's going to
stick out the back of the case so say
you want to plug in something like USB
or Ethernet or whatever that's where all
these are going to go we're also going
to have to get powered
to our motherboard so first of all we
have our 20 plus 4 pen so this is going
to provide most of the power for pretty
much everything on the board we also
have either a 4 or an 810 CPU power
connector this board has an 8 pen there
works the exact same way next it's time
to install the processor so this is
going to be a little different depending
on whether you're using intel or AMD but
I'll walk you through it on both sides
it's basically the same process so
inside we're going to have some
paperwork which we don't need at all as
well as our CPU cooler and processor so
you want to be a little bit careful with
the cooler that's so much the top but on
bottom there's going to be a little bit
of pre applied thermal paste do not
touch that and inside this little
plastic piece here we have the processor
itself you actually do want to be
careful with this guy so when you're
handling a processor you always want to
grab it from the side do not touch any
of these little pads it's especially
important with a and D processors
instead of having pads that have pens
and if any of those get bent you were in
serious trouble one thing to look for on
the bottom of the processor is this tiny
little gold arrow that's going to match
up with a corresponding arrow on the
processor socket and making sure that
you're not going to put this in sideways
or upside down it's pretty
straightforward to install so we just
need to pull the arm back and open up
the socket line our CPU up being very
careful not to drop it too hard and then
once it's in place we just need to push
this arm back into place and our CPU is
installed pretty easy the next step is
putting on the heatsink again it's going
to be pretty straightforward so they're
going to be four pins which will line up
to the corresponding notches on the
motherboard so all these do is line it
up make sure that we don't actually let
that thermal paste touch yet and then
once it's a place only to do is just
press it in until it clicks then we just
have to plug in the fan so we just need
to unwind a fan header from around our
CPU cooler so for this motherboard we're
going to be plugging it in right here
however it's because of the cable just a
little bit long what I like to do is
actually just tie a little bit of a knot
to get rid of some of the slack
now the actual fan header itself will
only go in one way because these two
little notches so if we line it up and
press it in tuck our cable away and
we're pretty much good to go the next
tip is installing our memory so that was
going to be pretty straightforward so
there are different types of randant you
need to look out for so most newer
systems this one included are going to
be
ddr4 memory if you're doing a slightly
older system that will be using ddr3 but
basically the same thing as far as
installing it might sound obvious but if
you have a ddr4 motherboard you have to
use ddr4 Ram and vice versa with ddr3
now it can be a little tricky because
these do look very similar but ddr4 does
have a different pen layout what is
pretty much the same between the two
there's going to be a little notch about
two thirds of the way down the memory
that's going to correspond to a matching
notch on the motherboard so this is only
going to go in one way so let me do is
line it up and just press down firmly
until you get the click and your memory
is installed before ready to actually
install our motherboards though we want
to get the i/o shield ready so this is
what's going to essentially go over the
ports right here but instead of putting
on the motherboard we're actually going
to put it on the case you do want to
make sure the shield is facing the
correct orientation once you get it all
you do is just line up with the back of
your case and once you do just pop it
right and that sounded a lot more
violent than it actually was
now used to go into the bag of hardware
that comes with your case inside we're
going to find these standoffs so these
are going to be what we actually use to
mount the motherboard so on one side
we're going to screw them into the case
and on the other we're going to mount
the motherboard so as I shall now
demonstrate with my wonderful assistant
Wes all you need to do is first take the
motherboard and just kind of test fit in
here
don't let it all the way down what you
can do is you can see that we have six
holes on the motherboard and that's
going to line up with these six holes
that are going to be in the case now
because this is a bigger casement for
ATX motherboards you'll see that we have
a bunch of extra holes what we do is put
these standoffs in the correct locations
so if the standoffs all you do is just
get them in finger tight they don't have
to be super super hard in there but
again just make sure that you get all
the stand ups and the right locations
the next step is removing our PCI covers
so this case actually does it a little
differently than most so essentially
right back here is where our graphics
card is going to go and typically you
would just unscrew it and take it out or
with this case we actually have to just
push them out of place there go the way
harder than it should be so once you get
the first one out it's not so bad but if
you get
case that actually just a little ow you
to unscrew it that makes things a lot
simpler otherwise you have to wiggle it
back and forth until it pops out all we
have to do now is just take our
motherboard line it up with our
standoffs
and take careful attention to the i/o
shield you wanna make sure that all the
ports are going to be fully visible
through the back which they are once you
have it lined up then you have to screw
it in place so we have a little bag of
screws here most of the time cases will
actually have lots of different very
similar-looking screws so it might take
a little bit of trial and error but just
get a few these screws out and we should
get this guy into place this is
definitely time where you want to use
cross threading on your screws so say if
you want to do one side and then the
other what can happen is the boardwax is
slightly shift so just do one corner
then go to the opposite corner opposite
corner opposite corner until we make
sure the board is all the way in place
so for this bill we are using an SSD
instead of a hard drive but the process
of installing and especially cabling it
is basically the exact same thing the
biggest difference is an SSD is just
going to be a physically smaller drive
which means that use a slightly
different mounting point with this case
we're going to be using the full three
and a half inch drive bay which is
typically used for bigger hard drives
however we do have the mounting points
for an SSD so only thing you have to
watch out for here is to make sure that
the connectors for the SSD are going to
be facing backward towards the back of
the case otherwise your cable management
is going to be challenged once you
launch a SSD up it's as simple as just
using a few screws to hold it into place
and this guy isn't going anywhere and we
just slide our SSD into the case and
that's pretty much it we are almost done
with putting Hardware in the case the
next step is to start with our wiring so
this can look a little intimidating but
it's really not that bad so to start
with we can find the little three pin
connector from our fan and all you do is
you plug that into the system fan header
on the top left of the board there's a
lot of extra slack here so we're going
to tuck that around because you know
totally now I'm going to notice that
right now we have to find the 20+4 pin
connector from our power supply so it's
going to be probably the biggest one out
of all your power supply cables so just
note that there's going to get a little
clip on the side all you do is just line
up with the larger connector on the
motherboard and just press it until it
clicks into place working our way down
the right side of the motherboard
we now need to go and pull all these
cables that are connected to the case so
for here in this build we have a USB 3
header so there's one USB 3.0 port on
the front of the case now this is a
little bit of a tricky connector mostly
because if you get it kind of stuck I've
actually seen that the whole front of
this will actually pull off so you
definitely want to make sure that you
kind of line up correctly but just like
the other one there's going to be a
little notch so it's only going to go in
one way so we plug into a USB 3.0 header
right here and just press it into place
and we should be good well we're here
let's plug in the front panel connectors
so these are the tiny little connectors
that are going to be running from the
front of the case so essentially this is
going to allow things like the power
button to work and the LEDs that kind of
stuff now these are all going to be
labeled so there's going to be a
positive and negative so that's going to
correspond to whatever it says either on
the actual connectors on the bottom
right of the board or if you just check
the owner's manual that will also give
you the exact diagram so for here we
actually only have four of these so if
we line it up should just go right into
place
this case also has a couple of USB 2.0
ports which is what this cable is for so
this is a pretty straightforward
connector so it actually has one pin
knocked out so you can only put it in
one way and for this case we're just
going to plug it into the white header
here so just line it up and press it all
the way em simple acts
last but not least we have the audio
connector so as the name implies is
going to allow the headphone and
microphone jack on the front of the case
to work and just like the USB port
there's going to be one little pen it's
knocked out so you can't put it in the
wrong way so just line it up but then
and we're done with the little fiddly
stuff we're almost ready to install the
graphics card but before we do that we
just need to plug in the CPU power
connector so it's basically two four
pins that can go together as an eight
pen so with this board we need to use
both but a lot of motherboards you only
have to plug one end now is the fun part
this is our graphics card so with a
gaming PC when it comes to picking parts
that really kind of impact gaming
performance the graphics card really is
pretty much the most important part
now the graphics card isn't especially
fragile so you don't have to be super
careful with it but generally speaking
you should touch it by the plastic bit
or the metal as opposed to the board on
the back this is about as small as a
graphics card gets but it works the
exact same way even if you have a much
larger more expensive card plenty do is
flip it around
so that you have the board on the top
and once you have your PCI slot and your
cover is open just line it up and all
you do is press it until it clicks into
place
all we have to do is just make sure the
graphics card is lined up with the holes
on the side of the case and just screw
it into place so we're gonna use two
screws to do this and that's pretty much
it so because there's a little bit of a
lower part of graphics card you actually
don't need to do anything else but for
most graphics cards you're also going to
want to run a 6-pin connector from your
power supply it's gonna look a little
something like this
and plug it in but again with this card
we plug it in it's good to go we are
almost there
next step is to pull out these SATA
cables that came with the motherboard
and all you do is grab one end and plug
it into the board right here these are
not so they're definitely not going to
go in the wrong way and then if we wrap
the cable around back so it doesn't get
in our way then we just plug the data
cable into the back of the SSD so it's
going to be the smaller port and this
guy's going to click in place and that's
pretty much it now we have to run power
we're going back to the power supply we
have these SATA leads so it looks very
similar to the data so it's a long flat
cable with a little notch and just like
before all you do is line that up with
the back of the SSD plug it in and our
SSD is a Harmsen ready to go well we're
back here we need to plug in the front
fan so we actually have two options of
doing that so typically we're going to
want to use the little three pin header
to plug it straight into the motherboard
however this board actually doesn't have
another slot so we can actually just use
the molex so this is another cable
you're going to get off the power supply
well it looks a little crooked and weird
all we do here is just plug it into
place so quicks
and our fan is going to be good to go
now the system is basically done so this
is always the most exciting part does
the computer work so once you get a
mouse keyboard monitor and plug
everything in hopefully everything works
so it's the best feeling ever when it's
actually boots on the first try so the
next thing we have to do is give it
about thirty seconds or so and we should
get video up on the monitor or less than
30 seconds that actually is really quick
so if you've gone to this point
congratulations you have a fully working
computer now is the point to turn the PC
off unplug it and start doing some cable
management
this may be not quite the clearest thing
in the world but once you get all that
ready you're good to install windows and
have a fully working gaming computer if
you want more information on the actual
parts ideas for the system you can check
