based on android hey guys this is Austin
and today at mystery Tech I can't read
this box
oh well is this the nut Pro - are you
serious a No
Oh Google Translate just way off the nut
Pro - you want it just because of the
name didn't you I know you you bought it
just because of the name
how could you kim giman the pride the
youmu do you run on my tape oh you
stepped on my line oh look it's the
pride and joy of an artisan and how much
was this three hundred and fifty dollars
why you already spent 350 dollars
because you want to make a nut joke
is that it whose money did you sell out
exactly that's coming out of your
Christmas bonus alright alright so
smartisan OS is a little skinned I guess
so can you tell me something about this
so this is a Japanese phone wait I
thought you said you got a new PIN no
you never said that no I just assumed
yeah oh I apologize
oh yeah that's it you know that actually
did not do a bad job I mean it's not a
great job but that's not so bad it's a
dumb joke you can't base an entire
product off of one joke come on no no no
well it doesn't I could throw the boogie
board it's like a Wacom but I don't know
if you're on expect you to get anything
good for mr. e tech to waste
that is actually good if I could flip
the phone around the straw let's draw
Ken's hopes and dreams since 2000 hours
if it's a gay little Charlie good Matt
would you care to come over and draw
Ken's hopes and dreams that is actually
pretty impressive okay is this what you
always hoped and dreamed for if you
always wanted one of these in your life
that was heavy
oh oh I know what this is so you guys
may remember what was it earlier this
year we did a video on a very very
expensive iPhone case well this this is
sort of the next level I'm actually kind
of excited for this one what a metal box
are you serious hold on a second oh yo
yo what what this is the case it's grade
five titanium so I know these great
cases are among the most liked luxurious
and expensive cases as you can find for
any phone with the fact that this comes
in a metal box and it's grade five
titanium how much was this okay thank
you for not maxing out a credit card
read the user manual before installing
I'm not going to do that oh dude look at
that so this is long iPhone ten I assume
it would also fit a standard size 10s
but that is that's ridiculous how much
is this is it wrong to me that I kind of
like it like I know it's obviously
ridiculous and over-the-top but I I kind
of like it I mean that's cool right look
you're never gonna see another one of
these ever is this the most expensive
episode of mystery tech yet I mean this
alone is more expensive than most items
this title is about to be Oh
oh wow a thing that's not coal garbage
so this is the master op mechanical
keyboard the control fully programmable
with a heavy aluminum frame customizable
backlighting dual USBC and PBT keycaps
alright so we've got the keyboard oh wow
now that that my friends that is a look
ah okay that is also really heavy whoo
now that that is some RGB action so one
of the cool things about this keyboard
is you can actually replace the switches
individually so say you want to have
Browns in there right now but you want
to say put Blues unlike your WASD or
something you can totally customize that
also the RGB yeah that's uh that's
bright
so I actually personally kind of like
something with a little bit less of that
actual tactile sounds sometimes it's
nice to be able to sit in an office and
do some gaming or some working without
distracting everyone around you yeah I'm
gaming it's called my job man yeah the
feel this chicken wow that's a lot
chicken why is there an Xbox controller
covered in chicken oh wait greaseproof
1.0 oh this is that one grease for oh
that's gross
so if you guys are unaware of this
magical controller there is a
greaseproof xbox controller which I
think was only sold what Australia I was
a giveaway wait did Sean hook you up
with this thanks Sean I have to play
with it
like Keira like wash it off or something
oh it's so slippery oh good I mean the
controller is working fine but it look
looks like my fingers like sliding off
the greasy sticks wait come back I have
a grease proof controller come
so if you're looking for a greaseproof
controller to eat chicken and play your
xbox / PC games then uh you know this is
uh this is a move that's a really good
chicken I'm just gonna it's hard to eat
with one hand though I'm making a mess</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
