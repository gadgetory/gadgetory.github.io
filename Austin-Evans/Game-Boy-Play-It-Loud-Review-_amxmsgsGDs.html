today I'm here with a review something a
little bit different from what I usually
do but this is a review of the original
Gameboy but this is a little bit
different this is a play it loud model
this is actually one of my favorite I
have a lot of you know older technology
but this is one of my favorites it's
really it's not extremely rare I
wouldn't say but they did not make very
many of them and you hardly ever see
them of course you know they made these
for years and years and years the
original game boys but I would say just
almost all of them were you know the
standard sort of beige these play a lot
of models were as you can see
transparent plastic which really you
know just kind of made them look
extremely cool so go ahead and give you
guys a walkthrough to explain it to you
guys and I give you guys a little review
about it and show you it shut off I'm
pretty proud of it I like it a lot
anyway let's get this one started
this latest technology covering
everything
okay guys let's go I just jump right in
so um if you have if you're not familiar
with the normal game boy this is this is
pretty similar to it if you look here it
is it's got you know the standard a and
B buttons you know start select d-pad
you know very very similar stuff if
you've ever played a game boy what you
hope you have this is actually a perfect
example is that that well that was the
major downfall I will say just right
with that the major downfall of these
original game boys was this screen there
terrible terrible screens I mean there
I'll show you guys a demo of it in a
minute but I mean that right there
that's what it looks like I mean just
for comparison's sake this is a gameboy
pocket which they played the same game
but basically this was just kind of like
you know the slim version let me go
ahead and just tilt it you can see
that's the difference in the screens
right there
they're both black and white neither
have color but well actually this one's
black and white this is green and black
I guess but I'll go ahead and show again
comparisons in a minute but that's right
the bad I just said I just do not like
that screen whatsoever but yeah so I'm
go ahead give you guys a quick
run-through um you have your headphone
jack you have you have your volume right
here and you have right here if I take
it off there's a small little uh a
little plastic piece right here and as
you can see at is what you hook up the
link cable and of course you know game
boys mostly in the Pokemon games I know
but game boys could you know link up you
could trade you could you know change
high scores for different games is
pretty cool we move over to the front
this is where you put the game in and
say there's slot for the game and
there's also the power button which and
had this little spot actually me go to a
slot game and show you guys better you
see the slaughter there camera wants to
focus so that keeps it from pulling the
game out which is you know kind of cool
will they remove it later in games but
uh over here you can actually hook up a
power adapter if you don't want to be
using the four double eyes it needs I
mean there's the contrast which you can
I'll show you guys when I actually do a
Tron the thing everything on the back
and see your own oh you're gonna steal
my serial number you see here like I
said you know you have the game slot
which I one thing on those note it's
really cool I love how that's clear you
can see everything you got your four
double A batteries
um they actually last a good while can't
set up the top my head how long it lasts
I want to say you probably get you know
eight maybe eight hours or so out of it
um don't quote me on that though but
it's not all that bad but uh yeah so um
let me really quickly here just kinda
give you guys like to show you again
this is a gameboy pocket
um now like I said they plug the exact
same games just the original Game Boy
games that game would color or anything
and they have you know this was this
came out about five or six years later I
mean as you can see is quite a bit
smaller but it's got a larger screen and
you know we stack them on top of each
other you can see I mean I can barely
even get that of the Gameboy in the shot
I'll have mostly all the same ports and
everything and this is I'll be doing
reviews you know I'm going to hopefully
start doing or start reviewing a whole
line of game boys but uh you see here
the Gameboy pocket literally this thing
if you've ever tried to put your pocket
you know he does not fund you it's it's
just giant I mean here's another thing
it's an iPod Touch I mean it's just I
mean it's just enormous yeah but that's
okay it was really cool back in the day
and you know you don't necessarily put
everything in Bakke do you so let's go
ahead and get this out of the way um so
real quickly here one of the main
differences between the normal Game Boy
and the plight loud models well there's
actually two main differences they both
all like I said played the same games
everything's the same except just a
couple things you see this this Bluebell
right here that goes around the screen
this was a little bit darker in the play
at lab models um you know it's a small
thing but I just kind of mentioned that
because these um the Dark One's
literally um there I think that are all
glued in
down but literally guys if you lose this
and game boys you know have a habit of
that popping off and stuff if you lose
that it will cost you an arm and like to
find another one literally they're
extremely rare to find I've never
personally Rian's
so definitely you know it's almost worth
a lot of people buy they find a plate
Lauda buy it just to take this to sell
it I mean it's it's kind of ridiculous
but the second thing I hope you notice
by now is that it is transparent this
one I'm really proud of it's in really
good condition so I'm going to get a
little close-up here you can see not a
whole lot of scratches it's it's not the
matte plastic is on the normal Gameboy
it's uh but not not exactly you know you
see there's lights kind of reflecting
off of it it's uh it's not bad but it's
really cool I just love this because it
shows you how much how much stuff is
packed into this you know I mean I'm not
Chanel don't quote me on this guys I
don't know what's what but I'm fairly
sure that's the CPU maybe I don't know
see here there's the board hooks up to
the speaker and you see the batteries
and of course it uses four double A
batteries that's what that shows you how
big the battery thing is just that alone
um yeah there's few more things but you
really can't see go ahead just take the
day now see if you guys can see of
course my camera want not wanting to
focus with this clear plastic but uh
yeah it's very very cool um I really
really like it um to be honest with you
guys I don't like to play it I mean you
know I've got a no Gameboy Color or you
know I recently played some of the
Gameboy pocket just because it's got a
much better screen and a lot of larger
Street as well so these really aren't I
mean you can of course they still work
and everything but they're really not
that great for playing the screens just
too awful but uh while we're speaking
the screen let's go ahead and show you
guys um so let me just pull the camera
in a little bit um so go ahead turn it
on okay
so while it's you know doing this thing
of course you know you can do the volume
just going to turn down just a little
bit for you guys I just turn it all the
way down actually and on the left here
is contrast okay
contrast is a really important thing I
know several people who thought that
they actually bought these game boys cat
sounds funny but people who thought that
they actually bought these game boys and
that are not working both guys watch
this if you turn the contrast all the
way that screen looks like it's totally
dead and a lot of people who have bought
these game boys go
oh no the screens dead and you know like
got rid of them or whatever no no no no
always check the contrast as kinda seems
like a simple thing but you'd be
surprised so the contrast is just a
little dial you pull it and basically it
goes from green and you see the kind of
comes in and then you keep going and
it'll go all the way to black now the
reason that they do this was that some
games can you know be maybe a little
lighter a little darker and you can kind
of customize it kinda seems weird
nowadays you don't really see anything
like this but uh back then is kind of
necessary let's go ahead and get
something hmm about that like that I
guess um so now I'm going to go ahead
and show you guys a little bit of
gameplay this is of course a pokemon red
version sitting here a little safe out
here
um so I'm not so sure
exhuming just a little bit more let's
see here if I'm sure if you guys can
tell with the camera that's not me
that's not in focus okay well um unsee
here if you guys can tell the screen
gets a little bit blurry when there's
movement you know like for example like
look it like that and watch it kind of
gets a little blurry when you walk this
is a problem with the original screens
um you know it's not awful um and of
course this game work
pocket had that same problem as well um
but you know it's not terrible I guess
but what is terrible is the screen I
mean to look at it and especially it's
blurry and stuff like you know walking
around
especially with any kind of games that
are like you see this I mean this is a
well for game boys was pretty decent
graphics so you can see I mean it kind
of taxes the screen a little bit so it's
not the greatest so of course you can
walk around everything and I'm not sure
why I'm showing you guys this and just
kind of give you a good representation
of what the springs like for playing it
for a lot extended periods of time it's
not a ton of fun but show you guys that
is just about it um go ahead and pull
the camera a little bit um see you guys
that is the gameboy original Gameboy
play it loud model um these are actually
um okay I don't like to it's kind of
hard to say that's not rare rare but
they're pretty uncommon it's it's it's
not you're not going to find these all
over the place now as far as you know if
you were wanting to get one yourself um
like I said it's kind of hard to say um
no obviously actually some places a
clear one like this in good condition
I've seen them say you know wanting like
a lot of money like seventy eighty
dollars or whatever I don't think it's
quite worth that much but if you are
wanting one and there's a couple of
things that you should probably look out
for first of all go ahead and turn the
screen one more time look carefully at
the screen these game boys were
notorious well most game boys were but
uh for getting line scan lines broken
and when that happens there's no fixing
it really so to tell a scan lines broken
basically all you to look for it be
really simple to tell that there
basically be a line of dead pixels
whether they might be lighter or darker
whatever usually they just kind of just
blank if you see that there's no real
fixing it besides just taking out the
screen now will say that it's not
impossible if you would like you wanting
to do that it's not impossible to get
another string for it I can't tell you
off the top of my head how much they
cost but it's Emmy it's not a
deal-breaker but if you're buying one of
these definitely keep that in mind
because you know it could cost you a
decent amount of money to you know get
it fixed besides that you know it's the
standard stuff you know don't put lots
of scratches one kind of thing is that
you see here where you stick the game
cards in you can tell that those
connectors down they
if they look a little bit bad or
whatever I'm definitely want to watch
out this one is in really good condition
for being really quite old you see even
the stickers look pretty much brand new
which I just love this thing but Dad so
that's pretty much it this is the
Gameboy
play it loud model I really like it a
lot
screen makes it almost unplayable these
days you know if compared to these
really nice looking screens we have
these days but you know it's not a bad
game boy and you know if you like to
collect that kind of stuff like me I
mean I kind of remember you right to
your childhood this is a great way to go
anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
