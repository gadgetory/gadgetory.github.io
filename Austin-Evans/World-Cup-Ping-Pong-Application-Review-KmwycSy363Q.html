I am with a special in-depth application
review on a skywars application called
world cup ping-pong I got this about a
week ago or so and I gotta say I am very
impressed it is a lot of fun um the
first thing you'll notice absolutely
first thing you'll notice when you start
this is the graphics are just ridiculous
now of course it's not a whole lot all
they're all that you're looking at
obviously ping-pong paddles and a ping
pong table but still the graphics are
just ridiculous I mean they are they're
just insane um basically woke up ping
pong is you uh it's towards the top of
the page I think it's 8:00 right now on
the top paid leaderboards basically what
it is is just a real simple ping pong
application with some really nice 3d
graphics which this is pretty cool
because I actually really haven't seen
any ping pong applications in App Store
there probably are a few but nothing
nothing anywhere near as polished or fun
okay so uh basically woke up ping pong
it's got a lot of it's got a lot of
really good things going for it it's got
four modes
it's got tournament mode which is a very
difficult where basically you go up and
you know you have the semifinals and
quarterfinals and then the finals and
you go through and basically just you
know when there's Arcade Mode which is a
really fun mode basically you just go uh
basically you just practice against uh
instead of you're up against a person
but with that half the board is folded
up and you can there's little target
stuff here and you basically just got a
you just gotta aim and hit the targets
and you get points and you want that and
then there's head-to-head this is
probably as much as great as the other
parts of this application are head des
actually probably one of the cooler
parts of it because head-to-head
what is is it totally the the normal
thing is totally different basically
instead of doing it from like your you
know your point of view where you'd be
doing the ping pong you're actually
looking at
above and that's really cool because
that way two people can play on the same
device really easily and it works really
well and then there's practice mode
which is basically just kind of like
tournament mode except you go up against
the other the other team is and
basically the only difference is that
you're not actually in a tournament
you're just you know you can pick
whoever you want play one match that's
okay
and it generally seems to be a little
easier to what Cup ping-pong is
currently nine and since the AppStore
and there's also a lite version as well
yeah I definitely recommend coke go
check it out it's really cool between
really good graphics the the fun fun
gameplay I mean it's it's a lot of fun I
mean this is one of the was one of the
really good pickup play apps where
anytime you've got 30 seconds
pull out your iPhone or your iPod touch
pull it out play a game on it's no big
deal you have high scores and everything
which is fun try to be um it's a lot of
fun that's just about it
on it I I do recommend it um it's not
for everyone else of that is great as
the controls are really really great the
only problem is just that you're stumped
because basically what it is it's real
simple you just move your thumb forward
left right whatever and I and your ping
pong paddle goes forward and everything
which it's kind of interesting because
when you move it forward your your ping
pong paddle goes moves forward then you
move it left and right and all kinds of
like that um it they're really really
awesome controls the only problem I
really have with them is just that your
thumb kind gets a little tired from
holding it down because you never want
to let it out because then you know your
paddle just be sitting there and it be
really loose so that's I mean there's
nothing really wrong with this
application my only nice navin a problem
I only slight reservations it just just
it's just not for everyone to mean it's
ping pong you don't have to like ping
pong to want to get this because it's
still I mean it's it's simple it's it's
a pick up and play but it's a lot of fun
it's so polished the graphics are so
great
so it's I will say this is a game I like
but it's not for everyone so it's not
answers right now it's on sale I would
say if you think you might be interested
check out the lite version which has
just a small amount you could just do a
little bit
check out the lite version if you like
it it's a secure kind of application I
say 100 cent go for it if not that's
okay it's just not for everyone now real
