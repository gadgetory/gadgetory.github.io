reporting live from CES 2013 with do
bunching for foam so of course a bunch
has been around for desktops and also
announced TV last year but that look
going to be moving into the phone going
up against Android Windows Phone iOS all
that kind stuff so let's take a look so
the first thing you need to know is that
this is not Android this is not anything
else now I could scan or anything like
that this is an all new OS based on
Ubuntu now will be running on a couple
of phones so right now is running on the
Galaxy Nexus it will be available on new
phones starting late this year early
next year something like that the entire
interface is based around gestures so
for example if you want to go ahead and
go to your some of your favorite or
recent apps you write them from the left
you gonna pull up a context menu swipe
up from the bottom and from the top you
can pull down your notifications and
your swipe between battery and all that
kind of fun stuff so when using it a lot
of normal things you expect to see in
the phone really isn't there so for
example there's no real homescreen there
are multiple screens which for example
will have everything from your normal
apps so something that you may have
running to the App Store it'll all be on
the same page so just everything apps or
music or videos or anything like that so
it's an interesting idea
now as using it I kind of got the
impression that this is going to be
something that's gonna take a little bit
of a learning curve because it is so
different but I like a lot of this stuff
some of the gestures seem like it's
gonna be a little difficult like when
you're swiping left to right you might
open you know the context menu or this
or that so there's some things that
definitely think may need to get a
little bit tweaked but overall this
looks like really cool stuff anyway guys
it's gonna be about it for my hands on
Ubuntu for phones again it will be
available late this year early next year
it will be available as far as being
able to download for yourself on the
Galaxy Nexus and here in the next week
or two so if you guys want to go ahead
and try it for yourselves you definitely
can do that if you have a Galaxy Nexus
and again shipping devices would be
later this year or early next year you
guys enjoy definitely should leave this
video a thumbs up and if you're
interested in more CES 2013 content like
this be sure to subscribe anyway guys I
will catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
