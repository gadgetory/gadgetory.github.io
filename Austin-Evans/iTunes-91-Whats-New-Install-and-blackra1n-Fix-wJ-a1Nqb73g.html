today I'm here with a quick video
continuing Apple week it seems i'm going
to give you guys a quick video on itunes
9.1 it's just come out and i'm gonna go
ahead and tell you guys what it's about
as well as one to show you guys a fix
for black rain if you're going to use
black rain with itunes 9.1 there's a you
need to fix it i'm so going to go ahead
and go through all the stuff for you
guys and i keep you up to date anyway
let's get this one started ok guys so
before begin itunes 9.1 is not really
necessary it doesn't really bring in any
major features unless you're buying an
ipad and if you do have an ipad it does
give you some helpful features but if
you don't have an ipad pretty much the
only thing it does is it gives you just
a little bit of a genius support not
really all that necessary but if you do
want to update its not a big deal just
open up your iTunes it'll probably go
ahead and ask you to do it automatically
but if it doesn't like it doesn't for me
go ahead and open up help come down here
and hit click check for updates and then
get just a second and then the last nine
point one is available of course like I
said guys this is not necessary
whatsoever as if you don't have an iPad
you know I might want to skip it but if
you do have if you do plan on getting an
ipad to saturday or just wants to own
the latest version of itunes it's not a
big deal so go ahead and click download
like I'll do it right now and ya guys
will go ahead and cut this and come back
as soon as it's done downloading ok guys
so it just finished up it took a few
minutes and it's actually at a hundred
and over 100 megabytes but yeah it's all
installed so now no big deal um it
doesn't say that you need to do this but
go ahead trust me on this guys go ahead
and restart your computer ok so restart
your computer and I'll be right back as
soon as I do that ok guys so everything
is done I've just restarted and I'm on
itunes 9.1 as well you can see here in a
minute but it looks exactly the same
basically guys only thing I only thing I
can notice real quick is if you look
over here
the apps catalogue or the apps little
thing it now says apps not applications
that's the only thing I can notice off
the bat I'm sure as soon as you plug
your iPad and you know you'll be able to
see your iBooks and all that kind of
stuff but for a normal user like me this
is just what you're going to see okay so
obviously this is about it there's not a
whole lot of great stuff but if you want
if you're if you're jailbroken there's
one thing you'll probably want to do and
it is go ahead and get it to work with
blackrain currently black rain does not
work with itunes 9.1 but there's a fix
thanks to the great guy that i hate snow
we're going to go ahead and show you
guys but really fast turnaround they
went ahead and already fixed iTunes so
they will work with blackrain now if you
jailbreak this is a great thing to do
because not only will it allow you to
now jailbreak with blackrain will also
now allow you to go ahead and if you
have a tethered jailbreak the itunes
basically has killed off black rain so
just install this little patch which i'm
about to show you and a black rain will
work perfect and it's a good deal so
let's go ahead and ask if to show you
guys what I'm talking about okay guys so
I'm go ahead and shoot the link in the
description but basically just come to
this link it is from hi I hate snow and
then it will just ask you if you want to
download black breeze which is the name
of the program squad and hit save and
we've already got it up so all you gotta
do is just go ahead and click on it
click on it now and let's go ahead and
basically it's very simple all it says
is basically just have to click fix my
rain and it will basically solve the
issues with iTunes so we go ahead and
click it and then all we got to do is
find our black rain where the flat green
folder is let's go ahead and find it
here um where to put it area so just put
find wherever you have your black rain
program hit open and then now where do
you want to say which is going to be the
fixed I've black rain sorry so again you
can save in this folder of course you
save it wherever you like it's quite it
save and now it's been fixed so now all
it says is basically make sure to pick
the black rain that you just text I'm
which is an important deal because of
course you don't want to use the old one
so you might not want to delete the old
one
go ahead and just you know get it out of
the way and yeah so as soon as you do
that you're all done so you can go ahead
and exit out of this and that basically
you're done so I'm go ahead and open up
iTunes really quickly here and show you
guys now is obviously nothing's going to
work it really didn't change anything
about itunes itself all it changed was
the fact that now blackrain works so
guys if you having problems that that's
what you should do and lastly although
I've tested it some and it seems to be
working ok some people have had syncing
issues with 9.1 especially with if
you're jailbroken now as far as i know i
had actually i had the same issue as far
as i know all you have to do is just go
ahead and restart your computer after
you install itunes which is what i
showed you guys earlier go ahead do that
and it should fix everything if you're
still having problems no matter what it
is whether if it's black rang obviously
do what i just showed you and if but if
restarting it hasn't helped and you're
having any kind of problems of course
you can always go down grade back to
nine-point-oh or whichever version you
were on now i'm not going to show this
may be a lot of you guys need to but
really simply basically guys all you got
to do is go ahead and uninstall itunes
9.1 just go ahead and have it totally
wiped then all you got to do is i'll
have a link in the description where you
can download earlier versions of itunes
so go ahead and just find your original
version and do that it's really simple
guys I might make a tutorial but I don't
really think I need to you guys should
be able to figure it out so hopefully if
one of the fixing black rain doesn't
work or if your iTunes is still giving
you some problems that even after you
update it and restart your computer you
might want to try that out anyway guys
that's about it for itunes 9.1 of course
once students I pen comes that will see
a lot of the new features but that's
about it for now anyway guys if you have
any questions about it leave it in the
comments so yeah guys this question to
my today is going to be what do you guys
think about the next version of itunes
9.1 have you updated you having any
problems or anything like that go ahead
and just leave me in the comments anyway
