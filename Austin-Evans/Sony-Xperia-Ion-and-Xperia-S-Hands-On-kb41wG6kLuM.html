from CES 2012 at the sony booth and same
here with the demo of the sony xperia
ion in the xperia s so you want go out
and take it away alright so here we're
going to just demonstration the xperia
smart tags which is basically an NFC
technology accessory that's going to be
launching in the second quarter you can
see by the widget on the screen that
it's located now in the bedroom so for
instance maybe every time you go to the
office that you launch certain
applications maybe you turn your
bluetooth on you turn your Wi-Fi on you
launch your calendar so you can set each
individual tag for a specific action and
a specific location you can go through
the widget and actually change any name
of the tag and the actions that it
commits when you scan so it's one of the
features that we have on the Xperia S
just using the NFC I mean moving on to
the Xperia as itself it features a
bravia display which is the reality sony
bravia display its 4.3 inches it does
have a pretty unique display you can see
the clear acrylic bar on the bottom that
actually houses the antenna and there it
does have a 720p front-facing camera and
then a 12 megapixel rear facing camera
that features the Exmoor our sensor one
of the unique features about the phone
is the camera and the quick capture so
you pull your phone out of your pocket
you're at a black screen if you just
press and hold the camera key within 1.5
seconds it launches and takes a photo so
it's kind of a unique feature to have on
a on an android phone it does have a 3.5
audio jack does have hdmi out volume key
dedicated camera capture like I showed
you and then the micro USB this will be
launching into the first quarter
beginning of the second quarter on a
global launch and then we can move over
to I'll show you the Xperia ion so very
similar to the Xperia S it does feature
the bravia Reality Display this one is
actually sitting in what's called our
smart dock so as soon as you put it in
it'll connect to the TV via hdmi and
you'll see the carousel of items there
you can customize those when you play
the music the orbs respond so you get a
little bit more of a response there so
the Xperia S features a 1.5 dual-core
Qualcomm Snapdragon processor the RAM is
one gigabyte it has to
gigabyte's dedicated to to app storage
and then also it's 32 internal so there
is no expandable memory on the xperia as
the xperia ion on the other hand has 16
on board same specs as the S as far as
processor speed and ram but it does have
an expandable memory upto 32 gigabytes
again the difference is really this is
going to be an 80 mg exclusive it's
going to be an LTE device launching in
the second quarter it is a four point
six inch screen but it features the same
720p front-facing camera and a 12
megapixel camera in the back shoots
1080p video so like I said again that
one will be an AT&amp;amp;T exclusive and the
Xperia S will be coming out global
around the same time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
