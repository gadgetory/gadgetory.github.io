another state of jailbreak video so I've
got a couple things to go through today
so I just jumped straight on into it so
the first thing you want to talk about
is the upcoming iOS 4.2 point 1
untethered jailbreak i knows i'm sure a
lot of you guys know we already do have
a jailbreak for 4.2 point 1 i'm actually
using all right now it is redsnow if
you're instead we'll put an annotation
on the screen right now if you haven't
seen it the major problem with that
though is that it is a tethered
jailbreak for most devices now while
personally for me it hasn't been a big
deal i think i've restarted making you
know just a couple of times and need to
reno to rerun the jailbreak just a
couple of times however it definitely
can be annoying I don't blame you guys
at all if you're not interested in using
it so the good news is that there is
going to be an untethered version of
that same jailbreak it should be coming
out fairly soon now muscle nerd recently
posted a couple of videos showing it an
ipod touch 4th generation on 4.2
actually booting untethered so there's
definitely really good news now i do
know that they're actually working on
two possible methods of doing this so
which one they use and what time it's
all done I'm not 100 sure although I do
know that they are planning on having
out this month hopefully before
Christmas before the end of the year
that's what they're aiming for so
definitely go ahead and keep an eye out
for that I also keep you guys up to date
now on top of that there's also
something else not strictly jailbreaking
late a bit kind of similar there's
actually going to be cydia for the mac
so yeah guys it's actually going to be
kind of crazy there's actually going to
be a cydia store for the mag now
basically what this is all about is
because the mac is now getting the app
store or the mac app store it's going to
still be subject to all the same
restrictions that you know apple decides
to do so basically what the folks over
at City and they're actually have quite
a few people who are working at City and
now I believe they're actually gonna go
ahead and create their own platform for
the mac so now like can you go ahead and
get stuff from the mac app store but
there's going to be a competitor in
cydia kind of cool news i'll try to keep
you guys up to date although i don't
know exactly in any time tables or
anything like that but i do know that it
is in the works ok guys so the last
thing i do want to talk to you guys
about is I do have a new website so this
is not a huge deal I'd kind of well it's
not even been a secret I've been kind of
showing you know I've been linking it in
videos and talking about it but my new
website is state of jailbreak com if you
guys won't go ahead and check it out
will be in the description basically
it's a website that's totally the boat
jailbreaking a very similar to how my a
lot of these state of jailbreak videos
are about you can go ahead and take a
look at the site it will go ahead and I
have news we have a bunch of people
working at the site there's going to be
a guy we can't should go ahead and pick
your device your firmware it will give
you a tutorial so really really
foolproof way of gettin yourself
jailbroken no matter what firmware
device you have so if you guys
interested go ahead and be sure to check
it out and let me know what you think
anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
