seriously interesting little PC so this
is an Intel Haiti's Canyon nook and
inside no lies it's the very first time
that an Intel CPU has been paired with
an AMD GPU on the same chip but it was
also according to Intel the smallest VR
capable gaming PC that you can buy the
special sauce here is absolutely that
8th gen Core i7 processor with the
built-in Radeon rx Vega graphics now
it's hard to overstate how weird it is
to see Intel and AMD combining forces to
create a single chip now to be fair this
is sold by Intel this is an Intel nook
and you're going to be seeing this chip
and some other things mostly like
mainstream laptops
however the Nook is all about getting
you the maximum performance and a very
very small desktop form factor so Intel
sent this out for review you should keep
in mind that there are actually two
versions of this nook so this is the
higher-end 100 watt version however
there's also a 65 watt TDP Edition which
is going to be not only a couple hundred
dollars cheaper but you are going to be
cutting back on the CPU the GPU as well
as the clock speeds now at eight hundred
dollars it doesn't look too bad and this
guy at $1000 seems like a good deal on
paper however you have to keep in mind
that it's a nook so essentially you have
to supply metal your own memory but also
your own SSD as well as operating system
pop open the box and we're gonna see the
heli the awesome skull logo but also our
nook itself
wow that is legitimately really small so
while we were in San Francisco for the
launch event of this guy
we actually got to try a VR capable
backpack PC and I say backpack PC but is
literally one of these that was sewn
onto a motorcycle jacket I'm not usually
this stylish but what I've got here is a
motorcycle jacket which has not only the
Hades Canyon nook on it we also have a
mixed reality headset so with a battery
built into the jacket in theory I'll
actually be able to be totally portable
oh well yeah the trekking is not bad
it's really cool that this is a fully
untethered experience mean I I hit a
wall I guess that would not be good but
the idea is that I don't need any cables
connected no power nothing so it's
really cool about this setup is that
because the Nook is going to be so small
but we can actually really run it easily
on a battery and it allows me to be
completely and totally untethered I'm
gonna I'm gonna grab your gun grab a gun
shoot you another knife oh okay I just
got shot alright alright
yes the main idea here is that because
now I am I untethered with the PC and
the battery and I'm also using the mixed
reality headset so actually don't need
any sort of sensors around me I can kind
of freely walk around it feels pretty
good this is really cool I am
legitimately surprised with just how
good of an experience you're getting
with something that's literally in the
back of a motorcycle jacket the size of
this actually is pretty impressive so
for context I mean that's the size of my
hand so it's not really going to be all
that large but you're getting some
pretty serious power inside you can kind
of see that in the back because there
are a whole lot of heat sinks in this
guy so around front you're going to be
seeing not only an SD card reader but a
couple of USB 3.0 ports a front-facing
hdmi 2.0 USB 3.1 type c headphone jack
and then if you flip it around to the
other side you were going to be getting
a whole lot more including one more hdmi
2.0 four more USB three two gigabit
ethernet too many DisplayPort as well as
two Thunderbolt three ports inside the
box we're also getting the pretty large
power supply that is like the same size
as the Huq however that's actually going
to be pretty important with a computer
like this well let's talk it's only
going to be pulling around 100 watts or
so this is going to be fully
overclockable not on the CPU but also
the GPU as well as that HBM to memory
inside so having a little bit of extra
Headroom with the power supply is
definitely not a bad thing pop off the
six screws on the top of the knock and
inside we have access to the motherboard
so Intel sent this already pre-populated
with the memory as well as octane and a
full SSD but like I said earlier if you
pick up one of these you will have to
supply all of this yourself something
that's definitely not going to get old
is when I open Radeon settings and see
intel logos all over the place even the
whole thing is in blue but the good
thing is because we do have an T
graphics we do have full support for all
the stuff that you would expect
including free sync which this monitor
supports so right now we're running at
1080p at 144 frames per second speaking
of high frame rates we have rocket
League so here at 1080p on max settings
were easily able to get 144 frames per
second something like the Vega GPU
inside here is gonna have no problem
playing a lot of games at 1080p and as
you'll see in a second we can even crank
things up a little bit farther now as
everyone knows pub G's not exactly the
most optimized game in the world
however it actually runs pretty well
here so this is going to be a mixture
medium settings and 1080p but because we
have the high refresh rate monitor that
doesn't mean that we're getting
somewhere between 60 and 70 frames per
second in these lighter areas so it's
one of the big advantages of course I'm
playing on PC and especially with
something like this that does have that
free sync support as well as the high
refresh rate monitor is that you really
can get something that is going to be a
lot smoother than any kind of console so
she can sing that this is well smaller
than pretty much any console I think pop
G is a good example of a game that
actually runs really well here on the
Nook so no I'm not going to be blasting
4k and like crazy options or anything
but it's definitely going to be playable
with pretty much any kind of game that
you can pick up today of course no
gaming video in 2018 would be complete
without a little bit of Fortnight so
here at 1080p on epic settings we're
getting something a little bit closer to
40 to 50 frames per second but if you
really do want to get those super high
frame rates it's easy enough to just
prop the pop the settings down a little
bit and of course if you guys are
interested in a little bit more on
Fortnite I did recently do a video
talking about how it runs that
everything from like $1,000 game PC all
the way down to a two hundred dollar
laptop they're moving on to a game
that's going to be even more graphically
demanding it's Middle Earth shadow of
war now here at 1080p on medium settings
we're getting somewhere between 60 to 70
frames per second if you don't care
about the high frame rates as always you
can crank up the settings a little bit
but this is definitely going to be a
solid 1080p gaming box jump into the
benchmarks and in 3d mark the graphics
here are going to be a little bit lower
end than something like a GTX 1060
perfectly fine and obviously pretty
powerful for a system that's small but
it is going to be a little bit lower on
the CPU side it's going to split the
difference between something like a
gaming laptop which honestly is about
the same size as this as well as a full
6 core Core i5 or Core i7 on the desktop
look there's no getting around it this
thing is weird
the idea that you're getting an Intel
CPU with an D graphics inside of it and
all the drivers are sort of branded as
Intel like everything this is kind of
unusual about it however it kind of
works no yes it is going to be a bit
pricey at $1000 and of course you do
need to keep in mind that you're gonna
need to budget at least a couple hundred
dollars more for RAM as well as an SSD
and probably a Windows license however
this
something that's not really going to be
found anywhere else you're getting a ton
of power in a small package it supports
up to six video displays at the same
time you've got two Thunderbolt three
ports so in theory you can even connect
an external graphics card to this guy
and out of the box it does support
overclocking now if size doesn't matter
you can't build yourself a bigger more
powerful computer for less money but for
a lot of people I do think that the
small size is a legitimate selling point
I mean you could just stuff it behind
your monitor and never have to look at
it if you don't want so I'm curious what
do you guys think about the Haiti's
Canyon nook let me know in the comments
below and I will catch you on the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
