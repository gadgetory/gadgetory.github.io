pod and at three hundred dollars I have
exactly one question why does it exist
now no I'm not trying to say this is
some useless product or there's not
meant for anyone when you consider that
the world is filled with Amazon echoes
and Google homes that cost 40 or 50
dollars a $350 speaker that has Syrian
side that's a little bit of a hard sell
for most people so in classic Apple
fashion the unboxing is super simple
no giant stabbing knife needed so this
has come out today and it's a little bit
late I think this is originally supposed
to come out late last year but the idea
here is that this is a very high-end
very good sounding speaker that just
happens to have Siri you know I'll say
this looks really nice so it has this
fabric mesh all the way around it's nice
and soft it's definitely a little bit of
a different look although the power
cables built-in okay we also have
designed by Apple in California with
what I assume is yes a single Apple
sticker not a lot of accessories with a
3m $50 smart speaker but what really
matters is how does it actually sound
all right so 350 dollars a lot of money
but I will say there actually are some
nice things about the hardware so like I
was saying this fabric finish feels
pretty nice and it even comes across to
the power cable there's a little bit
tension to detail here but you won't
find what the whole pod is anything
besides this power cable so there's no
USB there's no Bluetooth there's not
even going to be any kind of aux input
which now just think about it apples
killed the headphone jack and everything
else
makes sense to kill it on the speakers
which you will see however is a little
tiny grid of LEDs that are below the
sort of frosted panel on the top so it's
kind of cool but there's not a proper
screen it's more for kind of giving you
notifications and sort of a little bit
of a colorful thing when series
listening like ear pods the setup is
going to be pretty straightforward so if
you have an iPhone and yes you're
probably gonna want to have a lot of
Apple products with a home pod to make
sense you can see a little setup icon
right here do that and it should sync
with the Apple ID one thing you probably
will want with the whole pod is Apple
music so it does support airplay so
things like Spotify and YouTube will
work however if you actually want it to
work properly just using your voice
you're going to want to use Apple music
they're very specific the home pod is
for people who have everything Apple
before we get started I'm gonna give
everyone a warning new words hey Siri
and hey Google about to be spoken many
many times you've been warned
sorry I can't search the web the main
reason to pick up the whole pod though
is from music and at least on paper this
sounds pretty good so you're getting
seven microphones that are paired up
with an Apple a8 chip which no they are
going to be listening for you to call
Siri but also it's going to be able to
tune the music for your specific room
now to do that it uses the total of
eight speakers inside this guy so there
are seven small tweeters they're spread
out all the way around to be able to
give you a full 360 sound there's also
going to be a single four inch subwoofer
so at this point if you have Apple music
you can just tell it to play a song
however if you're like me and you
Spotify you're gonna have to airplay it
from your phone so of course you're
gonna be listening to this on YouTube so
everything is going to be compressed we
do have a microphone here to hopefully
give you a decent idea of what this
sounds like in person
let's give it a try I will say one thing
this does a really good job of giving
you that full 360 sound no matter really
where this is placed your printer is
gonna hear the same thing around
something else is immediately apparent
this guy even though it's obviously a
very small speaker has a lot of things
it's also really apparent that they're
doing a good job of making sure that
doesn't bottom out so even though there
is a lot of base it's not really
overpowering the rest of the music I
mean when you crank it up to higher
volumes it stays surprisingly well put
together may guess 4-3 or $50 speaker
you hope it sounds pretty good but I'm
pretty impressed pause one thing I will
say that the microphones do a really
good job even when you're cranking it to
be able to actually hear you pretty well
however I think the best way of actually
being able to properly test how well
this sounds is put it up against this
biggest competitor
when I say biggest I mean biggest the
Google home max so you guys are not
familiar the Google home max is very
much the sort of Google competitor to
the home pod yes it is much larger but
there's a lot of things that are going
to be very similar so this has Google
assistant whereas this has Siri they
both have multiple speakers inside that
are going to be working together and
they both also do have a version of the
sort of room sensing technology that
will tune the sound based on what kind
of environment that your end there are
some advantages to the Google home
though including the fact that knowledge
is a have a USB port but it also
supports bluetooth as well as aux end so
you know if you're not living a 20-18
yet this has got you covered however the
price difference is kind of surprising
whereas the whole pod runs a pretty
expensive $350 Google will charge you
$400 for the Google home max a Google
Play Hotel California okay Hotel
California by Eagles
so at first glance they're actually
surprisingly different so the Google
home acts is louder kind of expected
with it being a much larger speaker
however it completely lacks that 360
directionality of the home pod so from
the side it's kind of okay but from the
front it is very very loud now the home
pod
even though it's a little less bass II I
think does a much better job of making
sure that you really hear all the
different instruments there's a lot of
separation between the two but let's do
a few other songs and kind of fully
actually test to see what these guys
sound like although to be fair Hotel
California is the only song anyone
actually needs to listen to but I guess
I can play like two or three other songs
you really want me to some weird reason
he google play like whoa from logic like
whoa by logic sure playing on Spotify
okay so after listening to these both
for a little while my impressions are
pretty firm this sounds good it's decent
in a vacuum but there's a lot of bass
and it is very directional the whole
pods there's just so much more
separation you're all the different
instruments you hear the different
vocals like everything is very sort of
layered whereas this it feels a little
bit flat in comparison it's a good
speaker but there's no doubt the whole
pod sounds phenomenal however that's
just one piece of the puzzle so sure if
you're just going to buy one of these
for pure audio quality you can stop
watching now but I think what a lot of
people are interested in is how the
actual assistance on these guys work in
Google when did the Olympics started
competitions at the Pyeongchang 2018
Olympic Winter Games began on Wednesday
February 7th 2018 and ends on Sunday
February 25th 2018 PST hey Siri when did
the Olympics start the 2018 Winter
Olympics will be held February 9th to
the 25th in Pyeongchang South Korea hey
Google how many cups in 42 gallons 42 US
liquid gallons equals 672 US customary
cups hey Siri how many cups are in 42
gallons 42 gallons is 672 cups something
I'm noticing is that Siri is a little
bit more Curt and it gives you like much
shorter answers where Google wants to
give you all the details hey Google
what's the news
here's the latest news
from NPR news now at 3:00 p.m. today
live from NPR news Siri what's the news
here's the latest news from NPR hey
Google Play the latest episode of reply
all okay playing the latest episode of
reply all
number 42 blind spot rebroadcast this
episode of reply oh hey Siri play the
latest episode of reply all
sorry I couldn't finally apply all in
your music if you have an Apple musical
subscription podcast hey Google what do
you think about Siri full respect being
an assistant is hard work
hey Siri what do you think about Google
assistant I think the acquisition of
information and intelligence by human
beings through virtual assistants is a
very good thing Google's like serious
great I think the acquisition of
information by human-like beings is
excellent alright so what have we
learned well I think that they're
actually fairly evenly matched as far as
the assistant side so for the basic
stuff they're gonna be very similar for
things like turning on and off your
lights or kind of figuring out traffic
or the basic kind of things and I think
as you get to be a little bit more
advanced I would give this slight edge
to Google assistant I think a lot of
people have sort of been complaining
about Siri at least based on this
they're not that far off now as far as
the music set goes it's definitely a
home pod win but for me if you're not
gonna be really serious about music I
think it's hard to recommend either of
these so my house alright like using the
Google home minis as well as a standard
Google home they're much less expensive
and unless you're really serious about
the music they sound totally fine
especially if you're really focused on
the assistant side so should the Apple
home pod exist in 2018 yeah it's
actually not bad so be fair you need to
be totally into the Apple ecosystem so
I'm talking Apple music iPhones Macs the
whole thing but if you are this is a
really really good sounding speaker so
I'm curious what do you guys actually
think about home pod let me know in the
comments below and I won't catch you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
