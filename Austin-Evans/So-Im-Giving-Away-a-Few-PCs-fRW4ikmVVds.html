about time for a giveaway you guys have
been absolutely killing it lately with
the support so we've had videos on the
YouTube trending page on reddit we even
had one video that did over a million
views in a month so I think it's about
time to give back so you may have caught
my last video where I introduced the
photon 2.0 so this is a five hundred
dollar gaming PC build and I'm really
proud of it
for the money you were getting a lot of
performance since I built just a couple
gaming pcs over the years I think it's
only fair to give away the photon 2.0 to
you guys and to top it all off it's
built by me blindness wasn't available
however when I got my friends from
Canada involved they wanted to up the
ante by sponsoring an even bigger
giveaway
sorry giving away maybe two pcs three
pcs how many pcs we give it away Ken 5:5
you heard him right
five photon 2.0 or going to be given
away to you guys now this part I
actually didn't run by Candide so sorry
in advance guys however if we completely
crush the app I'm talking we get a
hundred thousand people to download it
we're gonna give away 10 pcs and I know
that's a lot 100,000 people is a lot of
people however get your friends get your
grandmas involved it's about to be lit
with grandmas so candid is a super clean
looking app it's all about giving you an
anonymous voice to talk about pretty
much whatever you want so it can be
something simple like tech I'm sure a
couple you guys might be interested
however there are lots of other topics
out there whether it's about cars
politics sports science even Pokemon
which I hear is super popular with the
kids these days so now I think it's only
fair to share some of the gems of candid
nothing is on fire fires on things so I
should really deep I'm hedging opening
up a bag full of chips only to fine all
the chips replaced with a bunch of i7
6700 KS
all individually wrapped in foam and
anti-static that is an incredibly
specific thing to imagine so if you want
to get in on the fun and the giveaway
action go download candid and join the
official hey guys group because that's
also how you get into the giveaway so to
enter make sure that you are subscribed
here on the YouTube channel and also
make sure to go follow over on instagram
at austin not duncan then in the hey
guys group on candid leave a post
letting me know what you would do if you
win the photon 2.0 and make sure to
include your Instagram handle so I can
contact you if you win now we are giving
away five computers regardless however
like I said if we get a hundred thousand
people to join the hey guys candid group
we're giving away 10 full Photon 2.0 so
remember hash tag lit with grandmas so
good luck to you guys and a huge shout
out to Candide for making this craziness
happen anyway I hope you enjoyed and I
will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
