of the biggest tech companies in the
world however after a few dark years of
Windows Phone they've actually merged
sort of better than ever and they
actually have a full lineup of Android
phones and some non Android phones but
of course the question is why does Nokia
exist in 2018 so of course we have to
start with the Nokia 3310 now if this
looks familiar to you we actually did an
entire video on the 3310 pretty recently
the sort of gist of it is is that the
original 3310 was an absolute legend and
this is sort of a modern remake with
some updated internals and sort of a
more importantly some retro style so
sure for a lot of people this is going
to be a novelty rather than a phone that
you're actually going to want to use
everyday however this is only one of a
surprisingly large amount of phones that
Nokia sells today we're things get a
little more interesting is with the
Nokia - now this takes a huge step all
the way up to running Android and with
only a hundred dollar price tag there's
a lot to like here ok let's go open and
the first thing we see is the phone
itself now something that sort of
separates this from a lot of other super
budget phones is actually going to be
the build around back you're going to
see it's got a plastic shell over around
the actual edges and the frame it's
going to be made out of aluminum that
makes a surprisingly big difference to
the actual feel in the hand it does feel
a lot nicer than the hundred dollar
price tag would suggest but if we pop
off that back panel and what you'll find
is not only a pair of SIM card slots but
you're also going to be getting microsd
expandable 'ti and you can use all three
of those at the same time something else
you're going to find here is
unfortunately an unremovable battery but
it's going to be a massive 4100 milliamp
hours so that is a very big battery for
pretty much any phone for context most
Android flagship store somewhere into
the 3,500 milliamp hour range when you
consider that this is $100 budget phone
with hundred dollar budget specs that
battery is going to make this thing last
forever what you're getting here is a
pretty solid five inch 720p display now
what's really impressive about this is
it actually gets surprisingly bright I
mean yeah of course you see $100 phone
you're gonna think that it's not going
to be super cutting-edge but for most
people you're going to be totally fine
with this screen no at this point this
is all sounding a little bit too good to
be true and where things start to fall
apart is with the specs so inside this
guy's powered by a snap
2:12 processor and that is not exactly
going to be fast it is going to be
quad-core but it's only going to be
using cortex a7 cores which are
old-school and very very slow making
things a lot worse is the idea this only
has one gigabyte of RAM now it's going
to be kind of usable that's going to be
fine
for a lot of things but the issue is
that multitasking is pretty much going
to be a no-go
and apps are going to be constantly
being ejected out of the memory the good
thing is this is running on Android
7.1.1 nougat and they will be getting an
update to Oreo soon and for the most
part the software is going to be nice
and clean there's really no extra bloat
where it's going to be pretty much as
you would expect to find on something
like a pixel around back it's rocking an
8 megapixel camera now if we take a look
here you know what that's actually not
going to be that bad I mean it's going
to be a little bit low on dynamic range
and it's still going to be a touch Saabs
$400 what you're getting here is going
to be solid build quality pretty crazy
battery life at the expense of a little
bit of performance however luckily Nokia
also has a range of other devices
available including the Nokia 6 open
this guy up it's immediately apparent
that this is going to be a larger phone
so this guy oh wow you actually can tell
immediately is going to be a little bit
more of a premium build so where's the
Nokia to have a little bit of plastic on
the back how do you actually open this
as I was saying the build quality is
going to be a little bit more premium
here so as opposed to having just an
aluminum chassis what we're getting here
is a full unibody design with actual
aluminum on the back now the only thing
that kind of jumps out to me a little
bit and honestly that's because I've
been looking at so many flagships lately
is that the bezels are going to be a
little bit large but that does leave
room for the actual haptic buttons on
the bottom as well as you're going to be
getting an earpiece which doubles as a
stereo speaker along with well that a
little tiny one on the bottom actually
doesn't sound that great so you can tell
it is using both speakers but it sounds
a little bit muffled it's not terrible
mind you but it just doesn't sound very
clear which is a little bit odd for dual
speakers inside you're going to be
getting an octa-core Snapdragon 430
processor now in addition to having
double the cores of the Nokia 2 they're
also going to be cortex a53 based which
is going to be significantly faster
while still giving you decent battery
life now the rest of the specs are going
to be with three gigs of RAM as well
64 gigs of storage however one of the
only things that's going to start Lee
let this phone down is the idea that
only has a 3000 milliamp hour battery
and with a spread like that it's
actually not going to be that bad but is
definitely not going to last anywhere
near as long as the nokia 2 with its
massive four thousand milliamp hour
battery
however just like little kid 2 we are
going to be getting a super-clean build
of Android and yet again it's going to
be running new get with a future upgrade
to Oreo it also is in the same camera
app but it actually looks like this is a
little bit of a better sensor so as
opposed to the 8 megapixel sensor on the
nokia 2 this guy is rocking 16
megapixels yeah that's a lot better
especially the white balance is much
more accurate oh yeah no that is going
to be a big big change might not be the
greatest camera on a smartphone you've
ever seen but for the price I'm not
complaining that's actually looking
pretty nice it might not be super
exciting but this is a fairly decent
looking mid-range device especially
considering that there's a new version
coming out soon might be worth checking
out I've got to say no kids actually
been doing a pretty good job so far all
these phones are decent if not actually
pretty solid however the next and the
newest phone I had to take a look at
today is the Nokia 7 plus so this is a
brand new device in Europe it should
cost around 400 euros or once it comes
to the state summer in the neighborhood
of about 450 dollars
it'll makes this interesting is that not
only doesn't have Android 8.0 Oreo out
of the box but it's also going to be an
Android one device meaning that's going
to get two years of guaranteed Android
updates as well as that same fairly
stock build of Android that's going to
come pre-installed and that's actually
something that Nokia is going to be
doing across the board with their new
phones so everything above the Nokia 2
is going to be Android 1 certified so if
you want to make sure that you're going
to be getting the latest updates that's
actually going to be a big win pop this
guy open and we're getting something
that should look a lot more modern even
though these all look almost identical
when you actually whoa this is copper
yo that looks really cool I didn't
realize so you're looking at it straight
on from the back it's mostly black but
especially when you flip it over to the
side it's got this sort of brushed
copper look and that even comes across
to little things like around the camera
which also has a little Zeiss logo oh
man this is this is a really good
looking phone I can't get over just how
nice this feels in the hand so because
it's got that sort of copper Ridge
around it it actually does sort of
settle really nicely and on top of that
what we're going to be getting is a 6
inch 2
with a 18 by 9 aspect ratio so it's not
going to be bezel-less but it looks a
little bit nicer and we're also going to
be getting a full 2160 by 1080
resolution around back you're going to
be finding not only the fingerprint
sensor but also your dual cameras it's
like a lot of higher-end flagships one
is going to be the wide-angle camera and
one is going to be the telephoto option
with a 2x zoom alright so if I take a
picture of Ken on the wide-angle camera
and then zoom into 2x yeah like most of
these the telephoto camera doesn't look
quite as nice but it should be available
as should be kind of helpful to have
especially when you want to get a little
bit of a different perspective on things
interestingly this also has a 16
megapixel camera up front actually it's
going to be higher megapixel than the
rear and dude that's not that at all
actually there's a little bit of depth
of field there to spec wise you're going
to be getting something that's going to
be basically on par with what you'd
expect at the price point a snapdragon
660 that being said it actually does
perform pretty well and it is going to
be backed up with 4 gigs of RAM as well
as 64 gigs of storage so we're going to
be getting only a single speaker unlike
the dual speaker on the Nokia 6 but
thankfully it actually does sound better
and even more thankfully this still does
have the headphone jack so you know so
this guy is going to be rocking a 38
hundred million power cell which while
not quite on par with the Nokia 2 is
still going to be on the upper end of
what you would find on most flagships
especially considering these slightly
lower end internals in this guy if the
Nokia 7 plus does come to the US around
$450 it's actually going to be a really
hard phone to beat I'm sure you're going
to be giving up a little bit of
performance but at this kind of price
you're getting nice build quality a
solid camera good screen I mean really
the only thing I can complain about is
it doesn't have stereo speakers and even
then the speaker itself here sounds
pretty good so nokia has seen a massive
turnaround and of course some people are
going to miss the old Windows Phone days
but now that they're making Android
devices they're actually doing a really
good job of making decent mid-range as
well as budget devices that have solid
build quality good battery life and just
have a nice clean build of Android
that's actually going to get updates so
should they exist in 2018 yeah of course
they should they're doing some really
cool stuff I've got to say I'm actually
happy that I got to give a good answer
on one of these
hey guys hope you enjoyed this video if
