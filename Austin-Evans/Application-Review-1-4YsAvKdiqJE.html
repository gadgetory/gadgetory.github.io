watching my very first application
review which is going to be focused on a
few first-person shooters I've found
available in the App Store let's get
this one started
my first up I'll be reviewing today is
called I tge fps ite it's less than an
actual game and it's more of a demo kind
of to show off what kind of graphics or
you could put on the iPhone iPod Touch
let me tell you this they are just
really just great now basically there
are three fields and there's no
deathmatch sandstorm and castle interior
Oh
basically there's nothing to do on any
of them except for the snow deathmatch
which there's one enemy who walks around
in a circle and you get to shoot him but
which is not a much fun but it kind of
you can kind of see the controls and
everything one thing that really sticks
out lower the graphics they're
phenomenal you get a third-person view
in addition to the normal first-person
view which shows you and you're quite
detailed character in the game and you
also have a crossbow to fire the problem
is though is it they're really some bad
framerate issues it's it's not terrible
it's it's still playable but it you'll
notice it will kind of get annoying
anyway the three fields or snow
deathmatch which you basically just walk
around in a very small ghost courtyard
covered in snow and you shoot at a
random guy who's walking around
seemingly for no reason
there's sandstorm which shows a really
nice really nice bus basically just
desert in the middle of nowhere and you
walk and walk it really shows you just
how huge the field is and then castle
interior which is a really just small
little place in a little field inside of
castle there's I mean little absolute
nothing to do there i qg e is a
definitely a very good app graphic wise
i would recommend going going to pick it
up at least try it once the next app
i'll be reviewing is half dead half dead
this is a one of the more popular
third-person
first person sorry first person shooters
in that store and that being said it's
not that popular but uh just just simply
because the first person shooters for
the iPhone iPod Touch just kind of seem
to be little laggy and the controls are
nowhere near as good you might find on
Xbox or Playstation but that being said
half dead does a very good job at trying
and at the moment and I it's been a
dollar for a very long time so I don't
think it'll be long but at for the
moment it's free and the I'd say it
instantly go out and go out there and
download it right now you can listen the
rest of the review later but this is a
definitely a really good one for free
half did basically it's no no menu
screen I think you open launched it
there's a loading screen and you start
now the first thing you'll see is some
really just well model graphics I mean
they're just some of them are just great
basically the heck did the whole
principle is I'm supposed on it looks
like a cargo ship and you walk around
and you're supposed to shoot people and
it yeah it's really simple it's a it's
more definitely more of a game than I
tge
but you'll you'll find it's not this
this isn't something you'll want to play
a lot either
there is high scores and does time you
see how long can last basically it's
really simple um you just walk around
and just you just the top of this ship
and it's very very nice because you will
see some really just great graphics
you'll see there's some there's some
people now there's no behind the
shoulder view like an iit-jee but to be
honest you really don't need it it's
it's pretty good and basically you just
walk around and they shoot people
once you basically how most first-person
shooters go this one I will definitely
say is very difficult I mean you'll if
you can last two or three minutes you if
you want you can stay at the place where
you spawn but if this is your own action
you get killed very quickly and
but then again I mean if you're getting
shot but it's got decent controls
uh nothing hasn't special it really
doesn't use tilt you've got you've got
four buttons on your right you got two
buttons on your left and you have a
shoot button above it's not the most
intuitive but it gets the job done okay
I suppose as with all the first-person
shooters I've ever seen in any way it
has framerate issues but they're not as
nearly as bad as an IT GE and it's
something you'll notice first time you
start playing it but once you get into
it it's really not going to be a factor
as you walk around it's really a
fantastic detail the the fighter plane
you see well when you're when you first
open up it is it is just fantastically
model half dad it has some problems
though it's just you you can't last but
thirty seconds in it before you get shot
and it's just it's a good game and for
free I definitely recommend it but I
really wouldn't spend a dollar on it my
last first-person shooter i'm going to
review today is called dead man's
dungeon dead man's dungeon features
probably the best full-featured
experience in a first-person shooter for
the iphone ipod touch it it like all the
others it's it's pretty bear compared to
what you might find on xbox or
playstation but it it's good for the
iphone it there's no story there's no
anything basically you start out you're
a supposedly a prison guard guarding the
dead man's dungeon and it's what one
really unique feature about is that
there are gates all over the place that
you open up all you have to walk up to
it walk up to them and they open and
that's where the prisoners they randomly
oh they're not prisoners they're
skeletons but they randomly appear and
but uh the the object of the game or
basically is to last longest you can
you'll go around you'll be shooting the
skeletons there are different kinds
there are there's one just skeleton
there's one with
or there's one with flaming arrow
there's probably couple more them I'm
not thinking of right now but it's very
good my favorite part of it at first the
first release of it
the controls were bad that it uses tilt
which is one thing I really think the
other two first-person shooters I just
reviewed should use and basically all
there is to use control wise not is just
you tilt you tilt it which it's nicely
nice nicely used you've got a small
control pad on your left now the key to
this this is one of the downfalls but it
still BC others basically put your thumb
in the middle of it and then slide it
slightly forward sideways or whatever it
first you won't be able to move you'll
probably will die but as soon as you
realize how to use it it really is the
best and on your right you'll see you're
holding the gun basically just tap the
little trigger icon no problem at all
the the graphics on this are well
they're not quite is is great as the
others the all the rendering the the
cell doors when you open them that I
mean they're just fantastic you see some
of the prisoners I mean the prisoner uh
I'm sure I say the barracks or the cells
on I'm sorry the cells are really nicely
done the bunk beds the sinks everything
the skeletons they're not not so great
but I mean you know it's not bad
and and when you shoot them it kind of
the graphics aren't that great you'll
see like like some read something like
blood or whatever and you see I don't I
don't know it's just kind of messy but
one good really really interesting thing
I thought was that you actually bullet
holes when you shoot like if you shoot a
wall whatever you'll see bullet holes
which I just thought that was really
cool but uh dead man's dungeon it - it
definitely has the best gameplay because
you can actually actually that your
high-score is done between your score
which is how many dumb zombie 's how
many skeletons you take down and each
different kind give you different points
and then you get gems which are the
these red gems that appear in the
or cells and you go and you pick them up
a really good thing is that you can pick
up different weapons now this is a you
start out with a pistol and you can get
what looks like to be an mp5 and then a
shotgun through as you walk around and
this is one thing it's good in a way
because you have different weapons and
you can you can swap and it's something
you will run have ammo on I mean Jaap
swap the thing is it's hard to find ammo
for them and you'll definitely notice
their differences between them obviously
there would be but I don't know it adds
a nice element but one thing the game
one needs is more ammo because it
nothing is worse than walking around you
got a bunch of them on your tail and
you'll have any ammo and that basically
just kills you until you can get some
more but one thing I will have to know
is that on the first if you have a first
generation iPod Touch which uses a
slightly slower processor than the
second generation and the iPhone but
both iPhones as far as I know you'll
have you'll definitely experience more
lag than you would otherwise
um I don't have a first generation iPod
touch myself so I don't really know how
bad it is I've heard from a friend of
mine who says it's not that great so if
you do you might want to consider it and
the app is $0.99
but uh if you're if you wanting
something just to take a look at the
graphics on see how oh that's good
whatever and I'd probably go with AI tge
or definitely pick up half debt if it's
still free if you want a game with
actually good replay value if you wanna
it's got a nice soundtrack everything
you would probably want to go with dead
man statute those possibilities that
developers are working on more levels
there there were there were lots of
different things and it's definitely uh
you don't pay a dollar but you
definitely get what you pay for because
uh it's a lot of fun well that's just
about it
I hope you enjoyed thanks for watching
see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
