review of the Nintendo DSi um so guys a
lot of people question should I buy a
DSi right now obviously the DSi XL just
came out a few months ago and of course
the 3ds or whatever they're going to
call it will be coming out probably
about for the end of the year but guys I
still think there is a decent market for
DSi so I'll go ahead and give you guys a
full review of it and let you know what
I think so the first thing is going to
be the build quality and the size and
all that so guys it is a pretty decent
sized thing if you ever had a DS Lite it
is almost the exact same size I believe
it's just very slightly longer and a bit
thinner but let me go ahead and give you
guys a walk through the device so on the
front there zoom in just a little bit
here so on the front you have your three
power buttons um is for Wi-Fi for
charging and then your battery indicator
you have your camera your point three
megapixel I'll cover the cameras in a
minute and there's a little light which
lights up when this camera is active on
the back of the device you see that
there's nothing there's no Gameboy
Advance cartridge which may or may not
be a big deal and then you have your
headphone and slash microphone on this
side you have your SD card and you also
have your stylus so you go ahead and
just put your stylus right in there no
big deal then you go ahead and you can
put in an SD card just like so you flip
it over on the back you'll find the l
and r buttons I'm guys I like these
buttons actually they're pretty clicky
as you can see they do protrude just a
little bit that's not a big deal and go
ahead and charge it and then go ahead
and put your games in and then you also
have a place for lanyards or something
like that and coming over here is
nothing except just a volume um guys I
should do like this volume it is like a
rocker on a cell phone um it works
pretty good ok guys so now go ahead and
give you guys a brief tour of this
software so in case you didn't know the
DSi is a lot different than the standard
DS Lite it's got a new menu system so
you can see guys here we can go ahead
and scroll through like this orange
really simply to go ahead and just
scroll like this and just take the
stylus there's a lot of different
options
and it works pretty well on the top
screen you go ahead and take care
pictures and you can go ahead and have
them display sort of like a wallpaper
it's pretty good and then at any point
while you're on the screen you hit the
left or right triggers and it will go
ahead and jump into the camera
application so if you want to jump into
your DSi and take a picture it works I'm
guys so there are a few different things
in the DS there is but the two main
things I'm going to be covering today
are the camera and the Photos app the
guys the camera works pretty well you
can go ahead and take pictures with
either the inside or outside camera um
they're pretty low resolution as you
guys can see right here I mean they're
okay if there's no other camera around
you know if this is what you got in your
pocket you can't a snap a couple decent
pictures but in general it's not that
great of a camera you can of course do
ahead and do some editing some kind of
cool editing effects you can pull and
zoom and all kinds of stuff with
pictures rafidhi on them there's a lot
of kind of neat stuff it's mostly a
novelty now the second thing is going to
be the sound app now guys the sound is
well it's you know it's nothing amazing
basically you go ahead and record a clip
and then you can wet and have you know
somebody you say something and then it
can you speed it up slow down raise the
pitch two different things like that
again it's a novelty but it's kind of
something fun to mess with now guys the
DSi also does have the DSi where shop as
well as the DSi browser I won't get
really get too in-depth into any of
these the DSi where is very similar to
if you've used the Wii where shop on the
Wii
go ahead and pick up a few titles to be
honest guys there's not a whole lot
there there's a few things and you can
go ahead and buy it depending on how
many points it is it's pretty decent it
also has a browser the browser is okay
but I really don't like it just because
it is very very slow and to be honest if
you're not on site with a mobile if you
don't have a website that has a mobile
browser then forget it I mean the DSi is
very very very
when you're loading you can use the
touchscreen to pan and zoom which is
kinda nice but the speed totally makes
useless in my opinion however guys there
are a couple things I think I should
mention one thing is that Wi-Fi is kind
of a little bit odd
it does not support high encryption
networks or at least it doesn't fully
support them now guys you can go ahead
with the latest 1.4 update you can go
ahead and do like web browsing over you
know like normal encrypted networks but
a lot of games don't support multiplayer
over highly encrypted networks so guys
that's a little bit of us hitting this
if you don't have your Wi-Fi encrypted
which I hope you do but if you don't
you'll be okay that's definitely an
annoying thing another thing guys is
battery life battery life is not great
on this it's not as good as the DS Lite
which was excellent um you can go ahead
and probably get seven to eight hours of
play you know on maybe like medium
brightness and you know with Wi-Fi off
you know you crank up Wi-Fi you know you
turn up the screen brightness it'll not
probably little bit of off fat I found
it to be decent just not fantastic
now guys while we're still talking about
the hardware and how the system works
I'm going to tell you guys for you I am
NOT a hundred percent really happy with
the build quality if you guys look along
this top line all along here you see
that it's there's a lot more of a gaps
just activation tonight there's a lot
more of a gap on the left side and the
that on the right side this holds true
oh my god that holds true if you guys
can tell right there as it goes it's ok
it's ok all sudden there's a little bit
of a gap now guys to be honest this does
not affect gameplay and I don't really
think I mean the DES does feel pretty
sturdy go ahead and yell twist it and
you know you know keeping your pocket
stop so I wouldn't really really worry
about that but just little things like
that just kind of Nohr me a bit now guys
the graphics on the DSi are basically
identical to the standard DS if you've
ever played in ideas or des light the
games are not going to look any
different the screen is this both
screens are slightly bigger on the DSi
and it is true that the DSi has four
times the RAM and a much faster
processor that that is not really
translating to normal games that said
though guys the DSi is pretty decent so
let me go ahead and show you guys just a
little bit here as you can see here
there's a pretty decent effects the
is pokemon soul silver go ahead and show
you guys just a little short bit of
gameplay now this is a really fun game
by the way so we can go ahead and say
that the 3d effects are pretty decent so
we can go ahead and go out here and I
mean there are some definitely some
pretty cool games see this is this is a
pretty good thing and of course the guys
the DS is capable of much better
graphics in this for example you know
there's a Call of Duty I mean get called
the I believe there's a couple different
Call of Duty's on here so I mean it is
full capable full 3d but I think why the
main part is is that it really does work
well for the RPGs okay guys so it's time
for the wrap-up um to be honest guys I
don't really recommend the DSi
I mean it's there's a lot of really good
things it's nice to have cameras
although they are pretty low quality and
you know there are a few nice things
such as you know being able to browse
the Internet slightly not really that
well you know download stuff in the DSi
where shop but Jimmy asked guys it's not
if you've never had a DS before this
might be a decent choice especially if
you have an earlier DS there's really no
reason to upgrade especially guys
because the main reason is that the 3ds
is coming now of course there is the DSi
XL of course which is hundreds and
entacle basically the only major
difference is that it's just bigger this
doesn't have any new features you know
obviously the case is a little bit
different but as the main reason that I
don't recommend the DSi is because the
3ds is coming on the 3ds should have
three D it it is confirmed that will be
a hundred cent backwards combat
compatible with all your normal DS games
so guys that alone I mean that'd be like
buying an Xbox right before the Xbox 360
came out I mean sure the Xbox might have
been nice but the Xbox 360 should play
most of the games you know and in this
case the 3ds will definitely play all of
your DS games so guys the the DSi maybe
if you got it for cheap or you know you
maybe just want to collect it like I do
then that might be a pretty good deal
but until then I highly recommend guys
go ahead and wait but then the next week
or two the 3ds should be announced and
it's going to look like it's going to be
a pretty solid upgrade</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
