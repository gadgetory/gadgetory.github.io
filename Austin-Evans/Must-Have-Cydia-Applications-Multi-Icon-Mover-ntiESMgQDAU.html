today I'm here with yet another in my
series of must-haves City application
videos with a really really nice tweak
called multi icon looper this one is
dead simple and yet is I cannot believe
that's never been thought of before
basically what allows you to do is move
multiple icons at a time sounds simple
but anyone who knows you pat you when
you have a million icons all over your
springboard it's so annoying to have to
take one here and there and it just
takes forever this one is dead simple
basically once you hook up install it
it's very simple then you're ready to go
so let's reclaim give you guys a demo of
it so let's say you want to move some
icons now normally hold on it and so I
want to move it now I take this one and
move over here and you know stuff like
that but it's going it back but with
multi icon mover I can move as me as I
want across so now let's go ahead and
pick a few ones so with multi icon mover
just tap it you see the little check
mark so let's move if you got acontece
grab that one this one this one this one
okay so now we want move these four
icons so let's still have to manually
dragon let's flip find whatever page we
want to bring along let's put on this
page I have to is it the home button
boom okay they are now it's not perfect
because you do have to make sure that
there are enough spaces so you see only
have two spaces left here let's go over
here and let's try to move these two so
let's grab these to actually hang on
that's crap 3 i'm sorry subscribe 3 now
when you try to move 3 only two will fit
you'll see that third is still there so
you do have to be sure that you know you
have plenty of plenty of space on each
page but still it's a very very cool
thing like what here i could take as
many as i want so you guys know the demo
let's grab these five let's go across
here and then when you want to X add
this mode just tap the home button and
there you go and obviously all icons
stay there and you could to go so yeah
guys that was just
really quick video this is totally a
basic simple tweak but it's great I
really love it um basically you know
just go ahead download it is in the
bigboss repo so you shouldn't you should
have it and yeah and enjoy not having
gonna do them single anymore anyway
