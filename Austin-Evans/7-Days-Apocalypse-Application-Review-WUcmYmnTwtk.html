a special in-depth application review on
an app called
7 days apocalypse this one's looking
like a really cool one you guys will
definitely want to check it out do you
like anything like AI Dracula this is
gonna be a really app that you want to
check out so let's get this one started
first thing that comes to mind when
talking about seven days apocalypse is I
Dracula which is likely the best zombie
shooting game in the AppStore between
the controls which are a perfect mirror
of Dracula to the gameplay which is also
uncannily similar to even some of the
dynamics such as the various weapons and
health that you pick up as you go first
glance seven days looks like an absolute
ripoff by Dracula it's the only major
difference being the rough unnamed
vampire hunter has been replaced by a
woman named Akemi who for some reason is
always covered in blood however once you
get playing the game you will really
realize that seven days has a lot going
for it when you begin the game you'll
notice there are two most choose from
history and survival survival plays very
similarly to I Dracula in that you have
no gold whatsoever to survive as long as
you can along you go the higher levels
you will reach but the higher levels
come more zombies and ghosts so the
difficulty increases is you continue on
you'll find that making it much past
level 3 or so generally which lasts a
few minutes will begin to be very very
challenging as in I Dracula you will
pick up various weapons such as the
laser blaster and chainsaw to company
your dual pistols with unlimited
ammunition that you will have it start
while survival is entertaining it would
be much more so if the difficulty was
turned down a bit so you could last
while the way it is it's fun but I mean
I would prefer if you could last at
least a few minutes now the real reason
that you would buy 7 days instead of or
in addition to our Dracula is the
history mode which is basically story
mode as the name suggests the story
consists of seven days or seven levels
the premise of the story is very simple
an unknown virus called the S virus is
killing the human population and turning
people into what else flesh-eating
zombies your job is to assist a
scientist to save the world from the
zombie apocalypse yeah
seeing it done that one before but hey
it's a zombie game throughout the week
you do this in different ways such as
you escort her across the courtyard
while defending off zombies you collect
bio containers that are spread out you
erratic
hey you have to eradicate the ghosts
there's a lot of different things like
that and I've gotta say I really think
that's a nice touch having all kinds of
different things to actually do and say
just randomly shooting and with each
passing day come the game just gets more
and more difficult one feature that I
always love is in games is an autosave
feature which will save your game
whether you whenever you close the app
and just let you jump right back in
whenever you want this is something I
wish all that's really had because I
can't tell you how many times I've had
to go jump up and do something and I
don't want to leave my ipod running for
30 45 minutes whatever I've gotta do
something so I'll do hit the home button
shut it off toss my pocket don't worry
about it and as soon as I get some free
time pull back out and just jump right
back in one other thing that 7-days has
is a really cool hard techno techno what
am I thinking Rock a techno I don't know
what it's got a really good rock theme
it's perfect perfect for a zombie for a
zombie game and I actually got to say
it's got some really good music
obviously nothing that you would
recognize but it's got some good music
you'll really get your pumping for the
game along with the entertaining and
definitely very challenging I mean by
the time you get to day six I'm stuck on
day six I'll tell you that I can't get
past it history mode contains the other
major reason to buy the game graphics
well in I Dracula there are some
admittedly very nice pixel based
graphics 7-days is entirely rendered in
extremely nice-looking 3d there are no
friend rate issues at all and in general
the game just looks fantastic
the standard view is an overhead view
which shows you and your surroundings
quite nicely there's also a third-person
view that looks fantastic for the
iDevices the graphics really shine in
this viewpoint everything that was
crisply rendered and again there are no
framerate issues whatsoever compared to
many of the first and third person
shooters available in the App Store this
is just fantastic however sadly just
this use this view is largely useless
the controls that work quite well when
you can see all around you just totally
fall apart when you have no idea what's
coming behind you that's probably my
biggest sync complaint of this game is
that the fantastic looking third-person
view real
just isn't playable the developers were
to create a new control scheme for the
third person view some days would
instantly become probably one of my top
favorite applications I won't want to
know that occasionally the controls have
glitched out on me which is just about
all I've seen in the way of bugs so far
exiting the applications restarting it
fixed the problem pretty simply which is
decent until the next update comes out
so it that's definitely not a
deal-breaker by any stretch of the
imagination it's just kind of sometimes
when you get into it you'll start moving
in the controls will freeze so you're
just walking one way you're shooting one
way you can't really do anything about
it
but uh yeah like I said that's something
to be fixed in the next update so it's
no big deal
overall seven days meshes the
fantastically successful formula by
Dracula with some really impressive 3d
graphics a decent story mode with some
real potential in the form of the
third-person view point there's a major
update in the on the way that will
include online high scores more levels
missions weapons items more monsters
just basically everything apparently all
this new content will be enough for name
change which will be called it we called
seven days apocalypse mutilation for
zombie huh and it's looking like it
might be take be able to take on the
role of an expansion pack very few
application the App Store really
capitalize on this and they just mostly
just small little updates so the fact
that seven days is going to and of
course the updates free that really
impresses me along with the graphics
will come a price increase so you should
definitely consider picking up seven
days now while it's still $0.99 be sure
