here with a gaming demo of the iPhone 5
the first game is horn an RPG powered by
the Unreal Engine graphics here
fantastic as are the production values
with full voice acting and an
interesting story I'll be quiet for a
minute and let the gameplay speak for
itself
have you seen the hi Python Emperor's
personal Squire I seem to have misplaced
him say what are you why do you look
strange you are pink and rubbery it's
it's nothing never mind
next we have Infinity Blade 2 an
excellent looking game from the iPhone
4s doors great on the iPhone 5 this is a
hack and slash with excellent looking
cutscenes and some of the best graphics
we'll find on a mobile device
excuse my terrible skills and enjoy the
game
if you're a fan of racing games Real
Racing 2 is a must as a much more
detailed game than most of the arcade
style racers in the App Store and get
full cockpit views and excellent
graphics with solid controls and even
features like damage modeling
moving on we have Angry Birds space this
is hardly a cutting-edge game however
it's still fun for a quick play now and
again well it's not optimized for the
larger display you can see it still
works just fine I don't think any gaming
roundup will be complete without
Minecraft Pocket Edition as the mobile
port for the excellent PC game minecraft
is all about allowing you to build
worlds in a giant sandbox while controls
are a bit if you sometimes and it's not
quite up for the same level of features
as the main version it's still well
worth the download these are just a few
of the many awesome games on iOS the
work just fine on the iPhone 5 if you
enjoy be sure to leave this video a
thumbs up and if you're interested in
more iPhone 5 videos like this be sure
