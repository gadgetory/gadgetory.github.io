here with my top 5 features of the Xbox
one so Microsoft had an event today
where they showed up the next-generation
Xbox and of course I'll be doing a lot
more videos on it next month at e3 but
for now let's take a look at the top 5
features of the brand-new Xbox one and
number five we have connect 2 which
actually might be useful now so unlike
with the Xbox 360 where Kinect was an
add-on that you had to go pay $100 for
and then it'll only work on some games
and then even then might be not all that
well connect 2 will be coming with every
single Xbox one and on top of that
there's also a lot of really cool
features with it for starters it'll be
much better at motion tracking thanks to
the new 1080p camera so here of course
it's going to be still tracking your
arms and legs and all that kind of stuff
it's actually going to be much more
precise as well as giving you some
really cool features like actually being
able to track your heartbeat which well
not probably all that useful it's
definitely something very cool that it
can just see with a camera on top of
that since it does have a microphone and
camera obviously you can actually use it
to navigate around your operating system
for example you can just say Xbox on and
the Kinect will actually turn on the
Xbox as well as some other cool things
like being able to switch between
applications for example going between a
game and a movie all that kind of stuff
and number four we have the new Xbox one
controller now I ain't a huge fan of the
current 360 controller it is in my
opinion one of the best controllers
period so the best praise I can give to
Microsoft is that they didn't screw it
up with the one so overall when you take
a look at it it looks very similar
pretty much every button and every
little surface has been tweaked a little
bit but for the most part it's going to
be very familiar if you have used an
Xbox 360 controller there are some neat
little tricks for example the triggers
themselves will now vibrate as well as
there's no more giant ugly hump on the
back of the controller so everyone is
going to be rechargeable so everything
is built into the controller so finally
we don't have to worry about using
double-a batteries any more
number three is live TV integration so
the Xbox one has an HDMI IN port which
means that you can take something like
your cable box plug it into your Xbox
and then be able to watch live TV
without having to switch inputs and all
that kind of stuff so this is something
cool if you want to save time for
example you can go between playing a
game and watching live TV in a split
second but on top of that it also allows
you to do cool things for example you
can watch NFL as well as have your
fantasy foot
on one screen and who knows they might
even actually allow you to use it as a
DVR number two is the new software so
it's definitely seeing a major change
from the Xbox 360 dashboard in fact
there's definitely a lot of inspiration
taken from Windows 8 and that also
includes some of the features so for
example now you can actually have
multiple apps on a screen at a time so
for example you could have a Skype call
running on one side while being able to
browse the web or you'd be watching a
movie and then go over to Internet
Explorer there's actually a lot of
really cool things that you can do now
with multiple apps on a single screen if
this sounds familiar you're right as the
Xbox one is partially based on Windows 8
no no before you get your hopes up you
won't be able to play PC games on your
Xbox one however what this does mean is
that we should see more high quality
games on both the Xbox as well as PC is
the Xbox is basically gaming PC hardware
internally and since Windows is pretty
much Windows wherever you go that means
that for a PC port to go over to the
Xbox shouldn't be any kind of big deal
and same thing in Reverse any kind of
Xbox game should in theory be able to be
ported over to the PC very nicely the
number one feature on the Xbox one is
power put simply this thing absolutely
destroys the Xbox 360 with an 8 core
processor as well as 8 gigabytes of RAM
it is in theory over 10 times faster now
there's also lots of other cool tech
goodies including the fact that it now
does have a blu-ray drive which is kind
of late but you definitely will be able
to play both games as well as movies on
it as well as other cool features
including of course Wi-Fi a 500 gigabyte
hard drive as well as USB 3.0 support we
only saw a few games running on the Xbox
one including the new Call of Duty
ghosts the new Forza 5 as well as quite
a few new ea sports games however
concerning the e3 is only a couple weeks
away I definitely expect to see a lot
more games shut off there especially
considering that the new Xbox will
actually be launching by the end of this
year so now it's your turn what do you
guys think about the brand new Xbox one
and how do you think it's going to stack
up to the new Playstation 4 definitely
be sure to let me know what you think in
the comments below if you're interested
in more feel free to check out my top 5
features of the PlayStation 4 and if you
enjoyed definitely be sure to leave this
video a thumbs up and be sure to
subscribe for more videos like this
including lots more coverage of the new
Xbox one anyway guys I will catch you
next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
