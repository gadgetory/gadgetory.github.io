here the comparison and speed test
between the Nexus 10 iPad 4 Nexus 7 and
iPad Mini to start off with we have
Geekbench which is a test that focuses
on CPU performance and everything from
phones to desktops with prices ranging
between $200 and $500 this might seem
like an odd comparison but the results
are a bit surprising the Nexus 10 pulls
in a score of 2775 from recent laptops
and the iPad 4 and Nexus 7 both pulling
very solid scores the iPad Mini with its
older Apple a5 finishes a distant last
next we have SunSpider which is a
javascript benchmark this makes the CPU
performance with a test of the browser
as well this sets as much to do with
Android versus iOS but it's still
perfectly valid comparison here the
combination of the Apple a6x in Safari I
do very well with the iPad for clearing
a score of just 839 followed by the
Nexus 10 and iPad Mini at around 1400
and finally the Nexus 7 with a score of
1690 to test gaming performance we have
Gio benchmark which simulates a very
graphically intense game with extremely
high resolution screens on the Nexus 10
and iPad 4 they're at a disadvantage but
as you can see they both keep up quite
well
the clear winner is the iPad 4 however
with an average of 42 frames per second
compared to 26 on the Nexus 1024 on the
iPad Mini and 14 on the Nexus 7 I also
ran the benchmark in an off screen 1080p
mode to take screen size as the equation
in the iPad 4 dominated again this time
followed more closely by the Nexus 10
and still well ahead of the smaller
tablets the Nexus 7 and iPad Mini both
do fairly well considering older the
Nexus 10 has the most powerful processor
in any tablet or phone I've ever tested
where the iPad has the best GPU both are
very important in getting a great tablet
experience so this one has to end in a
draw if you're interested I have more
Nexus 10 coverage here and if you
enjoyed don't forget to hit up that like

I'll catch you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
