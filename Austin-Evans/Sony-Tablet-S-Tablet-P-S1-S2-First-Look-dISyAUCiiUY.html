unveiled their first major foray into
the tablet market the s-1 and s2 both
tablets are powered by Android 3.0
honeycomb and have some very unique
features the first is the s-1 which has
a design similar to a folded magazine
giving it a very thin profile up until
the top of the device where it tapers
out nicely it sports the NVIDIA Tegra 2
chipset a nine point four inch 1280 by
800 touchscreen display as well as both
front and rear facing cameras the s1
also will be a PlayStation certified
tablet making it a big player in the
gaming market and allowing you to play a
wide variety of PlayStation 1 games the
s-1 has a fairly heavily customized UI
on top of honeycomb dubbed the quick and
smooth UI along with a Swift browser
that helps speed up browsing on slower
connections
the second tablet is the s2 which
features a folding dual screen design
with a pair of 5.5 inch 1024 by 480
touchscreen displays this looks to be a
very interesting compromise between the
smaller 7-inch tablet for Portability
and a larger 10-inch tablet for more
screen real estate the s2 seems to be a
bit more focused on reading with a UI
that draws inspiration from a book with
the dual screen layout being utilized
well for email reading more it also
shares the same Tegra 2 chip as well as
a pair of cameras both the s-1 and s2
have Wi-Fi connectivity
along with 3G and 4G support although on
what carriers remains to be seen
overall these look like a pair of
impressive tablets out of Sony and they
will be available worldwide this autumn
so what do you think
do you like the s-1 the dual screen s2
or neither be sure to let me know in the
