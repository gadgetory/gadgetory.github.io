today we're going to go over one of the
most exciting things to come out of
Apple since the iPhone the Apple tablet
there's a huge amount of information
about it so let's go ahead and get this
one started the first piece of evidence
is the date January 26th Financial Times
has uncovered that Apple has rented out
the same center that they usually use
for events including the last one in
September that announced the new iPod
Nano this looks perfect for a tablet
announcement as well as for the
announcement that the MacBook Pro is
getting the Core i5 and i7 processors
the next evidence is about the name of
the tablet isolate the past few days has
contained a huge amount of evidence that
Apple has been working on the name they
owned the isolate com domain among many
others and they have trademarked the
isolate name under a shell company while
this doesn't mean that it will be called
the isolate for certain it certainly
sounds very catchy and it's the most
likely bet considering the few if any of
the other names make sense now let's
take a look at exactly what the tablet
is going to be all about first of all I
guess that the tablet uses a smallish
solid-state tribe
perhaps a 64 gigabyte one the processor
could be one of two things either an
Intel Atom or a custom chip an atom
makes sense given that it already is in
use in other tablets such as the jew-jew
and that OS 10 should that be the
operating system the tablet uses
supports the atom
however the atom is underpowered
especially for a tablet that could be
quite expensive my bet would be on a
custom chip entirely tailor-made to the
isolate a short time ago Apple bought
chip maker PA semi who would certainly
be able to create a processor for the
this would also fit in nicely with
apples like of controlling the entire
package from operating system to all the
aspects of the hardware it can the
operating system is a really hard detail
to pen down most of the evidence points
towards this isolate blending a custom
version of the iPhone OS which of course
is a version of OS 10 supposedly app
developers have been told to make sure
that their apps aren't entirely
dependent on the screen size of the
iPhone &amp;amp; iPod Touch which could mean
that either the isolate runs a modified
version of iPhone OS or that it contains
an iPhone OS emulator personally I think
the idea that it runs full OS 10 that
has been modified to work on a tablet
makes more sense but there's no telling
what we'll see price has been a huge
question mark of the entire deal nearly
everyone agrees that it will be between
the most expensive iPhone $300 and the
cheapest macbook $1,000 if you take a
look at the only other tablet in the
space the juju and its price of $500
then you'll see that the Apple tablet
will almost certainly be quite a bit
more expensive than that I won't get
into any of the complicated and most
likely wrong guesswork for now except to
say that the 700 to 800 dollar price
point seems the most likely there are a
lot of other rumors about the specific
features in the tablet one in particular
about a patent Apple applied for a while
ago about a multi-touch tactile keyboard
that would allow the screen to actually
physically rise and lower at different
times this would be perfect for a
keyboard because it would allow the
screen to be flat usually but it could
morph into a keyboard when you needed it
very cool tech that would if really
possible certainly go a long ways in
making the tablet easy to type on so
that's about it there's a lot of rumors
and speculation about the tablet right
now and they really are reaching fever
pitch if everything goes according to
plan then likely we will
the tablet make its debut next month
with it being released for sale a few
months after that so what do you guys
think are you excited about the idea of
an Apple tablet or do you think it's
just going to be too expensive please
leave your thoughts in the comments
because I would love to hear what you
think anyway thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
