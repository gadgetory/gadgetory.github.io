of d3 live so today we're going to be
talking about the Amazon tablet which
we've been hearing about a lot for the
past couple of months now personally
I've been will excite about this there
are a lot of really really cool things
about this tablet I think gonna make it
a really really big success so let's go
ahead and start with what we do know so
recently a blogger / TechCrunch was able
to get their hands on the amazon kindle
tablet which that I don't think the name
is quite official yet nothing i'm called
the kindle tablet or just an amazon
kindle or whatever but where's unique
like the kindle tablet to keep it simple
they actually got their hands on the
7-inch variety which should be available
probably october november something like
that in the next couple of months or so
so there's a lot to like about this
tablet the number one thing that i have
to mention is it's the price it's going
to be only two hundred fifty dollars now
turn fifty dollars is kind of in the
range of you know it's like an impulse
purchase it's not like something like an
iPad where 500 bucks that's kind of a
lot of money but as far as you know
couple hundred otters it's like most
times like no big deal you can go pick
that up and that's a big thing I think
that's where tablets need to be now some
of the others features about this is it
is going to run Android about a kind of
customized version so kind of similar to
the grid OS guys took a look at that
last month they announced there's gonna
be a towel on the phone it's gonna be
based on Android but it's going to be
more more in depth in the skin it's
actually going to be like a real rework
of the OS well it seems like Amazon's
going to be doing the exact same thing
for the kindle tablet so what this means
is that it's not going to really look
anything like standard Android it will
still use a lot of the same Android
applications so it will have the Amazon
App Store Amazon music of course have
access to buying stuff on Amazon on so
it's going to be really focused on
getting you to be on amazon stuff all
the time which obvious is the reason why
they would do it some of the other
things about the amazon towel is that
will most likely have a single core
processor i think it's a little bit of a
disappointment i think in this kind of
day we really need dual-core just across
the board for you know anything
especially in tablet however there are
some decent single core processors and
considering only page 150 dollars i can
think of worse things they could have
cut now like i said earlier it will be a
7-inch tablet now they are working on a
10-inch variety however i think a lot of
that's going to depend on what how well
the 7-inch does you know if the 7-inch
two theorems sells well of all kind of
stuff that i think
definitely go ahead with the 10-inch but
if it flops and the one buys it they
probably won't but I'm unlikely we will
be seeing a 10-inch variety which will
almost definitely will be dual core
probably sometime earlier next year so
that's pretty much all we know about it
so far like I said most likely will be
launched in sometime in November and of
course it will be exclusive to the
amazon com just like the kindle was
released for the first a little bit see
I'm not looking forward I think it could
be a major major game changer I mean the
nook color is a pretty good tablet but
it's not it's just only slowly starting
to get some tablet features mean when it
first launched it was an e-reader it
really didn't do a whole lot of you know
apps not constant and while slowly
getting there i think if amazon can
really push it go hey we have this new
tablet it reads books it does internet
and all that kind of stuff but it also
has access to all our amazon services i
really think they could do a great job
anyway guys for the second segment of d3
live i'll be taking live questions from
the chat as always every episode III
live is foamed from the live audience
we've got a ton of people in the room
right now so squad and just take a
couple of questions what version of
Android will the tab will be running
three point oh uh it's going to be
running most likely an older version of
Android what they did was they forked it
or lady just kind of took a verte older
version so i believe it was version 2.1
although it may be version 2.2 and but
what it does is they've done some major
customization so unlike like a normal
Android tablet that you know gets
updated to 3.0 and 3.1 I like some of
stuff instead it's just going to be like
if they decide to bring some stuff over
but I wouldn't even be surprised they
call it like Amazon tablet OS one point
0 or something like that so it's kind of
to them but it's not going to be running
a specific version of Android say
heavily customized version of probably
2.1 or 2.2 one of those to do i think
android will ever be ported to ipad yeah
actually um on that note that's actually
a great question on they eventually been
getting fairly close to getting Android
and Linux up on the iPad so now I wasn't
sure the timeline thing like that but I
do know that they were being so getting
successful part of the I droid team on
getting on Linux at least in once they
get legs Android is doing not too far
behind are up and running on the iphone
for the ipod touch 4 and the ipad 1 so
of course it could be a lot longer but
it is being worked on it wouldn't be
surprised if we do see it in the next
something but yes pretty good news is it
going to have lots of internal memory
like 64 gigabytes actually no on the
contrary because it's cheap and it's
going to be mostly cloud-based the
Amazon tablet will probably have more
like eight gigs because like I said a
lot it's going to be focused on you know
for example cloud player so all your
music should be up in the cloud kindle
them you know the books don't really
take up a lot of space yeah it'll most
likely be an eight gig or perhaps a
little bit less valid absolutely
probably eight gigabytes of storage on
the amazon kindle tablet guy say that a
lot more before i could actually get
used to it don't think PCOS will be in
the cloud in the next ten years you know
having an OS in the cloud I don't know
it's the one thing with the cloud the
problem is is that internet is not
ubiquitous everywhere and you know in
places like Korea and Japan where the
Internet is almost everywhere that's not
a huge problem but especially here in
United States and some parts of Europe
and Australia Canada you know it's
you're gonna have problems that for one
your latency is gonna be a little low so
running out full PCOS in the cloud it
would be really really laggy on top of
that you obviously of course need to be
connected to the Internet at all times
if you have any kind of like bandwidth
restrictions like you have like you know
a cap of 100 gigabytes a month to
something like that yeah that's gay
office is going to eat up so um I don't
know about PCOS based totally in the
cloud in the next 10 years certainly
parts of the OS are going up so for
example like you know itunes and you
know media players that kind of stuff
indeed even some games are being you
know moved to the cloud but as far as
the core of the OS you know it's pretty
much everything I don't see it happening
in the next 10 years I think maybe a
little bit beyond that bout Seattle is
happening anytime soon um screen
resolution same as the galaxy tab 10.1
and then actually one hundred percent
sure I do know that it will be a 7-inch
tablet and it perhaps it may be a little
bit of a lower screen resolution but
typically with that it's probably going
to be something like 1024 x 600 or
something like that anyway guys it's
going to be about it for this episode of
d3 live of course you guys interested in
