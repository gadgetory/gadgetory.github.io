plus you're getting an improved camera
better internals but at the cost of
looking pretty much identical to the
galaxy s 8 in fact the s9 looks so much
like the Galaxy s8 that this is a Galaxy
s8 but I bet you couldn't tell on the
other hand we have the iPhone 10 now at
$1000 this is one of the most expensive
smartphone ever made
and thankfully Samsung didn't take the
bait and let the Galaxy S 9 priced at a
cool 700 to $20.00 my real question
though is can such a minor update
actually compete with the iPhone one
look and you can see that Apple and
Samsung are going after the bezel is
trend in two very different ways so with
the s9 the bezels are small but
noticeable on the top and bottom of the
display move over to the iPhone and
they're basically no Buzzle to be seen
except for the knotch to be honest I
don't have a huge preference so the
iPhone 10 notch doesn't bother me that
much but it does rob you of a little bit
of screen real estate which can be
important when you're talking about a
smart phone now it's the s9 you're
really not going to be losing anything
but also wax that sort of distinctive
look of the iPhone 10 it's kind of up to
you honestly I think the cleaner look of
the s9 does it for me though well the s9
looks very similar to the s8 Samsung did
make some minor tweaks that you can
notice once you actually get it in your
hand so one of the big ones is that
there's a little bit more of a well
defined edge on the actual frame of the
phone so especially when you consider
that this is an all-glass phone with
sort of curved glass front and back it's
nice to have just a little bit more grip
on it although to be fair it's still
going to be a very slippery phone and
you're probably going to want either a
bumper case or skin on this guy
in contrast the iPhone well it just
doesn't look quite as impressive now
sure you're getting the knotch but the
completely flat panel just doesn't look
as cool as the s9 however instead of
opting for aluminum like Apple always
does instead they upgraded this year to
stainless steel I've gotta say it works
and adds some welcome heft to the design
which when you combine it with the all
glass metal build really does make this
feel like a very premium product which
is good when you're spending $1,000 on a
phone no one minor downside is that
because it is going to be very polished
stainless steel it's really easy to get
minor scuffs on it but thankfully it's
not going to be that difficult to buff
these out to the surprise of exactly no
one these phones have a lot in common
first of which is water resistance while
the iPhone 10 is ip67 rated the gallon
9 is slightly better at ip68 know what
this really means is that if you say go
get tossed in a pool or something with
your phone it's going to be fine but for
the most part this is a really nice
thing to have I'm just putting this much
money on a smartphone it should pretty
much be a standard thing on flagships
these days you're also getting an almost
identical stereo speaker setup so both
phones have a single bottom firing
speaker as well as a second front firing
speakers that doubles as the earpiece
now it might not look all that
impressive with these both sound a lot
better than just a single speaker it's
hard to pick a clear winner here the s9
does get a bit louder especially once
you enable the Atmos setting however
it's at the expense of a little bit of
clarity personally I think the iPhone 10
sounds a little bit richer but is going
to be quieter at the end of the day
though it is really splitting hairs both
of these phones sound pretty solid one
area where the s9 definitely wins though
is what the headphone jack
it actually has one considering that
this is basically a dead feature in
flagship phones today big props to
Samsung for actually keeping it around
no no it's not going to be some crazy
high end high fied act like you're going
to be getting in the LGP 30 but it
sounds totally fine I think a lot of
people are gonna appreciate having this
around in 2018 another advantage of the
s9 is the fingerprint sensor now not
only is it back this year but unlike on
the s8 whereas in this awkward spot
beside the camera where you couldn't
really reach it it was easy to miss this
year it's going to be below the camera
and slightly raised from the body of the
phone making it a lot easier to feel
without actually having to go look at
the back of your phone every time it's
just as fast as you would expect well I
like how fast face ID is on the iPhone
10 there's definitely times where I
prefer having an actual fingerprint
sensor like on the s9 that being said
the s9 does have its own version of base
ID so it's kind of similar to the setup
in last year's Galaxy Note 8 in which it
uses not only facial recognition but
also iris scanning and it kind of works
it's reasonably quick but still nowhere
near as fast as face ID on the iPhone 10
and it's also not going to be the most
secure thing in the world this setup on
the no date has been easily fooled a
million times whereas at least on the
iPhone you're getting something that's
going to be reasonably secure that shows
and Samsung's confidence in their own
system where Apple is perfectly happy to
allow you to use face ID to unlock apps
or even pay for things with Apple pay
Samsung conveniently asks for your
fingerprint instead of facial
recognition when you're actually using
samsung pay move around to the display
there's no question these are the two
best panels on a smartphone you can buy
today I have the larger galaxy s 9 plus
here which is rocking the 6.2 inch
display but if you opt for the standard
s 9 you're getting a 5.8 inch panel
which is the same size as what you're
getting on the iPhone 10 both are very
similar which makes sense as Samsung is
the one who makes AMOLED panels for both
Apple as well as Samsung themselves now
what you're getting here is supposedly a
slightly brighter screen on the s9
they're claiming about 15 percent
brighter than on the s8 but in real use
especially once you actually tweak some
of the color profiles on the s9 they are
almost identical looking inside things
get a little bit more interesting where
the iPhone 10 is rocking the Apple a 11
Bionic chip here in the United States
you're going to be getting a Galaxy S 9
with that new Snapdragon 845 or for the
rest of the world it's going to be
powered by a Samsung Exynos 9810
processor jump in the Geekbench and
you're going to see a nice performance
uplift over the Galaxy s8 however
especially when you compare it to what
you're getting in the iPhone 10 it's
just not even going to be close single
thread performance especially is going
to be much much faster on the iPhone yes
sure benchmarks aren't always
representative of what you're going to
be seeing in the real world but when you
look at Geekbench and you see something
like nearly twice the single-threaded
performance that is something that you
are definitely going to notice in my
experience the only phone that comes
close is the pixel 2 and that's entirely
based on Google's awesome optimization
job which makes sense considering that
they make Android now a big part of me
feels like if Samsung was a little bit
lighter with their skin things would be
a little bit of a different story I will
say though that unlike in previous years
it feels like Samsung actually paid some
real attention into polishing up the
software so a lot of little design
inconsistencies that you used to find in
Galaxy software's nowhere to be found
and the Galaxy launcher itself is pretty
solid but when you dedicate an entire
Hardware button as well as the left side
of your home screen to Bixby it features
that I would argue most people find less
useful than Google assistance which is
also pre-installed on the phone that
it's hard to argue that Samsung has
really stepped that far away from their
old ways of slapping bloatware on the
phone that comes across to the bizarre
inclusion of a lot of weird Android apps
that are sort of duplicated thanks to
Samsung so things like the Samsung email
client or calendar or even the Samsung
browser all feel really out of date in
2018 now sure there's nothing stopping
you from jumping into the Play Store and
downloading
stock Android versions of these apps but
just why do they exist like I mean
seriously why move over to the iPhone 10
and while iOS 11 might not be all that
new or exciting right now thankfully
over the last few months they have
polished up a lot of the bugs and it
feels like a much more cohesive set up
now sure there are still some weird
design choices like hiding your
notifications as well as your control
center behind two very similar swipes
based on where you are on the top of the
display but it's really hard to look at
the s 9 in the iPhone 10 and not be
impressed with just how much Apple is
able to do with this guy and how Samsung
just hasn't really been able to keep up
its close but the performance especially
the Polish is just top-notch on the
iPhone get it
top notch something else the iPhone has
the advantage with is battery life the
galaxy s 9 is pretty solid it would
usually last me through a full day
however with the iPhone I regularly use
it for the entire day and still put it
on the charger with 30 or 40% left it is
a big step up over previous generation
well most of the upgrades on the s9 have
been fairly minor the biggest one is
definitely with the camera most obvious
change is the addition of a telephoto
camera on the galaxy s 9 plus nicely
matching what you're able to get on the
iPhone 10 this isn't going to be on the
standard galaxy s 9 but it's a solid
addition not only is it going to be nice
to get that extra focal length but in my
opinion I think it actually looks a
little bit sharper than what you're
getting on that iPhone 10 the real star
of the show though is that new main
camera which is going to be shared with
both the S 9 and the s 9 plus it's an
all new 12 megapixel sensor that has
stacked DRAM on the chip and now I does
this speed things up but also enable
some pretty cool new feature this
enables a new 960 frames per second slow
motion mode albeit in 720p no yes it's
going to be a little bit soft and you
need a lot of light to actually make
this look good but if you can time it
right it can look really really nice
low-light performance has also been
improved thanks to the addition of a new
mechanical aperture now Anneli is this
going to be pretty much a first on a
major smartphone but it gives you two
options for standard photos you're
getting an app 2.4 aperture did you get
into a low-light situation it can open
up all the way to Apple 1.5 F 2.4 is
what the camera will default to and it
looks good it's a nice blend between
getting a nice bit of sharpness as well
as actually letting enough light into
the camera however if you get into a
really low light situation or you switch
over to pro mode and manually enable it
you can't
it up to at full f 1.5 the results are
really impressive with that wide
aperture as well as Samsung's new multi
shot processing which will allow up to
eight foods to be taken and combined
into one to reduce noise it looks really
really good now yes you're going to be
giving up a little bit of sharpness here
for the most part there's really not
much to complain about you get this guy
in low-light it's gonna look awesome now
for outdoor shots Samsung does get a
little bit over aggressive especially
when you look at the saturation as well
as the sharpness but it compares really
well to the iPhone 10 especially if you
don't want to edit your photos the
front-facing camera on the galaxy s 9 is
pretty wide and it still it's nice right
Ken
in comparison the iPhone 10 front-facing
camera is fine but it's not quite as
wide angle which is especially for
selfies is really helpful where things
get a little bit more one-sided is with
AR emoji versus an emoji so this is what
a emoji looks like on the galaxy s 9
kind of creepy right so essentially this
is very similar to what you're getting
on an emoji on the iPhone except that's
just not as well done mostly thanks to
the lack of face tracking as well as
it's just going to be a little
unsettling especially when you make your
own like I did and this is what an an
emoji on the iPhone 10 looks like now no
I can't make my own custom emoji as you
can see especially with the front-facing
camera and the face ID tech to actually
track my face the level of detail here
is really impressive much much more so
than a our emoji the galaxy s 9 is the
best smartphone that Samsung has ever
built it takes a lot of what was great
about the s8 and subtly improves it in
some ways and majorly improves it when
it comes to the camera it also does this
at a significantly cheaper price where
the S 9 comes in at seven hundred twenty
dollars unlocked the iPhone 10 at $1000
is definitely going to hurt the wallet
that said the days of the galaxy being
the obvious answer if you want to get a
high-end Android flagship are definitely
over the pixel to still has a lot of
advantages over the s9 even though it's
going to be a little bit older when you
compare it to the iPhone 10 what you're
getting on that phone if you can of
course overlook the eye-watering ly
expensive price is excellent performance
good battery life polish software it
really is a solid package the galaxy s 9
is a great phone but for me it just
can't quite match the iPhone 10 so I'm
curious what do you guys think about the
s9 versus the iPhone 10 I'm sure they're
going to be lots of wonderful
it's all about the merits of each phone
and not fanboys or arguing at all let me
know in the comments below and I will
catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
