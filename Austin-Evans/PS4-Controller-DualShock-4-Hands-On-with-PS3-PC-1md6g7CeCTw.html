hands on the new DualShock 4 controller
for the PlayStation 4 so let's take a
look first of all the new controller is
absolutely the biggest departure from
the original design since the
PlayStation 1 it's bigger in most
dimensions compared to the ps3
controller which always felt a little
small to me but it has kept a similar
layout with more grippy thumb sticks and
a tweak to d-pad you'll find a new
touchpad in the center of the controller
like on the Vita which doubles as a
click pad although it is in a slightly
awkward position here there's also an
LED on the back there works like the PS
Move if you have a PlayStation Eye and a
microUSB port for charging below you'll
find a new speaker PlayStation button
along with the jack for the bundled
headset with the ps4 coming up top the
triggers have been redesigned with a
much more substantial feel and that
actually comes across for the entire
controller
it feels rock solid in the hand no
matter how hard you grip it but it's
also fairly light it's also got a subtle
grippy texture on the handles which
again feels nicer than the DualShock 3
almost immediately I could tell a major
improvement with the new controller it
feels a lot more similar to what you
would find on an Xbox but of course it
does have some added features like
motion sensing as well as the trackpad
if you take a look at the box for the
controller it says it's only for the
PlayStation 4 however who listens to
instructions anyway just like the Xbox
one if you plug it in via USB it turns
into a wired controller to set it up
with a ps3 you'll need a micro USB cable
supported ps3 game and a dual shock 3 if
you have one handy one thing I should
mention is that not all ps3 games are
supported by the ps4 so there's a great
thread over on our slash ps4 and I will
have that linked in the description that
goes over what games do and don't
support the PlayStation 4 controller but
the good news is most games that I tried
work no problem since it connects over
USB all you need to do is hook it up to
the ps3 and bam you're up and running
you will need to keep it wired but it
works well with the share and option
buttons replacing start and select
unfortunately the PlayStation button
doesn't work
so this is where keeping the DualShock 3
around for hopping out to menus helps
using the ps3 and ps4 controllers
back-to-back the main difference is how
much wider the new controller is the
handles are also a bit longer which fit
better in my hand and the subtle tweaks
to the back and triggers make a
surprisingly big difference that's not
all though you can also hook up the dual
for to the PC unfortunately this isn't
quite as well sorted windows detects the
controller and all the buttons no
problem but most games seem to be
designed for an Xbox controller
interestingly steam big picture mode
works right out of the box however when
you jump into a game like left 4 dead 2
it's not quite fully working yet so what
do you guys think about the DualShock 4
are you going to be picking one up
especially once we get some better PC
support doesn't be sure to let me know
what you think in the comments below
anyway thank you so much for watching if
you enjoyed definitely be sure to
subscribe to the channel so you're
always kept up to date with the latest
and greatest anyway guys I will catch
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
