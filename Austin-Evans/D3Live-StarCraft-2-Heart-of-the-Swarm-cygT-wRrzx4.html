episode of d3 live so today we're going
to be talking about starcraft 2 now for
starcraft two wings of liberty has come
out fairly recently and it has really
been a fantastic success of a game now
personally I played it a lot and really
I think blizzard did it just a great
great job with it I mean it's a really
in-depth game you know there's so much
on the multiplayer I mean you know just
looking at past look at past versions of
starcraft ii the multiplier is gone for
years and years eaters I think the
starcraft 2 has made a lot of key
improvements you know to him but you
know keep it going and keep it really
nice and fresh but of course the main
campaign was really really really great
in my opinion you know all the
cinematics were great there was a lot of
variation I mean it wasn't a lot of you
know a lot of games like starcraft kind
of get into the same sort of like you
know build a base defend build a base
attack it you know kind get some really
no narrow sort of missions however wings
of liberty really didn't follow any of
that I mean just was great variety as
you know so really I think wings of
Liberty was a fantastic game of course
though guys starcraft 2 is a trilogy and
that doesn't really make any sense but
basically they're going to be three
versions of starcraft two not three four
and five but basically the course of
starcraft two wings of liberty which
actually I've got right here it's just
the standard one it does follow the
Terran campaign however the rash is
going to be two more so the first one
that will be coming out is going to be
starcraft 2 heart of the swarm now this
is actually going to follow the desert
and I'm sure a lot of you guys have been
part of this but I'll go ahead just
recap your heaven this is going to go
ahead and follow Kerrigan and the Zerg
through all you know whatever the
campaign and all that kind of stuff so
basically cuz I'm going to be talking a
little bit about that and also kind of
my thoughts and my opinions as well as
wine and get you some of your guys's
feedback on what we think blizzard
should incorporate in the next starcraft
2 so of course the next one is going to
be focused on the third on Kerrigan
which i think is going to be pretty
interesting because you know usually you
know obviously we've been following you
know the story everything of the Terran
so kind of to move over it's going to be
pretty interesting but some of the
things i'd like to see is definitely you
know more variety more units and really
really
solid story so as far as the multiplayer
goes because obviously that's probably
one of the biggest things about
starcraft 2 now i think blizzard has
done a great job so far they've had a
lot of really interesting you know unit
types you know the galaxy map editor is
just insane I think it's going to take a
long time to really for people to fully
use it um but I'd really like to see
some more unit variety now I'm not to
say anything against starcraft 2 already
there are so many units for all three
races I mean it's a really really great
meta game however I think that there's a
lot that they could improve on no I mean
there if you just take a look if you
play through wings of liberty just take
a look I mean for all races that are
quite a few different really cool units
that you don't get to see in the
multiplayer so just taking some of the
for example like mercenaries I think
that's a really cool thing that could
really be useful in the in the
multiplayer and then there are a lot of
just units that just are just what kind
of just got the cut you know and it the
same goes true for both the zerg and
protoss as well so not looking forward
to them adding some new units while
still keeping a very balanced and fair
which is something blizzards really
knows how to do well I'm now continuing
on with that I really want them to make
sure that it doesn't I don't want it to
be you know like a short little story
had that I mean really wings of liberty
was a fantastic for an RTS it was a
fantastic story you know the cinematics
were really really just amazing looking
especially the ones that were pre
rendered to me those were those were
really great I'd love to see them do
more of that you know let us really just
draw us into the story of what all's
going on with dessert you know keep it
keep it in interesting fresh and of
course just go ahead and you know where
they keep the cinematics then do a
mission that really fills it out because
all the time you know it's really easy
to go well you know we're just going
ahead and let you fill in the blanks
yourself but blue does a great job of
making it a very cinematic experience
make it look like a movie so absolutely
hope that they won't skimp on that or
anything like that which I'm sure they
won't but you know now some of the other
things is that people kind of been not
106 shirt on even have a blizzard it
fully decided yet whether it's actually
going to be an expansion pack or it's
going to be going ahead to be a full
standalone game now to be honest for me
really care so much either way obviously
an expansion pack would be kind of nice
because most of the people who by then
because it will be out in a while and
will obviously have the standard
starcraft 2 and you know it's not going
to be a big deal to you know save some
money and buy the expansion back however
on the other hand you know make nether
but it has it and you can go ahead just
buy the full game so really to be honest
I don't like here either way as long as
I really do keep the story out keep all
the great elements they don't you know
try to just make an expansion pack and
just you know and like five missions or
something really small which I'm sure
like I said guys Blizzard they're not
going to do that they there starcraft 2
is so huge they're going to really do it
right so guys as far as when we can
expect heart of the swarm it's really
hard to say really Blizzard has just now
started on it you know they probably
working on for only a few months really
hardcore so if knowing blizzard it will
probably out in the next seven to eight
years well okay probably not it'll
probably be out here and you know maybe
the next year too but guys thats
actually comes down to probably the most
important part of this video what are
you guys looking for in the next version
of starcraft now I mean obviously
blizzards are just starting working on
this I guarantee that they are looking
around you know trying to figure out
what what what what does everybody think
so guys absolutely feel free to leave in
the comment section below what do you
think what are you looking forward to or
you think they can improve on what do
you think they need to stay away from
definitely leave all your thoughts and
comments in the section comment section
below okay so for the second segment of
d3 live I'll be taking live questions so
we do have a lot of people in here on
blog to be all watching it live so the
go ahead and take some questions kind of
answer and just kind of hang out a
little bit let's start prepping focusing
on all the races I thought they would
make separate games for each race as I
should good question now each one yes
you're right there are going to be three
starcraft two games of obviously wings
of liberty which focuses on the chair
it's already out there's going to be
harder this one as well as the Protoss
so there aren't going to be three
different ones however each one will
have each race so for example you go
ahead me by wings of liberty today not
while the campaign focuses on the Tieren
and the multiplayer you can play as any
of the three races and then I expect
with each one of the next two expansion
pack / sequels whatever
call it I'm with each one of those that
actually will be you know editions more
units obviously a campaign that focuses
on each race but in each game you can go
ahead and the multiplayer everything you
can't go ahead and play as all races um
how much why do I like my gameboy so
much uh well I is kind of long story
basically I like Game Boys a lot is like
some of my first console so I kind of
collect him a little bit but you know
starcraft start collectors or right
you're a regular version for a
first-time starcraft er uh to be honest
private regular now some of the
collectors edition there's a lot of cool
stuff but to be honest if you're just
getting into the starcraft as you never
played before you know you know you're
not really a hard for starcraft fan i
probably just go with this standard ah
that's what i bought now i don't know i
know i mean the collectors edition just
really didn't seem all that you know
special to me of me i just i just have
to play the game but you know i'd
probably just go with the standard one I
mean it's just kind of a personal
preference but you know it is
recommending playing starcraft one for
starcraft 2 um yeah do you actually um
yes and no I guess yes actually you
probably should especially because you
can go ahead get starcraft brood war as
well as i believe there's the back i
think it's called the battle chest don't
quote me on that but up and go ahead and
pick it up with the original starcraft
as well as strategy guys for like ten
dollars on amazon now i recommend
definitely go do so because obviously
it's very very cheap should run pretty
much any computer especially if you're
already playing starcraft 2 however if
whatever reason you want to do that if
you want spend that much money or you
know you don't you don't feel like it
you can go ahead and jump straight into
starcraft 2 you know you won't
understand everything but they did
blizzard did a really good job of
filling you in as you go there's lots of
flashbacks there's lots of well well
done storytelling so why are you might
as well to go ahead and just buy the
first one just because it's so cheap if
you don't you're really not missing out
on that much you you'll be able to get
the graphs to the story pretty quickly
while i buy the PSP go no i I've had a
PSP before the PSP go really just kind
of didn't just didn't really go with me
just because you don't have the UMD
and digital downloads well I mean I
don't mind is your downloads right now
I'd rather have something you know
physical just because you know it
is using wet and you could buy you stuff
you can do a lot more today so I'm going
to really too much into the of the
digital downloads but you know that's
just kind of my opinion right now um
connect vs playstation move as that's a
good question obviously i actually have
done a video a few months back talking a
bit about it but of course playstation
move is just come out connect should be
coming out here fairly shortly basically
the short of it i got a huge fan of
printers any of the motion controls um I
do have a way and you know obviously you
know everyone's played the Wemo not look
kind of the motion controls for a while
I know I haven't been able to play
either playstation move or connect yet
so i really can't say understand about
any of them but what I've seen what I've
heard I'm not really all that impressed
I just don't know if it's worth spending
all my money but I might just go ahead
and just have to try out them just kind
of just give you guys some videos of
stuff so you might watch out that but um
on that little impressed i guess is um
starcraft for world of warcraft two
totally different games both equally
dangerous but i play start drive I don't
touch world of warcraft not really my
kind of thing but I definitely do love
starcraft quadrupeds what is the minimum
requirements of starcraft 2 now for that
i don't know off the top of my head you
can go ahead just look it up but maybe
Google or something I will say though
that they're pretty low I'm for example
I'm able to play starcraft 2 on lower
settings I'm able to play starcraft 2
with the core i3 laptop with with
integrated graphics and it runs pretty
much just fine so really if I can do it
with integrated graphics if you have any
kind of decent computer at all you
should be able to play starcraft 2 so
well wed and check you know the minimum
requirements because obviously don't to
pay six dollars per game and i'd be able
to use it but most of you should be able
to play as long as you just don't have
like a really old laptop or something
they make guys that's it for this
episode of d3 live i hope you guys
enjoyed and if you did feel free to
