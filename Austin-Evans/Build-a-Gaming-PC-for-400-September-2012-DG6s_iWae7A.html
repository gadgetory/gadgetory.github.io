the 400 gaming PC build now this is some
pretty budget stuff and yet we're still
able to play pretty much any game you
throw at it so in fact I was playing
battlefield 3 on medium settings only
$400 bills just before filming this and
it handles it absolutely no problem if
you guys are looking to spend a little
bit more you can check out my $500 bail
here it's basically the same thing as
this but with a few key upgrades and if
you're interested in learning how to put
a computer like this together you can
check out my full tutorial right here
should kick our build off we're going to
be using an intel pentium g 850
processor now question i get asked all
the time is what i use AMD especially in
budget bells like this well the g 850 is
a great example of why i don't
this is a basic intel chip yeah it's
going to outperform an D CPUs like the
quad-core phenom x4 and it's going to
take up less power while doing it
the G 850 is based on the Intel Sandy
Bridge architecture and features dual
cores clocked at 2.9 gigahertz apiece
well it's not going to be quite as fast
as something like a core i3 you're also
going to be saving a lot of money as it
only comes in at $78 for motherboard
we're going to be using the gigabyte 861
mdsp motherboard now this is the same
thing that we used in the 500-hour
gaming PC and it's a very solid
motherboard at a very reasonable price
this is an h-60 one board so don't
expect any frills however it definitely
will get the job done so it supports up
to 16 gigabytes of RAM for hard drives
as well as has dual BIOS which can
really come in handy for only $45 this
is exactly what we want in our build for
a graphics car we're going to be using
unisys Radeon HD 7750 now this is a very
low powered card that gives you very
high performance so unlike a normal
graphics card which will require you to
bring over a lead or two from your power
supply for external power this pulls all
it needs from the motherboard despite
needing less than 75 watts to run this
has more than enough power to handle any
game you throw at it thanks to the 1
gigabyte of gddr5 memory as well as the
820 megahertz factory overclock for only
$100 this is going to work perfectly in
our build for memory we're going to be
using 4 gigabytes of corsair XMS 3 ram
now this isn't anything all that
spectacular so there's no explosions or
light shows or anything inside your case
but what this will do is give you more
than that frame to handle any game you
throw at it it's also going to singled
in so if you'd like you can grab another
one of these at a later date and up your
bill to a gigabytes of RAM regardless
though it's only going to cost you $20
for a hard drive we're going to be using
a 500 gigabyte Western Digital caviar
blue this is the same drive we used in
the $500 PC and it works just as well
here as it did there now with 500
gigabytes of storage
have more than enough room for all the
games you want however if you do want to
spend a little bit more it also does
come in a one terabyte variety
regardless though for 500 gigabytes it's
gonna cost you about 67 dollars for a
powder supply we're gonna be using a 500
watt cooler master extreme power plus
again we also use this in the 500 I'll
build and it's going to work right here
especially considering that these parts
actually take up less power and one of
the cool things about this is that it
fits in very nicely with the build so it
fits in right at home with the case and
for only $28 it's really hard to go
wrong for a case we're going to using a
fractal design core 1000 now I'm not
gonna lie I actually love this little
case so it is a micro ATX form factor so
that means is actually going to be
fairly smaller than something like a
full mid tower case full mid tower at
night mid tower case but don't let that
put you off at all as since we don't
have any kind of high power probe
components everything's going to fit
with lots of room to spare and on top of
that it's actually got a really nice
design for only about $40 for an
operating system you may want to
consider picking up a copy of Windows 7
home premium now an operating system is
not optional however buying Windows 7 is
so you may already have a version of
Windows you want to use you want to use
Windows 8 or you may even want to use
Linux regardless though if you do want
to use Windows 7 it will add an
additional $90 so there you guys have it
a 400 gaming PC they can handle pretty
much anything you throw at it now do the
even mind the prices are constantly
changing so I'll have links to all the
parts I used in the description of this
video since this is a custom PC I'll
have some other options in the
description so for example if you want a
different case you want a little more
powerful processor you want to change up
a couple things some other suggestions
in the description so you guys can feel
free to change some things around and
get the build exactly how you want it
anyway guys that's about it if you want
to check out how to build a computer
feel free to check out my tutorial right
here and if you enjoyed this video
definitely be sure to leave it a thumbs
up and if you're interested in more
