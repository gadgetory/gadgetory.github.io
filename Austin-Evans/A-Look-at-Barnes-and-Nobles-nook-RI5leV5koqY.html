their dual screened eReader the Nook it
takes direct aim at the Amazon Kindle
and with features like Wi-Fi a micro SD
card slot and Android it looks to be a
major challenge let's take a look at
what all the Nook has to offer and see
how it measures up to the rest of the
pack
the first thing you will notice about
the Nook is the 3.5 inch color
touchscreen which sits below the six
inch e-ink display where the standard
can no packs are reasonable keyboard the
Nook fills the space with a nice-looking
auxilary touchscreen it is used for
selecting books navigating menus and
much more while it may seem somewhat
like a gimmick it not only adds some
added value but also opens up the
possibilities for using the Nook in ways
you wouldn't with other readers because
of the color touchscreen one of the most
promising uses of the touchscreen stems
from the operating system of the Nook
Android Android so far has been mostly
confined to smartphones and it is a
first to see it running an e-reader
Android is an open source OS made by
Google and as such is extremely open to
modifications aka hacking and apps
opening up a huge world of possibilities
adding to the promise of an open
platform is the fact that Barnes and
Noble has as good as announced that
they're going to allow applications to
run on the Nook however promising it is
however it is of course an e-reader
first or foremost in that case it seems
is very formidable it shares the same
six inch e-ink display as the Kindle
which is perfect for reading books and
magazines in a natural way unlike how
standard LCD screens are backlit and can
be a strain on your eyes after reading
for extended periods of time downloading
books a simple via the Barnes &amp;amp; Noble
ebook online storefront with most books
coming in and right under $10 in
addition you'll be able to download over
500,000 free ebooks mostly being of the
classic variety such as 20,000 Leagues
Under the Sea
etc downloading the books is simple via
3G through AT&amp;amp;T network and it's free
just as it is on the Kindle
where the nook has an advantage is with
the included Wi-Fi which opens up a lot
of possibilities once the device has
been fully outfitted with apps being
able to download content went away from
ATT's notoriously spotty 3G network is
also helpful among the nooks unique if
disappointing features is ensuring
functionality with it you can wirelessly
share your ebooks with any other device
that has the client including the iPhone
iPod Touch blackberry PC Mac and of
course other nooks however this will not
likely be a well utilized feature as any
ebook you choose to share will be
unavailable to you while that is being
Lent in addition some if not most ebooks
won't be available to share and those
that well can only be shared once
forever it's certainly disappointing
however it may be handy in some limited
situations the Nook contains two
gigabytes of on-board storage which will
be good for up to 1,500 ebooks however
you can utilize a microSD card slot in
the device which will allow you to
insert cards up to 16 gigabytes in size
which should be plenty for you assuming
you have less than 15 thousand or so
ebooks which hopefully isn't a problem
the note doesn't break any new ground
price-wise it will cost two hundred and
sixty dollars the same as the Kindle 2
when it is released on November 30th
that said between the wealth of unique
features such as the added touch screen
Android easy sharing feature along with
Wi-Fi it really stands to be the first
very interesting eReader we shall see
once the Nook is released if it can
really match up against the Kindle but
for now I think it's safe to say Amazon
should be pretty worried thanks for
