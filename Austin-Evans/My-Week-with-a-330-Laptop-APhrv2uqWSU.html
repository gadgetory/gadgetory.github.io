laptop and I'm going to be using it for
the next week so big shout out to HR
finale sponsoring this video but also
hooking us up with their brand new spin
one so there's a little bit more of a
budget laptop what's nice about it is
it's actually reasonably portable you
know what I actually kind of like the
look of this so it's all blackness got
this kind of textured material it's
still plastic but actually doesn't feel
bad open this guy up and you'll see it's
running a full copy of Windows 10 home
continue this is about the same price as
a lot of tablets it's nice to get the
full windows experience and of course
you still do have that touch screen like
a lot of HR laptops these days you get
some flexibility in how you use the
spend one so of course you can use it in
standard laptop mode but if you want you
can actually flip it upside down to get
display mode if you want to be able to
watch videos like this or one of my
favorites it's tent mode where you flip
it upside down nice if you want to get a
little bit more of a compact form factor
or if you want to use it as a tablet you
can just close it up and you like that
and then just one really is not that so
what is rocking a cool 1920 by 1080
resolution and it's also an IPS panel
now that's important as a lot of other
budget laptop definitely skimp in this
screen Department so we have good color
good contrast and especially good
viewing angles hey guys this is Austin
it's all the laptop position
so this bin one is a solid laptop for
video consumption it's of course
powerful enough to stream stuff like
1080p video we're that nice screen and
some presently saw the speakers it works
well
however spec wise it's not the most
powerful laptop in the world inside this
bin one has a dual core Intel Celeron
processor four gigabytes of memory and
32 gigs of storage so for what I'm going
to be doing with it
mostly lighter stuff like web browsing
video watching and things like email
it's fine but don't expect it to handle
demanding tasks very well now about 32
gigs of storage doesn't sound like a lot
but thankfully the spin-1 does have a
micro SD card slot so for about forty
dollars you can expand it with 128 gig
card would she give you a lot more
usability what's cool is the spend one
also comes with a free year of office
365 which is cool because it's like $100
on its own so first glance the spend
ones not bad but the real test is going
to be how does it stack up when I take
it on a very very long trip so I am now
on the other side of the world in
Shanghai China and for the last week or
so the spend one has held up so mostly
use this as a
a laptop and one of the first things
that really jumped out to me was how
nice it is to do the 11 inch laptop
again
so I've been using a 15 inch laptop for
the last few years I want nice to have
that extra power having something that's
this small and portable with a huge help
so while I do usually use this in laptop
mode be able to flip the screen around
and said on airline table was helpful
this is a nice hinge so I think
something that I really have to kind of
give them props for even though this is
obviously a more budget oriented laptop
it doesn't really feel like it so the
plastic is nice I like the sort of
texture and that hinge just feels really
good to kind of flip back and forth so
having that 1080p IPS display really
does make a big difference it really
does put a lot of laptops to cops but
were double the price to Shane having a
free year of office 365 included is also
a nice bonus so I lit up all the notes
for this video inside of word it's a
nice experience so the keyboard is
surprisingly good on the spin one so it
has a nice keyboard travel the layout is
solid with the exception of the page up
and down keys which kind of stretch me
out a little bit but there's really not
a lot to complain about and that same
thing goes for the trackpad it wasn't
that long ago but if you're buying a
budget computer you can pretty much
guarantee that it's going to have a
terrible trackpad so at this point I
took pretty much any Windows 10 laptop I
use should have a touchscreen it does
make it a nicer experience to use I
think that kind of goes double for the
spin one for something that's so small
and so portable having the option now be
able to flip around the screen but
obviously be able to touch it use the
keyboard use the trackpad there are a
lot of options on how you actually want
to use the laptop so I've watched a lot
of video on the spin one over the last
few days and for the most part it's been
a solid experience so ads like Netflix
work really well especially with the
offline mode while you're flying however
there were a few hiccups so that Celeron
processor is decent for more basic uses
but for unoptimized apps such as iTunes
it does struggle just a little bit
considering the price the main
competitor to something like the spend
one is going to be a Chromebook don't
get me wrong I do like Chrome OS however
personally for me I do like having a
full version of Windows 10 but you are
going to have to deal with some
compromises one area where the lower in
specs are helpful is with battery life
so even when you're doing fairly
demanding tasks I never saw the battery
life estimate drop below around 7 hours
and we're doing lighter stuff like web
browsing and email you should expect
over 10 hours want to story short the
spend one should easily be able to make
it through a full day without needing to
hit the charger so is they spin one my
new daily driver no I have to do stuff
like 4k video editing on a regular basis
and puts them
this just is not up to it go over if
you're going to class all day taking
notes web browsing and that kind of
stuff this is pretty solid sure it would
be nice to be a little bit more powerful
there's really not a lot to complain
about besides that anyway what do you
guys think about we spend one let me
know in the comments below and I will
catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
