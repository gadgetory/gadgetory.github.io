of a different video so of course you
guys may or may not have heard that HP
is pretty much killing off webOS they're
gonna can discontinue all the phones as
well as the HP TouchPad tablet I know
this is definitely bad news I really
like webOS I think they're making a bad
decision on the good side they're
basically blowing out the touchpad right
now as you guys can see here I was able
to pick up this HP TouchPad for only $99
so while it may not be a perfect tablet
for the price I think it's gonna be hard
to go wrong so let's take a quick look
at it okay so we've got out of the box
let's take a look at what all we
actually get in the box so of course the
first thing is going to be the touchpad
cattle itself I'm go ahead and do the
whole unboxing deal for you guys now
comes the fun part
just kind of nice packaging here open
this up HP TouchPad getting started
really nice packaging here so we get a
getting started guide and navigation
HP's here to help and a little HP
cleaning cloth so you definitely do get
what you pay for and plus a lot more all
right so see here how do we open this
next bit up here so we do get a wall
adapter so just USB wall adapter nothing
particularly special and you do get the
USB cable which I believe is micro USB
perhaps so yeah so you get pretty much
everything you need in the box which is
not a whole lot but the most important
thing is you do get the HP TouchPad now
go ahead and open it up and give you
guys a quick run around the device so
it's nicely wrapped up here in the
plastic right peel it all off here love
taking the gadget out for the very first
time alright guys so here is the HP
TouchPad itself just made out of black
plastic um definitely organized to see
your fingerprints coming on it but
anyway guys this has been a quick little
first look at the HP TouchPad
now I think this probably goes without
saying but for a hundred dollars I don't
care what I mean this this is absolutely
gonna be worth more than hundred dollars
so if you guys had the opportunity to go
check it out most places are sold out
online right
if you find it in stores I might like
you guys saw I went to Walmart and
picked mine up I just go look around and
if you can find one absolutely go pick
it up but anyway guys I will catch you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
