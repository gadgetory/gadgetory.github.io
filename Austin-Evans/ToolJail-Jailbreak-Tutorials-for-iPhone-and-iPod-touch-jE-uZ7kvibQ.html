today I'm here with the video that
should be really really helpful if you
plan or have ever jailbroken your ipod
touch or iphone for this program is
called tool jail and it is basically an
all-in-one tutorial link just about
everything you want short of actually
jailbreaking your device you know I get
tons of questions every day okay I need
to jailbreak this how do I do this that
that all kind of different stuff like
that this program is going to answer a
ton of those questions basically it's
going to give you a tutorial all you
gotta do is putting some information
about your device and it will give you a
full tutorial on how to if you can
jailbreak it and if you can how to do it
all the steps what you need the whole
deal it's very very select anyway look
guys let's get this one started okay
guys let's get this one started so to
begin with we just come to the this link
which is an I hackintosh if you like go
ahead and scroll through here it's
pretty simple but basically all you need
is to come down to the bottom three
lengths there's going to be English
Italian and German obviously you know
I'm going to go ahead and get the
english one but if you like another
language feel free let's go ahead just
click on it download it and and just put
it on your desktop or whatever and then
there's icon should be right here so go
ahead and just open it up okay and the
first thing you will see is that it will
kind of tell you that it's not
responsible for any damage to your iPod
or iPhone just hit okay it's no big deal
I'm so now you're into the program so
there's a few different things you can
do there's home which is obviously with
the first thing there's jailbreak /
tutorials which is the main feature i'll
get to that just second there are
options for dfu mode and recovery mode
which is very very helpful I'm go ahead
and show you guys that right now so if
you want to go ahead and either need to
do into dfu mode of recovery mode this
will give you a full tutorial show it
showing you how to it so let's go ahead
and just
that we have it and let's say we need to
go into DFU mode so it will give us a
little pop-up basically say disconnect
your device and power it off or so we go
and hit next and then once we do we hit
start and it will give us the timer you
know said hold the home and power and it
will basically actually give us a full
tutorial and show us how to do it it
basically hold our hand through it so
that's really really helpful I'll also
tell you guys how to downgrade which is
very helpful because a lot of people
especially you know who accidentally you
know download earlier version of the
firmware like three point one point
three a lot of people actually did that
want to come back to 3.1 point2 so this
is going to give you instructions on how
to downgrade your specific device it's
brilliant lastly we have links now the
links all of them are numbered like TJ
one TJ to etc and basically in the
tutorial and we'll say go to length TJ
to whatever and then that will be a link
for anything from from where
jailbreaking devices the whole deal so
definitely very helpful they include
that but of course the main thing is
going to be the jail bruh tutorials
let's go ahead and show you guys that so
here you will see that there's a list of
a lot of different things such as device
firmware everything like that okay so
let's just do something random let's do
an iphone 3g just show you get for an
example just click it and let's go
through here and take a locked iphone 3g
okay pick firmware as either three point
one point two three point one point
three now one thing is it's kind of
doesn't break down into it you have an
earlier firmware hopefully you should be
running either three point one point two
or three point one four three you should
keep it updated but uh it's not a big
deal so let's just say we're on three
point one point three now it's going to
ask I boot but that's only for the 3gs
high fly it's going to ask for a model
and it's what as if it's an mb or MC
model though only applies to ipod touch
2nd generation so for this sample we
have needed it is i know we can go down
here and again this is the sh sh file if
you have an iphone 3gs you would give
you may or may not have thats cool to
see you again this is a 3g so nobody
lastly we just pick the operating system
are running on so for this example I'm
you're running Windows so then we just
click search and it says you can do the
jailbreak so then you just click start
to the tutorial now it will give this a
little pop up then it's impossible to
unlock the base paper so it will just so
it basically is just telling you that it
will not going to tell you how to unlock
just jailbreak so no big deal so now we
have it so it's really simple it'll
basically say download 3.1 point to
download redsnow go through and it just
goes through the whole deal and now how
to tried all these yet but everyone I've
seen seems to be really accurate and of
course if you still need more help or
you're curious you can always come hook
up one of my videos or one of someone
else's videos it'll definitely walk you
through it so that guys that is a very
very cool thing called tool jail it
really should help because apples got
this so next step where there's ton of
different different firmwares devices
it's really confusing situation so use
tool jail just make sure that you can
put all the information correct and it
will give you the perfect tutorial
anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
