something just a little bit unusual
these are iPods and no not some relics
in the mid-2000s these are hypotheses
you can go out and buy today but the
question is why to start with we have
the iPod touch and this is probably
going to be the most familiar it is very
much based on the iPhone just with less
phone stuff but when we get to the iPod
Nano things get a little bit more
strange this guy came out in 2012 and
really hasn't been updated since so on
the surface it looks like a tiny iPod
touch in fact it does run some sort of
Frankenstein version of iOS but there's
a lot stripped out of it however nothing
is more stripped down and then the iPod
shuffle the shuffle hasn't been updated
since 2010 so we're still rocking a
whopping 4 gigabytes of no it's - it's
two gigabytes which I thought it was for
this just seems like such a relic of a
different time to be here at $50 the
shuffle is about one of the cheapest
Apple products that you can buy but it
just seems so weird this is still on
sale in 2017 inside we get the actual
shuffle itself you know what I don't
think I've ever actually tried one of
these I know I used to have the second
gen which was distilled a-squared guy
but is a little bit bigger there we go
CEO cool am i to you by to music on my
shirt right now start here oh boy
jerseys are going to be some very useful
instructions on how to use my iPod
shuffle then I'm going to install the
latest version of iTunes oh joy whoa
wait a minute wait a minute yo these are
the original they have a name the
original iPod hit song wait wait
you had that iPod smell yo I'm going to
bring it back right now that's crazy
those it's so old they literally haven't
even updated it with ear pods which have
been out for like five years now it's so
weird that this is being sold today I
mean this is not the same Apple who
makes the MacBook Pro with no ports in
the iPhone with no headphone jack I mean
it's all like put on this lady didn't
put anything up just a little bit just a
headphone jack
all right all right we let's get it
first shot let's give it a fair shot so
to connect it to the new MacBook I have
to do this and the MacBook because I
didn't know I don't know what I'm doing
with my life right now all right so now
comes the fun part of trying to remember
how to set up an iPod and I hello and
this is I haven't used items in so long
I've been using Spotify for all of my
music I actually need to see what iTunes
music I still have oh no there's
Nickelback
but it's seal why is this seal yeah we
can we can cut this part out right they
don't even know I ever listen to
Nickelback well it sounds terrible no no
no okay so these might have been okay
back in the iPod days these sounds off
forgot how bad do you sound I feel like
they were fine back in the day but even
like new ear pods done a lot better
well the real advantages of the shuffle
is really the only reason why I could
think of someone actually buying it
today is the fact that I should go it's
working out or something yeah I get it
it's kind of cool they've been making it
forever but like I really can't think of
any reason why you should buy these in
2017 moving all the way up 2012 we have
the iPod Nano now I kind of say the Nano
has a little bit of a sweet spot my
heart this is my very first ipod I
remember back in the day was so cool but
now I'm not so sure I will give them one
thing this thing is really tiny and
unlike the shuffle which is tiny for not
particularly a great reason this
actually is sort of a full iPod I mean
you've got a touchscreen you've got a
weird home button there's a lightning
port which is unbelievably modern and
not from 2010 yep download iTunes of
course so while this does have bluetooth
it does not have Wi-Fi so you're still
not going to be able to have any sort of
streaming music or well anything that
doesn't feel like it's not five years
old although we do have that is actually
not five years old aren't your pods or
your prospectors old this is more like
it
so while ear pods might not be the
greatest sounding headphones in the
world
honestly I actually don't mind them
especially for when I'm working out and
want some use a little bit smaller all
just brings me back
so much like when we actually had to
plug in via USB cables and rip CDs and
we are in this is straight-up like
old-school iOS so we've got a blue icon
we can swipe back
you've actually got radio I mean I'm not
so sure how often the radio is going to
be super helpful but since this is the
only form of streaming music your iPod
initially worked out pretty well it's a
little bitchy
um the middle is a really hard word for
me to justify I mean sure it's cool to
this small and having the touchscreen is
nice but man you've got to be a very
specific kind of person who wants to
spend a hundred and fifty dollars on
something like this when you can get
something like an iPhone or an iPod for
just a little bit more with the iPod
Touch we at least have something that
was made in 2015
it actually has reasonable specs so
we've got the same a processor from the
iPhone 6 and as far as the actual design
goes this is not that far off from
modern iPhone you know this design is
actually still really nice so not only
am I really a big fan of that blue color
but this is nice and thin and oh shucks
amazing it has a headphone jack but once
you actually fire this thing up you
should find if it's still running a
fully up-to-date version of iOS the best
part about the iPod is that it runs the
full app store which means that pretty
much any apps that will run on the
iPhone will run here most importantly
for me as an iPod I can use Spotify
Apple music whatever I want
okay so well does those other speakers
the other iPods black it's not exactly
great but that's where the earplugs come
in that sounds a lot better so a huge
fan of ear pods but the nice thing about
the iPod touch is it actually has a
reasonable ant and DAC inside and then
crazy but you want to listen to some
proper headphones so much better not
only is it nice to have Spotify on the
iPod touch but even if you're away from
Wi-Fi you can still download the files
locally the iPod Touch is a little bit
of a weird one because on one hand it
makes a lot more sense than any of these
other iPods but on the other if you have
a smart phone it really is not a lot of
point to getting the iPod touch and
that's kind of the biggest issue as you
can actually pick up an iPhone 5s off
contract for about the same money so
should you buy an iPod in 2017
no no maybe I feel like while the iPod
Touch does make some sense in the lineup
it is really crazy as Apple still sells
this entire range of iPods but what do
you guys think a lot of time used in
iPod let me know in the comments below
and I will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
