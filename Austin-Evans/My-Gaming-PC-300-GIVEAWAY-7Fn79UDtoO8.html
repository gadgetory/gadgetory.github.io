here at the video going over what is it
in my gaming PC so before we get started
I just want to cue you guys a little
apology and in advance I haven't done
any videos in the last week because I
got the flu at CES I'm still not quite a
hundred percent over it but it's trying
to do a video for you guys also
definitely sure to stay tuned to the end
of the video as I've got a pretty
awesome giveaway you guys are not gonna
want to miss to start with we have the
case which is a fractal design define r4
so I've been using fractal design and
several my builds lately and I've gotta
say I've been really liking how these
cases look and work and all that kind of
stuff so the reason I went with this is
mostly because I like a kind of a
understated look so you guys can see
here it's not really flashy it's very
simple and it still obviously says hey
I'm a gaming PC with that giant window
powering the build is an Intel Core i7
2670 some of the parts for my old build
in the new one basically it's kind of a
continuous work in progress so I'm
always adding more RAM or hard drives or
changing fans or whatever so it's just
kind of a natural thing to continue to
use some of the old parts so this is a
great CPU it's overclocked to 4.5
gigahertz the motherboard is also from
our previous build it's a good goodbye
z68 board now of course like I lift the
CPU and some other parts here if you
guys want to do this exact build I
really wouldn't recommend it if I was
buying it all brand new today I would
make some changes but in general a lot
of this stuff from so close to what a
brand-new part would it's really not
worth it to scrap all the parts to get
something that's like 2% faster for a
CPU cooler I'm using the corsair h 100 i
so this is a closed-loop liquid cooler
so it's a lot simpler than doing a full
water cooling loop so of course you got
to get a pump or reservoir you're
fitting your tubing your water blocks
through CPU your graphics card there's a
lot of stuff that goes into that and
while it's definitely fun and it's cool
to do i do like these h 100 i and other
kind of closed-loop systems we're all
you gotta do is mess it onto your cpu
put it in the roof your case or the back
or you know whatever the reservoir the
reservoir if the radiator goes and
you're good to go one thing i do want to
mention though is that you guys have a
define our for or want to do a build in
one be careful you can fit an h 100 or h
100 i up into the top of the case but
you have very very limited clearance so
while i was able to get it to fit up
there it actually over tops the
motherboard just a little bit so the top
part like maybe half inch or so is
behind the fans and as far as routing
the cave
if you want really nice neat cable
management is a huge pain to try to fit
your fingers up there and try to route
stuff so you can do it if you guys want
to but it might not be a bad yet - you
know maybe cut some extra holes on the
top of the case maybe move the cooler
over just a little bit but overall it's
good stuff for memory I'm using 16
gigabytes of Corsair Vengeance ddr3 RAM
so this is pretty much some standard
stuff so back when I first got I think I
paid something like $200 to get it but
nowadays you can get 32 gigs for like
150 bucks or even probably cheaper than
that right now so it's okay Ram it's
really nothing wrong with it but I
definitely do plan on upgrading it if
only because the blue really sticks out
because the whole kind of color scheme
with this case is black and white and
then you've got like four giant blue
heatsinks kind of sticking out which
doesn't really look cool to me so I will
be definitely replacing this most likely
with some corsair dominator ram which
looks awesome if you guys have never
seen it before got light bars and it's
kind of like a silvery kind of finish
which looks really cool I think it'll
fit well in the build but for now the
stuff works fine and if you guys are
interested in some cheaper stuff I
believe you can probably guess the 60 70
bucks
definitely the weak link on my system is
the Asus Radeon 68 50 so this is an
older graphics card and while it does
give you enough performance which is the
only reason I haven't really replaced it
it's really not meant to be in this bill
I mean all the other parts are kind of
high-end except the graphics card but
again something that I will be replacing
the next few months for my main SSD I'm
using a 250 gigabyte Samsung 840 pro
series drive now I'm a huge fan of
Samsung SSDs so I have an 8 30 in
another bill which has been ticking away
for a while and I have full confidence
that it will continue to work for years
and years and the 840 pro is the newer
and much faster version of that so again
two and fifty six gigabytes although I
have over provisioned it so it's only
about 220 gigabytes usable this is just
a little tip and kind of getting a
little off topic here if you guys have
an SSD it's usually a good idea to give
it a little bit more free space as it
allows it to do garbage collection and
that kind of thing to make sure it does
stay nice and speedy so now let's say
about it 840 pro is in my opinion pretty
much the best normal 2.5 inch SSD out
there right now it's also backed up by a
128 you can go by ocz vertex 3 so this
is from my older build and again and so
basically what I did was it's just set
up as a steam drive right now so all my
steam games are loaded up onto the
vertex 3 so anytime I want
play a game I have that nice fast SSD
load times without actually having to
use up all the space on my main SSD for
storage I have four drives totaling nine
terabytes of storage so these are all
Western Digital caviar greens except a
single high tachi drive and I really do
like the caviar greens for data storage
like what I'm using them for they tend
to run a little bit quieter a little bit
cooler and also because they're
relatively cheap considering you can get
like a three terabyte drive which is the
latest drive I put in there about 130
hundred 40 bucks again I don't know the
price off the top of my head I will put
links in the description but anyway I
really do like the caviar green dries
for a data storage especially if you do
have an SSD for your you know your more
important things that you want to get
out a little bit faster my power supply
is a corsair TX 750 is a good power
supply and i've had zero problems with
the power supply itself but again this
is definitely one of those things that I
definitely plan on replacing fairly soon
so the big thing is is that the cabling
is not really that great looking so you
guys take a look you can see a lot of
the in the ends of the cables the
wrapping didn't go all the way over so
you can see some yellow wires poking out
which doesn't really look cool at all so
that's one of the main reasons why I'm
going to do it I've thought about Reese
leaving the cables themselves but it's
kind of a pain especially considering
this isn't a modular power supply so
I've got a lot of cables that are gonna
be kind of hanging around they're gonna
be tucked around anyway so more likely
I'll just be replacing this power supply
with something hopefully with better
cabling for lighting I've added a pair
of BitFenix alchemy strips to the top
and bottom both in white so I'm not
really a big fan of kind of really
flashy cases I like to my stuff to be a
little bit more understated and since I
was going for a black and white color
scheme a pair of these white lights look
really nice especially when you turn off
the lights and look through the window
of the case kind of illuminates
everything it makes it look really cool
now these strips are really nice they
just plug into a molex lead to your on
from your power supply so it's really
nice to kind of tuck them as away and in
fact normally you can't even see them
with the normal side panel on the case
it's a really good stuff they're a
little bit pricey but if you want some
really high quality lights that have
their own adhesive so you just kind of
take off the strip put them wherever you
want on your build and you're good to go
