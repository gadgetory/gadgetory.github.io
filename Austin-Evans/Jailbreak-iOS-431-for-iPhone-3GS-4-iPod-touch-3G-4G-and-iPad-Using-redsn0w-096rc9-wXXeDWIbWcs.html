tutorial showing you how to jailbreak
your iphone ipod touch or ipad on the
latest iOS 4.3 point 1 firmware and it's
going to be an untethered jailbreak
which is definitely what you want so
before we begin there's a couple things
i do want to go over really quickly here
the program we're going to be using is
red snow red snow is a very very good
program i've been using it forever and
it's now been of course updated to work
on four point three point one now red
snow is available for both windows and
mac so pretty much you should be covered
across the board so we can go in just
jump straight into the jailbreak the
only thing you're going to need in
addition to the red snow is your
firmware file the ipsw for your device
now i'll have a link in the description
both the download redsnow as well as if
you don't know how to get your firmware
file you can either download it or you
might already have it on your computer
that's pretty simple so of course check
out the link the links in the
description for all that kind of good
stuff actually let's close this how one
thing i do want to mention if your went
on windows if you're on a Mac you don't
have to bother with this but if you're
on Windows you need to right click the
red snow especially Windows 7 or Windows
Vista come over to the compatibility and
click run this program in compatibility
mode for windows XP service pack 3 that
will help some props some people have
problems on Windows 7 as well as on
vista so do that and also have it run
this program as an administrator so once
you do that it should run no problem and
you shouldn't have any problems and of
course drum windows XP or on a Mac you
don't even have to worry about that so
we open it up the first thing is it's
going to want us to ask to browse for
firmer so we can just do that it'll take
just a second to process the firmware
once it successfully identifies the ipsw
we can click Next and we'll take just a
moment to prepare the jailbreak data and
everything one thing I do want to
mention is that you of course need to be
on iOS 4.3 point one for the jailbreak
guys it should be pretty obvious but if
you're on some earlier firmware you do
need to update via iTunes and then run
redsnow or force if you're already on
four point three point one you're going
to be good to go again that's pretty
obvious but I do want to make sure that
you guys are not trying to jailbreak
drawing firmware or something a little
bit silly like that so we're almost done
here there we go and now it's going to
provide us with a few options now this
will vary a little bit between you if
you have an ipod or an ipad
whatever the most important thing is to
make sure that you can install city
that's obviously what where the whole
goal of this is you can install custom
bundles but that's only if you know what
you're doing you know that's not only
necessary for most people if you have an
ipod touch you can enable battery
percentage so definitely want to do that
it also has options to boot tethered if
you headed tethered jailbreak but of
course that's not what this is so we
don't need to worry about that so now we
can click Next and we can go on to the
next step okay so the next step is to
run the program itself now before we
begin there is one thing i do recommend
is plug your device and via USB and
allow it to fully sync with itunes now
by doing this you will back up all of
your data your apps your contacts all
the kind of good stuff will be all
backed up in itunes now while you should
not lose any data in the jailbreak
there's always possibility of something
going wrong and by doing that you're
going to be good to go you don't have to
worry about any of that stuff so once
you've done that just go ahead and turn
the device off I've already done that
hold the power button slide to power off
and make sure the pin wheels stop
spinning all that kind of stuff and
we'll be good to go next step is to put
into DFU mode now i will show you guys
how to do it but there's also to count
down so we can do that really quickly
here so we'll get started falling the
power button for three seconds and start
holding the home button as well and we
do that the power and the home for 10
seconds and then we're going to release
the power button so of course we cloud
the program to just count us down and so
give it just a moment and then let
redsnow do its magic so there we go so
it's going to go ahead and run through
the whole program and I'll be right back
this is it's done alright so as you guys
can see here that it only just took a
moment and if we scroll to our last page
we will now see Sidious so if we open it
up we wait for it to stop hanging and
then we'll open it up there we go it
will say preparing filesystems the city
will exit one complete so there's no
guys that's it that's a quick and easy
way to jailbreak your iphone ipod touch
or ipad on iOS 4.3 point one so guys if
you enjoy if you found this tutorial
helpful be sure to subscribe right up
above and you'll be notified with all my
new videos jailbreaking all that kind of
good stuff and of course get any
