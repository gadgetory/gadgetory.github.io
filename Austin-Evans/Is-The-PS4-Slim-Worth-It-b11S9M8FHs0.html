now this is a fairly new console in fact
it literally arrived here 23 minutes ago
cursey at my good buddy ken however I
think the big question is is this worth
it
slim consoles are nothing new however
what is a little bit interesting about
this is the fact that there is another
ps4 coming the ps4 pro in just a couple
months not only is it a redesigned
console but it's also seen a price cut
so this now runs $300 versus the
original ps4 which used to go for 350 on
top of that as you might be able to
guess from the wonderful artwork it now
includes uncharted 4 in the box I'm
really curious to see how this ps4 slim
actually performs because with that pro
coming out there's very little reason to
get this if you know there's something
better in just a couple months alright
so if we open up the box we'll see first
of all a headset so it's the same little
mono headset they've been shipping with
the ps4 forever also have a micro USB
cable to charge the controller
you also get an HDMI cable in the Box
now something interesting about the ps4
slim is that unlike the Xbox 1s it does
not support 4k but there is an update to
support HDR however that HDR update will
not work on all ps4s super confusing I
know there's also the power cable so
just like the Xbox 1s in the original
ps4 there's no power brick now this time
around the controllers actually been
slightly redesigned some curious to see
if I can open it from the right side
would be helpful actually feels like
right now this is the same thing so this
is an original ps4 controller and this
is the slim I'm not seeing a lot of
difference first glance oh there is a
little bit of light up there also have a
full disk copy of uncharted 4 this is
actually a nice touch
I feel like most of the time you just
get a digital download I think that's
everything for the unboxing let's
actually get the console itself and I
can already see it's tiny Wow
whoa that is a lot smaller now a
surprise when I saw the original Xbox
one versus the S at how much smaller was
but this is this is even bigger of a
leaf whoa first of all no more glossy
plastic that is a lot better-looking in
person than any of the pictures or
videos that I've seen when I first saw
the leaks and some of the early hands-on
pictures was like but that's not bad so
it's kind of like someone took an
original ps4 and chopped off the top
half but the big difference is in the
height so the slim is well slim unlike
the original ps4 which had these
annoying touch buttons for power and
eject the ps4 slim has dedicated
physical buttons now are they much an
extra to hit but they're also different
sizes you know which ones which you know
what this is a nice little touch so Sony
has all the feet are the square
I completely pointed triangle innocence
Creek around back we have the port for
the power we have places you camera HDMI
and Ethernet there is no optical audio
but honestly I don't think that's a huge
loss and unlike the Xbox 1s which drop
the Kinect port you're Prettyish getting
the full experience here there's also
what looks like a port here I wonder oh
hello ah this is how you get to the hard
drive one fancy ps4 screw later we
should be able to get at the hard drive
this should be a normal 500 good white
hard drive I've got to give Sony props
they have made it even easier to get the
hard drive on the ps4 slams still 5400
rpm so this should be pretty much
identical to what you would find in the
original ps4 however all you do is find
basically any sort of SSD or small
two-and-a-half inch hard drive it should
fit in this caddy you can drop it right
back into the ps4 especially considering
this is only $300 it actually might not
be crazy to consider just upgrading the
hard drive when you first get it 500
gigabytes is decent you'll be able to
store a few games but stuff like that in
charge it's like 50 gigabytes it does
not take long before you'll fill that up
hardware wise the ps4 slam is pretty
much what you would expect I have a slim
console of what I'm curious about is how
does it actually perform get into a game
and it's essentially identical to the
original ps4 which shouldn't be a
surprise in theory it can support HDR
for apps and games however there's
nothing out yet and I imagine most games
will focus on the ps4 pro on the HDR
side where you will notice a
sound the older ps4 was always noisier
than I'd like and a lot of it was thanks
to the blu-ray drive the new slim drive
is a bit quieter but not by much switch
to a digital title like rocket League
and the slim is still a fair bit quieter
the only issue is when you put a disc in
the slim ya hand-in-hand with noises
power consumption both the Xbox 1s and
ps4 slam are based on updated hardware
architecture which enables the same
performance in a smaller package and the
slim definitely takes advantage it idle
it's a noticeable difference but while
playing Uncharted 4 the original model
needs nearly twice the power it also
runs a bit cooler the original only
really got warm when it didn't have
access to clean air but the slim runs a
few degrees cooler across the board
unless obvious but seriously needed
upgrade is in the Wi-Fi Department the
original ps4 had only 2.4 gigahertz
Wi-Fi which not only is fairly slow but
incredibly prone to even worse slowdowns
and areas like apartments where there's
a lot of interference the slim
thankfully has at least upgraded to 5
gigahertz Wireless which delivers up to
triple the speed on my connection it's
not perfect but a huge improvement so is
the ps4 slim worth it what depends if
you currently own a Playstation 4 this
is not a great upgrade sure it's better
however with the ps4 pro on the horizon
it just doesn't make sense however if
you haven't jumped on the ps4 bandwagon
yet it gets a little bit more
complicated and if you don't have a 4k
TV the ps4 slim is totally fine
however the ps4 probe will still have
some upgrades and performance even on a
normal TV and you're also getting a 1
terabyte hard drive so is that what the
extra hundred dollars for most people
probably go over the slim is still a
solid console as always if you guys
wanna check this out I will have a link
in the description and you can also
check out one of my recent videos where
I took a look at the Forgotten into no
console this crazy contraption called
the Panasonic cue hey guys is Austin
steam here's the video talking about
