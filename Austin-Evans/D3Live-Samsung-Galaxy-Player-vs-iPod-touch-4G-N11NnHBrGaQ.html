episode of d3 live so today we're going
to be talking about these Samsung Galaxy
player versus the iPod Touch 4th
generation and now before we get I do
want to go ahead and give you wish you
guys all a really happy New Year and
also go ahead and let you all know that
i'm using my brand new Nikon d3100
so hopefully the quality's a lot better
it's not focused or there's some
technical issues bear with me I'm just
still learning that easy so anyway
that's what just get it straight on into
the topic now for Samsung has just
recently announced they will be creating
an iPod Touch competitor in the Galaxy
Tab the galaxy player to meet Alex in
earrings so this is them look pretty
cool we know a lot of us have been
waiting for some kind of Android iPod
touch competitor for a while this looks
like it's going to be one of the very
first solid ones so of course we'll go
ahead talk about that just saying let's
just go ahead and back up and talk just
a little bit about the iPod Touch 4th
generation for those of you who aren't
familiar put that one right here
basically I bought those fourth
generation is a really really solid
device basically it is an iPhone without
the phone or just the way a lot of
people have talked about for a long time
still have all the same apps you still
got a very similar you know build runs
the same kind of operating system and
with the new iPod Touch 4th generation
you do still have the FaceTime camera as
well as a rear-facing camera which while
not quite as good as the iPhone 4 still
is pretty nice to have you know in just
a couple hundred dollar iPod so
basically what Samsung is planning on
doing is really doing their best to
match this with the news galaxy player
so what they've done it's very similar
to what they've done with the samsung
galaxy s lineup of phones they've been
known under a lot of different branding
such as the vibrant the Epic 4G the
continuum which is technically it's a
little bit different but they're all
very very similar phones they said
they've done pretty much the same thing
they've taken out the phone they've made
it where you know she's gonna be a
standard you know mp3 player that you
know of course does everything else that
you expect you know an Android device to
do so some of the really key things that
I like about these galaxy player the
specs is it's got more stuff than you
the iPod touch in a lot of different
areas so if take for example for has got
Android which that's that's not such a
huge advantage of course
you know android/ios you know they both
had the pros and cons covert hardware
wise it does have some big things so one
thing is you can actually go ahead and
does have an interchangeable battery so
unlike the iPod Touch where the battery
goes there's not a whole lot you can do
about it certainly not easy to you know
to tear the thing apart and get at the
battery it's almost impossible when is
this you know you can just pop a brand
new battery and no problem in addition
to this it also does have GPS now I have
no idea why Apple has spent so long not
putting the GPS putting any kind of GPS
in the iPod Touch I think would make a
lot of senses you know just being able
to forgive an iPod with GPS would do
really well then of course this is going
to be a feature in the gassy player
I'm they'll be running Android 2.2 Froyo
with their own custom interface with
Oprah personal I'm not a big fan of
custom interfaces however no it's not it
shouldn't be a huge deal and in fact it
will make it run a little bit closer to
iOS so if you know if you never use an
Android device before it should be a
little bit more user friendly I'm so
continuing on with some of the other
cool things it will be available in 8 16
and 32 gigabyte capacities of course I'm
talking about the galaxy plate here it
also will have a micro SD card expansion
slot so again unlike the iPod touch
where you know you buy an age 32 or 64
gigabyte capacities and you know there's
nothing else to it you know if you want
to ever expand it or there's really
nothing you can do if you can easily go
ahead and buy the gassy player then you
know we can buy the eight game you
realize that that's not gonna be quite
enough for you
so nobody deal you know spend a little
bit of money buy a micro SD card and you
can expand it so that's really a nice
thing again that I really like about it
now as far as the screen sizes go
they're actually going to be a little
bit of a difference and the iPod Touch
4th generation you'll have a three and a
half inch display with a resolution of
640 by 960 very very nice screen I
course have my iPod Touch here a lot the
screen now over the Galaxy player will
have a little bit of a different screen
it's gonna be larger 4-inch screen which
should be very nice for typing for
watching movies for a lot of different
things need I like before just because
it's an it's really a between a fine
line between being way too big you know
to carry around and deal with also it's
not gonna being you know too small or
anything that's gonna be really
sighs that's going to be a 480 by 800
resolution display and it's not going to
be a Super AMOLED so just like the
iPhone 4 has a better display than the
iPod Touch give it a say it be the same
way the gasps es which has they have
fantastic ring it's not gonna be quite
as good on the gassy player however they
should be you know pretty decent pretty
decent guys that's mostly for the you
know the overall specs not hot stuff now
of course the galaxy player will be
announced in 12 in announced that
they're gonna be we're going to be
getting hands-on everything next we
could see yes and since I we're going to
see yes it's gonna be one of the first
things I'm going to do is go get myself
a hands-on take a look at what I know so
far the Galaxy Tab and gassy play I'm
gonna leave the alumni the dousing
player should be a really really solid
competitor to the iPod touch
now of course it's got a lot of the same
features you know it's got still the
same front-facing and bleeding should be
a little bit better rear-facing camera
so it's got a lot of the you know the
strengths for the iPod Touch it's also
got a lot of additional things that you
know that really make it really gonna
make it a lot better so definitely
looking forward to see you know the
price and all kind of stuff but for what
we know so far the Samsung gases can be
a really solid compared okay so for the
second segment of day through the I I'll
be taking live questions from everybody
of the chat I've got quite a few people
in here is that a voice of gladness take
some questions
can you jailbreak mod or hacking Samsung
Galaxy player such a good question
forced Android phones and Android
devices in general tend to be a little
bit simpler to hack than you may be the
iPhone the iPod Touch and Samsung and
specifically it doesn't seem to be too
too focused on keeping everyone out
generally they're the Samsung Galaxy
lineup is fairly simple to hack so I
would definitely expect to be able to
route all do you know the Gaussian just
just pretty much the same way you would
route any other Samsung device this
Apple making firmwares more often just
to keep up with the Geo brick developers
I yes and no yes there had been several
like I believe it was four point oh
point to was solely just go ahead and
pretty much keep people from
jailbreaking a lot of times they will
you know
you know speed up the firmware just come
out just to patch holes but that said a
lot of times I will just go ahead and
just wait you know there's gonna be a
new update you know they'll go ahead and
just wait for it so sometimes yes
sometimes they don't really care is
Samsung jealous of Apple well that's
kind of uh that's kind of a hard thing I
think anybody is that jealous of Apple
just of how you know how much money
they're making but I don't know I don't
really think so I think that they're all
just trying to compete I just don't
think it's gonna be like they're trying
to copy or anything like that
I think the the iPod Touch market I'm
surprised nobody's really tried to go
after that just because iPod Touch
that's such a great idea I mean that's
why I like mine so much because you not
pay a ton of money and you know be stuck
on a carrier that you might not
necessarily necessarily like so or
didn't you know of course you still have
all the cool features and all that kind
of stuff so I think the Samsung gas
player is gonna be the first of many of
those kind of devices only not the first
but one of the first major competitors
anyway it's gonna be a video editing
program for the galaxy player like them
I move you the iPod touch you know
that's actually a good question um not
that I know of now I don't really know I
think there are doom really slight video
and things in the Android app market
however I do think that there's
definitely a big possibility there
wasn't major things with video anything
though is that it's not it's not very
simple app - right of course you know
it's that's what video energon generally
tend to be fairly expensive you know
when you buy up for the computer and you
know it took you know Apple themselves
to make iMovie so I think there are
definitely a big possibility of someone
making it but I just don't know how good
it will be until someone be like Samsung
and Google somebody like that actually
steps forward and makes an app like that
well the galaxy player have the camera
yes it actually will have to the
rear-facing camera I believe is a 3.2
megapixel camera which should be better
than the iPod Touch so I think it is
about 0.7 megapixels
definitely the iPod Touch is not very
good camera for taking stills and but
the front-facing camera both of them
both should be of just a standard VGA so
the front-facing camera should be about
the same but the rear-facing camera on
the gassing flutter should be do quite a
bit better
do you think Apple should let other
companies sell computers with Mac os10
installed like Microsoft does you know
that has been a thing that people talked
about for so long you know whether Apple
should go ahead just open up and you
know allow by me to buy you know Adele
running Mac or well you know whatever um
you know I don't think that I think it
would be kind of cool and you know that
would be a really nice thing to be able
to go ahead and just instead of buying
Apple you can buy oh it's tuned on
whatever you want but I don't see it
happening
I mean apples doing so well with OS 10
right now there's indeed was lying
coming out soon I just don't see them
actually just saying you know what we'll
just open it up and just let it um well
I think it's absolutely possible and it
would be really nice they did not in the
next few years maybe beyond that stuff
could change but for the foreseeable
future I don't see that happening do I
think it would be cool if the gassy
player could be hacked to run iOS let's
say she kind of funny you mentioned that
iOS and the iPod the iPhone have
actually been recently been hacked to
run Android now well I wouldn't say
recently it's probably pin a few months
but yeah so it actually does go the
other way around
one of the key things differences though
is that Android is open source
anybody can you know do whatever you
want whereas iOS definitely is not so
your where's anybody can go ahead
download Android you can do whatever you
want you can hack it however you like
get right to into iOS a lot harder and I
don't really see that being able to
happen just because it's a lot more
complicated when you don't have the
source code on that's not more
complicated it's next to impossible so
it'd be cool but I really got it so yeah
guys that's it for this week's
absolutely d3 live now just one thing I
do want to note I'm not sure what will
happen next week for next week's d3 live
I will be at CES
so dude just keep in mind that b3 live
might be a day or two early maybe a
little bit late might be some weird time
so definitely do keep out the look out
for that I'll try to keep you guys
updated anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
