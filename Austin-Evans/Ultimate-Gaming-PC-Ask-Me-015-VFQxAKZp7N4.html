huh guess not can you a gaming bill for
10,000 pounds I've had a lot of people
asked if I can do some super crazy
high-end ultimate gaming PC and while it
could go on Amazon and just create a
giant parts list and show you guys what
you could theoretically build I really
like to actually build and test all the
PCs that I make and I recommend to you
guys so the short answer is yes I would
love to do some kind of crazy high end
build but the problem is I can't see
myself spending that kind of money on a
system just to do a video for you guys
so one of these days maybe but not
really until I you like find a pile of
money or something what is the current
camera on which you're shooting your
videos I use the Canon 70d so this is a
great camera for someone on YouTube as
it has a flip-out screen so I can spin
it around actually be able to see myself
when I'm filming which is a huge help as
all that has really nice autofocus so
I'm usually not a fan of autofocus on
cameras however when you're shooting
yourself like I'm doing for most of this
video it makes a huge difference there's
too much power supply a bad idea like a
750 watt power supply and a mid-range PC
build that's totally fine so for the
budget side yeah you're probably paying
a little bit too much if your bill only
needs 300 watts and you have a 750 watt
power supply however it's not gonna hurt
anything by having an extra powerful
supply and on top of that if you ever
decide to do some more upgrades like say
add a second graphics card that can
really come in handy what was your
favorite game from last generation
consoles oh that's a tough one uh so
Super Smash Brothers Brawl is definitely
one of those games that blade so much
Mirror's Edge is one that I don't think
a lot of people give enough credit I
mean yeah it definitely wasn't a perfect
game but it was so much fun he's just
such a new kind of just game I know it
was just very very different and it
looked awesome as well but I think if I
had to pick just one game hands-down it
would be fallout 3 so I played that game
so much I hold the deal see just trying
to collect things just exploring that
huge awesome world man don't even get me
started fallout 3 is absolutely one of
my favorite games of all time what's
your opinion on the new Pokemon remakes
of Ruby and
that buyer yes just yes will you ever do
a Linux build and have you used Linux
it's been a while but yeah I have used
Linux before so as far as actually doing
like Linux focused gaming builds I could
especially we obviously would like
steamos kind of coming and making Linux
gaming a much bigger deal however for
the most part if you're going to be
doing a gaming PC Windows is still your
best overall choice now that being said
there's nothing stopping you from
putting links on pretty much all of my
bills I haven't tested them all with
lengths but for the most part hardware
compatibility is actually pretty solid
so there's really nothing stopping you
from picking out one of my current
builds and just throwing a copy of Linux
on it what thing do you miss most that
you lost in the fire it's probably gonna
sound lame but I really miss my Gameboy
Advance SP so remember I got it on my
11th birthday and I was completely mind
blown by how cool it was I mean it was
tiny it folded up like a laptop it had a
backlit screen which is just completely
crazy to me because Gameboys always had
you kind of leaning in windows trying to
get a little bit of light so you could
see the screen and I seriously kept that
thing in my pocket for years and years
so you know at the end I mean it was all
beat up and you know battery lasted like
20 minutes but like just all the
memories I had with that thing I
definitely regret not grabbing it often
how old are you even though I do get
called 17 every once in a while I'm
actually 21 well replacing my old laptop
drive with an SSD make it run faster
definitely so pretty much any computer
can benefit from an SSD so well sure a
hard drive will get the job done
when you add an SSD everything is just
so much quicker so much more responsive
it's such a nicer experience that even
with an older laptop you can absolutely
get a benefit out of it what 2.1 channel
speakers under $200 do you recommend I
really like the Harman Kardon sound
sticks three so those are the speaker's
you see behind me and I'm actually
really been enjoying them so I think one
of the big reasons is that they look
nice so yes of course speakers just need
to sound good but it definitely helps
when they're not some big ugly brown
piece of plastics sitting on your desk
so they look nice and they really sound
fantastic if you guys want more
information on them I'm actually working
on a video talking a little about some
of the tech I use and I'll definitely be
going more in depth on these guys a
little bit later on if you guys have any
more questions you can feel free
hit me up on Twitter Facebook and
Google+ and as always those links will
be in the description of this video
anyway guys thank you so much for
watching and I will catch you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
