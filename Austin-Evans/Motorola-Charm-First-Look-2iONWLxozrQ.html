on the motorola charm this is a really
unique phone guys it actually has a very
similar form factors to the palm pixi
but of course it runs android with
android 2.1 rather with motoblur instead
of webos i'm so guys take a look at
these pictures it is a very unique
looking phone I'm actually kind of
impressed with it I'm just definitely
you know a nice step away from you know
the sort of Android phones are all time
turning into the same you know giant
screen is that is that so it's kind of a
profession to actually kind of see
something a little bit new so guys
anyway some of the specs on it does have
a 2.8 inch touchscreen which is a really
nice feature on but but in addition to
that it also does have a full qwerty
keyboard which is really nice and then
guys on top of that if that's not enough
for you it does have a track pad on the
back basically so guys if you ever saw
the back motorola backflip where is the
phone where it flipped out with the
keyboard and then on the back of the
screen had a small touchpad well guys
the charm has the pretty much the same
touchpad which should be pretty
interesting you know it's it's really a
unique sort of thing against you know
the track balls and everything she might
see you on normal HTC phones etc some of
the specs included has two microphones
one for noise cancellation it has Wi-Fi
as well as a 3 megapixel camera so guys
this is a pretty interesting phone they
did say that it would be running flash
now what that means we're not exactly
sure full flash 10.1 is only for android
2.2 which is 2.1 so i don't think it
will be running that perhaps we'll be
running flash light that flashlight
flash light but who knows that said
though guys the fact that would run any
kind of flash at all contents to make me
saying that it does have a pretty decent
processor but they did not really
mention a lot of the key specs such as
processor ram memory so we'll just kind
of have to wait and see about that the
motorola charm will become your t-mobile
in the USA this summer so you probably
don't have that lot much longer to wait
on that guys they did not mention a
price I imagine this is not going to be
this doesn't look like a really high-end
phone so I imagine probably a hundred
dollars would be about right but you
know why do you have to wait and see so
guys I'm really really curious to know
what do you guys think about this phone
I don't know I mean personally I like
the look of it I really like the fact
that it's you know a really unique form
back
I like that it does have a touchpad
which is you know pretty you need for a
phone but of course on the other hand
2.8 inch screen is pretty small and that
keyboard well it looks decent I would
you have to kind of wait and see it get
some hands-on time before I can always
say anything about that guy's nothing
let me know in the comments what do you
guys think about this thing it's pretty
unique I've got in it anyway guys thanks
