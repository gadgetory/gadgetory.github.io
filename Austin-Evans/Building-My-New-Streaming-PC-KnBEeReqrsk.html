building a streaming PC we've done a lot
of gaming PC builds over the years but
something you guys have always asked for
is a dedicated streaming box and what
we're going to be doing today actually
has three different criteria so first of
all we need a computer that can actually
play games the idea here is that not
only do we want to be able to stream
from this but we also want to be able to
play the games on it and stream all from
a single PC the second criteria is well
it actually has to be good at streaming
so my goal is to be able to play at aap
60 to be able to stream to places like
YouTube gaming and twitch at 1080p 60
thirdly we actually need to be able to
stream from other consoles as well as
record so a lot of times when we're
doing videos especially we're not even
going to do live streaming we need to
get some gameplay from stuff like a ps4
or even some older consoles and right
now we have to pull out another laptop a
bunch of capture equipment it's kind of
a pain however with this PC in addition
to be able to stream we are also going
to be able to capture gameplay so let's
actually see what we've got for the
system so these are the brand new AMD
second generation rising processors now
Indy was awesome enough to actually hook
us up with this to be able to do a video
on but there's actually a lot of reasons
why you might want to pick up a rising
processor for a build like this you guys
will probably be familiar with first
generation Rison this came out last year
and it really kind of changed the
desktop PC scene however with the
second-generation AMD rising 7 desktop
processors it's going to be well just a
little bit better be honest it's not
gonna be a huge difference but what we
should expect is a little bit more
performance for about the same price so
who's gonna complain about that first of
all we have horizon 520 600 X so this is
going to be the 6 core 12 thread
processor or we can go all out with
Rison 7 this is going to
this is going to be the eighth course
sixteenth read part which we're going to
be using for this streaming bill and it
go along with our eyes and processors we
also have this giant velcro box oh and I
love that AMD goes completely all out on
the press kits we also get the asus rog
crosshair seven hero which is going to
be another x 470 motherboard and judging
by the half this is uh could be a big
one and last but not least we have a kit
of g.skill sniper X which is going to be
16 gigs at DDR 3400 so something
actually that is important to keep in
mind with rising processors is that
memory is important the most part most
memory is going to be compatible but the
faster memory is actually going to make
a fairly sizable difference wears a lot
of times on an Intel chip it's gonna be
a small thing it's mostly going from
single to dual channel but with rise in
this kind of fast stuff actually does
make a big difference so fast forward a
bit and we have the completed build
ready to go and as you can see there's a
lot of RGB now to be totally honest with
you I think once we actually get this a
little bit more dialed in I'm gonna
probably give it a little bit less
flashy but it looks good on camera and
that's the important part so this is the
corsair 5 70 x case now the main start
of the show here really is going to be
the tempered glass so now that do we
have a glass side panel but the top the
rear as well as the front are all
completely made out of tempered glass
and I've got to say especially pair with
all the RGB and the thankfully pretty
decent looking cable management thanks
to the actual room in the case I think
it looks pretty nice check off the side
panel and what you'll see is that the
case actually is not going to be too
busy inside I mean seriously with a
build like this normally I would want to
go for something like an all-in-one loop
or even just like a bigger air cooler
but consider this comes in the box I
really have no complaints it's going to
be more than enough for what we need so
in addition to that Asus crosshair
motherboard as well as these 16 gigs if
g.skill memory we also do have an EVGA
gtx 1070 now because this is going to be
a streaming setup that is aimed at 1080p
gaming and I had a 1070 laying around
and didn't want to have to go buy a
cinavia or something I think we should
be more than good enough and as you guys
will see here in a little bit for gaming
performance at 1080 this has more than
enough power for storage we have a 500
gigabyte samsung 960 Evo SSD now as an
entry drive it's going to give us
plenty of performance and 500 gigs
should be enough for our games for
Windows programs and that kind of stuff
with plenty of overhead but on top of
that because we are going to be doing a
lot of gameplay recordings with this guy
we do also have in the back a 4 terabyte
WD black hard drive and this is where
all the recordings are going to live at
least until we actually do go edit it
and then we're going to use USB to sort
of dump it out the editing PC as far as
actual capture goes that should be
pretty much all we need now down here
the only thing that is not black and
matte and RGB and cool is our Blackmagic
intensity Pro 4k now this is just simply
an internal capture card so around back
we have a pair of HDMI ports as well as
we have a multitude of analog inputs so
if we do want to hook up an older
console we can record with this guy what
the idea here is that we actually have a
single system that's going to be able to
nail a captured gameplay that we're
actually playing on the system but we
can't capture from those external
consoles PCs pretty much whatever else
we have this entire setup is being
powered by a 1000 watt course there are
n 1000 now a thousand watt power supply
is wild overkill for the system
considering that's probably gonna be
pulling well less than 500 Watts over I
had it laying around and so it had the
nice modular cables and uh you know why
not no no I had real reasons when we
upgrade to another 1070 and overclock
the rise and processor I'm never gonna
doing this it's gonna be totally fine
stock cuz I'm literally just need to
place type of technically I just like
the idea of making it more RGB dand more
ridiculous when really I'm trying to be
conservative and build something that's
reasonable so first up we have an easy
one rocket league of course here at
1080p on max settings we're getting a
solid 220 frames per second so you know
it's going to be playable but
importantly we also do have support for
shadow play so with a single keyboard
command we can get a nice clean
recording of the gameplay as well of
course can also stream it to but plenty
performance for a game like this so
while we wait for pub G to update like
it always needs to do when I need to
film the video this essentially is a
good time to talk a little bit about why
I'm using Rison 7 as opposed to a lower
end risin or something like core i5 or
i7 and that is entirely due to the fact
that we've got eight cores and sixteen
threads to work with now we can
definitely get away with a lot less if
we were just doing gaming but the idea
that we're going to be streaming and
recording on top of that the extra
Headroom does make a big difference
you can see we have well it's just nice
to look at lots of three so now that pub
G has been updated what we're getting
here is as you'd expect a pretty solid
experience so again 1080p ultra settings
right now just running around this
little prison here we're getting a solid
100 frames per second and this actually
is a good time to mention that I am
playing on a high refresh rate monitor
now that that really matters for
streaming but it actually does make it a
little bit better for well you know
playing the game this is the ultimate
camouflage being naked in the desert
they'll never see me coming next up we
have fortnight because what else would
we be playing in 2018 so I've got full
epic settings at 1080p and we're
averaging around 100 frames per second
what's different this time is that we
are streaming at the same time so this
is the exact same feed on YouTube gaming
and that's going to be a full 1080p 60
frames you can see it's gonna be maybe a
few seconds too late but it's actually
is surprisingly clean looking signal
we're really not going to be losing a
lot of quality while still getting a
super playable game and that's really
the beauty of a system like this so that
was going to be a hardcore dedicated
streamer I would have a separate PC to
be able to get the maximum performance
out of the one that I'm using to play
the game but the performance overhead
really isn't bad with a system like this
we have plenty of cores we have a more
than powerful enough GPU which means
that I can easily play the game stream
it all at once and not really see any
kind of serious performance penalty so
that is our brand new streaming PC as
always I'll have links to everything we
used in the description of this video
you may want to make some changes like a
different power supply considering that
that's total overkill but for the most
part actually do think this is going to
be a pretty reasonable setup and I'm
excited to get some streaming going or
in the future anyway guys thank you so
much for watching and I will catch you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
