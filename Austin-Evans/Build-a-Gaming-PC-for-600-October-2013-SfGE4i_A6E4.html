here at the gaming PC bill for $600 so
this is going to be a great way to get
yourself into all of the awesome new PC
games that are coming out to give you an
idea of how it performs I ran it through
a few different games including
battlefield 3 where the 600 lrpc has no
problems playing it on ultra Crysis 3
which surprise surprise is one of the
best-looking PC games out right now is
also easily able to be run on high
settings a very fun game from earlier
this year BioShock Infinite is also
absolutely no swept for the PC being
able to easily run on Ultra settings
lastly one of my surprise favorite games
of this year Metro last light is also
going to be totally playable running on
high settings to kick the build off
we're going to be using an AMD athlon x4
750 K so if you guys have been watching
the channel for a while you know that I
absolutely love the cpu is if you're
going to be gaming on a budget it's
really hard to beat this is a quad-core
processor clocked at three point four
gigahertz
however the nice thing is it's fully
overclockable so if you want to crank it
up and get a little more performance you
can absolutely feel free it's only going
to run you about $80 for a motherboard
we're going to be using an msi FM to a
75m ae-35 so awesome
super not long name at all aside this is
a great motherboard for this build so it
does support our CPU obviously but also
the support overclocking with it and you
get all the kind of fun bells and
whistles that you would look for
including USB 3 support as well as SATA
3 support all for $60 for a graphics
card we're going to be using a gigabyte
Radeon r9 270x
so I recently just reviewed the new r9 +
r7 series of AMD graphics cards and
spoiler alert they're awesome
so the r9 270x is probably the sweet
spot in the range as it gives you tons
of performance you get that 2 gigabytes
of memory which is great to have on a
graphics card and it really is going to
give you enough power to play pretty
much any game you want out there for
quite a while all for $200 for memory
we're going to be using 8 gigabytes of
Corsair Vengeance ddr3 RAM so I've used
this stuff on a ton of my builds and
it's never let me down so with 8 gigs of
RAM that's going to be plenty for pretty
much any game you throw at it including
a little bit of multitasking and it also
is rated at 1600 megahertz which is the
sweet spot in my opinion you can spend a
lot more on gamer series Ram
and that's nice and that's fine but to
be totally honest you're paying a lot
more for what really isn't going to be a
whole lot more performance so the
Vengeance series Ram is going to cost
you about $70 so it's going to be well
worth it for a hard drive we're going to
be using a one terabyte Western Digital
caviar black so again this is another
staple of my PC builds as this is pretty
much the default standard for a gaming
harddrive so with one terabyte of
capacity you can have plenty of room for
your games free music videos all that
kind of fun stuff although there is a 2
terabyte version if you want a little
bit more storage and it's also going to
give you enough performance so it's
definitely no SSD however it's
definitely not anywhere near as
expensive as a 1 terabyte SSD this is a
great choice it's going to run you about
$90 for the power supply we have a 500
watt Corsair ZX 500 so the power supply
is the literal heart of your build so if
you cheap out here expect to run into
issues before too long
so it's 500 watts of capacity it's going
to be plenty for everything we have in
this build and then some to add extra
hard drives fans that kind of stuff
that's going to be totally ok and it's
also going to be an A plus bronze
certified power supply which means that
not only is it going to be a high
quality so lets going to save a little
bit on your power bill so a win-win
there for about 50 dollars for a case
we're going to be using the Rose well
line em so this is an underrated case in
my opinion it's micro ATX which means
though it's going to be a little bit
smaller than the average sized Tower
however that's definitely nice going to
save a little bit of space in your desk
but it doesn't skimp at all on
performance with 2 included
120-millimeter fans as well as both USB
2 and USB 3 support on the front panel
making this an awesome case very small
and very easy to work with for about $50
so there you go an awesome $600 gaming
PC build of course prices are always
changing so I will have links to
everything I mentioned in the
description of this video also
