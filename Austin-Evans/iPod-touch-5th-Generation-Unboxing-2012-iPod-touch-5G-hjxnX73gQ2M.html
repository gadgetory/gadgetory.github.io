an unboxing of the iPod Touch 5th
generation with an all-new design better
cameras and more the new iPod Touch
looks solid so let's take a look if you
guys are interested in a giveaway of one
of these be sure to hit that like button
and I'll make it happen
with a quick deal we can make quick work
of the seal and get to the good stuff as
always the iPod Touch is held in by a
bit of plastic but easily enough it's
free I have here the 32 gigabyte model
but if you guys are interested in
checking out the other colors and sizes
I'll have a link in the description
setting aside the iPod for just one
second let's see what else we get in the
box here you'll find a little Quick
Start Guide to get you up and running in
the all-important Apple stickers that is
the reason you buy Apple products right
inside there's also the new lightning
cable which replaces the 30-pin cable
used in older models it's quite a bit
smaller and thinner and it's reversible
so you can be a rebel and plug it in any
way you want below this we have the loop
it's a little lanyard that attaches to
the iPod Touch to keep you from dropping
it and I'm torn between considering this
a useful feature or it's Apple insulting
my intelligence at least it matches the
color of your iPod lastly we have the
new Apple earpods which were a big
improvement over the last Apple earbuds
they might not blow your mind but they
are quite a bit more comfortable and
sound reasonably decent finally we have
the iPod touch itself the first thing
you'll notice is just how insanely thin
it is to give you an idea here it is
next to an iPhone 5 which is already
seriously then probably my favorite
feature is that they ditched the
terrible old polished aluminium for a
new colored backing you'll see the color
wraps around to the sides of the iPod
too while the front is white unless you
opt for the black model fire the iPod
touch up and you'll see the same 4-inch
Retina display from the iPhone 5 at
first glance it looks really impressive
and with that new wider aspect ratio
videos look awesome overall the new iPod
touch looks solid but be sure to stay
tuned to the channel as I'll be doing a
full review in the next few days if you
enjoyed this video and want me to give
away one of these bad boys hit up that
like button and be sure to subscribe
until next time I'll catch you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
