episode of d3 live so today I'm gonna be
talking about a pretty big topic and
it's going to be the Nintendo 3ds
version of the so many PSP - so
obviously the current PSP and the
current Diaz are both tremendous sales I
mean the DS has been C I mean it's just
ridiculous how many they sold and it
absolutely looks like it's gonna
continue into the next generation of
handheld consoles so today we're gonna
go ahead and take a look at what each
one tends to offer obviously neither are
out quite yet but we do have quite a bit
of information on the 3ds and do have
some on the PSP to some way give you
guys some of my thoughts my opinions on
all of what we can expect us to be
playing here in the next couple of years
so the first one is definitely going to
be the Nintendo 3ds I know this was
actually go ahead and they've already
talked about it here a couple months
back at e3 so we didn't know quite a bit
about it it's gonna it is going to go
ahead and share quite a bit similar to
the normal D's at what its gonna have a
folding clamshell design as well as two
cameras as well as two screens - but the
cool thing about the 3ds is it brings a
lot of new features so it also in
addition to the standard two cameras it
adds a third camera on the outside so on
the outside you actually can go ahead
and hold it up and take a 3d picture
that's gonna be a pretty - interesting
feature and in addition also does have
as you might have guessed a 3d screen so
basically the Nintendo 3ds is gonna be a
very powerful console as well so what
you expected to do is actually play
glasses free through glasses-free 3d
it's that's fun to say um so basically
and something any other size or your
pocket obviously you're just gonna be
handheld all you have to open it up and
on the top screen not on the bottom but
on the tops where you'll be able to play
full 3d games and they should look
pretty and pretty impressive too close
to gamecube graphics from always seems
so far so the 3d s though does have
quite a few other features I should have
a lot more of a software focus and what
I mean by that is if you ever played you
know the DS Lite or maybe even the DSi
which was an improvement um as you can
see it was really designed you know back
in the Gameboy era where you know there
was no software you put the game in it
boots up it goes straight to it now the
death was kind of a bridge but I
expect to see the 3ds you know improve
on this you know get a better sort of
app store of course the DSi it has do
you know the DSi shop literally look to
see a lot more software and you really
see them improve upon it because really
game systems these days can't afford to
just be game systems I mean you look at
me about the iPhone the iPod touch
they are great game systems you guess
what they play music you know on the
internet make calls all kinds of other
stuff so we really do expect to see the
3ds improve on this and really move into
you know the kinds of doing a lot of
different things obviously including
picture hopefully video camera all those
kind of stuff so that's about it for the
3ds it does look like a really solid
console and while we actually don't have
an exact release date it could be really
some people have been saying you know
here in the next couple months I'm but
the least we know it will be available
before March of next year so within the
next four or five months we will have
the 3ds so that's going to be pretty
cool now moving on we're gonna have the
PSP 2 which is kinda be a little bit
harder to nail down because it's not
official in any sort of way unlike the
3ds so of course the PSP 2 is going to
be the successor to the original PSP and
I will say the PSP 2 neck isn't final
that's just what most people call it I'm
gonna go ahead just stick with that
Nepenthe - like I said we don't really
know a whole lot about it but take a
look at you know what Nintendo's been
doing and you know what the what Apple's
been doing with the iPhone and iPod
Touch well I didn't kind of get a pretty
good picture of what Sony's looking to
do so there have been a lot of talk
about dual analog sticks and I think
that's going to be really really huge
anybody who's ever played in all PSP can
definitely attest to the fact that it's
kind of a little bit difficult to really
play a lot of games using just a very
small not very comfortable little
joystick so I really look forward to
them having a lot better controls and
they might even and proved upon that
with actually having a touchscreen in
addition to all of the standard buttons
so does it kind of get an idea of how
this would work you can go ahead take a
look at the current PSP go a lot of
people have suggested that I might
having the same sort of slider design
where you can glad with the clothes you
wouldn't really see any controls you
just have this screen and obviously if
it's a touchscreen you go ahead
do some simple things but then when
you're ready to go ahead and play game
on just slide out the controls and then
you go ahead and you might have a combo
with some touch controls some physical
controllers might do all kind of stuff
like that so that's definitely something
I would look forward to in the PSP to
now moving on I really think that the
PSP 2 is going to be a very very
powerful little console so when the
first PSP came out it was really really
impressive it had very very similar
graphics to the PlayStation 2 of the
time and I actually do kind of expect
that this will be kind of the same way
in the PSP - I wouldn't be surprised in
obviously I don't expect it to have
PlayStation 3 graphics right out of the
box but I do expect to be a big big jump
now for the PSP to mean the PSP was a
very powerful console and I could pick
to see the PSP - after them having four
or five years to you know prepare for it
to get a big bump in graphics to go
ahead and be able to play a lot really
you know in depth sort of games now as
far as 3d I'm not so sure
obviously sony has been pushing 3d very
hard on the console side with the
PlayStation 3 so I wouldn't be surprised
as I do try to put it on the PSB -
however with obviously that's the other
main focus of Nintendo with the 3ds I'm
not so sure if I'm wrong go ahead you go
with that so that's kind of a toss up
they very well could have 3d but if they
don't I can definitely see why so that's
about it for the PSP - like I said we
don't have a whole off concrete
information and it probably is still
going to be at least a year out before
we actually does come out so you know
like I said it's kind of hard to go
ahead and nail down but from what we do
know it does seem like a pretty solid
console okay so for the second segment
of d3 live I'll be taking live questions
as always every episode of d3 live is
filmed in front of blog TV even have
quite a few people in here right now so
go ahead and take some questions and
just kind of hang out what is the best
mobile game system well I think if
you're gonna buy something today it kind
of depends you know I really I'm a big
fan of the iPhone the iPod touch
you know if they're great systems as far
as you know they just don't do games I
mean there are a lot going on there
obviously I don't quite keep good games
on the iPhone the iPod Touch but in
addition to that they you know they make
phone calls if you have an iPhone I'm
getting the Internet
you know let's the music do all sorts of
other apps
so if you're looking to me if you're not
really into maybe like something that
you only can get on the PSP I maybe God
of War SOCOM or if you're not a ninja
like Mario or Pokemon on the DS
the iPhone and iPod touch I've been
plumbing really depending on if you need
to phone or not it's a pretty good way
to go
however if you're getting it straight
from games it really just kind of
depends on you know do you like a lot of
the Nintendo franchises would you like a
lot of the more hardcore stuff on the
PSP so really it's hard to just say well
one's better than all of them because
they all do have the respective
strengths and weaknesses why do they
call the PSP 2 and not the PSP 4000 well
I think the main reasons I'm not going
to go ahead call the PSP 4000 is that if
you take a look at the 1000 to 2000 or
3000 they were all just you know minor
upgrades you know maybe they change
little bit here they add a little bit
here
the next key is gonna be a totally
different they're gonna hopefully start
with you know clean slate you know she's
gonna be a big leap forward that I'm
gonna have you know you of DS hope not
there they're gonna go ahead so it's
gonna be a major step forward and I just
added the 1000s 3s that just was kind of
to mark like an incremental upgrade
whereas the next PSP should be you know
just a giant neo step forward you know
what do I think about those 23d raids on
devices like with 3ds uh I actually
that's a good question I had not been
able to well most people haven't but I
had actually been able to test out the
3d a semester and never actually seen Y
in person so it's kind of hard to say
now I have heard a lot of people have
said that it's pretty it's a pretty
solid screen however it's really simple
to kind of get you know depth perception
all messed up for example a lot of the
time when like they had a lot of 3d
movies such as avatar a lot of people
kind of got a little disoriented with
the 3d I think that might very well be a
little bit of a problem for the 3ds
however the major thing that you need to
keep in mind is that there's a 3d a
deserves a dial that goes it turns up
and down the effect of the 3d so maybe
like if you don't like the 3d you can go
ahead turn all the way off you can slide
them up and down so I think that I mean
the 3d is gonna be an additional feature
but obviously pretty much any of the
games should work without the 3d for if
for whatever reason you know it doesn't
look good to you
you know some people you know get a
little sick by the river so I think it
shouldn't be that big of a deal well the
next iPod Touch be 3d uh you know that's
a good question
I definitely look to see Apple start to
move into the 3d space because as of
right now we haven't seen them really go
for anything 3d as far as maybe the next
iPod touch
I think it's possible um I'm not really
sure I think it would be a good idea but
Apple is kind of they kind of work on
their own schedules you know so maybe
like build up new technologies when they
think that hey it's a good idea but with
with big things like the 3d what Apple
really likes to do is sit back let
everyone else you know flood the market
with 3d stuff or indeed whatever the
technology is and then however it pans
out so people really love 3d that will
go for it and if people don't or indeed
a little bit later wants a lot of the
problems everything get worked out then
Apple will do it so I think it's
possible that we'll see it and a next
generation iPod Touch I'm just not sure
if we'll say it next year or maybe in a
couple more years once the technology is
mature smart
how many game consoles do I have that's
a good question
you know I don't even know I have quite
a few here I'd have to I have to
probably pause and count them up
actually but that's quite a few mostly
getting boys you hate the PSP too will
slide open and except um DS uh no I
don't now I'm not so sure I doubt that
the PSP too will you know be all digital
download only like the PSP go I think so
many at least I really do I think so
many learn their lesson from that I
think son of realizes hey wait you know
that's not a good idea but also on the
other hand I don't I think the UMD
format really is gotten outdated I mean
it's an optical disc drive and then
something well of course it was designed
really well back in the day
for today there's really no need to have
you know a spinning disc and all the
parts and everything that entails so I
doubt do not think that they will have a
UMD you know maybe just to slide it into
the PSP too that would be surprised if
there's some sort of add-on that you
know
maybe you just goodbye you know an
add-on and then that way you could use
your um DS but I love I do not think
that the PSP 2 will support them console
gaming versus PSP gaming or PC gaming
that's a pretty decent question um the
thing is I think both of them have their
strengths and weaknesses and I
personally I really do like PC gaming
for quite a few different reasons you
know I like a lot of games such as you
know Starcraft or really mate with PC I
mean I couldn't imagine playing
something like that on the console
indeed first-person shooters are the
same way you know a mouse and keyboard
is such a such a great control setup
especially for me on the other hand
though console gaming is really really
nice for a lot of reasons for example
you know when you buy a PC game unless
you have me a really really nice rate a
lot of time you don't necessarily know
how well it will work and all this cut
stuff whereas when you buy a game for
mega the xbox360 you put it in its gonna
work you know that so I think they both
do have their advantages and of course
the console on the console side you do
have a lot of you know franchises here
you know specific to that whereas the PC
really doesn't have a whole lot I mean
does have a few things so she's like you
know Sims which actually is a Sims is
the main think of PC Starcraft except
etc but I think that I mean most gamers
are gonna have a console and a PC so it
really depends on what kind of games
left to play and that was pretty much a
non-answer but that's just kind of my
opinion will kiss p21 Android now that
is a good question I've never been a lot
of talks and I want to get into this
I'll probably just save it for another
video
there have been one talks about a
supposed PSP phone that would actually
run Android now as far as if that's you
know that's feasible I do think it is
you know whether the PSP 2 itself not
now without a phone will actually run
Android honestly I had no idea I think
it would be a pretty interesting idea I
love Android as an operating system
however whether we'll actually see it or
not I'm not really sure I think it would
be very very cool as far as you know
being able to download all sorts of you
know acin or anything you know instant
access to all that stuff I think it'd be
a great idea about just not so sure so
he's gonna go ahead and go through with
it so any other guys that's it for this
