desktops usually I take a look at the
big beefy gaming rigs so sure it's great
to have a lot of graphics horsepower and
a ton of storage however sometimes I
like to take a look at something just a
little bit smaller so this is a complete
mini PC or at least it says that on the
box this is an Intel nut this is about
the cheapest version of the nut that you
can buy just ready to go as a box
however there are different models that
are even cheaper if you don't mind
supplying your own Drive and windows or
if you need more power you can also get
these things with cry threes in quiet 5
so inside the box we get the nook itself
so these are really helpful little
computers so as you can see it is
actually really tiny and it really does
fit in the palm of your hand so the idea
here is that this is really meant for
more basic tasks such as Excel or web
browsing I'm curious what we can
actually do it it also comes with a base
amount so because this is so small in
theory you could just pop this right
onto the back of a monitor we also have
a pretty small power adapter so all
inside that we have all the different
international adapters depending on what
country you're from and that's retention
for the actual embossing take a look
around the Nook and you'll see it's a
pretty cool little piece of text so
first we have a pair of USB 3 ports one
of which will charge your devices even
when the nuts off and on back you have
two more USB ports we have optical flash
3.5 audio out a VGA port Gigabit
Ethernet as well as HDMI and what's cool
about this is that's actually HDMI 2.0
which means that this time we'll PC can
do 4k 60 Hertz output so what's nice
about the milk is that it really is just
so portable so inside my bag here I have
everything I need for a full desktop
setup so I have a wireless keyboard with
a trackpad as well as all the stuff I
need to actually get the Nook up and
running which includes the tiny power
adapter and the Nook itself inside the
milk is rocking an intel celeron j34 55
quad core processor 2 gigabytes of
memory and 30 cube gigs of storage now
that might not sound like a lot
Cobra Melanie can you upgrade to those
core i3 and i-5 models if you do be more
horse power but on top of that you can
easily upgrade this guy with additional
land and storage so the Nook is meant to
be fairly easy to open so if you get a
bare-bones version you actually have to
open it up put things in like memory and
a hard drive but even this one even
though it is premature a to go out of
the box
does have some upgrade option so if you
take the four screws on the bottom out
we have access to the two and a half
inch drive bay below that not only can
we get at the Wi-Fi card which this
already has installed but also the
memory so this nut has two gigs of RAM
pre-installed however it's easy enough
to just pop this out and upgrade it with
four or even a gigabytes no problem so
since this guy only has three gigs of
storage built in it's easy enough to
just throw in an SSD or by just any kind
of regular hard drive so all you do is
line it up and should click right in the
place but simple as that we have upgrade
or not with a full SSD and now all we
have to do is just screw the top handle
back on and we're up and running so well
then this might not be the most powerful
PC in the world and actually can handle
some light gaming such as minecraft so
we're out doing around 40 to 50 frames
per second here no no we're not ready to
play crysis on ultimate setting however
as long as you keep in mind this is a
$200 mini PC then actually can handle
some light gaming now on top of that you
can actually upgrade the performance a
little bit by adding an additional gem
of RAM it might not make a huge
difference but by running this thing a
dual-channel you should get a little bit
more performance out of it something
else you can do with some milk is game
stream so it has dual band AC Wi-Fi
which means that even if you don't have
a connected via ethernet it should be
fairly easy to stream other devices in
your house such as an Xbox one
Oh Cooper whatever what oh yeah the
ports of might not be the most demanding
game as far as latency goes what's
actually not bad here so while I'm
straining I'm very high setting it's not
quite as crisp as I was playing on an
actual Xbox one but the thing is this
could be anywhere my house so even
though I for example I have the Xbox
behind me this could be in another room
all together and then that could be a
sort of separate gaming setup it works
pretty well the Nook is a pretty cool
little PC so what do you want something
that's for sincere use you want
something that's a little bit portable
or you don't need a giant desktop to be
able to do basic stuff like web browsing
the nut might be worth a look so what do
you guys think definitely be sure to let
me know in the comments below and I will
catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
