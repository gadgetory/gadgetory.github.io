showing you how to jailbreak on iOS 4.1
using snow breeze so guys in case you
missed it I did do a video just a little
while back I just kind of wonder you
guys away from snow breeze there were a
lot of problems however I hate snow the
developer of snow buries has went ahead
and fixed pretty much all of these and
in the meantime I've been testing it and
I have found no problem so I'm feel just
fine to go ahead and give you guys a
full tutorial so anyway guys this is a
course that's 4.1 jailbreak and it will
work for pretty much all devices except
for the iPod Touch 4th generation and
the iPhone 4 and the iPad all of the
devices that does support although in
different cases is a little bit
different so unlike most chill breaks
where you know it's really pretty
straightforward as far as what devices
support it's it's a little bit uh
thinness a little bit complicated so
guys want to go ahead and do is instead
of spending five minutes just trying to
talk three guys through what its
supports and what it doesn't instead on
go ahead just point you guys I'm gonna
go ahead and write the entire thing down
and put it in the description of this
video now there are different
circumstances for all devices so take
for example the iPod Touch 2nd
generation which I'll be showing you
today it's pretty simple all you do is
just need to be pre jailbroken or you
don't even or you can just go ahead and
run a different program I ran now it all
the way goes up to for example the iPod
Touch 3rd generation and iPhone 3GS
which needs you to be on three point one
point two so again guys take a look at
the description read through pick out
make sure that you pick out your device
properly and that's go ahead and show
you guys how to do it okay so let's
begin with the August step of
downloading the program so it's pretty
simple go ahead and come over to I hate
snow comm and you click on the snow
breeze link and I of course will have
the link in the description as well you
wouldn't just hit that it'll take you
through this page basically all you need
to do is go ahead and just click
download for Windows and this snow
breeze is Windows only currently so if
you're looking to use it and you have a
Mac or you have a lunch computer you
just borrow someone else's the Windows
computer somehow just go ahead get on
Windows then go ahead and download the
program so once you've done that it's
pretty simple all you need to do is go
ahead and open up the program ok so once
you had the program open a little box
should open up saying check for updates
you just downloaded this you shouldn't
have to however it doesn't hurt to go
ahead and just click make sure that
there are no updates maybe you know bugs
and glitches might be fixed
I'm betting right go ahead just hit okay
that's going it next so the first thing
you need to do is pick simple or expert
mode now this is pretty simple go ahead
and pick expert mode it's not all that
difficult and it does give you a lot of
extra options so go ahead in addition if
you have an iPhone 3GS or an iPod Touch
3rd generation you will need to click X
promote so I don't go ahead just click
on that and hit next now at this point
you're going to go ahead and need to
find your IPSW file now this is the
firmware which obviously is going to be
4.1 but this is going to be your
firmware for your device so odds are
you're going to have it on your computer
if you don't know where it is just go
ahead and Google you know if you have an
iPhone 3GS 4.1 go ahead and just Google
that or whatever it is that you need
that should give you all the answers you
need
so at this point go ahead and just pick
out your IP SW so as you can see here I
do have it right here
my 4.1 and obviously this is using my
iPod Touch second generation go ahead
hit open and hit next ok so at this
point it will pop up with both depending
on what your device is it'll pop up with
some sort of dialogue so if you have an
iPod Touch 2nd generation which is what
I have here you need to go ahead and
pick out if it's an iPod NV model or m/c
so definitely go ahead and pick out the
correct jailbreak and I will say that if
you have an NC model it will be a
tethered so you know you'll have to kind
of keep that in mind you know I do have
the MB so it's no big deal so go ahead
and hit next and now there are quite a
few options I tell you what you don't
have to go through any of these but I
recommend go ahead and go through take a
look at what you want to do I'm not go
ahead and go through it pretty quickly
here so you can go ahead and activate
the iPhone you can do all kinds of stuff
like that
however if Y I'm going to do I'm just go
ahead and pick a battery percentage and
native multitasking you can go ahead and
put background wallpaper again you can
activate your phone you can do a lot of
things but for this time I'm going to do
these two of course feel free to do
whatever you like and at this point in
go ahead and add custom apps custom
sources all that kind of stuff today I'm
gonna go ahead and do that it's pretty
simple to do it from inside the device
but you know if you have you know maybe
a custom patents you want to download
whatever it's pretty simple to go ahead
and do it front inside of Smokey's and
that lastly we can go ahead and pick out
the boot logo and recovery logo again
you can go ahead and pick out now this
is not for all devices but you go ahead
and pick out so you know you want to go
get
custom boot logo custom recovery logo go
ahead and feel free to pick out whatever
you like I'm gonna go ahead just stick
with the standard but not a big deal and
that's pretty much it so now we go ahead
and click build IPSW and hit next so at
this point so go ahead and build the
IPSW depending on how powerful your
computer is and that's gonna take
anywhere from you know just a couple
minutes to quite a while so go ahead
just sit back shell let your computer go
through its thing and I'll be right back
as soon as it's done
okay so snowberries just finished up now
at this point they're actually two
different ways that you can do this and
now depending on your device if you have
an iPhone 3G or an iPod Touch second
generation you and you're not jailbroken
already you will need to run I read now
basically what it'll do is once snow
breeze finishes up it'll go ahead and
ask you I accidentally shot the camera
before that but uh well go ahead and ask
you whether or not you're already
jailbroken if you're already having
jailbroken like I am here actually I'm
already on 4.1 I'm just doing that
I'm just jailbreaking again just show
you guys how to do it I'm already
jailbroken doesn't matter what firmware
you're on your jailbroken go ahead and
hit yes and you can go ahead and get out
now if you haven't jo broken yet go
ahead and hit no and it will run you
through I Reb it's guys it's a really
simple program basically just need to
put your iPod Touch or iPhone into DFU
mode but it's got a great tutorial there
so you just follow up that really simply
run through that and then you'll be here
so either way
snow breeze you should finish up with
snow routes and come into iTunes now at
this point what one way or the other I'm
sorry by my white balance is terrible um
one way that you should have your iPod
or iPhone connected to iTunes at this
point is pretty simple you know I need
to go ahead if you're on a you're on a
Mac go ahead and hit hold option and
left click restore
if you're on Windows go ahead and hit
shift and restore so I'm going to do
that right now and let's just go ahead
and find your IP SW actually why not
really sure why I just told you to do it
on that because obviously Windows only
but if you're obviously it's gonna be on
your desktop the IPSW I think I need to
do is hit open and then just give iTunes
a few minutes so guys I'm gonna be right
back but I Tunes run through again just
let it finish up I'll be right back as
soon as it's done okay guys so we just
finished up and sitting I'm thinking all
my stuff over but as you guys can see
and here's Game Center in there Sidious
oh there we go guys that's it for my
tutorial of how do you snow priests on
iOS 4.1 I do have to say I'm pretty
impressed you know the first time I know
I'm a pretty late in making this video
but of course when I tried it before it
wasn't working I absolutely the last one
to do was recommend a jailbreak that was
not going to work for you guys
you know cause your problems or anything
like that but obviously I've tested snow
Bruce quite few times now that's been
updated I have absolute zero problems
but of course if you do have any
problems feel free to go ahead and post
them in the comment section below and
I'll try to get to as many of you as I
can
anyway guys I hope you enjoyed and
