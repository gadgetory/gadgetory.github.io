Haswell core i3 s have just hit and so I
figured this would be a great time to do
a comparison between it and the new core
i5 to see which is best for your gaming
dollar to start we have the Intel Core
i3 41:30
this is a dual core has well part with
hyper threading and it's got a base
clock speed of 3.4 gigahertz for $130
jump up to the core i5 46 70 K and
you'll get a quad core CPU again based
on as well but with a clock speed they
can boost up to 3.8 gigahertz stock with
the option to overclock if you want to
push it higher for a solid mid-range
card we've got the 2 gigabyte EVGA GTX
650 Ti boost which is a card I really
like for the price the three gigabyte
MSI Radeon 79 which gives plenty of
performance for typical 1080p gaming and
finally the beastly three gigabyte EVGA
GTX 780 which is one of the fastest
single GPU cards you can buy right now
before we get into the gaming benchmarks
I ran each CPU through Senna bench since
they're both based on the same
architecture the core i5 nearly wins
when using a single core thanks to the
higher boost clocks but when you take
all the cores into account hyper
threading helps some but the core i3
still falls behind so on paper the i-5
clearly has the advantage but how does
it stack up when you're actually gaming
starting with the 650 Ti boost we have
the fire stripe benchmark inside 3dmark
and unsurprisingly there's not much of a
difference here considering the $100
price premium battlefield 3 shows even
less of a difference of only about 2
frames per second Crysis 3 is one of the
most demanding games out but it's almost
entirely GPU bound here as this is
essentially a time BioShock Infinite is
basically the same story with the 650 Ti
boost both CPUs are simply good enough
Metro last light finally shows the core
i5 pulling ahead by about 10% which
makes sense as it's the most CPU bound
game I test with unsurprisingly at this
price point there really just isn't much
difference between the core i3 and i-5
now sure it is a little bit faster but
for the most part considering that $100
price premium it's really not going to
be worth it however what
when we throw some extra GPU horsepower
at it now with a Radeon 7095 strike and
we start to see the core i5 pull out a
bit of a lead here jumping back into
battlefield 3 we're looking at mostly
the same story though with a pretty
minimal difference Crysis 3 is back to
being within the margin of error for a
tie however BioShock Infinite is helped
along a bit by the quad core i5 but even
here we're only looking at about a 5
percent improvement even with the more
beefy GPU in Metro last light we're
still only looking at a fairly small
difference in performance even with a
fairly powerful graphics card the
Haswell core i3 really does put in a
good showing however now let's go for
some serious overkill with the GTX 780
and fire strike we're finally seeing
some substantial gains and performance
of over 10% battlefield 3 is also
starting to see a small boost although
both CPUs have no problems keeping the
FPS well over 60 Crysis 3 continues to
be extremely GPU bound though even with
a six hundred and fifty dollar GTX 780
BioShock Infinite is just like
Battlefield we do see an improvement but
since the graphics are already maxed out
the difference between 90 and 100 frames
per second is mostly academic finally
with Metro last light we see the biggest
improvement yet with nearly twenty more
frames per second with the core i5
compared to the core i3 the best way to
sum up this video is that you shouldn't
underestimate the new core i3 sure it
might only be a dual core part however
that hyper-threading definitely does do
a lot to improve the performance in
games bring it very close to the much
more expensive core i5 so if you're
building a gaming PC with anything less
than a crossfire sli setup I would say
the core i3 is absolutely worth a look
however what do you guys think would you
use a core i3 in your next build would
you maybe get something a little bit
more beefy like Core i5 definitely be
sure to let me know what you guys are
thinking in the comments below anyway if
you enjoyed definitely be sure to

become one of the guys and always be
kept up to date with the latest and
greatest anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
