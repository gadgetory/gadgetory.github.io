here with the top five worst phones ever
so last week I did the top five worst
laptops and a lot of you really liked
that video and wanted me to do more so
today I'm going to go over some of the
waters phones that have ever been made
coming in at number five is the
blackberry storm from 2008 now this was
a very different time the iPhone had
only been out for about a year or so and
a lot of the other manufacturers were
slowly starting to catch up so for
starters the screen was based on an
older type of technology called
resistive it also used a brand new thing
called sure press in theory it sounds
pretty good when you touch the screen it
actually goes inside the phone just a
little bit which gives you it's feeling
that you're actually touching something
in real life unfortunately it mostly
felt like you were breaking the screen
on the phone and in general it just did
not work at all on top of that the
BlackBerry OS was really not designed
for a touchscreen and the fact that I
lacked a feature is simple as Wi-Fi made
the storm not only a failure but at
least in my opinion one of the major
reasons why rim is in such trouble today
and number four we have the Motorola
ROKR e1 from 2005 now this one has a
very interesting backstory it was a
Motorola collaboration with Apple and in
fact if you wanted to you could almost
call this the very first iPhone sort of
back in September of 2005 Steve Jobs
walked out on stage at the annual Apple
event and announced this rocker phone
well I'm sure it was great to ditch your
iPod and play all your awesome iTunes
music on your phone unfortunately had
some major problems for one it was
limited to 100 songs regardless of how
much storage space you actually had on
the phone couple that with the fact that
it was basically a normal Motorola phone
with a slightly iPod like interface and
sales didn't not do too well leading
Apple Motorola to break up and Apple
went on to make some other phones that
were slightly better coming in at number
three is the Kyocera echo from 2011 now
this was from the start a very very
weird phone basically the idea was hey
one screen is good on a phone so why not
have two so that's what they did so
there was a normal 3.5 inch display up
front but with a hinge you could pull it
out and instead of finding a keyboard
you would find another 3.5 inch display
now it wasn't all bad once you put the
screens together it was actually like
having a 4.7 inch tablet in your pocket
unfortunately the app support was
absolutely non-existent thanks to the
fact that it was running a pretty much
standard build of Android 2.2 when you
put the not too useful second screen
away which you were left with
a very thick and bulky phone that had
the screen offset to the left side which
made it look very weird when you didn't
have that second display out on top of
that battery life was terrible
in fact just to explain how bad the
battery life was they included two
batteries in the box when you bought it
not a good sign coming in at number two
is the Nokia ngage from 2003 basically
what this was was a normal Nokia phone
mixed with something like a Game Boy
Advance to create a phone that you could
carry around all day but also play some
games on sound familiar unfortunately
there were quite a few problems with the
N Gage and yes I have one
don't don't judge me so for starters
Nokia announced that in the first two
weeks of being on sale they shipped over
400,000 that sounds pretty good right
except when someone actually looked into
it they had shipped 400,000 but as far
as how many people actually bought them
only 5,000 were sold in the United
States and about 800 in the United
Kingdom oops
amazingly enough because of this not a
whole lot of games ever actually showed
up so instead of being able to download
them you actually had to buy the
physical cards which looks basically
like SD cards now the big problem was
was that when you actually wanted to
change games you had to shut the phone
off pull the back panel off take the
battery out and then slide the card in
behind the battery as if all of this
wasn't bad enough the engage was
actually not a very good phone either as
to actually be able to hear what the
other person was saying and make a
proper call you kind of need to hold it
up to your ear like this which quickly
gave it the nickname the taco phone so
defi sad to say the taco phone didn't
last too long on the market coming in at
number one is the Microsoft Kin now this
was supposed to be a big deal for
Microsoft as they spent over 1 billion
dollars developing the pair of phones
however after I record 48 days on sale
they were discontinued yeah you heard me
right after 48 days and spending 1
billion dollars Microsoft goes yeah
nevermind so has this massive meltdown
happen well these really were not meant
to be smartphones instead they were
meant to be more for texting and that
kind of thing as they really liked a lot
of things like a calendar app being able
to I am and even an app store pretty
much what you got was what you got even
with all these problems you were
expected to pay for it like a smartphone
so Verizon required a data plan and with
the pricing being 50 to 100 dollars on a
two-year contract you could get a much
more capable smartphone for that same
money so all this combined made the
Canali one
the worst phones ever but also one of
the hugest flops in all of phones pretty
much period anyway I'm curious to know
what's the worst phone that you guys
have ever used definitely be sure to let
me know in the comments below if you
guys are interested in more feel free to
check out the last week's episode where
I went over the top 5 worst laptops of
all time if you guys enjoyed definitely
