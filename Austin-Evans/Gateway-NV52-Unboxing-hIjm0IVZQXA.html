Buy and picked up this gateway NV 52
I've been looking for a computer for a
long time but after seeing this one for
the price space I'm just crazy it just
really looks like a really pro computer
so yeah but no box thing alright check
out the secured you see all this took
forever to cut through but you just got
to cut it and not cut that flap it took
forever but yeah what too bad what open
up one of these Hey cardboard array
cardboard insert here toss that and now
instantly we have the computer called
line it up in plastic wrap that's it
they're actually really nice and big but
let's go ahead and set this aside and
show you guys what always comes in the
box okay so first we have a thing for
how to upgrade to Windows 7 which it
definitely is great because this does
come with Vista but you use this I'm
sure they're coding here or something
you use this and then I can go ahead and
get a free upgrade to Windows 7 which is
really nice we have office interesting
just you know schematics and that sort
of thing
we have started a guide which might come
with CDs or something mm-hmm not parties
got some manuals and warranty
information that sort of thing this
let's go ahead and open this so we have
a charger it's good this is the AC cable
you know your standard ball here plug
the AC adapter
all right have an Acer laptop you don't
know gateway is owned by Acer so this
will actually work for my HP laptop as
well and vice versa so that's pretty
cool that's um we have the AC adapter
again this is 100% identical to the one
I have which is actually pretty cool
because the one I have is almost broken
and then we have the battery go ahead
this is a six cell battery which is
pretty standard for my laptops
it's got good have to it um see here
don't see what 4400 milliamp hours
that's pretty good and just slots right
into laptop so we'll put that
interesting
Wow let's get to the laptop itself this
way just kind of put in here is a 15
inch Oh gateway actually can let me go
ahead and write off some respects for
you I won't think about it
it's a 15 inch gateway NV 52 it has the
dual core AMD processor got 4 gigabytes
of RAM 320 gigabytes of hard drive space
Wireless in following tons more than
forgetting nothing in here but those
gratings close up so you have a good
spot so it's just missing plastic wrap
oh wow just hold me like this it's a big
laptop like this that's 15-inch but it's
really nice and light I'm not surprised
so you can see here in Michigan huh see
that it's really nice it's actually
brown not so sure how well the cameras
picking that up it's brown with a nice
gateway logo pull off this always so
satisfying and wow look at this this is
really nice of go ahead and see so you
can see that really nice pattern there
of course my camera's not wanting to
focus very well but of course you have
the Gateway logo so yeah so it's a big
laptop I gotta say it's a big laptop I
have a 14 inch I'm more than a small
laptops but this was a it's nice it's
well I think it's about an inch and a
half thick um for something this long it
doesn't seem like that it seems pretty
decent um so yeah actually let's go
ahead and give you guys a rundown of
everything that's going on okay so
starting from the side and we just have
you know we have the power adapter yeah
gigabit ethernet which is nice now VGA
we also have HDMI which is really nice
you can just hook this up to your plasma
TV or whatever you did to go to USB 2.0
we have a microphone and we have a
headphone and then this is the card
reader a dummy card you put in all your
memory cards you know I don't know off
the top of my head what HP steps I know
at least SD I think XD no big deal um so
really nice and slick on the front
nothing really at all this really gives
you good sense of how thin it is you
know an inch and a half is kind of thick
for some computers but something that's
this wide it's really pretty soft
let's go to the side there's some stuff
surprise though other plastic inside um
so then we have a DVD Drive that's right
dual layer DVD may it burns as well
obviously the computers not
we have two USB 2.0 which makes a total
four which is fantastic that's one of
the big things because I'm always
running at USB ports and this is a
pretty big computer so we'll probably
stay on a desk for a long time we have a
modem and then we have the power button
now let's go ahead and open this thing
up mmm comes right up and here we go so
that you can see here um it's really
nice to see here we've got a keyboard
kind of plastic of it we have the
keyboard and if you can see here this is
we've got a member pet here so like I
said it's a 15 inch so you know you've
got enough room for the full keyboard
which actually blends around these keys
you can see the keys were really nicely
shaped they're pretty cool we have the
number pad here
which I don't really find that a big
deal for me but go ahead and show you
guys a kind of a unique feature with
this laptop okay so this is a nice size
pad and you see it's pretty offsets left
but look down here this is the left and
right click can't really do anything the
middle and you see there's the gateway
though though maybe you know I was kind
of leery about that that kinda seemed a
little weird cuz I mean this is the
holder you can't push here or up here
obviously you can tap but I thought it
was kind of weird but you know I've used
it some not on this one but I've used it
on a demo and it works really well so
not a big deal I'm just going I'm coming
to spring yeah oh listen I've got all
kinds of stuff on it but but show you
guys the screen if I can get in um it's
a 15 inch screen like I said and if I
can get up here we got a webcam as well
which is nice seeing it it's good
quality
um but yeah um so let me go ahead and
see if inspects unlock said it's got the
dual core ATI Athlon processor she was
bleep riding a 2.1 make her gigahertz
once it comes with Vista Home Premium
64-bit like I said with the windows 7
upgrade definitely big deal
and yeah it's got the ATI graphics
well so that's definitely a big plus so
guys that's just about it this is my new
gateway computer and yeah thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
