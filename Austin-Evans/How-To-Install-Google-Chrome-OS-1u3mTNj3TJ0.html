today I'm here with a video that I think
a lot of you guys are really going to
like I'm going to show you guys how to
easily and free download and install
Google Chrome OS now first off the bat
I'm going to say this is not anywhere
close to what Google Chrome OS is going
to look like well it's going to look
similar but this does not work very well
at all it's really early this probably
be released for another year so you got
really keep that in mind this is mostly
just to you know mess around with it and
take a look anyway I'm going to show you
guys how to install it and yeah mess
around with it soon let's get this one
started
okay guys this is pretty simple you're
going to need to download a couple of
programs assuming you don't already have
them and it won't take that long it'll
take a little bit you'll have to
download a few things install it but it
shouldn't be too bad
so the way first thing we're going to
need obviously is Chrome OS so I have a
bunch of links in the description but
I'm just going to be tap two links to
download Chrome OS depending on how you
want to do it there's a torrent and a
let me just before I get all bunch
questions yes this is 100% legal don't
worry
this is totally this is totally legit
it's open source and someone compiled it
and it does work so don't no worries
so anyway there's a two different ways
that you can download it you can
download it via torrent which is for the
purpose of this this is what I am using
so it does work so you just go out we'll
have a link to the Pirate Bay so you
just download it it works no problem or
you can download it download it from
gadget this one is very simple you do
need to create an account but it takes
roughly ten seconds and then you can
download it and then you will do you
will need to pick the right version of
it to download but I will get to that in
just a second so go ahead get either one
of them going and then we'll go ahead
and go to the next step okay so now that
you have Chrome OS downloaded and I will
note that the only thing that you're
going to need to do if you decide to
download it from gadget is be sure that
you click the VirtualBox option there is
another option for VMware and that can
work sometimes but generally just go
ahead and be sure to download the
VirtualBox version so yeah it's not it's
not it's not like you're going to miss
it's really simple
so anyway now we won't you need
something to use Chrome OS in this what
we're going to be using today is
VirtualBox okay VirtualBox is a really
cool free and open-source virtualization
software that will allow you to run
different operating systems inside your
own so basically it basically runs the
entire offerings
just like a program this does work for a
lot of different things I could run XP I
could run Ubuntu or I can run chrome
Chrome OS okay so just come in here now
I'll have links to all of this in the
description come to this page and
download whichever version of VirtualBox
you need so you have Windows if you have
Mac or if you have Linux so download it
for whatever you have and then you're
good and next we're going to need I'm
just going to let make sure that you
guys do have this going to need WinRAR
or something similar to unpack your
Chrome OS file I'm sure almost all you
guys will have either WinRAR or
something similar but just quick
forewarning you will have to unzip it
okay so anyway now at this point you
need to have make sure that your Chrome
OS is fully downloaded and you need to
make sure that your VirtualBox is
downloaded and installed okay so next
we're going to come over to our chrome
file so I've just got right here so
you're going to need to unzip it okay so
I'm just going to open it up and you can
see here here's my WinRAR and you just
click it and then you just extract it or
you can drag it out to your desktop
which is Amelie what I'm using but it
doesn't really matter you just need to
have it in a place where it's not going
to be ever deleted or anything you might
want to make a special file or something
just be sure it's in a place that it
won't accidentally get deleted
it's just unpack it it shouldn't take
maybe more than three or four minutes
and you're good so this is our file okay
so now let's go ahead and show you guys
how to use chrome at OS inside
VirtualBox okay
so now after you know that you have
everything set up let's go ahead and
install Chrome OS okay it's pretty
simple from here on out especially if
you've use VirtualBox before but if not
it's not a big deal I'll be right here
to walk you through it as you can see I
already have it installed but I'm going
to go ahead and do a new install just
show you guys what I'm doing
okay so if this is your first
installation of VirtualBox you won't see
either this and is pretty much all we
blank but all you need to do is close
just click new okay so I'll bring up the
wizard go ahead and just hit next now
you need to name it so
it really matter preferably you know you
want to type in maybe like Chrome OS
just something that you know you can
remember although you probably probably
won't be a big deal but just name it
something so Chrome OS test is what I'm
going to do so now you come down to the
OS type this is really simple just click
on the main operating system I'll give
you a drop-down menu go ahead and hit
Linux and Ubuntu will be pre-installed
I'm sorry pre selected now go ahead this
is the main rate way to do it don't even
there's not going to be Chrome OS on
this list so just leave it as Ubuntu a
horrifying let's go ahead hit next okay
now you're going to need to pick the RAM
this this is kind of going to be
dependent on your computer the more RAM
you can give the better
it depends on how much RAM you have I'd
recommend a half a gig of ram to give
give to your operating system if you
don't know you might want to open up
task manager if you're on a Windows
computer and just take a look at what
your RAM is if you don't know how much
you have in it already and just you know
pick out like maybe about half or so as
long as you're not just you know just
punching at a random number okay so I'm
just go ahead and put in a gig right now
I have plenty around this computer but
it shouldn't matter too much as long as
you have more than 512 megabytes of RAM
so go ahead and hit next so now this is
this is going to be a little different
if you have used Virtual Box before you
probably won't have done this so you
know you don't have need to read any of
this basically it's going to come down
normally you would hit create new hard
disk but now we're going to use use
existing ok so I have this but I'm going
really pickett so you see this little
folder icon right here go ahead and
click that it's going to pull it up now
we're going to come up here is the
virtual media manager come up to the top
left and click Add so you're going to
hit it now I'm just going to come out to
the desktop where we know that our VMDK
file which is what we just downloaded is
there so just go ahead and select it and
click open
give it a minute and then there you go
so we're go ahead and going to go ahead
and hit select ok so now we have it
should have this selected and you should
have your Chrome OS image selected okay
so what it next
and then you're going to hit finish okay
so now you see it flashed real quick and
then you see right here it says Chrome
OS test okay so once you know that it
does it's showing blue and you obviously
everything's right you didn't get any
error messages ready to go
so all you need to do is just double
click it okay if I can hit it and a
little menu will pop up now basically
you just need to sit back and wait
Chrome OS does is once it comes out it
will does say more like 8 second boot
times but you are running it inside your
own computer so your computer is
happening around two things at once so
give it some time it might take 10 15 20
seconds it's not going to be too bad
and yeah just wait for it ok so you get
this kind of crazy screen and now you
see Chrome chromium OS ok so you're
ready all you're going to need to do is
punch in the user name and password this
is going to need to be looked at tied
into your own Google account and you can
make a separate google account if you
like it doesn't really matter all but
all you're gonna need to do punch in the
Google account email so let's say it's
Google at you know google.com or
whatever your email address is and then
put in the password go ahead and hit
enter and you'll be all set so the guys
that is how to freely download chromium
or OS or is it going to be called Chrome
OS onto your computer
real easy might take a little bit of you
know finagling but hopefully you guys
should get it real easy and yeah anyway
thanks for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
