the verizon iphone event this is gonna
be a really short video because it was a
really short press conference on the
gist of it is that there is going to be
a verizon iphone it will be available in
February 10th now if you're a verizon
customer and pre-order on the third
however for everyone else you go ahead
and pick it up at Apple stores go ahead
pick it up at apple com you can also go
ahead and get it at verizon retail
stores on the 10th now a lot of people
are expecting a lot of things at this
conference to be honest it was very very
simple now I think the press conference
the major bulk of it was only about
10-15 minutes pretty much all they
talked about was verizon network they
really want to emphasize that the
verizon network could handle the strain
of the iphone and after that it pretty
much that I mean that was just pretty
much it now forced iphone 4 is available
it's not the iphone 5 it's not anything
else it is strictly the iphone 4 on
though they did change the antenna a
little bit supposedly because of the way
the verizon iphone I mean the verizon
network works probably mostly just a
fixing of the antenna and all kind of
stuff as far as all the problems however
though guys this is going to be for all
intents and purposes the iphone 4 on
Verizon there's not going to be just
going to be on 3g they're gonna have any
special features now it is going to be
bundled with a hot spot so you'll
actually be able to go ahead and share
your data which is kind of a cool thing
however not the biggest deal in the
world so guys it will be available at 16
gigabyte iphone will be available for
two hundred dollars and the 32 will be
available for three hundred dollars and
again februari tint is going to be the
day they're gonna be released so
personally I wait for the verizon iphone
for a long time i'm always planned on
getting it and i'm not sure about this
one though because there should be the
iphone 5 or whatever they said to call
it here in a few months and obviously
it's going to be a big improvement so um
i don't know i think that it might be
smart not to get this iphone i'm still
not a little unsure but i definitely
want to know your guys opinion what you
think whether i should get it or not
whether you should get it or not but
yeah so anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
