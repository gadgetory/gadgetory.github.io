This is the Galaxy Note9.
And if you saw my recent video on it,
you'll know that I wasn't
exactly a huge fan.
No, no, it's not because
this is a $1,000 device.
There's going to be lots
more of these phones around,
and in fact, the iPhone X last year
was already hitting
that $1,000 price point,
and while I complained,
it wasn't exactly going
to be a deal breaker.
No, my real issue with the
Note9, why I'm so fired up,
why I had to do a video,
is 'cause this is just
not really a great deal.
It just doesn't make a lot of sense.
Now I understand why
Samsung releases the Note
when they do, right.
The Note comes out in
August, September or so,
and that's a big time for smartphones.
A lot of people are buying new flagships,
of course there is the
iPhone, there's the Pixel,
there's a lot of interest,
and there's a lot of people
buying phones during this time of year.
And yes, for a lot of people,
I don't think the Note9
is worth $1,000,
but it is still one of the
best phones of the year,
and definitely something that
would normally be recommended.
There's just a couple of
major problems with that.
My biggest problem with it
is actually not even the Note itself,
It's this, the Galaxy S9 Plus.
See, a few years ago,
Samsung started to do a little
bit of something different
with their high end flagships.
Previously when they
would launch the Note,
the Note would come
out a few months later,
and it would be a substantial upgrade
over the Galaxy S line.
You'd be getting a much larger display,
of course you're going
to be getting the S-Pen,
a lot of times, you'd actually
be getting some additional features,
like, say, a faster
processor, way bigger battery,
higher screen res.
I mean, it was a major, major upgrade.
Fast forward to 2018,
and we have the Note9.
This is very, very similar to the S9 Plus.
You're getting a 500
milliamp hour larger battery,
you're going to be getting
a .2 inch larger display,
And you are going to be getting the S-Pen.
The S-Pen is a legitimate feature, right.
I think a lot of people do think
that this is worth the price of entry.
But if you're someone
who's new to the ecosystem,
If you're someone who just
wants to get some really nice
high end flagship in 2018, this
S-Pen is going to cost you.
It's gonna cost you in a big way.
I totally understand that
Samsung wants to have
a high end flagship to be sold
during the holiday season, right?
So not only is it going to be
a thing where they wanna sell,
like, 500,000 phones, or whatever it is,
over the holiday season,
but it's also a matter of,
they wanna be able to compete
with the other major
competitors, like the iPhone.
The main issue here,
is that because Samsung wants to be able
to compete with the iPhones
and the Pixels of the world,
they released this sort of
mid, half, weird step with the Note,
And it's just so expensive considering
that it's basically the
same as a six month old
phone that was $800, right?
Like, that's just to me,
that gets me really upset,
because so many people
are spending so much money
on a phone that is not
only going to be obsolete
in six months, but really,
isn't a major difference
for what you could've bought
way, way earlier in the year.
And on top of that, Worst
part is that everyone knows
the S10 is going to be
coming out in a few months.
If there's going to be a plus version,
which is going to be basically
the same size as the Note,
There's so many features
that you're going to have on the S10,
and the Note9 doesn't have any of them.
It's just an S9 plus with an S-Pen
that they're charging you more for.
That was what I was
trying to say in my video.
But I didn't wanna get so fired up,
I wanted to be a little
bit more diplomatic,
I wanted to be a little
bit more reasonable.
But, you put a phone table in front of me,
and I really can't hold back.
And actually, speaking of the phone table,
there's actually a bunch of
phones here that I do think
make a lot more sense than the Note.
First of all, one of the
very interesting ones
that came out right
after the Note, is this,
The Pocophone F1.
This phone has some very
similar features to the Note.
First of all, it's not as good, right.
Straight up, the Note is a better phone.
But this has the same Snapdragon 845,
the most high end sort of
mobile chip you can get.
It's got very similar sort of cooling,
which actually does a really good job.
You've got that same 4,000
milliamp hour battery,
but look, this is less than 1/3 the price.
It's $300 vs 1,000.
- [Man] Hallelujah!
- Yeah I agree.
(clears throat)
Anyway, not only is it going
to be much, much cheaper,
but you're getting very
similar performance.
And you can even step up to
something like the OnePlus 6.
This is going to be a
little bit more expensive,
but it's still $500, half the price.
But I would say, this
is 95% of the experience
for 50% of the price.
On top of that, this is September.
The phone just came out, and yet,
we've got a bunch of new competition
coming right around the corner.
There is going to be a new iPhone,
it's going to be in that
same sort of price bracket.
It's probably going to be
better in a lot of ways
that the Note9 might not
be able to keep up with.
Maybe, maybe not, who knows.
The Pixel 3 is going to be
right around the corner.
It's going to have 500% more notch,
which I'm sure everyone is a big fan of,
but it is also going to be bringing
some high end features to the table.
The awesome software,
which probably going to
be some insane camera.
So it's like, the Note9
is competing against, first of all,
a phone that came out six
months ago, and the S9 Plus.
It's cheaper, it's almost
the exact same thing.
It's competing against much
cheaper Android flagships,
which are way, way, way cheaper,
and deliver a very similar experience,
And it's competing against
brand new flagships,
such as the Pixel, and such as the iPhone,
which in some ways are going to be
at least as good, if not
better, and maybe even cheaper.
Do you see why I'm upset?
Do you see why the Note9
got me all fired up, here.
So if Samsung wants to sell the Note,
and I'm sure they should
because lots of people buy it,
they should do one of two things.
First of all, they should release it
when the S9 comes out, right?
Like there's nothing
fundamentally with the Note
that is not sort of like,
something that they need an
extra six months for, right?
So when the S9 Plus came out,
the Note9 could have
slided in right above it.
Very, very similar phone,
they just added an S-Pen.
Cool, great.
If they don't want to do that,
if they want to release
it six months later,
then make it different.
Don't make the same phone
again six months later,
and charge you $200 more for it.
I get that the S-Pen's cool.
I get it, it's great.
I do like the S-Pen.
But it's not worth another $200.
And it's not worth another $200
when it's gonna be
outdated in a few months.
I'm gonna go, I don't
know, the Apple fanboy,
or whatever it is that everyone says I am.
I'm gonna go play with
the OnePlus 6, actually.
This is the real move right here.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
