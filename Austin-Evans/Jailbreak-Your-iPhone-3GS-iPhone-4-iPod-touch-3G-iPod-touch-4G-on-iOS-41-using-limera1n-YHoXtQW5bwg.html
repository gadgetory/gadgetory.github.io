another jailbreak tutorial so today
we're gonna go ahead and show you guys
how to use lime rain now before I begin
anything I of course want to give you
any other standard stuff be sure to go
ahead and back up your device in iTunes
make sure you don't lose any data or
anything like that
um so the device is lime rain sports I
should go and just open up the site
itself um it will support the iPhone 3GS
the iPhone 4 the iPod Touch 3rd
generation the iPod Touch 4th generation
and finally the iPad
this also is compatible with 4.0 as well
as 4.1 firmware so guys this is going to
be a really simple jailbreak very very
easy to do is only windows only however
though so do keep that in mind if you
have a Mac or lanced computer you will
have to wait just a little bit longer so
yeah let's go ahead just show you now
the first thing obviously is going to be
to download the program so if you do no
go ahead and just take a look I will
link it it's lime rang comm however
currently the download link is down so I
would do all do also have a secondary
link I of course have that in the
description as well so if one is down
even take a look at the other so it's
gonna be really simple today I'll be
doing it with my iPod Touch 4th
generation so I'm go ahead and just open
up the line rain and there it goes it
says make it rain so let's go and just
show you guys how to do it ok so this is
gonna be really simple so again I just
go ahead and show you guys I'm gonna
have my iPod Touch 4th generation
connected via USB it's already been
backed up and just to show you guys I'm
not you know trying to show you anything
it's been freshly restored although I
did try this you do not have to restore
I just did it so I can do the jailbreak
after I've tested it though so anyway
guys all I gotta do is go and click make
it rang just move my key
appear there so you guys can see now
it's gonna be entering recovery so I
wouldn't just walk you guys through it
it does take a couple of minutes but
it's pretty stuff now at this point we
need to hold the home in the power
button and the program shows you
everything so I'm glad just enter DFU
mode so there we go holding the home in
the power button and then we're gonna
hold these for just a few seconds and
then I'm gonna go ahead and release the
power button so there we go now I'm go
ahead and hold the home button until
it's done so again this does not take
just a minute and then we'll go ahead
and enter DFU mode there we go
so
it says in DFU mode wait we're done so
we'll go ahead and just sit here for one
second and iPods going to reboot and
that's gonna go ahead and use the
exploit and there we go as you guys can
see here that was it that lime rain icon
has already appeared and there it goes
it says enjoy your jailbroken iPhone
okay so now there's just a couple of
more things you do need to do
however pretty much all the hard work is
done so that your iPod your iPhone or
iPad is going to shut off so we're going
to go ahead and do is hold the power
button for a minute it's gonna boot up
so hang on one second I'll be right back
as soon as it's done booting okay so
once you have it booted pretty simple
now there's just a couple of minor steps
but you're pretty much done now so go
ahead and you'll find an application
called Lima rain so it's gonna be pretty
simple as can go ahead and say Cydia or
you can uninstall definitely don't do
that just go ahead and click Cydia go
ahead and click it and then hit install
so go ahead and take just a minute to go
and download city and then unpack it
okay so after one last reboot you will
see that we both have city as well as
lime rain so that is that's it you are
now jailbroken now I do want to say one
thing else some people are having
problems with this and it's been kind of
called like a beta or an unstable
whoever I tried this a couple of times
as well as since I blogged I'm still on
live on blogtv I'm had a bunch of people
in a chat try it and I really haven't
heard of a whole lot of problems most
people have had no problem whatsoever
however if you do have a problem feel
free to leave it in the comment section
below and I'll do my best to help you
out anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
