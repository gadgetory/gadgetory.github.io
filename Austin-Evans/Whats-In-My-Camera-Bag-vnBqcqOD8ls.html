my camera bag so I actually had a
request on Facebook last week about no
magic asking little about why I keep my
camera bag I thought I should have be
kind of a cool idea for video so let me
just give you guys a quick overview so
first let start with a bag itself it's a
case logic SLR bag it's actually pretty
small for an SLR but I like it because
it's kind of compact this unit doesn't
weigh 20 pounds it's easy to carry
around and one really good thing I like
about it this is kind of me being weird
I guess but I don't didn't want one of
the bags that said Nikon or something on
it which I don't know just just in my
opinion that's basically like a giant
steal we've got a thousand dollar camera
in here but so yeah let's just go ahead
and just start so just start over on
this side there's a couple of pouches
here I mean this one you'll find I've
got some of my lens caps that's not just
some random accessories we've got some
cable clamps battery protectors all that
kind of stuff but just just mostly just
stuff I like to keep on me but don't
really ever use so on this back but
let's open this up and show you guys all
the goodies so I just have to kind of
tilt that down here see it's nice and
orange number one thing keep is
obviously going to be my camera this is
a Nikon d3100 it's what I use pretty
much all the time for videos pictures
all kind of stuff although obviously
can't use it for this video sometime
filming this that might be a little hard
but yeah this is what I keep around
always I don't have any additional
lenses I've just got the kit lens the
1855 I definitely definitely plan on
picking up some more lenses just haven't
had the money or the time yet so
definitely put plan on expanding it but
even with this lens it's a pretty solid
camera
she just 1080p video Nikon itself if we
dig in a little deeper here you will
find the Nikon strap which I pretty much
hate and definitely do need to get a new
one this is a course it's nice to have a
strap for us like a big heavy cam like
that for example I was at CES it was
really helpful to have a strap you know
just to hang around my shoulder and go
about my business but I tell you what
that is an awful strap I
it um continuing on here you guys will
find my sinews that DCG 10 this is my
backup camera I've done enough video and
then stuff to note is so essential to
have some sort of backup on you at all
times you know it doesn't matter if your
battery died your SD cards full cetera
et cetera always have a backup on you
and this needs to be my primary camera
this is a nice pistol grip it's not on
right now but pistol grip and camcorder
what's really quite well it takes up
pictures but it takes pretty awful
pictures but it's good 720p video and
this is what I use like I said guys for
like about a year or so since I until I
got my Nikon so set up to the side um we
also have the charger for the Nikon one
thing I really like about the D 3100 is
that you don't have to the camera the
battery does not charge inside the
camera so I'm I have two batteries to
show you guys in a second oh we can
always have one charged up and one in
the camera so that it saved me on more
than one occasion when I need to film
some video and had a dead battery so if
I pull this in here and open up I've got
a few things in this top pouch so I've
got as myself a USB card reader these
are always super handy to have because
you never know you're around a computer
the SD card reader breaks the oh those
are just all kinds of reasons where you
can just pop your SD card and here read
it and no problem at all um a bunch of
stuff in here get some business cards
see you guys see all my information I've
got some extra SD cards
another thing I've learned is that extra
SD cards I can I've got one here extra
SD cards are always super super
important to have it you know I can't
tell you how many times you know you run
out and the last thing you want to do
especially if you're you know filming
something important is run out of memory
so I've got one of those I'm thinking
another one here somewhere um I got an
extra USB Drive that's about it I think
oh yeah I've got one of these little
kind of handy things it's just like a
lens cleaner well it's just outside
microfiber cloth so if I need to you
know white down the lens or white screen
or whatever comes will in handy it's got
a clip I never really use it but oh
that's that um I've got an extra battery
again
like I was saying extra batteries extra
just take extra everything because last
thing you want to do is you have a
problem and you know lose out on
something also got a pin and see what
else do we have here we've got an extra
battery for my can't and my for my Sanyo
I'm gonna need said again and I got
another SD card so hey guys that's it
that's what I kind of keep in my bag not
not really all that important of a video
but I thought you guys might be
interested in checking out all the kinds
of stuff I like to take with me so
anyway guys if you're interested in
seeing any more of this kind of stuff
you want to see you might know the gear
I take or anything like that be sure to
let me know in the comments below and
I'll see what I can do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
