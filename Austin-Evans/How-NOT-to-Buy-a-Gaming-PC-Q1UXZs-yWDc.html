going to find out how not to buy
yourself a gaming PC after years of
doing custom builds I have one question
is it possible to get a decent gaming PC
from a big-box store this is an area
we've checked out before a few months
ago we picked up a $750 pre-built system
from CyberPower that actually wasn't bad
but this time we wanted to step up the
challenge what would happen when we walk
into his store with $600 and ask to see
what they have um
so I'm kind of looking for a light
gaming PC for around 600 this is Ken he
usually lives behind the camera but
today he has a mission immediately the
salesman offers him a $750 CyberPower PC
you know the one we just did a video on
and definitely not inside the saxena
dollar budget soon however another
option comes up
I'll point terabyte of hard drive
getting at four point six out of nine
hundred and twenty four reviews oh
that's that's really good people must
really like it what'd it do it I can
price met two weeks ago okay going for
four forty nine oh wow okay would you
mind if I called my dad first cool dad
AMD FX forty three hundred eight gigs of
RAM one terabyte 7200 rpm hard drive Rx
for 6450 dad doesn't approve okay let's
uh I guess we'll keep looking then
perceive you as my real dad he'd get me
in GT X 1080 TI do you want anything
one Starbucks excursion later ken was on
to another big box PC store where the
halls were filled with promise well if
you looked hard enough at least really
oh yeah I'd imagine yeah let me actually
call my dad first core i3 6100 t eight
gigs of RAM one terabyte hard drive gtx
750ti
yeah for 449 that's what I thought are
there any other alternatives
alright 480 before gigs and they also
have a soft state hard drive this is a
great good machine but yeah so
originally was 700 and I think he's
gonna take off like 30 40 bucks cuz it's
a floor model so the graphics card is
basically worth more than half of the
price of this computer I'm like it's
actually not a pet to you alright that
actually does look bad so HP Pavilion is
a quite fine sticker yeah what's the
deal so this is an HP Pavilion something
something something something great
really long name it has a core i5 our X
480 480 ok 8 gigabytes of RAM alright it
has a 1 terabyte hard drive with a 100
gig m2 SSD okay yeah so how much was
this it was 664 that seems like a pretty
good deal so you said it's a 480 it's a
core i5 is that skylake is that KB Lake
3400 so it's kind like okay so it's a
little bit of an older system like a
2016 why did you get a floor unit
because this was the only one that they
had left because everyone apparently
that was my case for yeah everyone I was
looking for those cards just swiped the
computers for the cards probably just
sold everything else this is very small
480 it also has new branding on it so I
wonder who actually made the card 300
bucks
what's in 80 plus bronze unit 300 Watts
actually is that's really low
for a 480 I bet it'd probably just
barely works I'll do there's a card
reader and USBC up front
well USB yeah right there oh wow I did
not even see that Wow like 660 bucks
this seems like a pretty good deal I
mean you've got Wi-Fi you've got an SSD
you've got a solid graphics card
congratulations you successfully
defeated the the big box stores but I
actually want to see what we can
actually do at this I been session gonna
be pretty good at gaming first test will
be rocket League and uh good feeling
about this so right now yeah we're 120
frames per second on high at 1080 so
what were you expecting when you ended
about a + or sorry mmm random PC part
retailer what were you actually
expecting to get scammed next we have
dirt for now this is another game that's
fairly new that I think the 480 should
be able to handle pretty well um when
you look at a system like this for about
like 650 bucks what you're getting here
something that you really should be able
to play at 1080 on high with most games
to be fair all those stores that we
visited had options that were just
really overpriced that were basically
like that like we're talking $1000 for
like a 10 60 and you obviously want to
avoid that kind of stuff right I think
the mid-range is probably a little more
of the sweet spot of when you're buying
something that's pre-built
it can actually sometimes make a little
bit a sense as I go flying off so next
we have battlegrounds and cents
ken is way better at this game than I am
once you take it away yeah what God what
settings can actually play on let's find
out cuz backgrounds I know it's been
getting better with optimization but it
still does not well no it'sit's pretty
awful unlike a lot of systems well it's
defaulting to 1080 high that's not bad I
mean we could see how it plays first a
little bit loud but then again I mean
it's a fairly powerful graphics card and
what is not a super well ventilated case
so yeah this is actually running really
well though again 1080p high we're
getting 50 and 60 frames which on pub G
I think is actually not bad not crazy
okay all right so Ken what is your
conclusion here with this whole
experience of trying to actually get a
decent pre-built ganky see the deals
exist
keep your eyes peeled that's really what
it comes down to such great advice just
pay attention and life will be okay hey
look there are a lot of people that will
egg on you for getting a prebuilt PC
when sometimes maybe it is the better
deal this is a good deal look you did a
good job I know you had to shop around a
little bit you had to argue with some
salespeople but you're able to get a
system that honestly is a better deal
than what you actually could get on your
own so I mean the numbers on this and if
you tried to build this system today I
mind you to be a little bit nicer with a
KB like I 5 and rx 580
but it's gonna cost you about 870
dollars now mind you that 580 is way
overinflated in price right but even
once you cut that down you hear some
stuff like the DVD drive and the Wi-Fi
you're still looking at something that's
going to cost you over $700 which is
more than what you paid for this so what
do you guys think about how can date
with the pre-built gaming PC honestly I
think you actually did a lot better than
I was expecting
so thanks dad anyway let us know what
you think in the comments below and we
will catch you in the next one oh maybe
I'll catch you in the next one ken will
probably behind the camera like usual
but you know the way it should be
