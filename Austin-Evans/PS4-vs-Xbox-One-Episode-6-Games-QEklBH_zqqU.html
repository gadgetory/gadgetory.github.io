are tied so it's time to settle things
by looking at the games the Xbox one had
a solid 2015 with some seriously awesome
exclusive titles halo 5 guardians was
probably the biggest and while halo
isn't as big as it once was this is a
solid installment the campaign is a bit
of a sore spot though the story just
doesn't do it but it feels familiar and
halo 1 the Xbox one has never looked
better
there's also Forza Motorsport 6 which is
one of the best racing games out there
it builds on 4 to 5 with a massive
library of cars and serious
customization to really fine-tune your
vehicle's graphically it's on point with
a full 1080p resolution and a nearly
flawless 60 frames output pair with the
meticulously detailed cars it's an
impressive title
another big Xbox one title is rise of
the Tomb Raider it's a semi exclusive
with the PC version just being released
and a ps4 edition coming at some point
later this year
it has a very Uncharted feel which isn't
a bad thing at all there's a lot of epic
action sequences and while it doesn't
have the greatest mechanics it's a fun
game that looks impressively the
PlayStation 4 also had a few big titles
last year until dawn was a surprising
hit it's almost more of an interactive
movie than a traditional game but is a
big fan of telltale style games I'm not
complaining this story looks just like a
normal horror movie but the outcome is
entirely up to you all of the characters
can live or die based on how you play as
a ps4 exclusive it might not be a system
seller but it's definitely worth a look
blood-borne on the other hand is very
much an old-school hardcore game it's
not forgiving in the slightest once you
die you're going right back to the last
checkpoint to make your way back to the
enemy who killed you it's got a serious
sense of style too with an old-school
Victorian look and some giant monsters
you're going to enjoy dying too over and
over and over there are also some big
non exclusive games like fallout 4 while
it feels a little dated it's very much a
sequel to the incredible fallout 3 the
world is massive in the addition of
voice acting is a nice upgrade destiny
is another multi-platform game that
holds up well across the board while new
content has been a little sparse lately
it's still a satisfying shooter with
some serious replayability especially if
you have a few friends to play with Star
Wars Battlefront is another fun
multiplayer focused game there's
definitely some battlefield DNA which
shouldn't be a surprise but it's a lot
more than a simple rescan there is some
exclusive PlayStation content but the
biggest difference is in resolution the
Xbox one tops out at 720p where the ps4
has a more except
900p Just Cause 3 is a massive open
world sandbox that's a lot of fun it
shows a bit of weakness the Xbox is
utilizing a lower 900p resolution but
both consoles see slightly choppy frame
rates when the action picks up that
doesn't stop it from being a fun game
but it's clear the PC is the best
platform for this one the grandfather of
sandbox games though is definitely Grand
Theft Auto 5 and thankfully here
performance issues are nowhere to be
seen it runs well on both the Xbox and
ps4 it's a massively improved experience
compared to the last gen and the game
world is easy to take hours and hours
into this is about as close to a
must-have game as this generation adds
you can't talk about console games
without mentioning Call of Duty and
black ops 3 is the latest installment at
this point Cod is very much a formula
each version builds on the last year's
release and this is no different that
might not be a bad thing though it keeps
some of the best shooting mechanics out
there and the multiplayer is still a
huge selling point for picking up the
game well the Xbox has usually been the
best Call of Duty platform this time
around the ps4 gets DLC before the Xbox
there are also a lot of solid slightly
older exclusives like titanfall for the
Xbox one this might be my favorite
shooter out there as an early Xbox title
it shows its age a bit but still feels
fresh even in 2016
The Last of Us remastered might just be
an updated version of a ps3 game but
it's easily one of my favorites of all
time it runs much better on the ps4 than
the last gen so if you've never tried
the last of us you owe it to yourself to
give it a try another Xbox exclusive
that flew a little under the radar is
sunset overdrive this game absolutely
doesn't care about anything besides fun
and it typically doesn't hurt that's one
of the better-looking Xbox games even
after well over a year the ps4 has also
got quite a few cool indie titles such
as rocket League this has been a massive
success that's finally getting an Xbox
release soon but it's got such fresh and
fun gameplay that's hard to pass up
resogun was a ps4 launch title that's a
fun twin-stick shooter that's great for
a quick flash that really doesn't look
bad either while it might not be on par
graphics why isn√≠t hog is awesome it's
a straightforward game that super fast
paced and supports two players easily
this is a great example of an indie
title it's on PC ps4 and not on the one
while the Xbox had a solid 2015 for
games the ps4 is looking almost
unstoppable right now the additional
power means that it can deliver some
seriously nice-looking games and when it
comes to third-party titles not like
does it usually run them at high
resolution or better frame rates but
there are more and more exclusive deals
for the PlayStation
as close as this comparison has been
games really are the most important
factor for any console and the ps4 has
the clear advantage giving it an ally
the win for this episode but making it
the overall winner for this generation
this series has been a couple years in
the making so if you guys enjoyed drop a
like on the video and feel free to catch
up on the first five episodes if you
missed them anyway thank you guys so
much for watching and I will catch you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
