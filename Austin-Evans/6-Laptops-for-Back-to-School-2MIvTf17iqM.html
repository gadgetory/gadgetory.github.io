laptop for back-to-school I have a few
options you might want to consider
everything from $200 to over a thousand
first off we have this 14 inch HP laptop
now first list it looks just a little
bit old-school however a little bit over
$200 there's a lot to like here it has a
salt selection of ports with VGA
Ethernet HDMI and three USB ports now
it's a little bit weird with this guy is
it is actually cool by a fan so one of
the budget Intel laptop arfamis go over
this AMD option does enough and but
thankfully it's not too loud this guy is
powered by a quad-core AMD e 2 processor
with 4 gigabytes of RAM and 32 gigs of
emmc storage now that processor is not
going to be incredibly powerful it's
actually very similar to what's inside
the Xbox one and ps4 although obviously
in this case a little bit slower but the
important thing is it's going to be
totally fine for basic usage again this
is $200 that anti processor is a little
bit unusual on budget laptops but it's
not that bad so when it comes to more
heavy usage such as gaming it's not
going to be great but for normal stuff
like watching video it's not bad it is
nearly 4 years of the original Nintendo
- it came out what's also pretty solid
is the display so for $220 we're getting
a full 1080p IPS panel now yes it is not
quite as bright as I would like so over
for this price this is about as good as
it get it might not be a powerhouse but
if you're just looking for a budget
laptop to get the job done this is
definitely worth considering if you're
going to look at more budget to work
with
you may want to consider picking up the
asou stiva bulky 403 it's just a little
bit under $400 well it's not a huge jump
Oh with HP there are a lot of little
things that definitely add up so what if
she did a video on this last year but
it's still pretty much totally up to
date and what's nice about this guy is
that for only a little bit more than the
HP you're getting something that feels a
lot nicer now yes it is still plastic
it's thinner it's lighter and it just
feels like a more premium laptop this
guy also has a solid selection of ports
with an HDMI a USB 3 USB type-c which is
nice
you flip it over we're also going to get
an additional USB type a as well as an
SD card reader
well this might not be the most powerful
laptop in the world it can definitely
get the job done so inside it's rocking
a quad-core intel pentium processor
the Bison memory as well as 128
gigabytes of emmc storage you can't do a
bit of very light gaming on this guy but
it really is meant for more normal usage
and provide it does a good job so it
also has a solid 1080p panel with good
speakers slot trackpad keyboard there's
really no one part of this laptop that
falls apart moving on we have the Lenovo
Z 50 so this is the middle ground
between a budget laptop and substant it
can handle gaming at $370 this guy is
all about cramming the maximum amount of
specs into the cheapest possible
computer of course you guys want more
information I did a full video on this
very recently in fact most of these
laptops have already done for videos on
but there's a lot of interesting quirks
with this guy this is the biggest laptop
here with a 15.6 inch display but that's
also probably the biggest weakness as
this is only a 1366 by 768 resolution on
such a big screen it just doesn't look
great and on top of that it's a fairly
low-end TN panel which means the color
and especially viewing angles and
contrast could be a lot fatter
the upside is it has an AMD FX 7500 quad
core APU a gigabytes of RAM and Radeon
r7 integrated graphics now yes it's not
going to crush crisis at 4k but $400
you're going to be hard-pressed to fight
a more powerful gaming laptop with the
game like rocket League we're able to
get pretty solid performance so play at
760 ap which is the max resolution of
the screen on quality settings we're
doing you're between 40 to 50 frames per
second I can actually hit the ball oh
 oh isn't the ball like toy toy
camera totally got to go in it's
definitely not perfect but if you're
just looking for pure bang for the buck
performance you should check it out
stepping up the budget a little bit we
have the Lenovo Y 700 at $750 what I
like about this is that even though it's
a gaming laptop it's actually nicely
well rounded with the 14th display it's
still somewhat portable but you have
plenty of room for gaming
and I should really like the look of it
a lot of gaming laptops can be a little
bit over the top with this it's actually
a fairly subtle design inside it has
fairly powerful specs with an Intel Core
i7 6700 HQ quad core processor 16
gigabytes of ddr4 memory as well as
dedicated Radeon r9 370 M graphic trim
to get into a game like overwatch this
is totally playable so on 1080p on
medium settings we're going to area
between 40 to 60 frames depending on how
much
actions going on or regardless this is
very much playable this guy also has a
256 gigabyte into SSD pair with a 1
terabyte hard drive when you put it all
together not only doesn't saw laptop for
taking with you every day but it can
definitely handle from gaming moving
away from gaming we had the LG gram 13
at $1000 so there's a lot to like with
this guy it is hands-down my favorite
ultra bolt right now one of the main
reasons for that is that while it's not
only super light it also has very very
small bezels on the display making this
incredibly portable the gran comes in 13
14 and 15 inch screen sizes but
regardless you're getting a really nice
looking 1080p IPS panel color contrast
especially viewing angles that are going
to be on point and most of them the
search engine included also come with a
touchscreen I said a lot of times before
with Windows 10 a touchscreen laptop
just makes sense specs are fairly
standard for an ultrabook it has a core
i5 7200 u processor a gigabytes of RAM a
256 gigabyte SSD this of course is not a
gaming PC but it's pretty snappy for
normal use now on top of the screen
being nice it's also outfitted with a
nice keyboard especially solid trackpad
with Windows precision drivers and this
model also comes with a fingerprint
sensor the real star of the show here is
always battery light so LG claims that
it can last up to 15 hours on a charge
and that's not crazy with that 60 watt
hour battery I have never killed it in a
single day so if you're looking for a
laptop then only had solid battery life
it's also super portable
check out the LG gram insane category we
have the brand new Microsoft Surface pro
which ranges anywhere from $100 to a lot
a lot more so this might seem like a
little bit of a weird choice but I
actually think the surface would make a
lot of sense for back-to-school so yes
it is definitely a tablet and because
that's going to be nice and portable but
once you put the actual tight cover on
it this is not a bad laptop replacement
you're getting incredibly nice Hardware
here everything is made out of metal
especially once you pull out the type
cover and pop the kickstand what you're
seeing here is that there's a ton of
flexibility it is really really well
filled this guy comes in quite a few
different configurations but the one I
have here is the mid spec model with the
core i5 eight gigs of ram and 286 takes
of SSD storage now what's cool is the
qualifies here is actually going to be
familis so all these are going to be
nice and quiet on top of that is crazy
battery life 13 and a half hours it also
has the best screen here with a 12 point
three inch pixel sense display
which of course is not only touchscreen
but also supports the new surface pen it
also has some cool other features like
facial login with Windows hello and of
course you get the whole thing a tablet
package so yes it can be a little bit
pricy especially once you add the actual
keyboard which is basically not even an
option but the surface pro is definitely
worth a look if you're going back to
school as always I will have links to
all these laptops in the description and
I've also been dedicated videos on a lot
of them so feel free to go check those
out and I'm curious which one of these
laptops would you pick up let me know in
the comments below and I will catch you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
