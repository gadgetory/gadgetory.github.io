here with two very unique phones the
curved LG G flex and the wood Moto X the
Moto X was easily one of my favorite
phones of 2013 and it's still one of the
best Android phones you can buy today it
crams a 4.7 inch screen into a body
that's almost perfectly sized and shaped
giving you a bigger screen without the
compromise of dealing with a giant phone
it runs nearly stock Android with a few
helpful customizations like active
notifications which to be totally honest
I wish everyone would just steal pull
the Moto X out of your pocket and it'll
immediately light up with the time and
any new notifications without having to
light the entire screen up to eat
battery flip it around though and you'll
see what's new wood backs one of the
biggest selling points of the Moto X has
always been moto maker which allows you
to customise the phone in different
colors and accents but recently they
added some wood options I pulled the
trigger
on a white moto X with a teak back which
i think is a bad as classy as the phone
gets unlike typical plastic or metal
there's a slight texture which has a
nice feel in the hand and while I'm
usually not a big fan of white phones
I've got to say it works here now I'm
not going to try to say that every phone
should be made out of wood however it is
definitely a nice unique option
especially if you're already considering
picking up a Moto X on the other hand
you could go with something even crazier
the LG G flex from AT&amp;amp;T when I first saw
the official press photo of it it looked
like someone had a little too much fun
in Photoshop but take a look at in
person and that curve is very very real
unlike phones like the Galaxy Nexus
which just had slightly curved glass the
entire G flex is folded toward you at
first it's a bit bizarre using a phone
that isn't flat but it's something I got
used to pretty quickly when you're
holding it normally it really doesn't
feel all that different in fact the
giant 6-inch screen is more noticeable
than the curved flip it on side though
and that's where the curve makes sense
videos seem to pop a little more and it
just looks cool another big feature of
the G flex is durability the phone is
actually flexible and as hard as it is
to watch doing this won't damage it
you can even toss it in your back pocket
something I never do with other phones
the back is also self-healing which
means scratches shouldn't be the end of
the world something
we test if this was actually my phone
and add a review unit unfortunately
that's about where the praise ends
having a resolution of 720p on a
six-inch screen is a bit odd but the
panel itself is just bizarre there's a
permanent bit of digital noise on the
display almost like a poorly compressed
JPEG turn the brightness down to normal
levels and you can even notice some
temporary burn in especially on sites
with a white background which is
completely unacceptable on a smartphone
in 2014 it's got decent color and
viewing angles but it's almost like
there's a permanent film over the screen
which I just can't get over the fact
that you can buy a curved smartphone
like this is really cool a lot of levels
especially concerning the good specs and
awesome battery life but unfortunately
the screen tech just feels like it's not
quite there but what do you guys think
would you buy a curved phone or maybe a
wood one let me know in the comments
below anyway thank you guys for watching
and I will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
