today I'm here I'm continuing my series
of videos on some really great city
applications and I did a video on
kwik-lok which is definitely one I think
you guys should go pick up now I'm going
to pick up something a little different
I will say this is for 3.0 only it is
called spot right most of you guys
probably will have heard of this already
but I'm go ahead and show you guys
anyway what's part spot spot bright is
it is an application that basically lets
you enhance spotlight search if you know
obviously this is 3.0 only if you know
spotlight search you've really gotten
into it you notice that it uses lets you
see some applications but your hidden
apps hidden city applications and you
cannot see so spotlight spot bright
search will enhance spotlights search
and lets you go ahead and find the
hidden city applications as well as it
gives you a nice little menu and I will
show that in just one second so first
thing I want to show you guys is just go
ahead and how to get so I have to do is
punch in a spot right there we go you
see it right there I have to just hit it
and it's real simple just come up here
and install it nothing to it and yeah
really simple yeah there's nothing
there's not a whole lot to it I will
show you in just a second so that's all
I have to do I just want to show you
guys this first takes forever to
load anyway so now if you scroll over
here you see these six lists of six
icons for one it will show you all of
the most recently like launched icons
like as you can see I just launched
Cydia I had to re the App Store tweet
day my mail and it will let you go
through unless let's say I want to open
up the App Store I'll do is hit it and
there you go it's right in there I think
that's probably my main reason but you
also can find hidden applications those
just go oh I don't know um let's look
for it pass mm-hmm there we go so you
can see here this would
Phil okay so you can see here that those
are all your normal ones but you can see
like SB settings you see us right here
this is as hidden hidden application but
it normally would not show up but with
the enhancements of spot bright and
probably messed up bad couple times but
you see it is right there um you know
there's not a whole lot else to this but
like I said with a quick block it's a
simple application but it's a very handy
one too
because I mean that's nice to be able to
find your other applications because
definitely with the addition I've only
got like six pages but when you have
lots lots of pages it definitely would
help and plus you can just open right up
there's not a whole lot to it like I
said and I don't want to drag this out
I've hired dragon drug it out with too
far but I just want to show you guys
this is another really good just another
really good as to the application I
think everybody should get in case I see
no reason why you wouldn't wouldn't have
it but it is in the BigBoss repo and I
will have links that way for you to
download it and yeah I guess let's just
bet it thanks for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
