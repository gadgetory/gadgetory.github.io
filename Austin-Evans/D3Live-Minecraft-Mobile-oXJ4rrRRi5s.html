episode of d3 live so today we're going
to be talking about a topic that it's on
a lot of people's minds this week which
is minecraft mobile now if you're not
familiar with minecraft in general you
definitely should be it's a fantastic
game for the PC allows you to basically
build destroy do whatever you want I
always think of it as like a
first-person lego video game even though
there's technically been those but
minecraft is a fantastic game and this
week that was announced that it will
actually be coming to mobile devices
starting with the Sony Xperia Play so
now there's not a whole lot of
information on this just yet we will be
seeing a lot more in June 7th through
9th to III and they'll be showing it off
telling us when we can buy it not kind
of stuff but in the meantime I thought
it'll be kind of cool to get some of
everyone's opinions and talking a little
bit about it just get little bit of the
discussion on what you all you all guys
want to see on Minecraft Mobile so of
course if you guys have never seen d3
live before it is a live show is being
recorded right now on blogtv and there
are quite a few people in here so we're
just go ahead and take some questions
just talk about Minecraft Mobile well
Minecraft Mobile go to iPhone yes I
shall I do believe the will they said
quite a while ago that it's going to be
coming to both Android and the iPhone
and if you guys are not familiar the
Xperia Play is on Android I believe
probably the reason why it's going to
that first just because actually has
physical control which should be
definitely really nice for in for
Minecraft but yeah that's it should be
coming to both probably Android first of
course but yeah
sync it up with a desktop version that
will be fantastic now basically what he
means there is just if you're like let's
say you're building world on your
desktop and you have a nice world well
if you could just brighten or have it
sync to whatever over to your world on
your phone that would be really cool um
minecraft that just just makes the
addiction just a little bit better how
much will it cost for iOS it's kind of
hard to say I could imagine that they
could probably charge quite a bit for
Ford on the mobile device um but to be
honest I really have no idea I mean it
could be free if you have already bought
it on the desktop which I really doubt
but yeah it's I would hope that it's not
going to be that expensive but again I
have honestly no idea is it Angry Birds
killer of course no I don't think
anything's an Angry Birds killer until
and
birds fourteen comes out order will have
multiplayer compatibility is essentially
a good question I've never had sure on
that one from what it looks like it
actually looks more like instead of beta
it looks more like in minecraft classic
now again don't quote me on that day
very well could have you know all the
beta features a little bit later on but
um well it looks like it looks like a
little bit more of a streamlined version
of Minecraft that's going to be perhaps
might not have all the standard features
that you would expect on standard
minecraft but hopefully we'll have
multiplayer and all that kind of stuff
do I think it will come to the Xbox and
PlayStation 3 next perhaps I know they
had talked a little bit about perhaps
getting into consoles however if you
guys are not familiar Mojang which is
the company who makes minecraft they're
really small and they're just not big
enough in my opinion to spread minecraft
out to a million devices at once so
while I certainly think it's possible
that we might see it on some home
consoles or indeed something like even
like that in GP or the 3ds or something
it's possible that we might see that a
little bit later on but I don't see that
happening right now
will there be mods I would hope so again
coming back I'm more than likely it's
actually going to be a streamlined
version of Minecraft it might not have
all the features and texture packs and
whatnot as the standard version does
fact I'm almost sure it won't have
everything but I would imagine
especially when it comes to Android that
mods will happen one way or the other
I'm on iOS it's a little less clear on
your how that will be able to implement
the mods whatnot most likely we have to
be jailbroken but on Android I would not
be surprised whatsoever if it's if there
are ways to mod it that are become very
easy to do what's the most I would pay
well personally I'm a pretty big fan of
Minecraft so I would probably pay $10 if
that was what they charged for it I
would hope that they do it a lot cheaper
especially they were able to get
something more like in the dollar to
dollar range I think that would
absolutely just just top the charts
everyone would buy it on Android and iOS
and we get a lot of people interested
and the full desktop version of
Minecraft as well so I of course like I
said I would pay a lot for it but if I
was mine if I was behind minecraft I was
gonna be the guy who's pricing it I
would probably price it pretty low just
to get tons and tons of people
interested in the game so guys that's
about it for this week's episode of d3
live hopefully you enjoy it and if you
