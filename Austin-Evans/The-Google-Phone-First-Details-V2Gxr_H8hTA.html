steadily leaked out about a google phone
supposedly it would be an actual Google
branded phone running android allowing
Google to actually create their own
phone just as Apple has done with the
iphone today lots of details have
trickled out so let's take a look at the
new google phone the first details
started coming in last night when Google
employees started flooding Twitter with
all sorts of tweets about the new google
phone the tweets all seem to mention the
same phone a new android 2.1 phone from
HTC as you might expect of google
employees who all had just been given
free prototype phones they are all very
complimentary of it the hardware specs
weren't given out but plenty was
TechCrunch also has a post on the
details so let's fill in the blanks on
what could be the big next phone it is
built by HTC but completely to Google
specifications it runs a new version of
android 2.1 the home screen has been
revamped with touches like animated
wallpaper support it is unlocked with at
least support for AT&amp;amp;T and most likely
for t-mobile it has a capacitive
touchscreen supposedly a high resolution
Oh LED with an on-screen keyboard only
it's been speculated that it runs off of
a Snapdragon processor although I will
say that's not 100% confirmed it's
thinner than the iphone which isn't
saying that much considering that the
droid is nearly as thin as the iphone
and it packs a slide-out keyboard there
were other details but everything so far
points to the phone being a very solid
piece of hardware google has stayed
largely silent on this short of a small
blog post about how Google employees are
going to test a new phone but that's
about it
this is definitely something we're going
to be watching closely in the next few
days but this very well could be a major
contender in the smartphone wars</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
