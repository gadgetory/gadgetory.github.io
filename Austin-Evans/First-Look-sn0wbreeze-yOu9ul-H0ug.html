crew at I hate snow have been hard at
work on a new jailbreaking program
called snowbreeze snowbreeze is a
Windows port of pwnage tool which is
currently Mac only and will allow you to
build your own custom 3.1 point2
firmware let's take a look at what all
snowbreeze will have to offer once it is
released
snowbreeze is a very different type of
jailbreak than what is currently
available for the latest firmware blacks
no blacks no patches the iphone or ipod
touch firmware through an exploit and
downloads all the jailbreak data from
there this is the most direct way to
access the farmer to jailbreak the black
snow has caused problems with some
people whether by fault of the user or
of black snow itself that's where snow
breeze comes in the way snowbreeze works
is very similar to the way some older
jailbreaking programs such as quick
freedom work you build your own custom
firmware on your pc and download it onto
your iphone or ipod touch this way tends
to be a bit less complicated as there's
no direct hacking on your device rather
just a few choice files such as Cydia
are added to the firmware in addition
snowbreeze will also give advanced
jailbreakers the option to add your own
custom boot logo something mini
jailbreakers have been left out on for a
while now the choice is your partition
size activation support and more and
should you be a novice jailbreaker
snowbreeze will allow you to fully
jailbreak your device quickly and easily
as well snowbreeze is currently under
development at the moment but it is
getting very close to the release the
ETA is currently late November which is
of course subject to change at any rate
snowbreeze is looking to be a fantastic
addition to the tools available to you
to jailbreak with</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
