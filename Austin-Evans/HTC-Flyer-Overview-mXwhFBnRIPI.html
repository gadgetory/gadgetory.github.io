showed up that our entry into the tablet
wars the HTC Flyer this tablet is a
definite departure from the other recent
Android tablets as it runs Android 2.4
gingerbread with HTC sins while running
honeycomb would certainly be preferable
since on the flyer looks decent and
comes with a very nice addition of a
capacitive stylus that allows you to
hand write notes which isn't something
you'll find on many other tablets the
screen is another area where the
firebreaks with the majority of the
competition with a 7-inch display with a
resolution of 1024 x 600 it also will be
running a 1.5 gigahertz a single core
processor with a full gigabyte of RAM
some of the other specs include a
5-megapixel rear-facing camera along
with the front-facing 1.3 megapixel
camera and 32 gigabytes of internal
storage which can be expanded via a
microSD card the HTC Flyer also has some
unique software in the form of onlive
and the HTC watch app on live is the
increasingly popular game streaming
service for the PC which allows you to
play a variety of full PC games on much
lower powered hardware the addition of
online is certainly going to be one of
the biggest selling points of this
tablet although the controls will almost
definitely leave a lot to be desired
there also is the HTC watch app that
comes with the tablet that allows you to
both stream and download movies there's
no doubt that HTC has taken a very
different approach to the tablet market
than most and personally I'm looking
forward to taking a closer look at the
HTC Flyer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
