tutorial showing you had jailbreak your
iPhone your ipod touch or your iPad on
the latest iOS 4.2 point one farmer now
this is going to be especially helpful
if you want to unlock as using redsnow
it will allow you to go ahead and update
your baseband so that you can go ahead
and unlock your iphone 3g or your iphone
3gs i'm emma wagons the unlock tutorial
on this video it's very simple i'm just
go ahead and show you how to jailbreak
your device to get started so before we
again i do want to mention a couple of
things the first thing is is that this
is a tethered jailbreak for most devices
i tethered jailbreak if you don't know
what that means basically indicates that
you will need to go ahead and plug your
device in every time it shuts entirely
off now it's a little bit more
complicated not you might not always
have to do this depending on if you
depending on what apps you install in
cydia sometimes you actually might be
able to boot up untethered and your
jailbreak just won't be there so it's a
little bit complicated however do know
that for most devices you will need to
rerun redsnow every time you shut off
the device now it's not a tether for all
devices if you do have an iphone 3g and
iphone 3gs old bootrom or an ipod touch
2nd generation MP model if you have one
of those three devices then no worries
whatsoever this is antonio untethered
however if you have any of the newer
devices such as an ipad and iphone for
an ipod touch 4th generation if you have
any of those and a couple of others you
will have a tethered jailbreak so it
didn't want to let you guys know about
that okay so the first step is going to
be to download redsnow i will have a
link to where you can download it for
Windows or Mac in the description I now
once you do this if you're on a Mac you
can skip this step however if your arm
Windows Vista or Windows 7 you're going
to need to do one additional feature so
what we're going to do is go ahead and
right-click the redsnow we need to go
ahead and come down to properties now
we're going to go ahead and come over to
compatibility and click run this program
in compatibility mode for windows XP
service pack 3 i'll go ahead and we're
also going to need to run this program
as an administrator so there are some
problems if you don't do this in vista
and windows seven if you're running XP i
don't think you should have any problems
but definitely be sure to run it as an
administrator and run
and windows XP service pack 3 let's go
and apply this and hit ok and now we're
ready to go ahead and continue let's go
in just open it up and there we go so
now we rage go ahead and continue the
jailbreak so the next thing you're going
to need to do is find the ipsw be four
point two point one ipsw for your device
now I will have another link in the
description showing you how to find it
it's pretty simple ok so once read snell
is vendor ipsw file I'm successfully
identified it with you I'd continue on
I'm so it'll take just a moment go ahead
catch the jailbreak data and then we can
go ahead and choose a couple of options
so while it's there we go that while is
loading their options will be different
depending on what device you have so I'm
doing this on an ipod touch 4th
generation so as you can see here I
don't have that many options however if
you have an iphone 3g or an ipod touch
2nd generation you have quite a few more
and now keep in mind that it's pretty
much all up to you the main thing is as
long as you have to sit there install
cydia checked you're pretty much good to
go another a few other things like i
said if you have an iphone 3g or an ipod
touch 2nd generation you might want to
go ahead and enable multitasking you can
go ahead and enable custom boot logos
custom recovery logos but again that is
all optional as long as you had installs
THX you're going to get to go as i'm
going to believe this alone although i
do want to mention one thing you will
definitely need to pay attention to this
boot tethered as this is what you're
going to need to do whenever you need to
you know reboot your device you're going
to need to go ahead and rerun redsnow
and click this and rerun it so
definitely keep that mind you don't need
to do it right now but you will at a
later date so now we'll go ahead and
click national rates continue on and
show you exactly how to do this ok so
now this point need to go ahead and put
a device into dfu mode and this is
pretty simple you go ahead and just plug
it into the computer so make sure it's
connected via USB connect it and then
shut it off so just go ahead and not
like you know hit the power button but
make sure it hold it until it's light
power off and slide to do it now I've
already done this just save a little bit
of time but yeah so now we're going to
ready to go ahead and begin now we're
going to need to try to make sure you
guys can watch so to the club next
Minister holding the power button for 3
seconds and it does can't you down now
we're going to need to start holding the
home button for about 10 seconds now if
you can drop any of the buttons or
whatever you can go ahead
hold them both for about 10 seconds and
it will reboot there we go now we're
going to continue just holding the home
button without pressing the power button
and I'm just going to keep holding this
until redsnow gives us the okay and
there we go so there you go guys that's
pretty much it the program will take
just a minute so just leave your device
alone and I'll be right back as soon as
it's done okay so if you have any device
that was a nun to the jailbreak you're
all set as soon as it finished up you're
good to go now if you do have a device
that is tethered and you know it boots
and you see just a white cydia logo you
will need to rerun redsnow to get it to
boot now this is pretty simple you're
going to need to do this you probably
find yourself doing this quite a bit but
yeah so anyway guys it's the same
process just go ahead and rerun it and
just click boot tethered um so there you
go guys that's it you're not jailbroken
on iOS 4.2 point 1 and if you have an
iPhone you can go ahead optionally and
continue on and install ultrasnow now so
there you go guys that's it really I
don't let them in this for everyone 4.2
is not a huge update there's not a whole
lot new and it to be honest and it's
kind of a little bit annoying to have to
deal with a tethered jailbreak for most
devices however if you want to do it you
can go ahead obviously it showed you
with the tutorial so yeah if you have
any questions any comments anything like
that feel free to leave them in the
comment section below and I'll do my
best to get back to as many of you as I
can so anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
