CES 2018 with razors project Linda so
what might look like an ordinary laptop
this is actually being powered by the
razor phone so essentially the hardware
is kind of similar to something like the
razor blade stealth so you're still
getting a 13-inch display but instead of
having windows and a standard like core
processor inside everything is being run
off of the razor phone now the idea has
been done before what hasn't is
something that well actually isn't
terrible
now to be clear this is still a concept
so it's not necessarily going to be on
sale and there are some changes before
this would hit production but the idea
of being able to take your phone spend
all day using it as a standard phone and
when you're ready dropping it in and
turning into a laptop is really cool so
it all starts with the razor phone now
say what you will about the hardware but
it is beefy and it actually matches the
laptop pretty well so instead of having
a standard trackpad what we do is we
actually just drop the phone in and then
with one button it motorized 'as the
little USB C port and the actual laptop
will turn on so it takes just a second
right now obviously this is a prototype
once it's up and running these phone
screen just turns into a trackpad
they've actually done a lot of
interesting engineering to make this
work so we hit the button to detach the
phone there's just going to be a little
cutout here where we can actually can
grab it what's cool is not only does
this keep the power button exposed we
also still have access to the
fingerprint sensor now what's cool is we
can actually even motorized it without
the phone ends you can see the USB port
which kind of pops in and pops out also
I just really like the noise just sounds
so cool not only does the phone serve as
the trackpad right now but it also is
still going to be using these speakers
now if you guys caught my best
smartphones with 2070 video you know
that the razor phone has these best
speakers of any phone I've ever tried so
using this for a laptop should work just
fine the rest of the hardware should be
very familiar if you tried a recent
razor laptop we have full control over
the RGB lighting so even though the
configurator is a little bit lighter
than what you're gonna get on Windows we
can still do things like getting full
RGB wave because you know I should not
have any say of that it's very colorful
beyond that the rest of the hardware is
fairly straightforward so there is a
actual battery inside they'll be able to
charge the phone while it's docked but
beyond that you've got a USB C port for
charging a headphone jack as well as a
full size USB a and they said they would
like to add an HDMI port at a later date
but for a prototype this is actually
pretty close it feels fairly
straightforward as far as the
the build quality it feels a lot
honestly like a razor blade stealth
which is definitely a good thing this
guy is rocking a 13.3 inch panel with a
1080p resolution at least for now so the
main issue is with the prototype at
least it is not a touchscreen so the
final version it would be nice to at
least have that touchscreen that you
could use alongside the phone but if
they could bump it up to say 120 Hertz
or maybe even 1440p that would be
awesome because this is all Android some
apps will look better than others but
for example YouTube actually is not too
bad I will also say is really nice to
have a proper keyboard so while the
actual touchpad experience is maybe not
quite fully fine-tuned you can't just
plug a mouse in and it should work just
like this dude this sounds like proper
laptop speakers I've listened to lots of
laptops they're nowhere near this loud
but it's all just coming from the phone
well most Android apps are going to run
fine some are actually going to be
specifically optimized for a larger
display such as Lightroom now this is
maybe not going to be the full
experience but what you're getting here
is something that isn't going to be
pretty impressive especially considering
that it is after all running on a phone
so this is how I edit photos just crank
everything up you know we just
saturation it's just yeah crank that and
that's obviously a beautiful beautiful
image Wes doesn't approve I can I can
feel it right now so it's a hard no the
paint look on your face like pink of
saturation no no of course as a Razer
product Gaming has to be on the agenda
and here we're going to play a little
bit of vainglory this is a game that
obviously we run fine on the razer phone
but with a mouse and keyboard make it
curious to see how it plays I'm still
really impressed with just how close
this feels like I'm playing on an actual
laptop the screen is nice the speakers
are solid especially with this keyboard
it does make a big difference
the reason Project Linda is surprisingly
close to being ready however it is still
a concept right now
sonali does the hardware need some
tweaks specifically by adding a
touchscreen maybe something like an HDMI
ports but the software also could use
some work but my big question here is
what is the price going to be
considering that this only works with
the Razer phone if this was somewhere
around $300 I think would be a pretty
solid deal but if it gets closer to four
or five or six hundred dollars that's or
becomes a little bit more
questionable but I'm curious what do you
guys think about Razer Project Linda let
me know in the comments below and I will
catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
