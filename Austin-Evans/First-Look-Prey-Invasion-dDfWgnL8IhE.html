first look at a very cool game
pre-invasion
as most of you will know pre-invasion is
a highly anticipated first-person
shooter for the iPhone and iTouch that
is based off the per universe though I
will note that this features all no
storyline it's not like just came out a
few hours ago and I've only made it a
short while onto the game well at least
be able to keep you guys my first
impressions is on the game let's get
this one started
play evasion is an all new game for the
iPhone and iTouch and it makes a solid
first impression on me the stroke begins
with you after having crashed your Jeep
at the bottom of a canyon immediately
launching you into the story
Japan has I didn't think the intro was
perfect as you were basically dumped in
immediately it's no big deal you quickly
proceed through the canyon and onto some
ancient ruins into the pit of an alien
spaceship all while fighting off a good
variety of aliens you begin with a
wrench but quickly find an alien rifle
which is rendered very nicely it looks
quite good where the game gets
interesting Culver is once you get your
spirit bow which is one of the best
features of the game once you have the
spirit bow you can spirit walk there's
very little explanation at this at the
beginning but you don't quickly enough
at the top left after you have obtained
the bow an icon appears the less you
walk away from your body you can see
your body hovering creepily back where
you left it and go on to attack and move
with your bow you want to / if you plan
on straying too far from your body a
very cool feature of this game is the
death walk when you die in the game
you'll immediately appear in a very
surreal place where fantasy creatures
will be floating around and your body
will be hovering after a moment you blow
it down and return to life where you had
just been killed here ideas like this
really keep this game fresh interesting
the graphics well not the best I've seen
easily rank up high some of the models
are a bit rough but general everything
looks very impressive especially some of
the indoor models they look very good
well doesn't say new bars graphics wise
it is still very impressive
the controls are among the better for
first-person shooters in the App Store
with a very nice amount of options there
are two main control schemes and the
arcade is by far the best in my opinion
what do you with using the mostly
standard control layout of two virtual
pads
something that is much better than the
somewhat confusing series of slide bars
and the other controls format in
addition you can also move around the
controls as well as changing the opacity
well it's not perfect after playing
pre-invasion for a short time I'm very
impressed
it's among the best first person
shooters available right now with good
graphics nice controls some really
unique ideas
all in a package promising hours and
hours of the playtime is $2.99 in the
App Store right now I press which seems
very reasonable for such a good
application be sure to check out zircon

iPod Touch news tips and tricks for your
