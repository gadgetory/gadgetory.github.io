here with a review of the speck
CandyShell grip for the iPhone 4 and 4s
the CandyShell grip is still one of my
favorite cases for the ipod touch but
now that itself of the iPhone how does
it stack up it first lands very well
just like you would expect from a speck
CandyShell case it's a mixture between
smooth glossy plastic and soft rubber
not only does this look and feel very
nice but it also does a great job with
protection between the lay on the table
design and the fairly thick sides of the
case that should do a great job in
handling most drops along the left side
there's a large cutout for the mute
switch they'll work for all versions of
the iPhone 4 and 4s and a pair of rubber
covers for the volume buttons one
problem I had with the case for the iPod
was that these were a bit stiff when
trying to change the volume however I
had no problem with the iPhone version
of the case you'll also see the ridged
rubber inserts on either side as well as
on the back spec is marketing this
towards gamers to give you a better grip
on the case even when your hands get
sweaty while I can't exactly say I've
ever dropped my phone during intense
gaming the texture does feel quite nice
and look sharp there are also four small
bumps on the front which are supposed to
help you keep your fingers on any
virtual d-pad zuv buttons however I
really can't see myself gaming at any
kind of angle what they would be useful
on bottom you have full access to your
30-pin dock connector and both the
speaker and microphone are clear up top
you have the sleep button which has a
rubber over light just like the volume
buttons and an opening for the headphone
jack on the back you'll see a very
nicely sized cutout for the camera and
flash as well as the spec logo overall I
like the CandyShell grip quite a bit it
is slightly bulky but it makes up for
that with great design and it looks my
only complaint would have to be the
price which is $35 is a bit hard to
swallow even for candy oh we took the
side thanks to spec for providing this
case for review if you enjoyed this
