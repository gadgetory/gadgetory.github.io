VLC for the iPhone and iPod Touch so
I've been a big fan of VLC for quite a
while over on the computer and so now
that it's over on the iPod and the
iPhone I'm really excited to go ahead
and take a look at it so I've spent the
last little while loading up a lot of
different videos and testing it out and
overall um there's some good there's
some bad so I'll go ahead and give you
guys my full review so before I begin
anything let's go ahead and roll through
the interface pretty quickly here there
is an about button so you know you can
see all your legal kind of stuff not a
big deal I mean you also do have an edit
button where you can go ahead and just
you know delete whatever files and you
don't want anymore
one of the knocks I do have against it
is the interface it's very simple and to
be honest it's not perfect I mean as you
can see here it does you know take all
your files and put them into
alphabetical order however I can see
this would definitely get confusing
pretty quick once you start to get you
know 20 30 40 video files once you
really start to load up VLC getting that
big deal if you don't have a ton of
files on here but something that I did
want to note so now when you get into
the performance of the application so I
do want to know before we begin that
this is all run on my iPod Touch 4th
generation so if you have an earlier
iPhone or an earlier iPod Touch
performance probably will not be quite
as good but if you have an iPod Touch
4th generation or an iPhone 4 should be
pretty much identical so square just go
ahead and just jump right into it it
doesn't really play high definition
video so just go ahead and show this is
an mp4 file a high definition 720p
rather and this warning pops up saying
your prop is probably too slow and yeah
it's totally odd correct it really won't
play 720p anything I could I couldn't
find a single video file that would work
at 720p however it for a if you go ahead
and go down to 480p it actually does run
pretty well so here's an AVI file runs
perfectly here's actually a fly foul
straight from YouTube this one doesn't
run perfectly but if well run it is
watchable so I'm going to show you guys
a quick clip of it
there you go so that's actually a 480p
flash file it does run as I'm sure you
guys can see there there was some lag
and it wasn't perfect however it was
watchable and especially if you go down
to 360p flash files no issues whatsoever
so that's about it guys why just go you
go through the format's that it does
support really quickly here it does
support mp4 although actually that was
kinda something I thought was a little
bit surprising
it really doesn't support mp4 very well
at all in fact I could barely 360p in
before barely worked which is kind of
odd considering that that's what the
iPod in the iPhone that's pretty much
all they run by themselves but aside
from that it does run mp4 mov avi it
also does run DIF X as well so here's a
did X trailer I downloaded in MKV I ran
pretty well this one of course was
almost 720p so it didn't run very well
but it was like you know it was almost
watchable and VLC does support that so I
believed oh it does a for support flash
as well so overall I think VLC is kind
of a little bit of a mixed bag it's not
perfect you know I'm not big fan of the
interface and a lot of the files don't
run that well however overall
considering that it is free and it does
play at least some files back ok you
know I don't really have any issues with
it I definitely recommend to go ahead
and pick it up you know it's obviously
it's free so go ahead and download it on
your device open up iTunes and then go
ahead and see you know throw a few video
files over there and see how it works
you know you might be surprised so
anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
