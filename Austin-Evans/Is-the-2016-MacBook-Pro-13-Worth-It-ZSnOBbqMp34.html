Pro worth it so the new MacBook Pro is
interesting on one hand it's going to be
a lot thinner a lot lighter and like
immediately
wow it's sort of like the current
MacBook Pro mixed with the 12-inch
MacBook which is not necessarily a bad
thing I think for all its issues the
12-inch MacBook is a really nice machine
this looks pretty similar if you play
with the MacBook before now there is a
new keyboard the trackpad is actually
kind of giant Wow the hardware of the
new MacBook Pro has been updated a few
interesting ways so probably the most
noticeable difference is that the Apple
logo on the back you no longer lights up
which honestly I don't really care
and you're also no longer getting
plastic on the build so it's pretty much
metal all the way through now it also
now does come in two colors so in
addition to the standard silver there's
also now a Space Gray option you know
say what you want about Apple they can
make a nice piece of hardware this thing
feels absolutely sturdy you know it
actually is thinner than the last
MacBook in fact so to put things in
perspective I had the last generation
13-inch MacBook Pro here I set it on top
you'll see that it's actually a fair bit
thinner and considering that you're
getting the exact same sized screen
that's really nice on top of that it's
going to be thinner now it's not a huge
difference I mean put them side-by-side
and you will notice however it's
definitely nice they're kind of trimming
things down however that thinness comes
with a price take a look at the side and
you'll see a pair of Thunderbolt 3 ports
now these are nice to have but based on
USB type-c which means that not only can
you charge with either of them but that
also means that you can adapt out to
display port HDMI or USB there's a lot
that you can do with these however you
need adapters to do pretty much anything
with the old MacBook Pro you really
didn't need any adapters you had full
USB you had a card reader wide HDMI
you've had MagSafe you lose all of that
with the new MacBook Pro to make things
even more complicated there are multiple
versions of the new MacBook so what I
have here is the base model which does
come with the 2 Thunderbolt ports
however if you get the upgraded 13-inch
or pick up the 15-inch MacBook Pro you
get 4 thunderbolt ports now that's nice
to give you more expand ability however
it still doesn't get around the issue of
you're going to need adapters for
basically everything
before we get too far into things we
probably should finish up the unboxing
so inside we get a USB type-c cable it
looks like just the sort of standard
Apple paperwork Apple stickers there's
also the new power brick which is also
using USB type-c now it's nice to be
able to plug it into any port you want
on the laptop however I'm definitely sad
to see MagSafe go
it is definitely saved my laptop many
times just as Ken it would have saved
his put the MacBook side-by-side and you
won't notice a huge difference so even
though the new one has a smaller
footprint it actually does have a much
larger trackpad I've got to give Apple
props this touchpad is really nice so
not only is it absolutely enormous this
might be the biggest laptop touchpad
I've ever tried and you're also getting
front firing speakers as opposed to the
kind of mediocre bottom firing ones on
the older macbook the keyboard has also
been redesigned so it's similar to what
you would find on the 12-inch MacBook
which means that it has the new
butterfly key switch it isn't bad I
think the thing is you just have to get
used to the lack of travel so it's a
very shallow key however it's actually
not that bad I feel like I can get used
to it pretty quick the keyboard is
actually the biggest difference between
the two MacBook Pro models so this has
their traditional function keys so you
get an escape key you can adjust your
screen brightness next track all that
kind of stuff our actual keys however if
you get the upgraded model it comes with
the touch bar this is an interesting
idea it allows apps to take advantage of
the touch bar to change what keys are
actually on your keyboard so it's still
like touch screen what you can do is
still get the standard function keys and
all that kind of stuff but certain apps
such as Final Cut Pro can actually take
advantage of that to let you scroll
through a timeline add additional custom
buttons it's a cool idea it also comes
with touch ID however you want the touch
bar version it's going to cost you the
new MacBook Pro starts at $1,500 however
if you want the touch bar model that's
going to run you 1800 now for that you
do get the touch bar you could touch ID
you get a pair of federal 3 ports in
addition to the two that are already
here
over that's a lot of money across the
board the new MacBook Pro 13 inches are
using either Core i5 or i7 processors
now they're all dual core however the
base model has a 15 watt part where the
higher end touch bar model comes with a
28 watch chip since
based on the same skylake process there
shouldn't be a huge difference in normal
day-to-day use however when you're
getting into heavier lifting such as
video editing having that extra thermal
Headroom is going to be a big advantage
so since we're working with that lower
wattage processor I'm curious how
performance stacks up so to compare I
have the old core i5 model as well as
the i7 they're actually surprisingly
close so both of the core i5 models come
basically within margin of error of each
other
well the i7 has a slight lead
considering that it was a couple hundred
dollar upgrade that shouldn't be a huge
surprise
one thing the new MacBook Pro has going
for it is a super-fast SSD so it's so
quick in fact it literally broke the
speed test with well over 2 gigabytes
per second read and according to Apple
it's actually closer to 3 gigabytes now
the old models weren't exactly slow
however there's no doubt this new
MacBook Pro definitely sets the
benchmark as far as disk speed goes it
also now comes standard with 256 gigs of
storage compared to 128 on the old model
now that's not a huge difference however
when you consider the price difference
if you were to upgrade this to 256 this
is only $100 more it's still expensive
but at least it makes a little bit more
sense now so no one in their right mind
should buy a macbook as a gaming pc it
can't handle some lighter titles so here
we are minecraft and you'll see that
runs completely smooth so we're getting
a lock 60 FPS and this should be a huge
surprise max has been able to play
Minecraft pretty smoothly for a while
however is a totally usable experience
performance wise this actually isn't too
bad it might not be quite as smooth as
Minecraft we're definitely seeing a few
dropped frames here and there but you
can't play some sort of decent games on
the MacBook I'm kind of impressed white
this one's sort of a lighter blue you
know the speakers are not bad so with
those two front firing speakers we're
getting a much better audio experience
and the screen has also been improved so
we're still getting that same 2560 by
1440 P resolution however it now
supports the wider P 3 color gamut we're
getting a much brighter screen at 500
nits and it also has better contrast it
looks nice sounds nice it's a big
improvement as far as the webcam goes we
still have a 720p FaceTime HD camera
it's decent so there's definite some
grainy especially up here you can see
and the audio is good but not amazing to
over as far as webcams go there's really
not a lot to complain about now one of
the downsides to go into a smaller
chassis is that there's less room for
batteries so while the old 13-inch had a
75 watt hour battery the new has a 55
watt hour now Apple claims it still has
the same 10 hours of battery life and
honestly the 13-inch actually had some
of the best battery life of pretty much
any laptop I've tried however a smaller
battery is never a good thing so is the
new MacBook Pro worth it kind of it's a
hard sell I mean on one hand you're
getting nicer hardware you're getting
much better screen better speakers
performance is at least the same with
not better however you are giving up
ports and that's gonna be a tough sell
sure I think USB C and Thunderbolt 3 are
the future however the future is not
here yet you're still going to need
adapters and on top of that this thing's
expensive if you're already looking for
a MacBook Pro it's a decent option as
long as you don't mind adapters but for
most people I think you're better off
passing so what do you guys think about
the new MacBook Pros doesn't be sure to
let me know in the comments below and I
will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
