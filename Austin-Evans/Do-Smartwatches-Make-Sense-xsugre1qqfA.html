years have seen an absolute explosion
with smartphones and tablets however my
question is our SmartWatch is the next
big thing so the idea behind a
SmartWatch is pretty simple it's
essentially a mini smartphone that lives
on your wrist that delivers
notifications from your phone let you
take calls snap a quick picture and of
course check the time I've been using
the Samsung Galaxy gear the last few
weeks however there are several other
options including the pebble and the wim
one which was quickly bought by Google
and is expected to be the base for the
Google now SmartWatch and of course
there's Apple who has long been rumored
to be making their own eye watch but is
there something to this or smartwatches
not so smart after all take a look
around the Galaxy gear and it should
give you a good idea of what to expect
with other models it's built
surprisingly well with a 1.6 inch screen
surrounded by a very nice-looking
brushed metal that puts the Galaxy Note
3 to shame there's a single button for
turning on and off the gear as well as a
few pins on the back for connecting it
to the base for charging and syncing the
gear has an integrated band where you'll
find the decent 1.9 megapixel camera
along with the speaker built into the
class as nice as it is on paper though
the only time I ever use the camera on
the gear is for showing it to people it
seems like a nice feature but since you
have to have the watch tethered to your
phone why wouldn't you just reach for
your much better camera software wise
the gear is running Android with a basic
skin it works well enough with a swipe
from the top to bring you back and
swiping left to right will bring you
through your different options sometimes
core Android does poke through though
and the look is very stripped-down and
plain but all the blacks do a good job
of taking advantage of that AMOLED
screen you can also download apps for
the gear the selection is tiny right now
and what is available is pretty limited
I can imagine a few things being useful
on a SmartWatch but for the most part
it's better to just grab your phone and
use a full sized app at that point once
I have a million subscribers I should be
able to take over YouTube oh um so the
Galaxy gear also takes calls so it might
not be the most practical thing in the
world as the speaker is fairly quiet and
it's a little weird to talk to your
watch in public however it is probably
one of the coolest inner geek things
that I've done in a long time one thing
that's a little disappointing with the
Galaxy gear are
the notifications it's great to be able
to glance down and what's going on
quickly but unless it's a caller text
you'll have to go to your phone to
actually read the notification battery
life is pretty good on the gear as I'm
able to average about two to three days
on a charge considering this is
basically a smartphone from a couple
years ago crammed into a watch I'm not
complaining although you will be able to
get better battery life with some other
smartwatches such as the peple the
biggest problem with the gear is that
you have to be tethered to a samsung
phone like the note 3 and soon-to-be the
galaxy s4 and no 2 that's fine if you
have one of those but it would be nice
to be able to use your watch with any
phone so after using a SmartWatch for
the last couple weeks I get it now as
the Galaxy gear perfect definitely not
however it does have a lot of potential
and I can really see a reason why you
might want to actually wear a SmartWatch
however is that going to be better than
Google glass well that was gonna have to
wait for another video so what do you
