and one of the coolest text doors in
universe and I brought a couple fresh so
we are here at the BH superstore in New
York City now this is not a sponsored
video however my boy Darren hooked it up
so we have the entire store to ourselves
so it's after closing so it's pretty
much empty and we can do pretty much
whatever we want I got to say it's
really eerie to be in the store it's
completely closed well like actually
locked in right now so we're going to
make a good video they won't they won't
let us out baby look at look at all the
crazy damage here
let's see fs5 here see 100 yeah is about
the fn7 the cool part about this is it
female everything is off right now
normally you can come and employ us all
these camera um can we go inside
oh oh I feel like we're not supposed to
be here probably cuz we're really not
supposed to be here right now
the conveyer system is just calling my
name it's going room Oh still up the
door open for us guys want try to Mike
hey guys this is Austin minute so
actually the way this works
that's a 3600 odd night by the way that
you're likely so basically they built
this room officially to test Mike so all
these mics all around or they're all
patched in via this guy and then it runs
through all this equipment and you
actually listen to it on the headphone
so I know how to operate it because I'll
probably break something this is a
little completely soundproof
yeah so basically look at the look at
the windows so the windows are like 12
inches apart and like the walls are two
feet then it's separate on top and
bottom so you see how we have we had to
like step up to get in here darren lock
us in oh it's so peaceful
can you hear me as you can see like
he'll stick like the windows are and
everything they visit like a proper
proper sound setup but that's not the
only sound thing we've got Mr Morrison
could you please do the where the funds
that happen
so now you have ton of different
speakers and everything but they also
have some guitars
what's an amp rating I've seen you play
guitar pretty well
No okay look this is what shy john
mcclane sure shy he is right now
oh yeah caliber so when John's YouTube
career finally carbs like flames out
he's playing the pink guitar all day I
forgot everything
Wow
you're going to overdub it so it looks
like oh yeah
we're talking about really cool music
right now Oh where's Oh Ilya night I bet
girl limbs on it it's got a microphone a
light hey guys this is Austin and today
I'm replacing all my normal gear with
iPad especially something I didn't
realize bnh actually has PC gaming stuff
- no that's my bad
oh I like a nobita part dread don't do
it to be this Jon oh you mean music
without oh yeah hearing a whole egg is
an owl
yes what up so thank you thank you I
know that's welcome and bnh extravaganza
my friend all right it looks pretty
terrific it's a real party now the big
Dom is just miss all the great music so
please don't worry cuz you know anything
about music oh the dog the cool raincoat
buddy it's not as cool or sir Oh does
that sound crazier what yeah it's like
something sucking on my ears all right
when you get off your meat right I can
still hear you yeah no it doesn't cancel
I it's not often proof I'm for nothing
is Austin proof for the record you got
all the noise cancellation oh here we go
noise cancellation you might get the
chocolate swirl chocolates what we're
calling us today oh we feel to be called
that's a very nice way to put it you
very about the chocolate swirl light am
i rude I feel I shouldn't be doing this
right now
this all feels really wrong what are you
doing slapping the invisible tension ah
just look so light no did you just look
the light hand
can you clear this up what are those yo
Jesus Christ party mode so okay this is
where a lot of you stuff you might think
news cameras not a big deal but look at
some of this stuff like a lie I want to
try to figure out how I can get that
additive case right now
oh man 800 millimeter lens type for ping
subs how much is this one cut my hair I
think like seven eight thousand oh no
video this is awesome Evans
sniper mode say hello to my little
friend so I need Nate her millimeter
lens in my life you guys will have every
possible Wow oh right those are all
cameras that they so cool and retro from
the front of course you flipped around
back and you realize it's a new camera
but from the front Wow
oh wait I can get with it everything is
reversed that's trippy you know the best
part of the image I do not look up my
friend look up that conveyor system is
the coolest so I think what we need to
do now need to see what's actually
behind this conveyor systems if you look
there's like all these different little
like control modules and these are all
motorized so essentially what happens is
say you're upstairs in the camera
department you want to order a lens and
bring it over to the register they put
it on it will send it down and all the
way around so can you be bitten erase it
erase it can you erase it one way to
find out
three
I shall go pro so the obvious winner and
mr. Austen Evan all right so this is B
and H Darrin for real thank you for
letting us in your store thank you for
being kind enough to let us race and do
terrible things that you should not have
let us do it through thank ed of course
