very special edition of mystery tech
this time entirely focused on items that
can waste our money on straight from
japan curvy headphones okay i merely
appreciate the old-school pixel art
style wait it's 5,000 yen
how much is five thousand yen sixty-two
cents okay that's that's a bed so you
guys didn't know ken goes to japan every
once in a while and by everyone why i
mean like every weekend Wow oh it's
actually like hard plastic they're
awfully hollow like I feel like I hear
like you know like when you put your ear
up to like a seashell or something
that's kind of it sounds like the happy
wearing these headphones not great okay
look they're cool for 45 bucks I don't
know but I'm even really into Kirby just
don't use them as headphones Oh more
headphones the xperia ear duo Wireless
open air stereo headsets music and
communication while listening to the
surrounding sound enjoy closed the ears
your own tube design men
nothing says weird tech from Japan like
Sony so I guess the idea here is that
these are supposed to be kind of like
air pods so it looks like they're
actually going to be completely
independent and wireless how much is
thirty thousand yen sometimes I regret
giving Kenna company credit card
generally speaking when it comes to tech
it's not actually that weird when you go
to different countries generally pretty
much everyone has the same kind of stuff
but if the Japan is always exception
there's always this sort of extra weird
stuff there that's a wise again that's a
really bizarre setup so this is the
actual headphone but I guess that's the
sort of the opening for your ear oh so
this actually isn't out in the US yet Oh
interesting
so this is a an exclusive some would say
straight in Japan wait I should figure
how to get them paired first okay oh you
need an app okay so searching for
devices make sure it's turned on how do
you turn it on oh oh it's magnetic okay
that actually makes it kind of cool one
of the things I didn't like about the
pixel buds was there was really kind of
fiddly to be able to like real wine
the cable around like that Oh oh yeah
okay it's a little weird to get used to
on how you actually supposed to do that
but that feels pretty decent to me okay
so I'm listening to music right now and
it sounds decent it's not really
particularly loud or rich sound but
what's interesting is is that it's
really not blocking any of my hearing so
I can still hear everything just fine
can say something yeah I can hear you
completely fine so it's almost like kind
of having like some background music
it's not like listening to proper
headphones sound quality is not going to
be amazing
they sound okay but it's not really for
listening I can still hear everything
around me right now this is a really
interesting idea but I think it's not
really correct call them headphones it's
not really necessarily something like an
ear pods competitor what this really is
is a way of getting an assistant without
actually being able to block out the
rest of the world
nice phone woah woah that's that's
actually really cool so let's forget
charges with some pogo pins on the back
but it does accept a nano SIM as well as
it has 3g tethering so if you want to
use this in addition to say an actual
smartphone you can woah that's it that's
the whole phone are you serious okay so
I saw the picture and I thought it's
gonna be bigger than this that's the
whole flow right there okay how much was
this so 10,000 yen equals 91 United
States dollars and four cents much more
reasonable okay we're up we have
contacts messages calls music voice
memos Bluetooth alarm and settings let's
do settings so I can see the tiny little
text here I can also scroll down to type
the message alright what's your number I
mean I know there's weird tech out there
but like the idea of having a phone
that's this small it's cool and I think
for some people if you want a backup
phone I mean it does do hotspot in
theory you can do stuff with Bluetooth I
guess if you load music n via this micro
USB adapter but man this is
I'm not impressed I still understand how
it runs Android though that makes zero
sense to me why are you handing this
switch really Japanese okay Japanese
switch accessories got it
a felt pouch for the switch it's mildly
Japanese and weird but besides that
actually it feels kinda nice so I
dropped the switch inside and closed it
no one can tell I'm carrying a switch
where are you going with this oh I'm
doing flashbacks to the connected desk
or the port of desk or whatever that
thing was it's just it's just a bendy
thing I mean you know everyone's like
the switch is so heavy it's so giant
it's so difficult to you know using your
hands because it is unwieldy and
ridiculous so this is obviously the way
to play and you know I actually have to
say it's not crazy I feel like this is
just kind of oh god what are we doing
what is this a traditional Japanese fan
but why does it say you a USB what this
is the fan who's all there is to it
alright so after a slightly long time of
building this stupid fan let's actually
plug it in and see what it does
okay
okay I put the goopy thing on the bottom
it's like slime are you serious
well I mean when you're vigorously
Fanning yourself maybe you need a little
bit of extra sticky action I'm gonna put
this down and move on because this is
getting really weird yo-yo you did not
you did not this is not look at that is
so legit it's still the original
packaging I mean even though foam isn't
that old so if you guys are not familiar
this is an original Nintendo Famicom and
I look at the games you got mother
Excitebike Donkey Kong Rockman not
Megaman ice climber and Super Mario Bros
dude
that is ah ah alright I'm excited now
that is not what I expected to get today
I can't believe you got one in the box
like this looks like pristine packaging
I won't the want to open it it's like
it's too nice so if you guys are not
familiar this is essentially the
Japanese version of the NES
so they actually did it it slightly
differently looking but as far as the
actual system itself it shouldn't be any
different at all actually well I take
the bag there were some slight
differences as far as the controller
right cuz it in the control I have a
microphone on it so image quality not
the best due to our terrible adapter
situation but whatever oh oh oh no you
don't know you don't know oh this is bad
there we go alright Mario game did I
really should know how to play better
than I actually do oh come on come on
come on come on no no you don't know
Darien over here through here come on
come on come on come on oh yeah that was
dangerous oh well that was a terrible
jump but the Famicom is real now yes is
it basically the same thing isn't it yes
pretty much is it way cooler though
absolutely maybe you thought this was
weird doesn't be sure to go check out
the last episode of mystery Tech where
we checked out some of the most bizarre
cheap stuff we could find on Amazon
anyway guys thank you so much for
watching and I will catch you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
