with my WWDC predictions guys you don't
know the WWDC is it is the Worldwide
Developers Conference and guys really it
is where Apple usually and that's their
big event of the year it's usually where
they announced the iPhone the next
iPhone they also usually announced a few
other things so I'm gonna go ahead me of
you guys might run down to my
predictions um you know this is always
fun to do guys cuz usually I'm pretty
wrong it's kinda funny to go do this
over I always like to come back and
watch this video now that was wrong but
anyway guys so this is what I'm thinking
um the first thing you're probably
thinking the biggest thing is the iPhone
it hasn't leave that towards the end
everybody has heard about the iPhone I'm
sure you guys know most everything about
it so I will leave that to the end and
actually try to focus on some things
that hopefully you know I haven't heard
a lot and I think that could be pretty
true I'm so guys the first thing I'm
looking forward to and this kind of
might seem a little odd is an iMac
refresh that iMac was refreshed and
believed in October of last year and it
was totally redesigned and you know I
don't expect it will be a major redesign
and if you look at the MacBook the white
plastic MacBook and iMac or refresh at
the same time last year
well the white plastic MacBook was just
tweaked a little bit now it has the same
specs as the entry-level MacBook Pro I
might expect we might see a little bit
of something with the iMac I mean we
might see a little bit more ran maybe a
little bit bigger hard drives
maybe tweaks processors I don't expect
you guys it would be a huge overhaul I
mean I imagine the case will be the
exact same but I wouldn't be surprised
if we see a few smaller things
considering that I'm actually looking
forward to getting aid iMac here before
too long that's actually I'm kind of
looking forward to this so if you're
interested in that iMac oh absolutely at
a minimum wait you know until after WWDC
they don't ask to go ahead and buy one
but otherwise you might wanna be a
little cautious another one the MacBook
Air I we've heard that the macbook air
needs to be refreshed and a refreshing
refresh and I expected that we will
finally see it now you know the MacBook
Air really there's not
to point to it now guys I mean it's I
mean the ice is extremely thin if you've
never seen a MacBook Air I mean it is
really cool how thin it is but that's
about all it has going for it you know I
mean the meta the MacBook Pro is only
slightly thicker but it's got a better
design in my opinion and it's much
cheaper and it's got better specs so
right now the MacBook Air really needs
to be upgraded with some you know Core
i3 Core i5 ultra low voltage low voltage
processors you know maybe some
solid-state drives there aren't no cause
you know $10,000 or whatever I don't
know if we'll see a case redesign for it
it is like I said guys I mean it's very
thin and I mean literally I think they
can keep that case for you know ten
years they wanted to out see computers
and also just you know being way thinner
than that but I do see that we will
finally see some sort of upgrade to the
MacBook Air now the next thing would be
the Mac Pro the Mac Pro of course is the
big Daddy that you know the big computer
the top-of-the-line Mac you can get and
it needs a refresh pretty bad right now
so I expect we will go ahead and see a
multitude new things we'll probably see
some of Intel's new hexa core processors
and of course because the MacBook I mean
I'm sorry the Mac Pro is pretty powerful
and can run two processors that will be
pretty impressive in this you know to
say a couple of hexa core processors um
you know there's a lot of other things
guys you know I mean the case design I
like the case design it's really good
but if you look back the Apple has used
that I'm actually exact case design for
years and years and years now so it's
still good and you know I mean there's
not as much anything wrong with it but I
wouldn't be surprised that they tweaked
it they you know maybe I can move the
top handles and maybe they keep it from
being giant I don't know guys but I do
expect we will see at least some sort of
Mac Pro refresh I don't know exactly
what we will see but I think we will see
something now guys the last thing would
be the iPhone 4 iPhone HD - 4G I always
still think it's the iPhone HD but so
anyway guys
obviously we're going to see this guy's
it's been leaked and leaked and Lincoln
Lincoln Lee kum een no one should be
surprised at this point to see it let me
just go ahead and show you guys if you
don't know what's going on give you guys
a brief refresher of what all we know
about it so of course we literally guys
we see these prototypes I'm not nothing
joking actually we've seen these
prototypes on a daily basis since this
moto got their hands on one you know
we've seen the case we've seen different
colors we've seen the screen we've seen
the full prototypes we've seen some that
work I mean guys it's been ridiculous
I'm not the only thing we actually
haven't seen is a normal iPhone 4 that
actually runs os iPhone OS 4 but so if
you guys don't know what's going on it's
going to be a new design and the
pictures that we've seen all the
pictures say it's a pretty cool design
it's going to be lots squared off you
know the the current iPhones very
rounded all over the place it's going to
be more of a squared almost a little bit
more of an industrial this time I like
it a lot guys
so it's going to be roughly the same
size and the footprint I'm just going to
be a good deal thinner and the fact that
it's like I said guys a lot more squared
off can you can really tell that a lot
more it's going to have a much better
screen the screen looks to be about the
same size I believe it's going to be 3.5
inches maybe you're taking a very very
slight amount but it should be almost
the same size screen it's going to
literally have the twice the pixel
density so instead of being 320 by 480
which is what all the current iPhones
and iPods have always been it will be
960 by 640 well the reason they did this
guys I'm almost positive is that it's
going to be very easy for your normal
apps to scale up so when you consider
like the iPad you know when you run an
iPad an iPhone app on iPad it blows up
but it's kind of course the iPhone and
iPad a shake differently so something I
felt the whole screen well a normal
iPhone or iPod Touch app right now we'll
go ahead and work perfectly on that next
iPhone because all I have to do is just
get bigger it will fit in the exact same
size screen all those all the pixels
just have to get bigger so it should be
really good for that um guys there's a
bunch of other things about
case of it of course we all we've heard
isin iPhone rumors although recently
actually just this morning Verizon was
saying we don't have a we're not getting
the iPhone in the immediate future so
guys I wouldn't expect to see the
Verizon iPhone come out in WWDC I do
expect we probably will see a Verizon
iPhone maybe a little bit further on in
the year heard a lot of towards like the
end of the you of this where a lot of
people have been saying so we'll have to
see about that that guys one thing the
only really thing I can see about the
iPhone 4 that would be surprising people
would just be the operating system of
course we've seen iPhone OS 4 there's
been betas out I believe around the 3rd
4th beta don't quote me on that but
we've had several betas out already you
know people have been testing them out
there's not a whole lot that they can
surprise us with but I do think that
there will be a few special features
just like you know like from the iPhone
3GS came you know they had a couple of
things such as a compass and some stuff
I expected we will see a few I phone for
specific apps such as I check that works
with the front-facing camera on the next
iPhone so guys the iPhone 4 we know
about everything we're going to know
about it I don't expect I'll expect
anybody when they when Steve Jobs goes
here's the next iPhone everybody's gonna
go I mean everybody will know but though
hopefully will be a few small things on
you know of course runs the Apple a4 CPU
maybe it's the exact same one from the
iPad we don't know but that would
definitely be there's all kinds of
different things that we could know okay
guys that's off my WWDC predictions you
know I think we getting we're gonna be
getting some updated Mac's
we'll go ahead and get you know
obviously the next iPhone and who knows
we might just get maybe an iPod or
something else we weren't expecting yeah
that's always a possibility but yeah
guys that's basically what I think so
definitely let me know guys are you
interested in any of these products or
you will have been looking for a new
MacBook Air new MacBook Pro man sorry
I'm Mac Pro and you're looking for just
the next iPhone doesn't let me know
anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
