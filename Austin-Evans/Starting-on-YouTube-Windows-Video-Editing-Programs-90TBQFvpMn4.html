the free option which is Windows Live
Movie Maker now this is not a very very
in-depth editor so you won't find a lot
of the more you know hardcore effects
such as you know picture and picture and
anything really in-depth but for a lot
of people if you're just you know just
just doing a couple of copy and paste
just to put a couple clips together you
need just you maybe like a music in like
some slideshow or something movie maker
will be just fine for you and of course
it is free and if you're interested in
going ahead and getting it I will have
the link in the description so guys it
works very simply let's go ahead just
add the pictures or video so let's go
ahead and jump over here and I already
have the intro to the video so let's go
ahead and just drop this in give it just
a second as you guys can see it's a
pretty decent interface it's nothing
amazing the one thing I will mention
though is that while Live Movie Maker
it's if you're a beginner it's really
pretty simple to get actually if you've
ever used you know any more in-depth
editors actually it's kind of a little
bit confusing so go ahead and try to
explain it to you so basically this is
the clip if we wanted to go ahead and
add music we can do a lot of different
things such as title credits etc we're
going to go ahead and just cut this down
so what we can do and just scrub through
here and just pick out whatever time I
want so let's say that's it I'm not
going to really do it all that in-depth
it's going here to video tools we hit
split let's go ahead just get rid of
this first part so this is where the
video starts and let's just say for
example this is whether the un's
of course guys you know I'm just just
giving you a really brief example so
here's our video we can go ahead and
scrub through it I feel like I said if
we want to go ahead and add some
animations between different things so
you know could fly slide in etc etc we
also do visual effects so we can go
ahead and may make it a little bit
different but yeah it's not a big deal
so guys that's really Windows Live Movie
Maker and in that show you can do some
pretty decent things I'm not really
going to go into everything there are a
couple of decent things that you can go
ahead and actually just click this
button and actually have it render and
put it up on YouTube without even having
to deal with it so that's a kind of nice
feature you can go ahead of course and
just render it in high-definition or
really whatever you feel like but guys
that's live movie maker if you know if
you need something really basic
bare-bones nothing really all that fancy
everything then this is definitely
something about one check out okay guys
so now for the more advanced user this
is court'll VideoStudio Pro x3 on so
this is my video edited I've used this
for quite a while I really really do
like it basically a lot of you guys will
probably know the program Sony Vegas
well this is very similar to Sony Vegas
Pro 9 only that it does about 90% of
what Vegas does for about $500 less so I
think that's a good compromise I'm
generally quarrel of course it does cost
general you can get it on Amazon I'll
have the link in the description if
you're interested I'm for about $70 or
so for a video editing suite is not that
bad at all look why just give you guys a
brief tour now look I said video studio
is quite a bit more advanced I'm going
to try to you know explain everything
but I'll just show you how to edit a
very simple clip so basically we have
our full video thing here so we can go
ahead and just scroll through videos so
Glen just look for one so again let's
grab that same clip as before and just
drag down to the timeline now this
actually does support quite a few
different advanced features so for
example picture and picture just go
ahead just grab this d3 gaming intro
drag it in here so that if we want just
anchor it at the top left so then if we
want we can go ahead and play it and
you'll see that we have two different
videos running at the same time so there
you go guys if I want to I can go ahead
and render that of course it's not what
I want to do but just as a really brief
description showing you guys how it
works so again we can go ahead just
scrub through wherever we want so again
let's just drop a cut right here and
delete this first part so that looks
good let's scroll down and let's say
that's 12 seconds to the video we want
and that's that now there are several
other things we can go ahead and do
photos so let's go ahead and take my
watermark you just drag down here again
using the picture-in-picture so let's
just put it on the bottom right that
looks good let's see what else does what
do we want to do let's go ahead and just
add a random title so let's just drag
and drop this down to the title tab
again guys I don't really want to get
too in-depth I'm just going to show you
a brief you know a brief thing showing
you how to do this so actually that's
good so let's go ahead and just take a
look at our video so I'm go ahead and
just take a look at the project and
there we go so of course guys nothing
that exciting but there is quite a few
things video studio will let you do you
can go ahead there are quite a few
different effects like for example auto
sketch is actually something a lot of
people like so just go give you a quick
tour it actually pretty cool so as you
see actually will sketch out the video
which is a really really cool feature I
love about that it's not of course you
know the most useful thing in world but
yeah and obviously you can go ahead and
do music you can do transitions there's
lots and lots of transitions so guys
choral VideoStudio Pro x3 is a fantastic
program now of course you still might
need something more in-depth you might
need Sony Vegas for example but again
that runs you well over $500 whether
this is about $70 so you know you can
just weigh it out but personally between
just the interface is pretty decent it's
not really hard to understand it's
really very simple you can drag and drop
most things I really do like choral
VideoStudio Pro okay so let's go ahead
and do a really quick recap so we just
took a look at Windows Live Movie Maker
which is a decent free tool it's not
amazing it won't do a lot of the more
in-depth video editing but if you just
need to cut a couple of Clips you know
edit it really quickly then it's
definitely a really good choice and
obviously it is free on the other hand
if you need something more in-depth I do
recommend coral VideoStudio Pro x3 on so
it's something I use I've edited my
videos on it for quite a while and
before I got it I used its predecessor
so I really do like it and I definitely
like that while it is does cost about
$70 or so that's not too bad considering
that other more in-depth editors that
won't do a whole lot more do cost quite
a bit more so guys if you want to go
ahead and just check out one of these
two programs of course you might need
something more in-depth so you might
need Vegas or you might need some other
program but for most of you one of these
two programs will probably work at
anyway guys I do want to thank tech tip
Man TV for helping me out with the Mac
side so guys definitely go ahead and
check his channel out he's a great guy
and I really appreciate helping me out
anyway guys thanks
