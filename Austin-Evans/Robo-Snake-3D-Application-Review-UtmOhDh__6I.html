a special in-depth application review on
Robo snake 3d okay now I was first off
that I would say I really really enjoy a
little snake it is a lot of fun if you
ever played the the game no cell phone
game snake that you will know instantly
how this works basically what it is is
robust make 3d there's a full 3d version
of the original game snake in its really
pretty cool when you think that it
wasn't that long ago that the only game
most cell phones could play with snake
but I mean let me tell you this Robo
snake 3d is everything snake used to be
and then some if you're not familiar
with snake concept very simple you're a
snake who is constantly moving looking
for food or in the case of Robo snake
batteries the batteries randomly spawn
in different places around the field and
the addition of a red glow around the
batteries really does help you to spot
them because the batteries are kind of
uh they kind of blend into the
surroundings I mean that's not
surroundings the the feel the color of
it anyway as you eat more your tail gets
longer and the difficulty increases and
if you run into either your tail or a
wall game over
however there's a twist and Robo snake
in the form of climbing walls there are
two heights of walls and one of which
you can climb up and then the taller
wall even climb up after you've climbed
up on a short wall it kind of sounds
complicated but it's actually a lot of
fun there are six different fields to
choose from in the game opportunity
different challenges for you to overcome
and adding a good variety and of course
if you're partial to the old style game
which obviously I am as well there is
also just a level no walls at all making
gameplay practically exactly like the
original slept with better graphics the
graphics of the game are really
fantastic although of course some people
might think that the original tiny pixel
graphics is great yeah you know with
everything is rendered in 3d and when I
said that I mean I mean it I mean
everything down to the menu to the
instruction screen everything some
people have asked for tilt controls the
I think the touch controls are about
perfect a merely just swiping whatever
direction you need the snake to go and
that's about all there is to it
now I mean I was a big fan of the old
snake games on the old old cell phones
and you guys use what was it two five
eight and zero to move it
compared to this I mean just easily just
swipe up/down I mean it's it's way
cooler the really the thing the thing
that I can't talk about the reason I
prefer the touch controls compared to
tilt whatever is because when you get a
really long tail I just don't think you
can control it right I mean it would be
because you get so it's so it's so
difficult when you get such a long tail
you have to go left right up down around
and it's all it takes is one tiny
mistake in game over and you lose your
high-score so I definitely I don't think
I do I don't know if tilt controls they
may be added later update but to me not
need really at all while you're playing
you'll notice there's a kind of cool
soundtrack it's kind of techno kind of
uh kind of like you know modern kind of
soundtrack that you would expect for
Robo snake overall robos make 3d brings
together all all the great elements to
the original game but it's in a modern
package for the iPhone and iPod touch
it's it's just a lot of fun I mean
you'll be fine yourself playing it's a
simple game I mean it's not it's not
something in depth it's not something
really you know it's it's just a real
simple game it basically just like the
original snake for snake for all the
cellphones and games and all the kinds
of stuff and basically it's just with
some cool 3d graphics and and when I say
the graph I mean the graphics are just
so great the gameplay is just like that
original snake game except with much
better controls I highly highly
recommend this game it is a dollar I
believe right now I definitely recommend
go pick it up it is a lot of fun if you
think you might be even slightly
interested in least go
