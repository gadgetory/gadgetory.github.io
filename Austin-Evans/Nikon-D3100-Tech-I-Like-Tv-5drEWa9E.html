the first episode of tech I like this is
my brand-new shower as you guys from the
title I'm going to be taking a look at
technology that I like so it could be
anything from computers to cell phones
to cameras to apps whatever I really
like so let's just go ahead and get
started today I'm going to be talking
about the Nikon d3100 so this is the
DSLR that I've been using for over a
year now I guess I really enjoy it so
not only does it have full 1080p
capability and of course you can use all
the different Nikon lenses on top of
that it's only six hundred bucks the D
3100 is the camera that I use for pretty
much all my videos including this one I
find that even though it might not have
all the high-end features of a
professional level DSLR that for what I
need it works absolutely great with a 14
megapixel CMOS sensor you get a lot of
versatility so not only in pictures
which are nice and sharp generally in
pretty much most conditions now on top
of that you also get some really nice
sharp video especially if you get a nice
wide aperture lens photos with the D
3100 are really nice as you guys can see
here there's a lot of really fine detail
that you can pick up in some images on
top of that there's also plenty of room
for some nice depth of field depending
on which lens you use and of course
since it is a DSLR you have full manual
control over pretty much everything that
includes manual focus manual controls
over is OH shutter speed aperture you
name it you can pretty much handle it
with the D 3100 something I personally
like quite a bit is the size and weight
and well sure it might not have the
full-sized grip and the really heavy
construction of some of the more
professional models overall I like it
quite a bit it's not all that heavy so
you can carry around and shoot with it
all day long without any major you know
body building required of course it's
not a perfect package some of the things
I wish to include was better manual
control of the exposure it's pretty much
all automatic if you want to manually do
anything with exposure for the most part
is just going to be consists of hitting
the exposure lock kind of moving the
camera out it's not all really all that
great on top of that for video people
like myself and yes video people it's to
turn look it up some of things I really
wish it had was a flip-out screen that's
really nice for you know getting some
different shots angles and whatnot and
having a microphone input however both
of those are available on the d50 100
overall if you're looking for an
entry-level DSLR I have no problems
recommending the D 3100 of course there
are some good Canon models such as the
t2 I and more notably the t3i
however they're definitely quite
more expensive and if you're not really
looking to spend that kind of money on a
camera
I think the d3 100 is really really nice
that's about it for this first episode
of tech ilight if you guys enjoyed this
video you might see more Bethel if you
should leave a thumbs up let me know if
you liked it or not and if you have any
comments criticisms you name it feel
free to leave them in the comment
