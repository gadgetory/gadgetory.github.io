today I'm here with the video that
hopefully should help a lot of you guys
out there is as most of you will
probably know a rickroll ssh warm that's
going around basically what it's doing
is these hackers are basically they've
created this worm and that's spreading
from device to device and what it's
doing is it's going in through your SSH
and because most most people don't have
their ssh password change is just the
standard Alpine so it goes in and it's
able to mess all kinds of stuff up it
put rick astley all over the place and
make you in half pop up saying hey pay
us two dollars so we'll fix it and and
just kind of just junk like that what
you mean it's just ridiculous so i'm
going to show you guys today how to
avoid it by simply just changing your
ssh password and that's it you're
protected because i mean if you don't
change it i mean that's basically like
you know going around which like you
know your your normal computer whatever
without having a password on it only
that it's worse because you know this is
an actual worm that gets in whereas most
viruses are actually harder to get into
your computer so i'm going to show you
guys how to change your ssh password no
big deal i should keep you guys
protected anyway let's get this one
started
oh hey guys so now let's go ahead and
just do this really simple should take
you just a minute okay so you're going
to need to download one program it's
called mobile terminal obviously if you
have it you can skip this step but if
you don't just do it real easily so go
ahead and open up the cydia and hit the
search okay now you're going to need to
search for mobile terminal it's all one
word so let's go ahead and just mo you
guys you know how to spell it I have in
the description anyway okay so you put t
there you go guys you can see here
mobile terminal go ahead open it up now
you guys know the drill just install it
it's you know it's really small things
just a few kilobytes or something so
shouldn't take just a minute so then go
ahead and install it and come on out to
springboard now go ahead and open it up
and we're going to do just a couple
things now terminal as well mobile
terminology might guess from the name
old terminal is basically just a
terminal application just like you know
on your Windows PC or your linux pc or
or your Mac or whatever it's just really
simple okay so we're going to a couple
of things and you guys will be protected
okay so you're going to need to type in
s you space route so r 00 t okay well
net return now we're going to need to
punch in your password now obviously
this password should be alpine if it's
not you've changed it before and you
really don't need you know you probably
shouldn't be watching this because
that's what we're doing but so go ahead
and punch an Alpine so it's a l.p I in a
squad and hit return okay now we're in
so now we're going to change the
password so that you guys will be
protected so you need to punch in p.a SS
and then instead of wor d it's just WD
okay so it's just PA SS WD hit return
now we're going to punch in a new
password so for the purposes of this
where i'm just going to punch in
ipod touch just kind of something to
remember now winter turn and just type
it in again I will note that it does
need to be at least five characters so
ipod touch and i will know guys that's
not a recommended password because i
wouldn't doubt if people trying to hack
that's that that'd be a good password to
hack that's just I'm just showing you
guys just an example so you know
probably come up with something a little
bit better that you can still remember
okay so once you've done it you will see
the its back and it shows root you're
done it won't say confirm or anything it
will just show what's on the screen so
now all you have to do is just tap
anywhere on the black and just click
exit just go ahead and tell yes you do
want to quit terminal and your guys
you're done now your device is protected
and you won't really have to worry about
you know getting rickrolled or getting
scammed or or something even worse so if
you need to ssh still go ahead and
continue watching the video but
otherwise know that you're totally
secure and you're ready to go anyway
let's go on to the next step okay so
this part is dead simple you guys
probably be able to figure it out on
your own but I just show you guys just
make sure okay so just open up your ssh
program of choice my case is one at CP
and now you will still have your IP
address I just did take that out for the
purposes of the video now you just need
to come over just leave the route the
username I'm sorry the username alone
but you come over to the password and
exit out I need to punch in your new
password which in my case is ipod touch
so just punch that in and then go ahead
and hit save okay and I always say the
password you don't have to do that but
yes so there you go guys that is how to
protect yourself against the rickroll
SSH warm now I'll say guys for right now
it's been pretty tame I mean you can you
can undo the rickroll and you know you
can delete the stuff but you don't want
I mean that you don't want that to
happen in the first place and it could
be worse they could be taking your
sensitive information all kinds of
different stuff so you know you guys you
really i really be careful with this i
mean i mean it's really simple just
change your password and you'll be good
to go
as you can see here it's not like you
can't ssh anymore just change your
password and off you go anyway guys
that's it thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
