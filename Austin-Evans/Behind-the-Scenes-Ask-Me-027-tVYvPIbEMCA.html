yes the switch to 4k was it worth it so
a lot of videos this one included are
actually shot in 1080
I don't think looking at my face in 4k
is going to make this video much better
than 1080p although then again this face
needs 4k what I say this face does not
be free it does make sense though for
videos like the PlayStation 4 vs Xbox
one comparison so these are videos that
I have extra time to work on since
working with 4k means that the file
sizes are giant takes longer to edit
takes longer to even do simple things
like offloading like 100 gigs of footage
so I'm totally cool doing 4k and as kind
of I get my workflow nailed down I want
to do more and more videos in 4k but a
lot of times it saves me enormous amount
of time by just shooting in 1080p do you
think the Samsung Galaxy s6 edge+ is a
good buy okay hold on hold on hold on
the Samsung Galaxy s6 edge+
it's actually I think that's the first
time I've said out loud so I got to try
it recently and it seems like a really
solid phone so it's very similar to the
normal Galaxy s6 edge which I'm a huge
fan of I think that's probably one of
these sexiest pieces of phone hardware
I've ever tried if it can really last a
full day that edge plus has my name
written all over it
what's the hardest video you have ever
had to shoot and edit it was definitely
how real is virtual reality so that was
going to be a much smaller video I was
actually started shooting it in January
and then the opportunity to work with
Castro came up and they had this giant
elaborate project set up gonna mute my
computer now and the actual Shiva twas
fun but the Edit of that video took
literally months the amount of work that
went into it was crazy
so I'm really proud of how it came out
but that was not an easy project at all
are you looking forward to the iPhone 6s
yeah for sure
I mean it's a 6s so I'm not expecting
any kind of crazy upgrades but you know
2 gigs of ram would be nice you know
other stuff like improve specs and
cameras but mostly the RAM Apple can you
please give us 2 gigs of RAM it's 2015
thanks how do you focus the camera on
yourself when you shoot so I shoot
basically all of my videos by myself and
this is basically the setup so there's a
microphone above me that goes straight
into the camera
and to be able to actually focus the
camera what I do is I shoot on a fairly
wide lens so right now you've got a
pretty wide field of view what I do is I
can actually reach out and touch the
lens though camera I use right now the
screen doesn't flip all the way forward
so sometimes it's a little bit of trial
and error but basically the big thing is
get a camera that has a screen that can
kind of flip up so you can see yourself
which is just handy to have in the first
place
and just kind of get it nice and close
so you can actually manually focus it
and try to make sure that you get it in
focus and not like this cuz no one wants
to see a video like this plan on doing
any chromebook stuff I've done a few
things on Chrome OS I did a video on the
chrome box last year I also did a video
comparing a Chromebook versus a $230
Windows laptop but there definitely some
new Chromebooks coming out soon some of
them are really really cheap like I was
in Best Buy the other day there's like
$150 Chromebook on the shelf so I know
I'm thinking about maybe taking a look
at this super super low-end stuff
sitting it's actually worth it so let me
know if you guys actually want to see
that video actually drop to let me know
I'm gonna do it anyway are you planning
anything for your career or are you a
full time youtuber I've pretty much been
all-in on YouTube for about five years
now so when I came time for me to decide
if I wanted to go to college or not I
was already actually doing fairly well
on YouTube at the time and for me I
couldn't think of anything that I really
wanted to do more than what I was
already doing right then and there not
exactly any degrees in YouTube Balaji
I just think that the world is moving
online so fast I mean it's just very
obvious to me that this is the future
and I kind of feel like I'm in a really
good position to to be able to take
advantage of a lot of cool opportunities
they'll make awesome videos to be able
to do all kinds of fun stuff so for me I
mean know nothing is forever I mean
hopefully YouTube still around in 50
years but there's no way I'm going
anywhere anytime soon I do have to give
you guys a heads up I'm currently in the
middle of moving right now so apologize
for the lack of videos recently and
there might be a slight lack of videos
for the next week or so but bear with me
I'm actually moving out to LA I need to
be there and like less than a week and I
have two boxes packed so yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
