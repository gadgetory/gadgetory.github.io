today I'm here with the coolest video
I've done in a long time
I'm going to be showing you guys how to
use the Nintendo Entertainment System
emulator of the nez on your iPod or
iPhone
I'm going to show you how to control it
using your Wii mote this is totally
legit I'm not making this up this
totally works it's awesome and yeah it's
really cool or much better than touch
controls so you're actually touching
something anyway let's get this one
started
okay guys so the first thing that you're
going to need to do is download rock for
your iPhone or iPod touch obviously
you're gonna need to be two hooking for
this but pretty sure you guys should
know that you don't know what rakia is
it's basically kind of a an alternative
to Cydia and just because you download
it does not mean you have to go away
from city or anything but this is the
way to do it you can also get it in
Cydia through the Zod TTD repo which is
a community though you should I have it
if you download they're basically all it
will do is download rock for you too
that way either way it doesn't matter
whichever one is more convenient to you
so yeah so anyway I'm just go ahead and
show you guys real quick okay so once
you're in here or something you're doing
it from wrong it's really simple all you
need to do is just hit trial download it
it will be a I'm almost positive a 10
day trial and for free it's it's not an
option and you know obviously you're
gonna need to buy it or do something
later on but your trial works and
obviously it works for the Wiimote so
anyway let's go ahead and setup the
Wiimote and show you guys how to do it
in all okay so let's go ahead and do it
we're going to open up the launcher now
I will note for this - before you do it
you will need to make sure that
bluetooth is shut off and the way it
works is through bluetooth and
unfortunately if you have an earlier
iPhone or if you don't have an iPod
Touch 2nd generation if you have an iPod
Touch first generation you don't have
bluetooth unfortunately but if you do
have bluetooth you're all set ok so at
this point just launch it and I'll start
searching ok
set this aside and pull out our remote
just a standard Wii mote you don't I
mean if you want you can buy one of
these which is I believe it's about $40
or so you buy one of these or if you
have a Wii already you have one tonight
it's very simple if you've ever used it
before you know that all I have to do is
press 1 and 2 so let me show you guys
here get them both here so just hold one
two there we go all right okay so you
see it's connected and it shows now you
just pick out whatever wrong you want to
use so let me go ahead and get all
everything set up show you guys how to
use it
okay guys so let's go ahead and get this
one started so the controls are pretty
simple this is going to be the same and
you're going to need to have its on its
landscape mode yes these this is start
this is select and then this is a and B
so it's real simple so let's go ahead
and hit the start let's do it to play
one play game yeah
now I'll show you guys it's just like
anything else you know
and of course this will work for any nez
game
you basically just hook up the wrong I'm
not gonna tell you guys Teddy that you
should know I obviously know how to do
it legally and all that kind of stuff so
I can get into that you can see here
that the controls are really good the
Wiimote works well you know it's not
it's nothing amazing I mean you know
compared to the controller it just does
feel a little bit odd but it's still I
mean there's miles and miles ahead of
what using the controls on iphone it's
pretty simple once you all you need to
do is just make sure it's paired and
like I said before be sure that I'm
pretty much dead but be sure that you do
have bluetooth shut off so this beatty
stack which is what it uses to connect
to it can connect up properly so my guys
that is how to use a Wii mode to control
your Nintendo Entertainment System on
your iPhone or iPod touch very cool
works perfectly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
