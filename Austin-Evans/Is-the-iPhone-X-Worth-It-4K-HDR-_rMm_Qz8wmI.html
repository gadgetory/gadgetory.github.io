iPhone ever it has the biggest screen
smalls bezels and it is the first iPhone
to drop the home button but the question
is is it worth it it all starts with the
design from the rear it looks very
similar to the iPhone 8 you're getting
an all-glass back for the first time
since the iPhone 4 days the 10 comes in
two colors silver and Space Gray the
silver is basically just white with a
silver chassis where the Space grade
swaps out the rear glass for a very dark
gray color and a dark metal band it
really does look and feel premium
there's a saltness and heft to the
design that just wasn't there on the
iPhone 6 and 7 however there's a price
to pay for that unlike a metal back
which might just get scratched or dented
no matter how strong Apple claims in
this glass is it can absolutely be
cracked if you drop it one of the
upsides to switch into glass for the
rear panel is the addition of wireless
charging in a very on Apple like move
this supports the chief standard that
has been around on Android phones for
years meaning that you should just be
able to drop the 10 on a cheap wireless
charging pad and it'll work no problem
you also get the small added benefit of
being able to fast charge the 10 via a
USB C lightning cable too now the silver
phone is especially prone to scratching
as they moved from aluminum to stainless
steel this is a harder material that
gives the phone it's expensive feel but
like the old iPods expect it to scuff
easily thankfully like the iPhone 7
you've got ip67 water resistance
now this isn't full waterproofing your
shiny new $1000 iPhone should have no
problem getting a little wet or even
totally submerged for a minute like
always the design looks great but you
should probably get a case flip the
phone over though and you'll see the
biggest change this year the display put
the 10 side-by-side with the 8 plus and
the lack of bezels really does make the
phone look like a much more modern
flagship it looks similar to the Galaxy
Note 8 it lacks the curved edges but has
nearly no bezels otherwise except for
the knotch after using the phone for a
few days it doesn't really bother me
when you're using the phone in portrait
mode it basically just means that you
get a little bit of extra vertical
screen real estate with stuff like
battery and time on the edges when
watching video you have a couple options
for standard sixteen by nine content the
true blacks of the OLED panel make
things look a lot like a normal iPhone
but for example in YouTube you can pinch
to zoom into full screens you crop a
little of the frame
and sometimes the notch looks a bit off
but it's a good way of taking full
advantage of the display now I'm not all
apps support the 10 yet a lot will
display with black bars on top and
bottom
thanks to OLED the blacks are properly
black so that mostly means it just looks
like you're using an iPhone 7 that
display though really is something the
change from IPS to OLED means that
you're getting far better contrast that
black is actually black here I know we
keep saying it but it really does make a
huge difference the screen looks so much
more contrasting the color is pleasant
as well it's nicely calibrated and the
screen gets impressively bright my only
real issue is that there is a bit of
color shifting when you look at it off
access but it's fairly minor and the
rest of the advantages of OLED
definitely outweigh its value Phone 10
also gives you support for HDR 10 and
Dolby vision watching stranger things 2
on the 10 looks phenomenal
the brightness and contrast really does
make content pop in fact we're shooting
this video in HDR if you're watching on
an HDR TV with something like a
chromecast ultra or even some
smartphones like the Galaxy S II you
should be able to see the difference
audio is also impressive on the 10 it
has a pair of speakers one front firing
that doubles as the speakerphone and the
other on bottom it's not quite as loud
and crisp as dedicated stereo speakers
on the pixel 2 but it pulls away
basically any other flagship out there
right now combine that with the great
screen and you have one of the best
mobile video experiences period
something interesting is that the iPhone
10 touch layer refreshes at 120 Hertz
the screen itself is still 60 Hertz
which can't match the level of
smoothness of something like the razor
phone or iPad pro but that faster touch
layer does make the phone feel a lot
more responsive with the new screen
comes arguably the biggest change to the
iPhone in the last 10 years no more home
button on one hand it's what gives the
iPhone its most recognizable shape but
in 2017 it's looking awfully out of date
instead of the home button the 10 relies
on a series of gestures to navigate the
phone swiping up is replace the home
button and the gesture area doubles as a
quick swipe to move between apps after a
couple of days to me this feels like a
very natural evolution iOS already uses
so many gestures to navigate that once
you drop the button and totally commit
it speeds up moving around the entire
interface there are some trade-offs
though some button combos have changed
for example you now hold the power
button to trigger Siri and you can
screenshot by holding power
and volume up the biggest trade-off is
that there's no longer touch ID instead
the iPhone 10 introduces face ID this is
a big reason why the notch is as big as
it is you're essentially getting a
Kinect that has been miniaturized into
the top of a phone I will absolutely
admit that before I tried the 10 I had
my doubts about face ID but it actually
works
after a quick set up it works basically
as advertised tap the screen and then
the time it takes for you to swipe up to
unlock face ID scan your face and
unlocks the phone it's not perfect you
do need to be looking at the phone for
it to work
but I was impressed with just how
versatile it is your results might vary
but I basically have no major complaints
with face ID it feels like I just don't
have a passcode this take also makes an
emoji possible look these are just fun
okay this works as an iMessage app that
scans your face and translates it into a
talking emoji it does a really good job
of even capturing small facial motions
and lets you do karaoke so you know one
area that's basically the same between
the iPhone 8 and 10 is performance both
phones give you the Apple a 11 Bionic
which is hands down the fastest chip you
can get in a phone today this translates
into a phone that feels like you just
can't trip it up no matter how much I
multitask it just doesn't break a sweat
animations stay locked at 60 frames per
second and because you have those new
gestures it feels lightning-fast to move
between apps well this isn't exclusive
to the ten this power does come in handy
for games of course standard titles like
Minecraft run here no problem but you
also have some pretty fun AR games the
iPhone 10 brings a pair of 12 megapixel
cameras one wide-angle and one telephoto
this is the same basic setup as on the 8
plus and it works well here Apple has
cranked up saturation this generation
and it makes images look a lot more
punchy which will maybe not quite
technically accurate does make for a
better looking photo there's a good
amount of detail but what's really
impressive is the dynamic range HDR is
on by default and there have been a few
shots where I legitimately couldn't
believe how much range the 10 was able
to keep in one picture the telephoto
camera on the 7 plus came in handy for
me a fair bit but it's a lot better on
the 10 it still isn't quite as sharp as
the main shooter but it now has image
stabilization which makes a big
difference especially in low-light the
11 chip inside does quite a bit to
analyze each shot and make adjustments
based on that now while the days of the
iPhone having far and away the best cam
a smartphone or over you really won't be
disappointed with what you get out of
the 10 portrait mode makes a return here
and it's solid if you look closely you
can see where the camera doesn't
perfectly cut you out of the background
sometimes but for the most part it does
a good job you can now also take
portrait selfies these rely on good life
with pretty optimal conditions but when
done right they can really make the
front-facing camera look a lot more
expensive the problem is that while
decent in a vacuum
I really prefer the way that the pixel 2
handles these what you guys can check
out at my full comparison portrait mode
is handled well on the iPhone 10 but
there's room for improvement as the guy
who shoots a bit of video I have to say
the iPhone 10 is about as good as a
smartphone gets right now it shoots 4k
at 24 30 or 60 frames per second I have
absolutely no complaints about the
quality stabilization is terrific colors
nicely saturated dynamic range is good
and the auto focus and exposure
generally do a great job you also get
solid 1080p 240 frames per second slow
motion options as well as these still
impressive built-in time-lapse mode put
it all together and it is hard to be
disappointed with the iPhone 10 camera
and that really is a story of this phone
while battery life isn't quite as good
as on the gate plus it's still
significantly better than previous
iPhones and for me it was really no
problem to make it through a full day of
use when Apple announced $1000 price tag
for the iPhone 10 they pretty much threw
down the gauntlet if this one wasn't
incredible there was no way that it
would be worth it but it kind of is
