of grand theft auto on the ps4 Xbox one
and soon on the PC I decided to take a
look at how far these new versions we're
able to push the latest round of
consoles GTA 5 is easily one of the most
ambitious games for the nearly decade
old Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 with the
massive open world that's filled with
NPCs vehicles along with hundreds of
interesting places to explore
graphically it's very similar on the 360
and ps3 the lighting engine delivers
slightly different results sometimes but
you're getting the same 720p resolution
regardless jump up to the ps4 version
and it's a significant upgrade not only
is the game world more detailed but
we're running at 1080p on both the ps4
m1 which is a welcome change things look
much sharper across the board which
combined with improvements like much
more robust depth of field overhauled
lighting and better facial animations
makes a big difference
these were the opportunities I had at
least I took legit oh yeah I forgot huh
oh okay tax returns and all yeah right
the slightly wooden faces from the
previous games are much more believable
on the ps4 and Xbox one which is helped
by the lighting upgrades this is
especially noticeable at night as there
are reflections all over the place that
really helped to smooth out some of the
rougher edges on the textures just as
noticeable as the upgrades in the
graphics department is a massively
improved framerate considering just how
big of a game gg5 is it wasn't a huge
surprise that on the last gen consoles
while they targeted 30 frames per second
it would dip into the mid and low 20s
quite often especially when driving jump
over to the Xbox one and these drops
almost vanish well we're still working
with 30fps instead of 60 the newer
consoles have no problem keeping it
locked to 30 for the most part this
makes a huge difference as much as I
enjoyed GTA 5 when it came out the
choppy framerate on the 360 was almost
enough to drive you crazy sometimes you
can notice the game dipping below 30fps
on the ps4 every once in a while just
like with the older consoles that seems
to be an issue with the driving
interestingly I didn't really notice the
same problem on the Xbox one it would
stutter very rarely but on the ps4 it's
fairly repeatable if you've got a lot of
traffic and a decently fast car on the
other hand the ps4 has a few extra
features over the Xbox version of the
game the light bar on the controller
changes color based on your health
as well as flashes red and blue when you
have a wanted level Rockstar also takes
advantage of the speaker in the
DualShock for to play cell phone calls
and radio chatter gameplay is basically
unchanged with one big exception there's
now a first-person mode on the ps4 and
one at first it's very bizarre as the
field of view seems to be a bit tight
but once you get used to it it's a
totally new way of playing GTA it makes
the game a lot more realistic for both
good and bad dragging someone out of
their car or getting run over crossing
the street feels a lot more brutal but
the controls for running a first-person
could use some tweaking and the view can
feel a bit restrictive sometimes getting
yourself into a police chase or shootout
in first-person though is absolutely
awesome Grand Theft Auto 5 was
incredible on the 360 and ps3 and it's
even better on the new consoles it looks
a fair bit better runs far smoother and
the first-person view just makes sense
now all that's left is to see how things
around the PC when it comes out in
January so be sure to subscribe to the
channel so you don't miss that one
anyway guys thank you so much for
watching and I will catch you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
