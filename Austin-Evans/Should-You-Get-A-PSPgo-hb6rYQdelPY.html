while it breaks new ground by ditching
the UMD tries and getting a new sleek
slider form factor it certainly isn't
perfect between the total loss all your
original PSP UMTS and the fact that
downloadable games can cause even more
it's not for everyone so let's dive into
the good and the bad obscenities latest
handheld system
the PSP go is shed the UMD drive of the
original PSP make this easily the
biggest update says the PSP was released
in an age of digital downloads the large
noisy and slow UMD discs we're a
throwback to a while ago in losing the
UMD drive the PSP Go has finally been
able to shrink by a substantial margin
now roughly the size of an iphone and
finally easily pocketable and has gained
some nice-looking slide-out controls
however this is certainly not the PSP to
- the biggest gripes pad or what it
doesn't add namely a touchscreen or even
a second analog stick the new PSP Go
comes with 16 gigabytes of flash storage
which is going to be definitely
appreciated considering some games can
easily be one gigabyte in size in
addition you can expand the storage by
adding a Memory Stick Micro as a PSP go
now solely relies on downloadable
content you will likely spend plenty of
time on the PlayStation Store where a
decent variety of full PSP games
PlayStation 1 classics and new PSP minis
can be found which are similar to games
found on the iPhone indeed several of
the launch titles or ports of iPhone
games
unfortunately downloading them from the
device can be a chore just bears with
the original PSP both still use the
outdated 802 11 be Wi-Fi protocol which
is much slower than the majority of new
devices regardless of your connection is
likely going to be a better idea to
download games from your computer and
sync them over using the new media go
software when you compare the PSP go to
the PSP 3000 there are quite a few
differences which you should take into
consideration
obviously the PSP Go is much smaller and
having 16 gigabytes of built-in flash
storage is certainly a welcome addition
the screen size is a bit smaller than on
the PSP 3000 3.7 inches compared to 4.3
but the resolution is the same and the
PSP Go seems to have a bit of a brighter
screen so that's mostly a wash however a
big sticking point is the price the PSP
3000
goes for 170 dollars while the PSP go is
a much deeper 250 if you already own a
PSP and you will also basically have to
scrap your entire collection of um DS
because there's no way to get them over
to your PSP go in addition all the
downloadable content for the PSP co is
available for the original PSP in the
end it comes down to whether you want to
upgrade from your PSP or even make the
plunge as a first-time PSP owner in both
cases it's hard to wholeheartedly
recommend the PSP go unless you
absolutely have to have the new form
factor or just can't stand um DS
with a price cut to $200 the PSP go
would be a much more appealing choice
but for now it's a very expensive
proposition that doesn't get you that
much back in return</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
