here with a look in my video game
console collection to start let's take a
look at the Game Boy which I've always
been a big fan of here we've got the
original play at loud models and black
along with a really cool transparent
version compared to today's standards
it's an absolute brick and not really
all that pocketable but for the time it
wasn't half bad it might not have aged
that well but the Game Boy is still one
of my favorites
another cool handheld is the Game Boy
light this was a Japanese only version
of the pocket that included a lit screen
years before it hit other Game Boy
models the screen was still pretty dim
and it only plays original Game Boy
games but it's still an interesting look
back while it's not rare in the
slightest I've got to give a shout out
to the Game Boy Color as well I don't
think it's an exaggeration to say I
spent the majority of my childhood on
this playing the original Pokemon games
and it still works like new nearly 15
years later probably the best Gameboy
ever would be the Advance SP not only
does it play all Game Boy games on a
backlit screen but it's also got a
compact folding design that survived
years in my pocket considering that I
still get a couple hours per charge on a
ten-year-old battery this is definitely
one of my favourite consoles ever moving
on to a slightly less good portable we
have the Nokia ngage QD which was
recently featured in my top 5 worst
phones ever video while in some ways it
was the first phone to take gaming
seriously it was also very flawed at
both making calls and playing on the go
still though the engage is an
interesting part of my collection now
let's move on to a few of my favorite
full-sized systems the original
PlayStation 1 was the first console to
drag my younger self out of the arcade
it along with the much smaller ps1
really showed that Sony could make a
stellar console and all the graphics
haven't held up too well there are still
lots of games there's much fun to play
as ever one of my favorite parts of my
collection is the orange Nintendo 64
I've got to admit I'm still a sucker for
transparent consoles and the n64 was a
perfect choice to get the see-through
treatment the Sega Dreamcast is probably
one of the most underrated consoles ever
it had all kinds of impressive features
including online play solid graphics and
some great games some really great games
another console I think a lot of people
overlook is the Nintendo GameCube these
are ridiculously cheap now especially
considering how many fun games they have
oh and did I mention that has a handle
I don't see how you can argue with this
so these are some of my favorite systems
but I'm curious to know what's your
favorite game console of all time
