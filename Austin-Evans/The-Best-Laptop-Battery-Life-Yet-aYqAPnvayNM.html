might have some of the best battery life
in the world so this is the gram 13 and
big shout-out to LG purse poncing this
video so not only is this supposed to
have good battery life but it's also a
very lightweight laptop so like ram name
isn't just for show this guy weighs
around a kilogram or just over 2 pounds
so inside the box we get the laptop
itself with a very handy little G to
pick it up oh that was uh that was me I
bet that's is she really weirdly liked
continuing on we actually have a lot of
accessories starting with a USB C 2
Ethernet adapter really so even though
this is a 13 inch laptop it's actually
almost closer to an 11 inch laptop and
footprint as I shall demonstrate with
this totally random generic no-name 11
inch laptop I did only keep saying this
but this is so lightweight so what's
cool is even though it almost feels like
it's plastic this is actually magnesium
or rather it's a nano carbon magnesium
alloy kid maybe put this on by the way
he thought it would be funny for such a
thin laptop there are actually quite a
few ports so on the left side you'll
find that there is a charging port USB 3
HDMI as well as USB C and if you flip it
over to find there's one more USB 3 port
a headphone jack as well as a micro SD
card slot I just like doing this it's
just so lightweight it feels like I know
it just feels like there's like
something missing but it's just a really
lightweight laptop
I think the build quality is actually
something that's really jumping out to
me about the grand so if you guys saw my
friend what's inside when they took a
look at the Graham they actually put
this thing to a lot of abuse MLG claims
they can handle something like 400
pounds of pressure without breaking the
screen is flexible so it doesn't
actually break it's for something so
lightweight more durable and you would
think inside the grand 13 is powered by
a dual core i5 7200 U which is based on
KB Lakes that's pretty much as new as it
gets a gigabytes of memory as well as a
256 gigabyte SSD the speakers are
interesting so they are kind of on the
bottom but they actually project
sideways so while there may not quite as
loud as I would like there's you don't
sound that bad
what's cool about having that full USB C
port is that what
single cable we can attach the gram to a
4k monitor and now are we going to get
that 4k video signal we can also get
charging to the laptop as well as extra
data via the USB ports on the monitor so
first impressions of the Graham are
pretty solid but I really want to put to
the test is that battery life I'm going
to keep this for the weekend so the
first thing that jumps out to me about
using the Graham especially as I travel
is that wait so after using a giant
laptop for the last year and a half or
so having something that's so light and
so portable actually does make a
difference my peg feels like it weighs a
lot less of course the biggest part of
the grant is that battery life so it has
been nearly four days since I took this
off the charger and let's see what the
battery life is like so I open it up
here right now we are at 48 percent that
is not bad and I have not used this
thing lightly so on top of being in
standby for four days I watched about
three hours of Netflix some YouTube
answers some females it's in web
browsing and this is absolutely held up
now I will say that you should turn
battery saver on that definitely does
give you a fair bit extra battery life
but with a laptop like this it kind of
makes you use it differently so I was
able to use the Graham one-handed with
the touchscreen mind you it's not maybe
the most comfortable way of using a
laptop in the world but having something
that's so lightweight with a touchscreen
actually does work out pretty well
performance is pretty snappy so with
that cable a Core i5 processor it easily
handles any kind of basic usage and even
more moderate stuff like Photoshop runs
no problem now you won't want to do a
lot of heavy gaming or especially video
editing on this guy but for pretty much
98% of what I do every day it's
completely fine
well the laptop like this the inputs
really do matter and I don't have any
complaints about the Graham so the
keyboard itself is nicely spaced it has
plenty of key travel and as an upgrade
from the previous grant it's fully
backlit this time the tripod is also
pretty decent so my only slight
complaint is that it's maybe not quite
as accurate as I'd like but for the most
part it's completely fine and I end up
opting for the slightly upgraded version
of the Graham with the touchscreen which
definitely makes a big difference I
really do feel like Windows 10 laptops
should all have touchscreens at this
point so you know that screen is on
point so
don't let that 1080p resolution fool you
it really is more than enough for a
13-inch display especially when you
consider that the higher resolution
screens usually do hurt battery life
more importantly it's got a really solid
IPS panel so color contrast especially
viewing angles are nice
it gets reasonably bright even your
outside and because it has such thin
bezel it makes the overall Watts upsides
a lot smaller than it otherwise would be
the only issue with the small bezel is
it puts the webcam on the bottom of the
screen which gives you a great view of
the inside of your nose one cool part
about upgrading to the touch screen
model is that it does come with a
fingerprint reader this is again
something guys find amusing all the time
on laptops it's so nice to be able to
use Windows hello to drop your finger on
the touch pad and immediately log in it
is really nice to be able to take a
laptop on a full weekend trip and not
even think about taking the power
adapter so what do you guys think about
the LG Graham let me know in the
comments below and I will catch you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
