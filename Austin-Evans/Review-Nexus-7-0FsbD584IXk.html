review of the google nexus 7 for only
two hundred dollars with features like a
quad-core processor and android 4.1
jelly bean it looks good on paper but
how is it to use and a word excellent
the assume eight hardware is rock-solid
with a seven inch 1280 by 800 display up
front and a textured rubber backing it
can be easily used in one hand and it
really feels like a paperback book and
use more importantly the build quality
shows no signs of the two hundred dollar
price as the tablet is just as solid
feeling as you could hope for up front
is a 1.2 make a pixel camera and on
bottom is your micro USB and a headphone
jack around back is the speaker which is
one of my few complaints as it's just
very quiet on the right side you'll see
your sleep wake button and volume rocker
just like on an android phone in fact in
many ways the Nexus seems like a large
phone android 4.1 jelly bean trade some
tablet features for a more typical
android experience for example you can't
rotate the home screen and many apps
default to a normal phone UI such as
Twitter this isn't really a bad thing
though as the 7 inch size isn't that
much larger than phones like the galaxy
s3 and it means that in many cases the
lack of Android tablet apps doesn't
matter at all jelly bean as a whole as a
major improvement over previous versions
of Android polish is one of the big
things Google worked on and it shows
while not quite as smooth as iOS on the
iPad and then the less it's leaps and
bounds smoother than any other Android
device out there you'll also see Google
now Google how tall is the Empire State
Building Empire State Building is 1450 4
feet tall in some ways is like a much
faster Siri especially when asking for
facts it does have its limits but
overall Google now is a solid addition
while I prefer the Snapdragon s4 found
in phones like the HTC one x and samsung
galaxy s3 the quad core NVIDIA Tegra 3
chipset is no slouch inside the Nexus 7
you'll find a slightly lower powered
Tegra clocked at one point three
gigahertz don't let that put you off
though this little $200 tablet has more
power than some laptops just a couple
years ago one great example would be the
game Riptide GP as the graphics here are
among the most impressive you'll find on
any mobile platform battery life is
another high point
with basic usage like reading web
browsing and watching video you can
expect to get between eight and nine
hours out of a charge really tax the
tablet with gaming and you can expect
something closer to five to six hours 47
inch tablet I have absolutely no
complaints here there's a lot you can
say about the Nexus 7 on one hand the
screen size definitely isn't for
everyone although personally it's the
perfect size for me the speaker is
anemic and quite often I find myself
accidentally pressing the on screen
android buttons these are nitpicks
however as the Nexus 7 is an excellent
tablet between the solid Hardware
up-to-date internals Android 4.1 and the
two hundred dollar price this is the
first tablet as then the iPad that I can
gladly recommend if you're interested in
more feel free to check out my unboxing
of the nexus 7 here if you enjoyed this
video definitely be sure to leave it a
thumbs up and if you're interested in
