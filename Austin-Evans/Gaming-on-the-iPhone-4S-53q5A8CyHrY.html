gaming on the iPhone 4s first game I
will be showing you is Real Racing 2 now
really racing one was probably one of my
favorite racing games I've ever played
on a handheld and Real Racing 2 is just
that but plus and more way better
graphics a better control and all that
kind of good stuff so hopefully J's can
see here the graphics for almost
spectacular I want to hesitate a little
bit but they're actually just great so
I'm go ahead and take off here the
controls I'm Real Racing 2 are pretty
solid it's gonna see here on the if you
touch anywhere on the right hand side
that becomes the accelerator they hit
over here it's gonna be the brake and to
steer we just need to tilt the device
now it's one of the nice things about
having iPhone 4s is that of course it
does have motion control so we can you
know tilt and all that kind of stuff and
also does have a gyroscope so it's very
precise so I'm not so sure how we got
some tell in the camera but the motion
is pretty close to 1 to 1 now beyond
that there are other control methods and
that's I think it's a big thing for list
for me it is is that you really need to
have a lot of control like options
because of course there's no physical
buttons that you can really use for
gaming and you know there's a lot of
well it just came full tiring when your
constant having to use the screen so if
you'd like you can just use the model
whoops or option rather that you can it
will automatically do the gas and the
brake for you and just kind of do a
little steering yeah it's okay but not
too big of a deal but go ahead and tap
up over here we can go into the end
cockpit view if I can do it without
crashing and I'm a big sucker for in cup
pit views in racing games and hopefully
well a little dark there you go maybe
you guys can see a little bit
yeah there we go that's one way to pass
everybody is just not hit the brakes and
almost right but you guys that's gonna
be about it for real racing too there's
a lot of really nice things about it the
cars do have damage so if I battery but
if I resume here but if I reckon to
somebody or do something like that and
the damage will be there and of course
there's all licensed cars you have a
full career mode multiplayer all
definitely good stuff so if you're
looking for a good racing game we're
racing to is definitely something you
should take a look at another excellent
game on the iPhone 4s is jetpack joyride
now this is probably the game I play the
most in the past few weeks and months or
so and what it is is it's a really
simple game it's not like super high
resolution graphics or anything like
that what it is if you can control this
little guy I believe his name is Barry
and you just tap on the right side of
the screen to use your jetpack so you
can see here I can run or I can fly up
top what you do is avoid all those like
laser things while collecting coins
there are also some power-ups so this
one is not exclusive to the iPhone 4s
you can pick it up on older devices if
you want there we go we have to power up
so now we have a
pogs we can go shoot these scientists
and grab another powerup which allows us
to ups fail but yet now this one gets a
lot is a lot of fun there's lots of
different things you can unlock you see
if we have wit's missile here America
and of course collect more coins but
like I said this is probably the game
I've spent the most time on the past
couple months I absolutely love it and
it does run really nicely on iPhone 4s
now this is one of those cheaper games I
believe it's only about $0.99 or so as
recording this there we go get another
powerup and it's just it's just great
fun it's got a lot of replayability and
just keep trying there's lots of
different options we can do and of
course we have an awesome teleport that
we can just fly around until we kill
ourselves yes it's on a little bit like
that
alright now let's kill ourselves one
more time I'll show you guys to pull
there we go so when you die it's kind of
it's all based on scores so we went
1250 meters because we picked up a few
power-ups you know cut out to play this
a couple times there it goes the next
time we get a head start and all that
kind of stuff oh and we get a second
chance
I believe a guys that is going to be
jetpack joyride she's gonna go play for
a little bit the next game I will be
showing you is dead space a dead space
is a 2008 Xbox and PlayStation 3 game
and this is not a direct port but it is
a version of it on the iPhone 4s I know
this is another one of those really
really cool games you can obviously tell
that and they spend a lot of money it's
not like one of these like sheep you
know junk games you'll find on the
iPhone this is actually a really legit
one so go ahead and take over it is a
third person almost shooter I don't know
if I'd like white-collar shooters
but yeah so we can go ahead and control
it the controls on this game is not too
bad
in general I'm not really a big fan of
the touchscreen like you know the Xperia
Play is one really nice thing I'm going
to look around here but the Xperia Play
is one thing that has you know this a
nice advantage over the iPhone is of
course it does have the physical
controls but beyond that I do think that
this game is pretty solid so the way it
works is you can just tap on the various
things and the graphics are really quite
nice not sure sure how what you guys can
see on the camera the graphics are very
very nice I would honestly it's not too
far off from the Xbox on the PlayStation
which is pretty impressive for Strings
as a phone you see here some particle
effects and all that kind of stuff and
of course the for the farther along you
go you have to fight aliens you get all
kinds of weapons what not infected
believe when you look over here there we
go pick up our plasma saw baby yeah this
is another really great game dead space
if you're into shooters
kind of want to be creeped out and want
to put some headphones on whatever this
is a great game go for it anyway guys
it's gonna be about it for gaming on the
iPhone 4s now that was just a small
taste in the games that you can play
there are thousands upon thousands of
them in the App Store now all of them
are good of course but there are lots
and lots of really nice gems she can
definitely pick up and of course one of
the great things about it
this is typically instead of paying your
twenty or thirty or forty dollars for a
game like say Nintendo 3ds or an in GP
or rather a PSP or anything like that of
course most of these are going to be
running from anywhere from $1 to I know
some of the really good ones are gonna
be like five or six but overall the
prices are not too bad anyway guys if
you enjoyed this video definitely be
sure to leave it a thumbs up and if
