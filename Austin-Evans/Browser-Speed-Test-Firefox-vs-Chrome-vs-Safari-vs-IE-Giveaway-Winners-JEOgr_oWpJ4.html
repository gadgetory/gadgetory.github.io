I've got a special video on browser
speed namely which browser is the
fastest Iran each of the four top
browsers through six tests measuring
JavaScript speed overall page loading
speed CSS rendering and startup time I
cover the latest releases of Microsoft
Internet Explorer 8 google chrome to
apple safari 4 in firefox 3 i did test
firefox with and without add-ons running
and contrary to what most people think
actually didn't see any slowdown at all
in fact generally with add-ons running
firefox was at least as fast it's not
very slightly faster however all my
testing was done with the add-ons
disabled also note that I tested the
latest non beta release of firefox 3
version 3.0 point 10 and not the
upcoming 3.5 release I'm sure 3.5 will
do much better but for this test i
focused on browsers that were not in
beta i also did not test opera so sorry
for opera fans anyway let's get this one
started
let me just say a couple of things
before we begin first of all while the
test is accurate is I could get it it's
not strictly scientific generally you
would install each browser on a freshman
install of Windows and tested seeing as
that wasn't feasible for me I did the
next best thing and just restarted my
computer after each round of browser
tests I also cleared out the cash and
closed any programs on my computer that
could affect the performance so while
the numbers might not be perfect I think
they should give you a clearer idea of
how fast each browser is relative to
each other lastly I use the laptop
running windows vista fridge test with a
1.6 gigahertz processor and 1.5
gigabytes for am ok so the first test
would obviously be starting the browsers
i opened each browser five times and
averaged out the results using my screen
recorder to time precisely how long it
took note that this took a great deal
this has a great deal to do with your
computer but it should give you a good
idea of how fast each browser is
relative to each other I timed from the
time I launch the browser to when the
content began to load as you can see
chrome did very nicely with launching in
under two seconds Safari followed bus
behind it's slightly more than three
seconds with Firefox right behind it it
just over four seconds and explore
however took much longer an average of
just under 13 seconds to load some up
Chrome Safari and Firefox all do quite
well what internet explorer takes at
least three times longer to load then
even the slows to the other three next I
ran a generic JavaScript test which time
each browser according to how long it
took to run a well-balanced script
javascript is fast becoming one of the
most popular types of content on the web
purring such popular sites is gmail and
google earth among many many others here
safari for really showed off the power
of its new nitro JavaScript engine by
finishing the test on average and well
under two tenths of a second chrome
while behind still post some impressive
results slightly more than three-tenths
of a second firefox lagged behind with
taking more than a half a second and
again in explore was a long way back
taking nearly a full second to complete
the test all so far did beat out the
other browsers fairly easily here well
still did a very good job as well in
reality a tenth of a second to run a
complex the complex JavaScript task
really isn't noticeable so that's
something to keep in mind next I ran the
acid three test asset three is a broad
test that runs each browsers through a
battery of tests to check and see if the
browser meets the web standards and also
it gives a general idea of how well the
browser renders all sorts of different
types of content as the three does focus
less on outright speed but here again
the fastest browser score highest both
Chrome Safari passed with flying colors
getting a perfect 100 score Firefox does
surprisingly well with a very solid 71
score an explorer however only barely
made the test with lackluster score of
12 as at the JavaScript test both Chrome
and Safari breeze through it with
Firefox doing decently and in explorer
putting up a poor showing the next test
I ran each browser through was a CSS
rendering test by loading up 4,500 blank
dibs CSS is found on nearly all modern
web pages today and is the language that
makes all of the boring and lang plain
text and links into vivid layouts here
I'm glad to say all for browsers did
very well Safari led the way with chrome
and explorer firefox all quite close
behind while the grass makes it look
like a runaway for Safari it is slightly
misleading the difference between first
and last was less than 10 milliseconds
in other words all these browsers are
very very fast with CSS the last test
iran was the v8 benchmark suite this is
a test made by google which compiles
several popular JavaScript tests into
one as you might expect in this test
chrome one with an impressive score of
over 1800 despite wasn't far behind with
the score of over 1,200 from there
however it fell well off to Firefox with
a mere 151 as for an explorer instead of
running the test it gave a dialogue that
said the script I was running would
likely freeze my computer and take
several minutes to complete that mostly
says right there but I did try to run
the test and true to form my computer
crashed all these tests are fine
for the real original simple which
browser is faster it's simple question
with not such a simple answer well on
most tests Safari edges out chrome
usually goes by a small margin and both
were indeed blindingly fast loading a
website like Google took less than one
second both browsers which is moderately
faster than either firefox or internet
explorer if you use Internet Explorer
I'm not really sure why you could would
as I can't for the life of me think of
one reason why you would would unless
you absolutely just didn't have any
choice the reason i think is between
Firefox Chrome and Safari Chrome and
Safari or noticeably faster than firefox
the firebox is decent enough and has
many features such as add-ons the chrome
inspired really don't right now so in
the end it will probably come down to
what you feel works best for you between
the interfaces features and anything
else that you might want to take into
account based purely off of speed
however there's no touching safari for
