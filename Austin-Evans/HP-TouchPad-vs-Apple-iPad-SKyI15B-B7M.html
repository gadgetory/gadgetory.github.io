between the HP TouchPad and the apple
ipad now these two tablets are going to
be some of the biggest things that are
going to be out all year long so I want
to take this up to you to explain a
little bit about the differences between
them to help you to make a good decision
about which one's going to be best for
you now before we begin there's one
thing I do want to mention I'm going to
be comparing this to the current iPad
which is out today now the iPad will be
replaced with a second generation iPad
probably in the next couple of months
certainly before the touchpad is
released so this comparison might be
very different in the next 3-4 months
however I'm going to be doing and just
on the information we have today as if
you're going to go ahead and go to the
store and buy them both today so just
please do keep that in mind anyway let
me go ahead and just start with the
newest of them which is going to be the
touchpad I know the touchpad has a lot
in common with the iPad they both have a
nine point seven inch display with a
resolution of 1024 by 768 and indeed
they also have the very similar shape
and size in fact you could almost go
ahead and you stack an iPad stack a
touchpad together and you're they're
gonna be very similar that you're almost
the exact same thickness the same width
the same height so they're gonna be a
very similar as far as the case goes now
that's not a bad thing at all I like
besides the iPad and I'm liking that the
touchpad is going to be very similar to
that well they really start to differ is
in the processor the touchpad you will
find a dual-core 1.2 gigahertz
Snapdragon processor if you're not
really technically inclined what that's
going to mean is it's going to be very
fast it's gonna be good at multitasking
running multiple apps at the same time
which is what webOS is really good for
but also just playing games checking
email all that the kind of stuff is
going to be really quite fast on this
tablet now in comparison the current
Apple iPad only has a single core one
gigahertz Apple a4 chip not by any means
bad but certainly not going to be in the
same round as far as the speed goes
moving on you'll find that the touchpad
it has another advantage over the iPad
which is going to be a front-facing
camera and while the usefulness of this
is somewhat in question i video chat
really isn't in that mainstream dish yet
is definitely very nice that you will
actually be able to use it on the
touchpad and obviously there's no way to
do that on the iPad which does entirely
lack any cameras of any sort the biggest
difference between the talus however is
the operating system now on the iPad it
runs
i OS which is a very very simple
operating system to what you might find
if you own an iPhone or an iPod Touch so
all the same apps will run you will be
able to use this very similar UI and
everything and it works really quite
well however the touchpad is a very very
different animal it has a lot more
features and it's really made a lot more
for the tablet form factor in my opinion
so what you'll be able to do is much
better multitasking have you ever seen a
webOS device for example a Palm Pre or a
palm pixi you look kind of about how
that is going to be it has a really nice
deck of cards interface which allows you
to go ahead and scroll through your
various different apps that are open
select what you want and just go on with
your day one of the most important
aspects price is still a question mark
right now now while we do know that the
iPad will run you anywhere from five
hundred to eight hundred twenty-nine
dollars the touchpad is going to
probably be somewhere in that range but
we don't have the excessive extension
someone in the five to six hundred
dollar price range is going to be where
we're going to find it however of course
like I said this is still a question
mark and that's going to be a big factor
so as the release date gets closer it
will be out this summer we will probably
get more information about that anyway
guys that's been it for this video you
know the both tablets do have a lot of
strengths and weaknesses the iPad has a
huge amount of apps really nice
operating system and everything
however the touch pad has an even better
operating system in my opinion as well
as better hardware so it's a comparison
just between the iPad and the touchpad
I'm gonna go ahead and go with the touch
pad however this story could entirely
change in the next couple of months when
the iPad 2 is available so definitely
stay tuned for a review of this
comparison</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
