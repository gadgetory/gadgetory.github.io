gaming laptops when you go below $1,000
typically you have to deal with a lot of
compromises take the Acer Aspire 5 at
$600 I've been incredibly impressed with
this laptop and sure it's not going to
be the most powerful thing in the world
but it delivers a ton for the money step
up to something like the Dell Inspiron
7000 series and for $800 you are going
to be getting a ton more performance but
you're still going to be lacking the fun
toy that the higher-end laptops at $700
though the asou stuff FX 504 looks like
it could be the perfect sweet spot at
least on paper let's see how it actually
stacks up though a first glance it looks
pretty decent so they're definitely
going for the whole gamer aesthetic with
the red accents and the fake brush metal
which I will mention is entirely plastic
about something that has soos claims on
Amazon and will pretty much in all their
marketing material is that this is a
thin and light laptop weighing in at
only 5 pounds and one inch thick but I
mean it like this definitely is not
you're gonna notice this guy in your
backpack this is one of those cases
where I actually feel like the laptop
looks better on video than it does in
person now the idea of having brushed
metal is nice but honestly it feels very
plastic E and that comes across the
stuff like the screen so I mean if you
just do a little bit of flexing here it
well it doesn't really inspire a lot of
confidence especially considering that
this is going to be a $700 laptop
speaking of the screen it's exactly what
you would expect at this price point so
it's going to be a 15.6 inch 1080p panel
and it's going to be pretty much
mediocre make sure the resolution is
going to be decent when it comes to the
color and especially the contrast it's
not going to be particularly accurate or
particularly contrast d and on top of
that as soon as you get it even remotely
off access the viewing angles fall off
and even though it does get bright when
you start to crank up that brightness it
washes out even more it's going to be
fine
but at 7 under dollars it would be nice
to see a little bit of an upgrade
speaker why's this actually is going to
sound pretty decent so it does have a
pair of speakers that are going to be on
these sides so it's not going to be
quite as good as something that's going
to be on the decklid facing directly
toward you but it's a lot better than
most laptops that fire down into well
whatever it is that you're sitting on
now the keyboard is going to be backlit
in the same red that's all over the
laptop and there's some good stuff with
it so I do think it actually has a
really nice layout and is able to get up
to speed with it almost immediately
however there's a lot of key travel and
it kind of feels a little bit mushy it's
maybe not quite as precise as I would
like but cuss plating here is here for
some hundred all a laptop there's really
no complaints we've also got a decent
trackpad so it is using Windows
precision drivers and while it's not
going to be the biggest trackpad in the
world again totally fine what isn't so
great is the port selection we have a
pair of USB 3.0 one USB 2.0 HDMI as well
as Ethernet that's going to be fine
those are going to be the essentials but
what you are losing or things like an SD
card reader USB C Thunderbolt support
it's going to be pretty basic here now
don't let the looks fool you even though
this does look like a premium laptop the
build quality is only going to be so-so
however it is clear that a su spent the
money on the internals what really drew
me to the ethics 504 is the core i5 8300
agent sign now this is one of the new
8th gen 45-watt H series processors that
are coming out in laptops if you guys
caught my video that I did last month
where I took a look at all of the new
chips including the new I sevens and I
9s you know this is actually really
exciting this is the first time in a
long long time the gaming pcs are
getting a major update on the laptop
side where the core i7 and core I nine
are jumping up from four cores to six
cores the new core i5s are adding hyper
threading essentially giving you four
cores and eight threads very similar to
what you used to be able to get in the
last generation core i7s there that's
simple right the idea of having a
cheaper computer that's on par with a
core i7 gaming laptop from last
generation is exciting and as you'll be
able to see it is a step up however it's
not going to be perfect take a look at
the benchmarks and you'll see if this is
going to be a step up over the last
generation i5 although it's not going to
be a massive leap and while it comes
close to the i7 dulo 2.3 gigahertz base
clock actually does hold it back a bit
here here with the i5 is that gtx 1050
you know this is actually going to be a
pretty decent performer at 1080p as you
guys will see a little bit later in the
gaming section and if you stack it up to
some of the other competitors including
the 1050 Ti in the Dell as well as the
MX 150 in the Acer you'll see that slots
right in there as you would expect at
the price remove about 12 screws to get
at the inside of the laptop you'll see
there's actually be a fair bit of space
here
so first of all you're going to see our
8 gigs of ram you can't expand that to
16 gigs pretty easily or 32 if you
really want to go all out and you're
also going to find an m2 Drive slots now
that is because this only has a one
terabyte hard drive mind you it is going
to be an SS HD so it is going to be
faster especially when it comes to
things like Windows however if this is
going to be my everyday system I would
definitely install a full SSD in this
guy the battery is going to be a fairly
small 48 watt hour cell so don't expect
to do hours and hours of gaming on this
guy what you can't do is well not
overheat it is going to have true
cooling fans as well as a pair of heat
pipes for the CPU and the GPU that
combined with the heat sinks on the back
should keep this fairly cool under
extended gaming sessions just remember
to bring your charger get into some
gaming and first of all we have rocket
League now here at 1080p on high
settings we're getting a pretty
impressive hundred frames per second
rocket League is not exactly a demanding
game especially with a gtx 1050 inside
is absolutely no problem next up we have
everyone's favorite pump G not like
people play any other game these days so
oh ok shot we have
1080p low settings here and with that
we're getting somewhere between 50 to 60
frames per second if you do want higher
settings you will sacrifice some frame
rates of here okay with 30 you can
probably go up to medium but for me I
like having something that's going to be
a little bit smoother and this is again
totally playable it's almost like when
you spend $700 on a laptop you're able
to play games at reasonable settings
amazing right moving on to everyone's
actual favorite game we have port night
now here on 1080p on medium settings
we're getting it's still very impressive
75 to 90 frames per second I think this
is really a good example of the kind of
game dinner's really meant for a system
like this I mean sure you're not running
at epic settings like 300 frames per
second but for most people I would say
the vast majority of people a medium
1080 piece experience that's going to be
running at this high of a frame rate is
going to be more than
good enough we went to a game that's
going to be much more demanding we have
Middle Earth shadow of war now here at
1080p on low settings we're still
hovering around these 60 FPS mark again
you can bump some settings up to medium
if you want a little bit of a better
graphical experience but if you really
do want to get that 60 frames per second
you're able to get it and pretty much
any game at 1080p providing you true
things download it this laptop is kind
of in a weird position on one hand for
$700 the performance is really
impressive getting that new 8th gen Core
i5 processor paired with the GTX 1050
well that's really handle 1080p gaming
very easily but in this kind of price
the trade-offs do start to add up so
stuff like the build quality on the
screen I can mostly overlook when it
comes to the sshd that's where I start
to have real problems for $70 I don't
want to deal with a slow hard drive
making windows feel super super slow the
fact that it's an SS HD helps some but I
would much prefer to find a full SSD
like you would find in the Aspire or the
Dell at the end of the day there are
options that are going to be cheaper and
better in some ways and they're going to
be options been a little bit more
expensive and better in pretty much
every way it's an interesting laptop
there's a lot that I like with it but
it's kind of hard to recommend at this
price if only if only they had an SSD I
know you guys are really tired of me
complaining about SSDs but you need an
SSD and computer in 2018 ok so here
you're spending 7 or 8 dollars anyway
let me know what you guys think about
these suits in the comments below as
always there will be a link to this guy
to check it out over on Amazon and I
will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
