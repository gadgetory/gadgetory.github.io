caught our building the ultimate ps4 and
Xbox one videos and they use the word
ultimate very lightly there however this
time we're taking a slightly different
approach today we're going to be
building a portable ps4 so this is the
games Vanguard case the idea here is
that this is going to give you some
portability with a console we're going
to be taking it up a notch so inside you
have a another box okay so this is the
case then they claim their work so it's
pretty much any console ps3 ps4 Xbox 360
Xbox one and the idea here is that not
only is it a case that your console fits
inside but also integrates the screen so
now what are we getting a nineteen inch
display even though it is only 720p but
you also get the speakers as well as the
power adapter to run the entire unit so
this actually is reasonably portable so
not only does have a built-in handle but
you also have your integrated first of
all we have the display itself
it has lots and lots of wonderful
warnings for example you need special
packaging for the Xbox one and that you
should not store your peripherals inside
the Vanguard and cables need to be
unplugged and if you don't listen to all
these rules it might kill you well as
you know you can do some damage to the
screen let's go to the power adapter as
well as a small HDMI cable includes the
box which is helpful since that really
only has to run a few inches there's
also a couple of carrying cases here as
well as a strap if you want to be super
super cool next we have the ps4 slim
there the main reason for going with
this over the pro is to do with power
efficiency since this needs a lot less
power to run it's going to make things a
lot simpler when we actually get this
thing fully portable and since it's
going to be smaller and lighter it fits
in here easily and it's a 720p screen
you don't really need a ps4 Pro anyway
the only slight issue is that the ps4
slim isn't technically supported but I
think it should fit what you need to do
is get any two straps and then just
tighten things down and I think that
should work between the phone pattern of
straps I don't think that's going
anywhere and the cool thing is we
actually still have access to all of our
ports if you have our USB the puranas
goes blu-ray and we can still get access
to everything around back including
power as well as HDMI so we have the
games case on power of our ps4 and
theory we should be up and gaming so
turning on the sharpening just a little
bit it looks like we're pretty much good
to go that is actually not bad so there
may be that the greatest built-in
speakers in the world but for gaming I
think this should be totally fine so you
do notice that the screen is only 720p
it's not great I think though for a
portable set of it's something I could
live with so not only is it matte you
actually have pretty solid viewing
angles and when something I actually do
really appreciate is the idea that it's
a pretty decent sized screen sure 19
inches doesn't sound huge but we're
going to do this close-up especially
with something that's going to be used
in a portable situation it actually
doesn't want that but of course this is
just a simple game case by itself what
we want to do is make this a fully
portable set up that's what this comes
in this is the anchor powerhouse
essentially what it is is a giant giant
power bank so what you can do is of
course charge standard things like USB
devices off this guy but it actually has
a full outlet that can power something
like a ps4 this guy is rocking a 120,000
milliamp hour battery now they put that
in perspective anchor claims that's
actually be able to run something like a
mini fridge for like seven hours oh man
it's like the size of a car battery this
is giant Wow there's a really nice
feeling handle - it feels dirty so not
only do you have the input but you also
have a 12-volt cigarette lighter four
USB ports which can charge everything
from a smart phone to a tablet with
pretty decent speed as well as what we
want which is the full outlets now the
idea for something like this is sort of
more than sit like a giant emergency
battery so not only can you do stuff
like charge your phone a ton of times
off this guy is you can even charge
something like a laptop but what we want
to do is power our full ps4 portable set
up purely off of this guy so visit
everything we need to make our portable
ps4 happen you have the games cage with
the ps4 cables accessories controllers
as well as our powerhouse so hopefully
everything works one of the things that
we're a little bit worried about what
we're trying to get everything to set up
here and the reason why we went with the
ps4 slam is because of the power draw so
even though this is one of the biggest
batteries that you can get it still does
have a 120 watt limit which should be
fine for the ps4 slams the way we've got
this set up is that the ps4 in the games
case are running to a multi tops and
this is just going to plug straight into
our battery bank
all right monitors up ps4 looks like
it's
ps4 ring controller up and and we're
good all right this is it this is the
whole setup you can look around there's
no like hidden wires or anything
literally it's just a games case with
the monitor we've got all our cables
nicely tucked around and we're pretty
much up running with the ps4 the last up
though is to get on the internet now of
course some games are going to run just
fine without it
however to the magic of tethering okay
so maybe not blazing speeds but the
important part is we are actually fully
up and running on our ps4 no no no no no
you see what that was because it's so
portable I uh I was in the park and I
was lost by nature's beauty and stopped
paying attention for a second you think
look how beautiful it is looks very
different game here there are certain
moments when I'm making a video and I
realize how ridiculous I must look right
now with this in a park it's a beautiful
day people are having fun playing
baseball I'm uh I'm sitting in a park
bench with ps4 on a giant battery bank
there's a lot of language there Park
this is so good
I'm surprised at how could you look at
this back it's a 720p screen and yeah
you can see it's not the sharpest like
there's definitely a little bit of
downscaling going on but this is totally
usable and the most important thing is
the screen is bright enough and it's
matte enough that even outside is
totally usable so in about 10 minutes we
lost 4 percent battery that's not bad at
all you actually could legitimately use
this for a pretty decently long gaming
session so this is the portable ps4 set
up do you guys want to build your own I
will have links in the description I'm
curious what do you think about this
masterpiece let me know in the comments
below and I will catch you guys in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
