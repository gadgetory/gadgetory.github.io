for the iPad 2 now I thought about you
know just showing you guys a really
simple overview you know show you how it
works but instead you do something a
little bit different so I just went
outside and I found a bunch of clips
with the rear facing camera on the iPad
2 so what I'm going to do is edit them
render them upload them I'm all live for
you guys so you can see exactly how
iMovie works and then the end of the
video you can actually take a look at
the final product let's just jump
straight on in so you'll see it's got a
nice little interface here and wait the
plus button we get to open up a new
project as you can see here here are
Clips I'm going to be doing it in
landscape it has work in portrait as
well but again I like effort in
landscape so let's pick this and just
drop this on the timeline so you didn't
see here we can scroll through it works
really quite nicely in fact I managed to
make sure the audio is on yeah so we can
scroll all that kind of stuff really
quite nicely I'm over here in our clip
bin we can also take a look at pictures
in the camera roll which I don't have
anything particularly great we also have
audio so for example we have theme music
so let's say we want to add that play
that's ok um but let's pick modern and
we just kind of just experiment around
with it see but also our sound effects
if we open up the sound effects you see
there are a wide variety of them so
let's take for example the dinosaur
growl we definitely need a dinosaur
growl so if we play it
so there's just lots of really fun
things that you can do like that and
just like on iMovie just like on the
iPhone and the iPod you pick something
up and you just drag it up and it goes
away so let's take a couple of Clips
here um the clip looks pretty good let's
stop it there so which do is we can just
drag down to right about here so that's
gonna be our clip but we also jump out
to here and there's a few different
settings so we can pick a theme I think
we'll do a theme let's see what looks
nice we'll go with simple we draw some
theme music cuz that kinda sounds good
and we'll do fade in out from black so
there we go
so let's just take a quick look at our
file real quick here mm-hmm yeah I don't
really like that music so let's go ahead
and change it up a little bit and I'll
be right back as soon as I'm done okay
so I've been editing a little bit let me
show you guys real quickly what we've
got here and I'll explain how I did it
so this is just really simple base with
all of that I've got two clips in here
I'm gonna get myself a transition I just
picked up music muted the clip so it's
pretty simple as you can see here works
really quite nicely you know the rear
facing camera it is 720p but outside is
not too bad so I'm gonna add a few other
clips and transitions in fact I'll show
you guys doing that so we just tap on
this clip and drop it in and then this
is just a kind of a slow kind of pan
through some stuff so wool okay right
there and of course you can just trim it
or if you want just swipe it like that
and if we want we just get rid of this
excess toss it away and you'll see that
I movie in general is really nice very
very intuitive so you can just you know
just do whatever you want it was really
quite nicely won okay so I'm all done so
I end up not doing anything too
particularly amazing you guys can see
here just just edit the simple sound
effect rather the mute the theme music
used a couple of transitions all that
sort of thing okay so now let's go ahead
and finish the video up so we're all a
we're all good to go and then we have a
variety of options to where we can
export it so we need to camera roll
which is probably what you're going to
want to do whoever you want to upload it
to YouTube Facebook Vimeo sin in order
to iTunes you can undo all of that oh
I'm just going to be uploading it to
YouTube right now so this is going to be
pretty simple I'm not gonna skip all of
this stuff but let me just fill on all
the stuff and you guys will be able to
see the export okay so I filled in all
the information all that kind of stuff
and now the video is all rendered and
now it's uploading to YouTube so they go
guys that is iMovie on the iPad 2 I'm
very interested to see how this video
turned out of course it's not an amazing
but it's been a couple of minutes I'll
show you guys exactly kind of how it
works you guys can take a look I'll have
an annotation on the screen right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
