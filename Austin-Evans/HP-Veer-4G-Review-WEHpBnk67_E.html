the HP veer 4G 480 Mt I've been using
this phone for the past few days now so
let me give you my full review the first
thing that would jump out at you is the
size of the phone with a 2.6 inch
display and a slide-out physical
keyboard the veer is absolutely tiny
even compared to phones like the iPhone
I'm into how this affects usability a
bit later on but suffice to say that the
2.6 inch screen is nice and bright and
has a very reasonable resolution of 320
by 400 pieces
firm calls on the very surprisingly good
thanks to its dual microphones the
speakers also surprisingly decent with
good volume without any distortion when
laid down on a flat surface the 4G part
of the phone comes courtesy of the AT&amp;amp;T
HSPA+ network just like the inspire 4G I
recently reviewed the viewer gets decent
if not amazing speeds I typically found
somewhere in the neighborhood of one to
two megabits per second down and usually
less than one megabit per second up
assuming you have a good connection
certainly not that but this is nowhere
near the speeds you'll find on Verizon's
4G LTE network I'll say it right now I
love webOS the multitasking is second to
none and the gesture area on the veer
allows you to control the phone
effortlessly currently on its 2.1 point
to release as of this review webOS
screens on the veer don't let the small
size fool you this is a very facile
phone with an 800 megahertz Snapdragon
processor and 512 megabytes of RAM it
chews up and spits out multitasking as
many apps as you like when you get into
the ants however the veer becomes a bit
of a mixed bag it comes pre-installed
with quite a few apps such as a mail
client contacts app a YouTube player
google maps in Amazon mp3 most all of
these are just fine however where the
real issues lie is in the App Catalog
the interface is decent but there are
some fairly hook major holes in the
selection including an official Twitter
app Netflix Skype and many many other
major apps that are unavailable to make
matters worse not all apps are available
for the veer if they were made for the
larger display on the pre things get
much better in the browser while you are
of course constrained by the small
display you'll find that the browser is
quite fast and has some of the smooth
the zooming and scrolling I've ever seen
you'll also find support for Adobe Flash
10.1 for viewing Flash content which
runs decently like it does on most
mobile devices but is less than perfect
the camera is
or spot well has a five megapixel sensor
it lacks both autofocus and a flash
resulting in mediocre images in most
situations on top of that I ran into a
bug with crash the camera app and
restarted the phone after taking a few
pictures the story doesn't get much
better as the VGA video is fairly awful
as well the size of the phone limits how
big the keyboard can be but overall I
was impressed the sliding mechanism
seems to be very robust and the keys had
a nice tactile feel that had me up to a
decent typing speed in just a few days
of using the beer it also lights up
subtly making it great for typing even
when you can't easily make out the tiny
keys the veer has a proprietary magnetic
charging and syncing port that's very
similar to the max leaf adapter on Apple
laptops it works well
connecting strongly what isn't so great
is the included 3.5 millimeter headphone
adapter that snaps onto the phone while
this - snaps on easily it's tiny and
almost certain to get lost in the first
few days of owning the phone it's a bit
of a shame really
as the sound chip in the veer actually
sounds quite good once you hook
headphones up battery life on the veer
is decent in my testing I found that I
was able to get through a day of
moderate usage before the phone died
your mileage will certainly vary but you
will almost certainly need to plug the
beer in every night the fare is a bit of
a hard phone to sum up on one hand you
have a poor camera a lackluster app
store and no way to expand the roughly
six-figure bytes of usable onboard
storage but on the other hand you have a
stellar OS and absolutely speed
experience and excellent build quality
what it boils down to is are you
interested in a small phone if so the
veer is a great choice and will serve
you well if size isn't as big of a deal
to you though I would recommend taking a
look at the pre 3 which should be
available in the coming months and has
all the same features of the veer but in
a larger package if you enjoyed this
