here for the LG ultra-wide festival and
of course big shout out to LG for
sponsoring this video and you're
mouthing what I'm saying the entire time
aren't you
after hundreds of entries Linus and I
narrowed it down to three finalists
Taylor Zack and John they each have a
budget of $2,000 to hold the game pcs
set up to go along with the LG 34 you
see 89 G ultrawide monitor and the
winner gets a $10,000 grand prize what's
the deal with the parts right so you
want a mini ITX system I went with a
mini ITX system okay this case is really
beautiful it's actually not built
anything in the Manta I'm not either
it's gonna be exciting
it looks nice so you're also going
you've got like the Z 270 I you've
gotten Core i7
but you're able to fit a 1080i in the
$2,000 budget yes with that I 770 700 K
pair with the gtx 980ti 16 gigs of RGB
a5 ram and a 250 gig SSD tears got a
pretty well-rounded small form-factor
build next we're here with Zachary now
you picked a very different style of
computer so what do you plan on doing
with it
well I wanted to focus more on immersive
gameplay immersive gameplay yeah okay
well you definitely went a lot higher
end on the accessories you spent was
probably 150 bucks or so on accessories
yeah 170 170 so you believe it
technically a little bit more than that
technically wouldn't you technically
well about something else what's what's
there something else that's the secret
weapon I don't think anyone's getting
anything close to this but I'm curious
okay so you have a beachy 50 motherboard
would you have an unlocked core i7 yeah
some reasoning behind that well there's
a big reason for that okay I'm just
stupid wrong motherboard aside while
zach is rocking much better accessories
to go with the ultrawide monitor he's
taking a serious hit with only a gtx
1080 as well spending a big chunk of his
budget on a 480 gig SSD next we're here
with John and you actually picked out a
little bit of a different system so
what's the main thing you wanna do with
this I want to make 3d animation videos
ok yes ok gotcha so it's a little more
on the content creation side yes here
John's also got an i7 7700 K pair with
the GTX 1080i but he also stepped it up
with matching RGB accessories even
including a headset for $2,000 you
should be able to build a pretty solid
gaming system and
first glance everyone has solid parts
but part of the challenge is actually
building them and tuning them in a
single afternoon to work with that
ultrawide monitor one it's three to one
we just said 31 okay so three two one go
or three two one three two one and then
you go on go okay all right okay ready
okay three two one turn so is the
headband giving you the power to
complete the build faster is it that the
manly power that you only need to like
use your words to just reinforce it it
does look cool what wait wait hold on
whoa that is crazy yes you can see those
pins are definitely bent they're
actually there's a couple over here as
well what do you think so I don't think
there's an easy way of fixing this at
all you have another look at this that's
that's totally fair like this is not
your fault that you got a busted yeah of
course not
after about an hour or so of building
the systems are coming along nicely hey
dude good job alright so you're the
first person to get a system up and
running lul you suck okay try it
well one fan is not spinning because you
actually had to swap out the motherboard
it's probably not posting because
there's a kV like CPU in here and it's
really looking for skylake so if we have
a BIOS update that will probably fix it
that's going to set you back this is
kind of a tough one
alright so your system is done do you
have anything else to do besides
overclocking right now no well he posts
so that's a big improvement over
Taylor's machine
besides the secret weapon which I'm sure
will be a hundred percent figured out by
the time that we're actually ready
you have everything installed yes okay
so now it's going to basically come down
to since you can't overclock the CPU
you're gonna try to get as much as you
can out of the ten eighty yeah all right
so everyone's basically buttoning up
their systems now it looks like you're
just doing the final bit of cable
management no I got
this Ram reseated that was the ceded
property so you're actually only at
eight gigs of RAM that's showing up
right now yeah okay got it so you feel
like it's just going to need to be
receded yeah all right so we are almost
done
everyone has their systems set up and
now it's just the final stuff like
making sure all the benchmarks are set
up doing the overclocking tweaking all
the last-minute little like lighting
stuff cables all that kind of thing the
first test is going to be set a bench
image
now they all have the same CPU yes but
overclocking is going to be very
different or what is it nonexistent
three two one two okay go go just go
start go everybody go
so your five gigahertz five gigahertz
overclock on that little priority cooler
very nice that's really impressive so
the next test is going to be 3d mark
which is going to be testing their GPU
performance so are you guys ready all
right three two one start alright so
we've got our x 5 benchmarks basically
John's card is a little more overclocked
and or margin of error of the test but
he takes this one by a hair so for Ghost
Recon we're running at the native
resolution of these monitors as 2560 by
1080 and we are using the ultra preset
because we figure for 2-grand
you should be having a pretty ultra
gaming experience now one of the things
that we're gonna be looking for is not
just being able to run the game but
being able to run it at a framerate
where you're gonna be taking advantage
of these high refresh rate monitors 65 7
65 9 and 53.4 ok you guys basically tied
with benchmark results in hand last
night stepped away to discuss what we
thought about the competition so far I
feel like right now ya back is kind of
not looking so great I feel like he's
got the wrong motherboard yeah there are
some fairly major issues I'm not a huge
fan of the idea that he spent so much on
the SSD and with some of the other stuff
where he skimped on things like the 1080
is opposed to a 1080 I'm having the
worst graphics card out of everyone
we're a gaming setup yeah is at the
problem pretty tough yeah in the
motherboard that's a huge problem
because like he got a very expensive
motherboard but it's still not
overclocking compatible like I think it
looks nice the complete system is going
to look solid but that's a big big
problem
which I guess brings us to Taylor yeah
so Taylor had a huge disadvantage in the
fact that he got a broken motherboard
out of the box so we're not gonna dock
him points for that I mean I'm not I
think I like his build I like the ideas
doing small form-factor
I think it's going to match pretty well
with the monitor well he had a rationale
behind everything he's like yeah I chose
like a case with curved side panels not
match the curved monitor I chose a black
and red case to match the monitor and
like it feels a little kiss ass to me I
mean the rules were that you had to get
a system to go along with the setup I
don't think we can penalize him for
trying to make something inside the
rules what do you think about John so
far John everything's going smoothly
over there I don't disagree with any of
his Hardware choices I think his is in a
vacuum you know the best balanced
machine on the table I terribly do that
so third place is Zachary you you fought
hard the scores were super close
actually it was actually we basically
agreed on almost everything yeah but I
think what's hurt the performance hurts
you the good news is that you come out
of this with a wicked awesome gaming rig
and hopefully you had fun today I think
before we announce the winner we agree
on basically every category
I think we're pretty on the same page
you guys all did really well it was way
close John you took it home and Taylor
you fought hard and you were a lot of
fun to hang out with today you royal
kitchen all right and you get to do the
check do the challenge I mean it doesn't
really look like it no she can't go cash
this is this 21 by nine so of course you
shut it to LG for sponsoring the video
and inviting us out to sort of host the
ultra-wide festival and let us know what
you guys think about the whole thing
actually we'd like to do more and you're
just keep doing that aren't you you know
I'm glad the videos over I can finally
go home</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
