of the audio technica at2020 USB
condenser microphone so I've been you
know obviously I've had kind of some
audio issues in the past I've had pretty
much always used just you know the
inbuilt camera microphones and you know
just just some really bad microphones so
on the side go ahead and step it up and
buy myself a really nice mic
this will I'll be using this for d3 live
I'll be using this for voiceovers I
might even be using this for normal
videos so yeah besides stepping up
hopefully the audio quality will be
worth it I did just get this off Amazon
it cost me about ninety two dollars or
so um of course I'll have a link in the
description if you guys want to check it
out for yourselves anyway just jump
straight on in it's got a nice pretty
plain box so just jump right on in here
so we open it up and we will see some
registration setup and operations you
know just all the kinds of fun paperwork
that you always get with these sorts of
things so let's take a look at what all
the accessories it comes with comes in a
nice leather carrying case which is
actually pretty cool and we've got a
very long USB connector so I can go
ahead and have this a long way from my
computer which should be pretty handy we
have I believe this is the stand that
I'm sure I have here got nicely wrapped
I believe that is part of the stand and
if I go in here
I think that yeah this is the other part
of the stand it comes with a kind of
flimsy stand I think I'm going to be
sticking with it for now but in a minute
that's pretty tightly in there but I
think I'll probably stick with the stand
for now but if I need to change it in
the future I will and that's about all
we have okay so let's go ahead get to
the microphone itself it's really nicely
padded I love how they did that that is
uh has a lot of padding anyway let's
just go ahead and open this up here mmm
Wow
we got takeout slides out really nicely
here um so and got ourselves our
favourite little gel on so there we go
this is the microphone itself very very
nice
definitely very very sturdy it's not as
big I was considering going with a
couple of other mics I looked to the US
the blue Yeti a couple of others but I
decided to go for this one mostly
because of the looks it looks really
nice and the audio quality on this is
really quite good so anyway guys of
course I'm going to go ahead and test
this out use it for a while and I'll be
back with a full review in a little
while so yeah anyway guys thanks for
watch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
