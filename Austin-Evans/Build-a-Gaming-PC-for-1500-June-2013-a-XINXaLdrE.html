with the gaming pc built for $1,500 and
this is a high-end pc that's really
aimed at giving you maximum performance
out of your games as well as of course
pretty much anything else you throw at
it thanks to the brand-new Intel Haswell
CPU as well as the GTX 760 card to give
you an idea of the performance here's a
demo of the PC running battlefield 3 now
here all the settings have turned up to
ultra and the resolution is set to 1080p
and as you can see here pretty much
stays above 60 frames per second at all
times moving on we have Far Cry 3
another game that looks fantastic
especially as you're able to turn the
settings up here we have no problem
there being able to turn everything up
to ultra as well as running eight times
a to aliasing and still the PC handles
at no problem
the next step we have Crysis 3 which is
by far one of the best-looking PC games
ever so here we're able to run on very
high settings so pretty much everything
is cranked up we also do have FXAA
enabled and it is absolutely no problem
yet again last but not least we have
BioShock Infinite which while not quite
as graphically intensive this crisis is
still a fantastic looking game here we
have no problems whatsoever running it
on full Ultra settings with everything
cranked up at 1080p and even then we're
still getting well above 60 frames per
second at pretty much all times to kick
the build off we're going to be using an
Intel Core i5 46 70 K processor now this
is only the new Intel Haswell CPUs that
just came out a couple days ago an
overall it's a nice improvement over the
last generation give you about 10
percent more performance now of course
this is a quad core CPU clocked to 3.4
gigahertz however since this is a case
series part that means that we can
overclock and of course the rest of the
build is totally designed to work with
that as well so I was able to get about
four point four gigahertz on this core
i5 although every one is different but
at least getting four gigahertz is going
to be absolutely no problem with this
build so overall you're gonna get eight
underperformance all for about two
hundred and forty dollars for CPU cooler
we're going to be using a corsair h80
high now a lot of cooling is great for
bells like this have when you get into
making an entire custom loop it becomes
very complicated very fast when you use
a closed-loop system such as the H ATI
it's much simpler and you still get all
the same benefits from using liquid
cooling so of course this is really
gonna be aimed at giving you a much
better overclock on your core i5 well of
course the added benefit of getting rid
of a giant ugly heatsink in the middle
of your motherboard
also definitely appreciated so this is
definitely going to be worth it for
about 90 bucks for a motherboard we're
going to be using a gigabyte gaz 87 xu
d3h so this is a great motherboard that
supports pretty much all the features
that you would expect including
obviously the core i5 as well as
overclocking it up to 32 gigabytes of
ram as well as thanks to the z87 chipset
up to 10 USB 3.0 ports and 8 SATA 3
ports which means that you can plug in
lots of SSDs hard drives all that kind
of stuff so overall this is a fantastic
method board all for about $190 for a
graphics card we want to be using a 2
gigabyte EVGA GeForce GTX 770 now this
is another brand new card and delivers
some very very solid performance as you
guys saw in the benchmarks earlier but
on top of that it's also a very nicely
designed card with the new EVGA ACX
cooler delivering lots of cooling
performance and you can also get a
pretty decent overclock on this card if
you'd like speaking up overclocks this
card is actually very similar to the old
gtx 680 when it's clocked higher it's
got faster memory and it's going to
deliver tons and tons of performance for
about four hundred and ten dollars
for memory we're going to be using 8
gigabytes of Corsair Vengeance ddr3 RAM
now this is all stuff that recommended a
lot of my builds in fact I'm using it in
the system right behind me here and
that's because not only is it reliable
but it's also clocked at 1600 megahertz
which in my opinion is still a sweet
spot even on a has well based system
like this now if 8 gigabytes isn't
enough for you you can very easily
upgrade to 16 gigabytes pretty simply
over this system we're just gonna stick
with eight gigs of RAM all for about 68
bucks for an SSD we're going to be using
120 gigabyte Samsung 840 series drives
now an SSD is probably one of the best
upgrades you can do to a computer as it
really does make a massive amount of
difference in normal day-to-day tasks
and even stuff like loading games
it just happens so much faster and so
much more consistently it makes a huge
difference over a normal hard drive so
as far as the 840 series drive itself
goes it does have one on 20 combines up
capacity which well definitely isn't
much is definitely plenty for your main
games for a couple of things like for
example your programs windows that kind
of thing and the rest of your stuff can
definitely go on the other hard drive
and of course on top of that it is a
Samsung Drive which means it's going to
be very reliable very quick all for
about 95 bucks for the hard drive we're
going to be
a 1 terabyte Western Digital caviar
black now like I sang with the SSD while
it's an awesome solution and much much
faster and pretty much any kind of
normal hard drive that you can find the
one disadvantage is that you really
don't get a whole lot of storage space
so that's where pairing it with a
standard hard drive for your normal
things for example your pictures your
media you know the kind of normal stuff
that you don't need lightning fast
access to definitely make sense with a
stand hard drive now if one terabyte of
storage you're gonna have plenty of room
for parents all your kind of stuff
although I will mention that there's
also a 2 terabyte version if you want to
upgrade that but on top of that since it
is a caviar black it is actually pretty
fast for a hard drive not quite as fast
as the SSD but still you're gonna give
very decent performance out of this for
about 95 dollars for a case we're going
to be using a fractal design define our
for now this is a stylist optimized case
which means that not only is it
well-built but also does have some noise
dampening foam inside a door over the
front intake as well as to quiet fans
connected to a fan controller so that
means that you're going to get still
plenty of good performance well I
actually happen to sacrifice on noise on
top of that since it is a full sized ATX
enclosure that means you have room for
of course the motherboard you have room
for additional graphics cards hard
drives fans all about kind of fun stuff
and in fact I like this case so much
that well you can see one right behind
me here because that's what I've got my
main built in anyway if you want to pick
up a define art for it's gonna run you
about a hundred and ten dollars for the
power supply we want to be using a 750
watt Corsair TX 750 m now with seven and
fifty watts of capacity that's gonna be
more than that to run your build as is
even with some overclocking on top of
that you could add an additional gtx 770
to the build it will run no problem on
top of that since it is an 80 plus
bronze certified power supply it's gonna
be fairly efficient and well built and
it is a modular power supply as well
which means it's gonna be a lot easier
to get all the cables out of the way
instead of having to deal with tugging a
bunch of stuff and you're buying the
motherboard and underneath the drive
trays and all that kind of stuff you
just simply only a plug in the exact
things that you need and everything else
will just stay out of the way so they're
about $115 this is gonna be a great
power supply for the build for the
optical drive we're going to be using an
LG blu-ray drive now this is definitely
optional I know for me I hardly ever use
the kind of DVD or blu-ray drive however
it is definitely something nice to have
if you ever need to install a disk for
example or you want to watch a movie as
of course this is not only going to be
working with blu-rays but of course DVDs
and CDs as well so it's not all let's
say about this you can freely you decide
to skip out on it and save yourself a
little bit of money but if you do want a
blu-ray drive in your computer it's only
gonna run you about forty dollars so
there you have it an awesome $1500
gaming computer of course prices are
always changing so I will have links to
everything I mentioned in the
description of this video as well as
some additional upgrades so for example
if you wanted more RAM a bigger hard
drive maybe an Wi-Fi adapter whatever
I'll have some additional links in the
description if you guys want to do some
upgrades to the computer if you're
interested in more feel free to check
out my full tutorial on how to build a
gaming PC and if you enjoyed definitely
be sure to leave this video a thumbs up
and subscribe for more PC builds like
this anyway guys I will catch you next
