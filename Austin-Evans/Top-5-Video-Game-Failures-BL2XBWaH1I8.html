the top 5 video game failures so the
last time we went over the biggest fails
in tech so this time let's take a look
to see what kind of giant flops the
video game world has given us at number
5 we have Sim City now this one hurt so
released earlier this year after over 10
years since the last sense it e game it
looked so cool and then it came out and
it was literally unplayable EA made the
game with an always online requirement
even though it basically was just a
single-player game you have to connect
online to be actually able to play it
and since when it first came out a ton
of people got on the servers all at once
they were absolutely overloaded and you
really couldn't play your brand-new
single-player game when people started
complaining and asking for an offline
only mode they say it would be way too
much work and too complicated to make
happen until someone realized that all
it takes is you to delete one line of
code and would run offline no problem
DRM issues aside once you were able to
finally play the game it was actually
pretty fun however the fact that I had
small cities and kind of dumb AI didn't
give it a whole lot of replayability so
all this combined with the disastrous
launch wait what could have been an
awesome game kind of fall flat and
number 4 we have the Sega Saturn like
SimCity the Saturn was actually not that
bad however thanks to some spectacularly
dumb moves by Sega
the Saturn is actually one of the main
reasons why you can't go out and buy a
Sega console today first of all the
Saturn was rockin dual CPUs now this is
actually way ahead of its time however
the problem was it made making games way
more complicated than it should have
most developers couldn't even get the
Saturn to match up with the PlayStation
1 much less being able to actually pass
it so you got also surprised everyone by
launching the Saturn early so that way
they got the big jump on the PlayStation
1 except they had to launch with only 6
games which were made by Sega all the
rest of the games were spent to be
launched later on the year and on top of
that they didn't even tell a lot of
retailers who are actually going to be
carrying the games so some stores
outright stops carrying Sega stuff
because they were so mad oops to make
things even worse barely two years after
the Saturn was released Sega already
announced a next-generation console
being the Dreamcast which pretty much
immediately put the short-lived Sega
turned arrests in number three we have
Duke Nukem Forever now we're getting
somewhere
so Duke Nukem Forever was originally
announced in 1997 however took over
fifteen years to actually complete and
2011 we got a game the gameplay was
clunky and boring and a lot of the story
went past being the awesome over-the-top
Duke Nukem that everyone loved into
being just weird and cringe-worthy to
make things even worse forever and
really badly on consoles which is not
something you would expect for a game
that was started back when the Nintendo
64 was still around for a game that was
as hyped as Duke Nukem Forever to
finally show up after years and years as
something that was both buggy and not
even all that fun yeah and number two we
have Superman 64 now we go from a huge
disappointment to a huge laugh as
Superman 64 is widely known as one of
the worst video games of all time
there's really not much nice I can say
about the game you play a Superman who's
thrown into a virtual world and has to
do stuff like fly through rings to save
his friends now now hold it hold on a
second this is Superman the guy who has
laser vision whose beretta Klee
invincible who can fly around the earth
really quick and like stop time and
rewind it and you're putting him inside
a computer making him fly through rings
save his friends but we are talk about
the same guy here right you know I could
talk about the laggy controls the
Kryptonite fog which the developers call
the terrible view distances and nowhere
near stable gameplay or I can move on to
the next one and number one we have et
for the Atari 2600 this was actually one
of the most important video games in
history back in 1982
the fact that there was a video game
based on a movie was actually pretty
impressive and in fact that sold well
over a million copies was pretty cool so
there's definitely no reason that's
number one in this list right I mean it
was clearly a good game right first of
all the game was completed in only five
and a half weeks by two guys which was
ridiculously short even by 1982
standards on top of that while the Atari
2600 definitely wasn't a graphics
powerhouse uh this is what the game
looked like and this was et so you know
this game required a little bit of
imagination
yeah the gameplay is all about
collecting parts of a phone so that you
can call home so I was picking up random
Reese's Pieces along the way and the bet
as fun as it looks even though it
actually sold decently Atari made
millions and millions of the cartridges
so many in fact the rumor says that they
made more ET games that Atari 2600 s
that even existed famously they buried
truckloads and truckloads of unsold
cartridges in the New Mexico desert
making this Nathalie a huge failure for
Atari but in fact it was one of the big
reasons why the video game industry
almost collapsed in the early 80s I
think it's safe to say fails don't come
much bigger than this so now that you've
heard what I have to say what is your
pick for the biggest video game failure
definitely be sure to let me know what
you think in the comments below also I
want to mention this video is brought to
you by audible audible.com is a leading
provider of audiobooks with more than
100,000 downloadable titles across all
types of literature including fiction
nonfiction and periodicals you guys
probably know that I really love to read
so I've always got an audiobook loaded
up on my phone or on my iPad so I can
always listen to something while I'm in
the car or about to go to bed lately
I've been listening to I am Legend by
Richard Madson which is not only a
fantastic book but in my opinion even
better than the movie if you guys
haven't tried audible yet all you need
to do is go to audible.com slash Austin
to download this book or any book for
free when you try audible it's an
awesome service I use it all the time so
definitely be sure to go to audible.com
slash Austin and give it a shot anyway
