brand new camera strike global offensive
this is the first counter-strike game
that's been released in several years so
let's take the full look at what all it
has to offer global Offensive love all
new maps weapons and characters when it
is launched in addition it will also
have a lot of classic counter-strike
content that will be repackaged for the
brand-new game in addition we can also
expect some brand new gameplay modes new
leaderboards as well as a new
matchmaking system as it's been quite a
while since we've seen anything
counter-strike related I think a lot of
people are really going to be happy to
hear about this now we don't know
everything just yet all we know is just
this press release that just talks a
little bit about it however we do know
that it will be targeted for in early
2012 or leagues so only a few months
before we actually go ahead and get the
game I know it will be available for of
course the PC as well as Mac an addition
will also be available on Xbox Live
Arcade as well as the PSN network one
thing I really hope for in global
Offensive is that they keep the same
counter-strike core so of course you
know I'm sure they will use the new
Source engine and it'll look nicer and
all that kind of stuff what I really
hope for is they keep the gameplay the
same they keep the whole core of the
game what makes the counter-strike so
great I hope they they keep that totally
intact now of course like I said there
will be new maps new guns new game types
all that kind of stuff which hopefully
should keep it fresh but as long as they
keep the same core of the game keep all
the things that made it such a balanced
game such a fun game as long as they
keep all that intact I'm absolutely
going to be looking forward to playing
this game when it comes out early next
year anyway guys I'm really curious to
know what do you think about the new
counter-strike are you interested in
have you been waiting for it for years
we're really interested to see how it's
gonna be on Xbox or Playstation are you
really just kind of lost it you're not
interested in counter-strike anymore
definitely be sure to leave your
