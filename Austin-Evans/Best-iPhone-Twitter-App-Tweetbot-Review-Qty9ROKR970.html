for the iphone and ipod touch so this
launched last night and there are a
bunch of people absolutely loving it you
know my Twitter stream is half filled
with people saying oh this is the
greatest thing ever you guys check this
out so I downloaded it and i've been
using it for the better part of last
night in this morning something of you
guys my full review the spoiler alert
it's actually really really good and
this is my new default twitter client so
you can see here the UI the first thing
you will jump out at you is the UI is
very non-standard difficult you know
most iphone apps nearly they look they
look pretty similar they all have the
same kind of look to them whoever
tweetbot is really sir pet not surpass
that i suppose but they really went a
different way and while it doesn't
really necessarily blend in you know
when you go from app to app it looks a
little bit different but i like that it
looks really nice very very very very
very polished I'm so you can see here
here's my timeline and Scrolls over here
and take a look at whatever I like I'm
such as I just did this test week for an
example if you tap on the tweets you get
a little list of options so I can't
reply myself and retweet that I can
favorite it I can pull up some options
so if i wanted to delete that tweet post
a link to it copy it email that i could
do any of that or if I hit this button I
can go into more detail so as you can
see here it's a test suite chose you
know what time what where it's from and
take a look at related tweets specially
I'll show you guys that a little bit
more detail and take a look at the
retweets so those are the couple of
things I can actually show you this
because you swipe over to the left you
can take a look at the rest of them in
the conversation so in fact I see you
buy him um that's the year I know I
think about this one no um yeah here we
go so here's here's a tweet you swipe
over to the left to pulls up the
conversation so as you can see here I
was talking to somebody on Twitter the
other day all you have to do is just
swipe to the left when you take a look
at all the dimensions and everything in
that conversation and on the other hand
if you swipe over from it to the right
you'll pull up related tweets now as you
guys be probably kind of getting the
gist of it now this is very
user-friendly it's very easy to do so
you can swipe left and right if I want a
triple tap I can just open up a new at
reply you can actually customize that
I'll show you guys you back up to the
options and hit settings
wide variety of them including the
triple tap so if you wanted a triple tap
to retweet or reply i prefer reply but
you can do it if you want what we're
here the sayings of you guys a quick
little demo there's a lot of sounds
automatically it does play all it gets a
little bit annoying i will admit so i
have it just on notifications only but
to lift you you get to do font size i
like to have a little bit smaller but
for this video so you guys can see it i
made it medium so if we open it up you
go force you can see you can add
multiple accounts if you want to for
example there's a new tweet if you Oh
clothes no asbestos beat me what isn't
that lovely but anyway well there's a
shout out to him he beat me in the video
being like if you want to refresh you
can just pull it down as you can see
here very cool little animation there
and you just released refresh just like
you'd expect you know with any boat most
to our clients value to get to do that
these days um yeah guys that's just
about it if we can just move down here
and there we already got somebody at
replying me but you know guys that's
about it the only other thing really I
could show you is making a tweet I guess
I could do that really quickly I'm you
can just tweet whatever or if you want
to hit click here you can add photos or
video from your camera you can view
draft you can add your location so
pretty standard sort of stuff there's
also favorites which i'm going to have
any favorites and there's a searches
where you can take a look at the trends
and all that kind of stuff anyway guys
that's it for my review of tweetbot for
the iphone and ipod touch if you guys
are interested I'm it is a little bit
expensive in just two dollars in the app
store however I think that's absolutely
worth it this is by far the best twitter
application I've ever used if you guys
are anything like me you know you use
Twitter a lot you definitely want to
have the best so I'm two dollars will
definitely recommend it take a look at
in the app store of course it is called
tweetbot if you found this video helpful
