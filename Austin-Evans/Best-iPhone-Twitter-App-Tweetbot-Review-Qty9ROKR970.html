for the iPhone and iPod touch
so this launched last night and there
are a bunch of people absolutely loving
it you know my Twitter stream is half
full filled with people saying oh this
is the greatest thing ever oh you got to
check this out so I downloaded it and
I've been using it for the better part
of last night in this morning something
give you guys my full review a spoiler
alert it's actually really really good
this is my new default Twitter client so
you can see here the UI the first thing
you will jump out at you is the UI is
very non-standard typically you know
most iPhone apps nearly they look they
look pretty similar they all have the
same kind of look to them whoever
Tweetbot is really Serpa not surpass
that I suppose but they really went a
different way and well it doesn't really
necessarily blend in you know when you
go from app to app it looks a little bit
different but I like that it looks
really nice very very very very very
polished on so you can see here here's
my timeline I can scroll through here
and take a look at whatever I like I'm
such as I just did this test tweet for
an example if you tap on the tweet you
get a little list of options so I can't
reply myself and retweet that I can
favorite it I can pull up some options
so if I wanted to delete that tweet post
a link to it copy it email it I could do
any of that or if I hit this button I
can go into more detail so as you can
see here is this a test tweet shows you
know what time what where it's from and
take a look at related tweets oh I
should I'll show you guys that a little
bit more detail and take a look at the
retweets so those are a couple of things
I can actually show you this because you
swipe over to the left you can take a
look at the rest of them in the
conversation so in fact I see if I am um
that's this one yeah here we go so
here's here's a tweet these swipe over
to the left it pulls up the conversation
so as you can see here I was talking to
somebody on Twitter the other day all
you have to do is just swipe to the left
when you take a look at all the
dimensions and everything in that
conversation and on the other hand if
you swipe over to the right you'll pull
up related tweets now as you guys be
probably kind of getting the gist of it
now this is very user friendly it's very
easy to do so you can swipe left and
right if I want to triple tap I can just
open up a new at reply you can actually
customize that I'll show you guys you
back up to the options and hit settings
on the wide variety of them including
the
triple tap so if you wanted a triple tap
to retweet or reply I prefer reply but
you can do whatever you want and while
we're here the Saints of you guys a
quick little demo there's a lot of
sounds automatically it does play all it
gets a little bit annoying I will admit
so I have it just aren't notifications
only but to lift you and you get to do
font size I like to have a little bit
smaller but for this video so you guys
can see it I made it
medium so if we open it up you go of
course you can see you can add multiple
accounts if you want to for example
there's a new tweet if you Oh close
knows best you speak me well isn't that
lovely
but anyway well there's a shout out to
him he beat me in the video being like
if you wanted to refresh you can just
pull it down as you can see here very
cool little animation there and you just
released refresh just like you'd expect
you know with anything
well mote most where clients value to
that to do that these days um you know
guys that's just about it if we can just
move down here I'm got somebody at
replying me but you know guys that's
about it the only other thing really I
could show you is making a tweet I guess
I can do that really quickly I'm here
you can just tweet whatever or if you
want to hit click here you can add
photos or video from your camera you can
view drafts and you can add your
location so pretty standard sort of
stuff
there's also favorites which I'm going
to have any favorites and there's a
searches where you can take a look at
the trends and all that kind of stuff
anyway guys that's it for my review of
Tweetbot for the iPhone and iPod Touch
if you guys are interested I mean it is
a little bit expensive and just two
dollars in the App Store however I think
that's absolutely worth it this is by
far the best Twitter application I've
ever used if you guys are anything like
me and you know you use Twitter a lot
you definitely want to have the best so
for two dollars definitely recommend it
take a look at it in the App Store of
course it is called tweet bot did you
