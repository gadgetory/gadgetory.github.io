with a review of Batman Arkham City
lockdown for the iPhone iPod touch and
iPad placed on Unreal Engine 3 the game
featured some nice-looking graphics and
smooth it's a bit repetitive gameplay
the story revolves around Batman doing
what he does best
pummeling bad guys it features a few of
the villains from the Arkham City game
on consoles in the PC over don't expect
the full open-world experience
Arkham City lockdown is a strict
fighting game with nothing beyond a few
short cut scenes sprinkled between the
different enemies as it's based on the
same engine and features very similar
gameplay to Infinity Blade 2 they're
easy to compare I found myself liking
the controls on lockdown more than
infinity blade controls are very simple
you swipe up for an uppercut left and
right for punches down to counter and
tap on the screen to dodge there is very
little in the way of different moves and
it quickly becomes more of a game of
timing your text correctly than pulling
off complicated combos enemies are easy
at first but quickly ramp up in
difficulty most are finished with simple
attacks but as you progress they gain
weapons including pipes and guns
sometimes the henchman will go into a
rage mode where they become invulnerable
for a short time and it's up to you to
dodge their attacks if you avoid them
you get a short window to lay a
smackdown
but if the attacks connect they'll do a
good chunk of damage as you progress
through the game you get experience
points for each grunt you take down as
you go up in levels you were able to
purchase upgrades as well as gadget
gadgets add another unique element to
gameplay each can be used by activating
on the bottom-left of the screen and do
everything from give you a small help
foods
briefly power up your attacks or
distract the enemy for some easy damage
all of these elements help to give more
challenge to the game but no matter how
you look at it the gameplay is quite
repetitive there are four sectors each
with three sets of normal enemies and a
boss fight for a total of 16 levels in
the biographies page it shows Harley
Quinn and poison ivy coming soon but the
fact remains I beat all the levels from
start to finish and right at an hour
after you beat the game there is more to
see you can play the game again on an
increased difficulty grab yourself some
wallpapers as well as take a look at one
of the three Arkham City comics
you can also buy different Batman skins
including an animated Batman along with
a Batman Beyond skin for a dollar each
overall I'm a bit mixed on the game
on one hand you have some very solid
controls good graphics and nice design
on the other hand though I feel like
they missed out instead of having an
awesome open-world game you get a
straightforward fighting game it can be
completed in under an hour if you're a
fan of them Fendi's blade style games
we're batman in general this is
definitely worth a look but otherwise
there are better ways to spend $5.99 if
you enjoyed this review definitely sure
to leave this video a thumbs up and if
