resurfaced but this time with the twist
according to Apple Insider Apple has
already contracted out a new iPhone they
will be able to function both on Verizon
and AT&amp;amp;T x' networks up until now
Verizon has been on an entirely separate
type of network than AT&amp;amp;T which has been
part of the reason why the iPhone
remains an AT&amp;amp;T exclusive in the u.s. if
this abides somewhat odd rumor is true
that all could change late 2010 let's
get this one started this really seems
to rap to rumours into one that the
iPhone is coming on to Verizon and that
the author rumored iPhone Nano is on the
way one key piece of evidence it seems
to link the pair together is the
addition of the supposed world mode
hybrid cellular chip that would allow
the iPhone to run both on CDMA and GSM
networks effectively allowing it to run
on either AT&amp;amp;T or Verizon without
needing to make two separate phones to
do it if true this would make a good bit
of sense in keeping with Apple's like of
a simplified lineup as having one phone
that can access all networks is much
neater than selling several types
catering to different carriers now we
get into what is a bit odd in my opinion
at this new world mode iPhone is going
to be the iPhone nano the report doesn't
say much on this subject except to say
that the next iPhone will shrink from a
3.5 inch to a 2.8 inch display they go
on to say that there were pictures of a
2.8 inch iPhone earlier and that a
Chinese newspaper had mentioned that the
next iPhone will be lighter and smaller
it all seems quite vague and really
makes me want to just discredit the
whole deal screens sizes are escalating
at a rapid
so why would the iphone shrink in size
but such a large amount they don't
specifically say that the standard 3.5
inch iPhone would be discontinued but it
does seem to say that if it were just in
addition to the lineup then it could
make some sense but if the iPhone Nano
is the next iPhone then I'm definitely
going to toss this one in the rumour
pile what do you guys think do you think
that there could be some truth to this
or is it all just a jumpstart for the
year as far as the iPhone 3G rumors go
you should let me know in the comments
