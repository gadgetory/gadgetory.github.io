cheapest stuff on Amazon I bought the
four cheapest laptops that are currently
available on Amazon that are brand new
with prime shipping of course first of
all we have the Dell Inspiron 11 which
is not only the cheapest laptop here at
$170 but we've actually done an entire
video on this earlier this year put
simply it actually gets a lot of basic
stuff right unlike a lot of budget
laptops this is powered by an AMD
processor and I'll get into that a
little bit more in a second but
generally speaking it is a little bit
cheap but for the most part you actually
get something that is surprisingly
usable next we have these Samsung
Chromebook 3 at 180 dollars now this is
similar in a lot of ways but the key
difference of course is that it is
running Chrome OS it has the same tiny
11.6 inch display what's different about
this is of course the idea that instead
of having to run Windows we have a much
more lightweight operating system which
makes a big difference to the general
performance then there's the Evo EVC
which is less than $200 is a little bit
of a weird choice and it does come with
a larger 12.5 inch display and there are
some cool features like a fingerprint
sensor but they're also some major major
drawbacks three gigs of ram is
definitely unusual but with a quad core
processor it seems pretty solid I mean
they're pretty obvious about it on the
box not only does it say on the sticker
but also several times here that is a
quad core chip except when you open up
task manager and see that it's actually
a dual core Celeron which yeah that's
great this isn't a total deal-breaker as
several of the other laptops here also
dual core but I think it's more than
just a little bit sketchy they advertise
it as a quad core processor and give you
50% of what you're paying you know what
does have a quad core processor the
assist vivo book which has a very
obvious amount of stickers and badges
saying that it does in fact have four
cores exactly as you would expect the
issue here is that this is a much older
AMD processor while it does have decent
performance as you guys will see soon
it's not all that impressive and even
worse you hear that that's a fan my
friends unlike the other laptops this is
not fanless and it's significantly
thicker because of that is the only
laptop here with a 14 inch screen that
is an advantage for some people and
there are a ton of ports so if you take
a look on the side we have not only USB
see but also a couple of USB AAA
Ethernet SD even HDMI flip the laptop
over and we have a very convenient
little door which gives us access to the
two and a half inch drive bay and that
is unique among these laptops all of
them with the exception of the
Chromebook have only 32 gigs of storage
which as you might imagine is difficult
to run windows on so for the most part
you're going to need to install
something like a micro SD for extra
space with this guy you can very easily
upgrade it with a hard drive or an SSD
when you click on a video talking about
the cheapest laptops on Amazon you
probably don't expect a lot of
performance and you would be right with
the Chromebook and EVOO you get a
dual-core Intel Celeron processor with
four gigs of RAM on the Samsung and
three on the Evo whereas with the dell
inspiron we actually have an AMD dual
core processor if we move over to the
asou it of course does have that awesome
quad core power as you will see it's not
all that it's cracked up to be run
everything from Geekbench and the Dell
does take the wind slightly over the
Celeron processors what's especially
disappointing is the performance of that
is soos because it's such an older
processor even though it's got the fan
even though it's got the thicker build
it is still significantly slower and
that's not just in benchmarks use the ax
soos and it does feel a lot slower for
normal use speaking of the real world I
do think the Chromebook does feel
fastest now fastest is a little bit of a
relative term it's certainly not as
quick as any kind of more expensive
laptop but because Chrome OS is so much
lighter weight the windows it feels
reasonably snappy I will give it to the
dell for being the fastest of the
Windows systems having the 4 gigs of ram
as well as a decent CPU and actually
kind of ok graphics does make a big
difference but again all four of these
systems they're a little on the slow
side then by little I mean a lot on the
slow side at this price all of these
laptops are absolutely made out of
plastic but there are fairly big
differences in build quality not all
plastic is the same it's built but I
always forget it what is it what's the
phrase not all plastic is is built the
same create equal create equal not all
created equal guys the evo is definitely
at the bottom of the pack here I mean
just look at how much I can flex the
chassis just hear that yeah I mean it'll
probably last you a little while but
durability doesn't really strike me as
the strong suit of
no-no-no
in comparison the Dell is an absolute
tank and I mean it's still not super
super sturdy but there's no real flex on
the bottom the actual keyboard itself is
pretty sturdy there's a little bit on
the screen but generally speaking this
does feel like you can take a little bit
more abuse when it comes to screens all
four of these laptops have the same
standard 1366 by 768 resolution now
there is a slight advantage to the isuzu
as far as having a bigger 14 inch screen
but let's be real these are all kind of
okay they're decent but none of them
look remotely as good as something that
costs even another $100 speakers on the
other hand are a little different
so the Dell is the only one with front
firing speakers but the only issue here
is that they are incredibly small they
sound okay but they just don't get all
that loud the Chromebook and vivo books
sound fine but what doesn't is our good
friend the Evo yeah so I mean they're
tinny they're quiet just not really good
experience which I guess you shouldn't
expect that much for $200 but all the
other laptops sound a lot better when it
comes to keyboards the Chromebook is my
clear favorite now that does it have a
nice clean layout and full-size keys but
it also does have a small but pretty
solid touchpad these students is right
up there thanks to its full size layout
whereas the Dell feels pretty decent to
type on but the main issue here is that
it is just a physically smaller keyboard
look the evil eye will be blunt with
this might be the worst laptop keyboard
I've used in quite a while not only does
it have a weirdly small layout but the
keys themselves feel like little maybe
it is just not a nice place to type I
will give the EVOO this it is unique in
this group and that it does have a
fingerprint sensor built into the
touchpad and really there's not a lot
bad to say about it it works just as
well as these sensors and much more
expensive laptops Wi-Fi is a bit of a
sore point for the Windows laptops
they're all limited to 2.4 gigahertz
Wireless which really does slow things
down quite a bit except when it comes to
the Chromebook which has dual band AC
Wi-Fi now sure these are slower systems
but even if you ignore the speed
difference which is fairly significant
you get a much more reliable connection
and that's something that's important
for any laptop so should you buy any of
the cheapest laptops on Amazon well
the Chromebook is probably the best bet
here not only is it a well-built package
but importantly pretty much anything
you'd want to do on a sub 200 or a
laptop you probably can do on Chrome OS
on the windows side I like the dell
inspiron not only is it the cheapest
laptop here but as far as a budget
system goes this checks almost all the
boxes for what I'm looking for so that
my friends is a roundup of all the
cheapest laptops on Amazon as always
links to all of these guys will be in
the description if you want to feel free
to you know check them out although
maybe avoid the Evo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
