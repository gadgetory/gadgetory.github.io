episode of d3 live so today and when you
be talking about handheld game consoles
and why don't they actually have a place
in the future so of course if you guys
have missed it a few days ago nintendo
announced that they will be really
really dress Phylly slashing the price
of their nintendo 3ds now this is a
little bit of a surprise Nintendo was
always done well with KML consoles me
from the game water gameboy color game
boy advance even the Nintendo vs they
all been tremendously well i just sold
them out just four years from years and
years and just made money hand over fist
however with the three guess it seems
like this really is not the case at all
i know there are a lot of reasons way
this may or may not be an i don't go
ahead and talk a little about some of
them in my opinion right now so of
course i think the number one thing that
really hurt the 3ds was the lack of
games now i think that can really speak
from experience because i was excited
about the 3ds before it came out and I
was like really looking forward to it
but they announced if everything I'm
like it's going to be awesome 3d on your
hand held up sailing school everything
but then when they announced the launch
lineup what games will be launched on
day one I was like there's nothing there
I want and to this day there's one
getting that I would buy it by about the
three BS right now I would buy ocarina
of time and that's it an opening at time
is a pretty old game I already own that
game on other systems so there's not a
whole lot of really great games that you
really pulled me in so that's I think
the number one problem with the 3ds and
why it really hasn't done so well now
the second thing is priced and I think
it's a little bit less room of an extent
I mean typically game consoles when they
come out they're gonna be a little
expensive and you know as the time goes
on also lower in price hit redesigns all
I kind of stuff um but how are they done
this was just immediately four months in
tulip shopping a dollars off the price
my thing that's going to leave eee ate a
lot of that i don't really expect any
more 3ds price cuts probably for quite
some time and i think that what now that
they cut the price down to I mean pretty
much within you know Dee's levels i mean
the dsi was 107 dollars and maybe a year
or so ago so i think the price they
really done a good job with however a
bit of a bigger issue in my opinion is
whether or not there's actually still
room in the market for a dedicated
handheld game console and well again a
few years ago your the das with Game
Boys everything like that there's no
real competition the others you know
cell phones or your place
snake but not really any major
competition compared to fly you know I'd
full RPG or something on your Game Boy
however these days there's a lot more
competition in the form of smartphones
so you know smartphone my opinion are
not as good for gaming as something like
a 3d s or even something like the PS
Vita however what they are good at is
doing a lot more so let's just take it
for example 3d s ring something like an
iPhone so of course you only have so
much room in your pocket you don't wanna
be carrying on the 3ds and iPhone and
this and that and this and that so the
kind of competing a little bit and just
off the batch number one gonna look at
you go home this my phone has a better
camera it has mobile data so i can get
on the internet check emails obviously
they're gonna have a phone and it has a
little bit more different kinds of that
so it's not just you know straight like
a game letter to do all kinds of other
stuff on top of that with the iphone you
have much much cheaper game so you know
you might be able to get like dead space
for 99 cents we're supposed to that same
console pulled a game on the three days
with probably 20 30 even forty dollars
so i think that's a major problem with
the 3ds and that's one of the things
reasons why it's not doing so well in my
opinion so what really think comes down
to is whether or not there's actually
still room for a dedicate game console i
think a lot of people if you have a
smartphone really are just not one to
carry around something like a video or
something like a 3d s i think what they
really are going to have to focus on is
people just don't have smartphones or
really really good games that just
aren't available smartphone so for
example mario games pokemon games some
of the really good franchises the
nintendo has they need to hold onto
those and really push them for the 3ds
because to be honest even though the
games generally are you're probably
going to be a little bit better quality
on the 3ds i'm still probably going to
rather played on an iPhone or smartphone
and something just because it's convened
a have so what they really need to do is
focus on getting really good games that
i'm just not going to be able to play on
any other platform and really try to a
pup the you know the quality of both the
30s as well as they need ok so for the
same segment of d3 live i'll be taking
live questions from arrow in the chat as
always every episode of d3 live is
filming from the live audience we've got
quite a few people in right now so squad
just take a few questions well the new
3d s price help sales yeah definitely i
don't think there's any question about
that now well like I said it might be
out like 250 dollars was an absolutely
outrageous price definitely was a little
bit expensive
I think a lot of people were like an
between that as well as you know the
really lack of good games I think that
kind of put a lot of people off but now
with the better price and with all kinds
of new games it's no Mario Kart and you
know Star Fox and all these kind of
games that are going to be coming out
soon I definitely think it will help
sales whether it'll be just a short term
like metal bunk for a few months or will
actually turn into good sales for a long
time it remains to be seen but she I
definitely think it will at least help
some well minecraft come out to the iOS
devices I never said sure I do know that
they are working like for Android as
well as on the Sony Xperia Play but as
far as whether they're going to be
putting out on iPhones everything
anytime soon and that herb said sure I
do know that they did they were talking
about that a late like earlier this year
but as far as any plans or when or you
know anything like that I really don't
know I haven't heard about it in a quite
a while um hellas city affected the
portable gaming devices personally I
don't really think it has i mean i think
some people still get emulators and
stuff but i think emulators are going to
be on any console emulators just it's
just kind of what happens on me i'm
pretty much any device that can support
it um so i don't really think it's
really majorly affected anything i mean
i could be wrong but i don't really
think it's a big deal well the graphical
processing of the phones reach the low
of the console oh yeah i definitely
think so I mean if you take a look at
some of the recent bones and recent you
know processors I'm thing we've been
coming out it's getting really really
powerful and that's one advantage that
phones have over something like a d a 3d
a sorvete it is that when they come out
they're going to be coming up for 3 4 5
years maybe even longer and they really
can't up the process and car anything
like that it's going to be the same
graphics roughly of course they can do
small adjustments but basically going to
be about the same for the entire life
the console what if those phones there's
going to be something new about every
six months and they're constantly going
to be going up and up and up very
similar to how consoles vs pc you know
one console comes out for five or six
years but computers obviously there's
going to be new chips you harder that's
going to constantly be raising it up so
yeah definitely thing that phones will
be surpassing the console before the end
of the generation probably then you know
make in the next year or two do I think
there will be 3d phones in the short
future I'm absolutely
three folks on the market today such as
HTC EVO 3d as far as we're going to be
mainstream whether it's all phones in a
3d displays I'm not really totally
convinced I think a lot of people are
kind of pushing back against 3d it's cuz
I'm what kind of turning back into a
gimmick I know everyone's really excited
like oh yeah we're gonna have 3d TV
sweetie phones 3d tablets 3d anything
and everything but a lot of people just
aren't really satisfied with the 3d
quality with you know how well it looks
a lot of 10 times you're going to need
glasses and this and that so I
definitely think the 3d phones are not
going to just disappear overnight but
whether i should going to be
mainstreaming you every single phone
your next couple your skin d3d i really
don't think so what how long do you
think the whole 3d is crazy will the 3d
crazy will last um you know it's kind of
hard to say I mean like I said I think
that it's starting to kind of cool off
and then a lot of people like oh I'm
gonna get a 3d TV I'm gonna get you know
3d this 3d that but a lot of people are
like oh eh I've got to wear glasses or
oh there's not a lot of content or you
know this makes my eyes hurt I mean
there's a lot of negatives to 3d right
now so um I don't like this I don't
really see it just going away I mean 3ds
always been around it's been around for
50 60 years but this sort is really
becoming mainstream and really you know
just this big hype of everything's 3d I
definitely think that's cooling off I
don't think we'll be seeing that for too
much longer now make that may change in
the next couple years which they get
better 3d displays that don't need
glasses that don't give you headaches
this and that but for now yeah I don't
see any major 3d 3d crazy continuing for
much longer anyway guys that's been
about it for this episode of d3 live if
