video going over the new iPhone at the
old iPhone cuz who would do what so
we've been hearing this rumor over and
over and over again for over a year now
and finally it looks like we actually
has some solid evidence that's all
happens if you do the math what this
equates to is adding an extra row of
pixels extra pixels one if you do the
math what's it if you do the math what
if you do them if you do the math if you
almost very possible that it could go
with quad-core my opinion I'm gonna bet
that it's founded what for quite a while
now however it looks like Apple
hopefully what I'm making stuff up now
aren't I won't be surprised to see the
new iPhone come with the same eight
megapixel I can't say megapixel why
can't I say megapixel megapixel
megapixel easy right
megapixel good as you can't say it well
saying any other words together well
they're definitely some better cameras
coming out with 10 and 12 mega mega I've
been doing this for seven minutes I'm
getting this take ready sounds really
weird if you can't see what I'm doing
here it's like think you have no idea
am I doing this but I don't underneath
here just along well it's very possible
that it could go with quad core my
opinion unyk bet that it's gonna what I
also really hoped that I was it is birds
that zippers is that just some
placeholder name that would be what I
would guess is the new name of the
iPhone course with the new iPad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
