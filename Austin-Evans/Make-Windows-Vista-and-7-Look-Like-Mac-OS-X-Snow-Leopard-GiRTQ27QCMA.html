to show you how to turn this into this
before we begin there is just one thing
you will need to download and that is
the snow transformation pack it is an
all-in-one program that will entirely
set up your Windows Vista or Windows 7
computer to look like Snow Leopard
so simply go ahead and download the file
and go ahead and unzip it but before we
begin there is just one more thing you
will need to do to install this you will
first need to disable user account
control now this is both in Vista and
Windows 7 simply just go ahead and just
type it in the search and you will be
able to find it and then on Windows 7
just drag it all the way down and
Windows Vista just shut it off now once
you hit OK you will need to restart your
computer so go ahead let it restart and
come back now this is the very simple
install so simply come over here to the
folder that you downloaded earlier and
then go ahead and open up the snow
transformation pack just wait and click
run and give it a moment and then this
is going to be very very simple so now
just follow the simple prompts go ahead
and just uninstall that be about the
only thing I do is just not collect the
default homepage and one just hit next
it's gonna be really quite simple and go
ahead and read through all the terms and
agreements both of these go ahead and
just read through all of them and hit
next and now you're going to need to
pick one of these three you're going to
pick performance which is going to just
just set it up if your maybe your
computer is not very powerful then this
is probably what you want to go with
performance if you have a decent
computer I'll go ahead and go with
complete it is it will give you a lot of
extra tweaks and make it quite a bit
better you can also do customize but to
be honest there really isn't a whole lot
a few if I were you just go ahead and
hit completed I'm going hit next and
then hit transform ok so after a quick
restart this is what our desktop now
looks like so it first times it looks a
lot like OS 10 however when you start
looking at it it's not perfect but still
I think if you're coming off of OS 10
coming over to Windows or for whatever
reason maybe you are on Windows you're
tired of the way it looks this is pretty
a good option let me show you a little
bit about it now the first thing you
probably notice is that the top taskbar
looks well nothing like the original OS
10 bar now there's one thing you can't
go ahead and shrink it down however it
doesn't quite work all you have to do is
come over here
to actually show you and just come into
properties and then come over here and
use small icons and apply but once it
goes ahead if you can see here it leaves
this little shadow here and plus when
you go to maximize windows it does that
shadow just kind of gets in the way so
personally I would go ahead and just
leave it I'm gonna you can see here move
it out it does look all the menus and
everything do look quite good so let's
go ahead back out here so just for
example let's go ahead and open up this
and as you can see this looks nothing
like the original Windows 7 and I've got
admit it looks very very cool they've
used a lot of new fonts shadows
everything like that which makes it look
really really nice and obviously it's
still the you know the closed and open
and the expand buttons are all still on
the right than on the left but still
it's not too bad now as you can see here
you actually do have the dock and
actually one thing you'll probably want
to do is just right click it squit and
go into settings and go ahead and just
make the dock a little bit bigger and
make the magnification a little bit
bigger so as you can see here now it
looks just a little bit nicer of course
you can very you can change that up you
can also change these like although they
look like just the standard OS 10 icons
you actually this is for internet
explorer or this is for media center
acceptor etc but there you go guys
that's in a nutshell how to make your
Windows Vista or Windows 7 computer look
like pretty pretty good like OS 10
personally I'm not really a huge fan of
this I love the way Windows 7 looks
especially but if you're coming off like
I said if you're coming off of you know
OS 10 you're coming over to Windows or
for whatever reason you just want to
kind of spice up a little bit this is a
very simple tweak all you have to do is
basically just install it and it's done
and if you ever want to uninstall his
very simple you can uninstall it just
like any other program so it's pretty
much just go ahead and try it out if
you're interested anyway guys thanks for
