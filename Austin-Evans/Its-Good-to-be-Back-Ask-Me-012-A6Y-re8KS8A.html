here with a new episode of ask me where
I go for all of your questions it's good
to be back what are your plans flash
goals for your future since all your
stuff went down in flames same as always
I mean yeah it's kind of a setback but
I'm back here I've got a place now I
have a camera and ready to rock and roll
you're going to be stuck on an island
for the next ten years which five games
do you take from any platform well to
start with our deaf lagarde Pokemon game
so probably Pokemon crystals the best
overall in my opinion I would also want
a Gran Turismo game because I've been
playing because since I was a little kid
probably crunchers from a4 was my
favorite there Super Smash Brothers
Brawl is definitely one of those games
that poured tons and tons of hours into
so take that one with me Starcraft 2 if
I get heart of the swarm in it that'll
be awesome too but yeah Starcraft 2 I've
spent a ton of time in that and fallout
3 yeah definitely fallout 3 I mean that
probably is like five years just on its
own what did you learn about the tragic
fire the most important thing is things
can be replaced but people can just
there's a fire you know there's some
kind of danger just get out don't try to
go grab a bunch of stuff and everything
I grabbed what I could carry took me
like 30 seconds and I was out of there I
mean if I would have tried to go back
upstairs who knows it could have you
know something could have collapsed
something could have gotten caught
whatever I mean it's just not worth it
so if you guys ever have any kind of
situation like that I mean if you can
grab something really quick on your way
out do it but don't try to go back it's
just not worth it what monitor did you
connect to your new Mac Pro right now
I'm using a 23 inch dell ultrasharp
so it's a great little monitor but I
actually bought it as my second display
so down here I have a 27-inch Dell but
unfortunately it really won't quite fit
on my desk at the moment how do you
manage to be so cool when your house
burned down well you know I'm just kind
of chill about these heated situations
is you tube your only source of living
or do you do something else I used to do
a little bit of writing for a couple
tech websites but no YouTube has been my
full-time job now for quite a while
actually what is Bitcoin mining this is
like she'd a really interesting topic so
cryptocurrency whether it be Bitcoin or
like
dogecoin doesn't matter it's all just
kind of magic internet money which is
just the coolest name for anything ever
so basically it does it uses your
computer to create or to mine this
currency there's lots of different ways
of doing it for example Bitcoin you
really can't do it with your computer or
you can't have this never kind of really
amount to anything but I was actually
working on a video on this before my
place burned down so hopefully I'll be
able to get another rig set up kind of
show you guys exactly how it works and
what the pros and cons are and all that
kind of stuff do you like girls like do
you like grills name all the new video
gear you bought after the devastating
event of your house getting burned down
first thing I did was get a camera so
right now I'm filming with the Canon 70d
as far as audio goes I am using a zoom
h4n which is actually a surprisingly
good little recorder and for lighting
I'm using one single LED panel so
nothing too special but that's like it's
the job done what parts are you planning
on getting for your next PC that's such
a good question I really haven't thought
about it too much I definitely do want
to get any gaming PC so if you guys had
any suggestions on what you think I
should use for parts let me know I might
even make a video on it what's your
favorite movie of all time
I would probably have to say Back to the
Future so I feel like I've talked about
this in videos before but that was a
movie that I saw when I was really
really young it's definitely like
changed me in a lot of ways I mean I
think partially because of that movie I
can never imagine like trying to like
regret things because I guess if you
guys have never seen the movie spoiler
alert he goes back in time and messes a
bunch of stuff up but I think because of
that movie I've always kind of like
never wanted to change things that have
been done cuz I I guess I'm just kind of
irrationally afraid that it would be
worse than it is today so yeah back to
the future and that was a deep answer
wasn't it who is your favorite little
rascal is it alfalfa or is it Spanky I'd
like to say my hair has had just a
little bit of influence from alfalfa
when did you meet all the other tech
youtubers like when and where I've met
most of my friends here on YouTube over
at CES so that's pretty much where all
of us taking youtubers usually go every
year I have that some people other
places though
so VidCon is another one as well as a
couple like smaller events like product
launches and that kind of thing but see
this is definitely the big time every
year where we all kind of get together
and hang out what is your audio setup
including speakers headphones amplifiers
and how you process your audio
definitely have some work to do with the
audio side but I do have a pair of
sennheiser 428 headphones which really
actually not too bad and as far as my
speaker kind of ashamed to admit I've
been using the speaker built into the
Mac Pro lately anyway that's about it if
you guys have any other questions feel
free to hit me up on twitter at austin
not duncan i'm also on facebook google+
and all those links will be in the
description of the video anyway guys
thank you so much for the support it's
good to be back and I will catch you
guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
