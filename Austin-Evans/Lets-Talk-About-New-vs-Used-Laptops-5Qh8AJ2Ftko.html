watching this video on a laptop very
similar to this a nearly five year old
HP Pavillion so for this one I've teamed
up with Intel who are not only
sponsoring this video but an entire
series on the channel taking a look at
how technology is changing over the next
couple years so one of the first things
I'm not curious about is where we are
today and of course what better way of
doing that than to compare two very
similar laptops spread out over nearly
five years this is the HP Pavilion x360
two-in-one as it's powered by an eighth
gen Core i7 processor it's going to be
powerful although by no means some giant
workstation but importantly it is going
to be good for the price and even more
importantly than that it is going to be
a very close match to our older HP
Pavillion set up put these two
side-by-side and the family resemblance
is clear so the pavilion TouchSmart was
one of the very first Windows 8 laptops
that did come standard with a
touchscreen and actually does a lot of
things right although if you take a look
at the brand new Pavilion x360 there
have been a lot of upgrades and changes
over the last few years the real
question is whether you actually need to
upgrade so when you take a look at this
older system it doesn't seem that old
and to be fair it still can do some
basic stuff like web browsing it's not
like it's going to be completely
unusable but when you step over to a
newer system with the core i7 with the
optin memory you're going to be getting
a much much better experience you're
getting pretty much everything you'd
expect on a modern laptop so stuff like
USB 3.0 is here you're going to be
getting a fourth gen core i5 which is
going to give you decent battery life
and ok performance and you're even going
to be getting some extras like a DVD
drive if you're still living in 1999
actually now that's not fair right like
2005 was really that the peak of DVD
this guy is rocking a 15.6 inch 1366 by
768 panel now it wasn't a terrible
screen when it first came out but put it
side-by-side with a 20-18 pavilion and
there is a huge difference not only is
this screen quality itself going to be
much nicer on this guy but having a full
1080p resolution makes a big difference
with this guy being limited to stuff
like 720p video and sort of very little
screen real estate it feels kind of
claustrophobic in 2018 realistically the
screen is actually one of the most
noticeable differences having a nice
quality 1080p
does make a big difference and while the
other one is going to be a touchscreen
this is going to be a much more accurate
touchscreen you also have the HP Pen if
you want to use stylus input one of my
favorite party tricks that you actually
can flip the entire thing around and
treat it like a giant tablet now of
course this is going to be a 15.6 inch
tablet so you should temper your
expectations for how portable it's going
to be but this especially when you pair
it with the stylus does make a nice
difference when you can you know
actually use it with one hand as opposed
to something like that which doesn't
roll I think it's kind of
self-explanatory how close that comes to
being tablets of course your mileage is
going to vary on something like this but
actually do you find that the pen can be
useful in some situations for example if
you want to work on some graphic stuff
if you want to make some notes or
especially for people who want to have
something that's going to be a little
bit more ergonomic the touchscreen
paired with the pen can feel a lot
better than sitting with a mouse and
keyboard all day when it comes time to
upgrade your computer one of the biggest
questions is always going to be to do
with performance so you're looking at
such a wide range of years between these
two laptops obviously they're going to
be some major differences but some
things are also going to be very similar
both are currently rocking twelve
gigabytes of RAM as well as I want
terabyte hard drive but look a little
bit closer and they're going to be some
major major changes in the last few
years Intel Core processors have seen
some major leaps in performance
consider that we're going from a
dual-core 2.7 gigahertz boost clock all
the way up to a quad-core chip they can
go all the way up to 4 gigahertz on
boost now that is really impressive
especially when you consider that that's
all going to be in the same 15 watt TDP
essentially for the same amount of power
we're going to be doing a lot more work
much much faster you're also getting a
smaller thinner and lighter PC and
pretty much every aspect that not only
does have that more powerful processor
but you're also going to be getting
dedicated graphics as an option when you
put it together what essentially you're
getting here is something that's going
to be smaller thinner lighter and more
powerful and pretty much any way that
you measure it a lot of it has to do
with the processor now don't get me
wrong it's not like a 4th gen core is
suddenly some archaic piece of old
technology but things advanced a lot and
it is very noticeable when you put them
side-by-side now yes it is very very
noticeable when it comes to stuff like
gaming and video editing as you would
expect beams from normal tasks there is
a big difference I mean something as
simple as opening up a webpage can take
all a lot longer in the older system and
that's something that stuff like
benchmarks don't really quite get across
always what
comes to stuff like editing 4k video
more performance is always going to be
helpful no no this is not going to be
some giant fake workstation class
massive editing laptop but what you were
getting here is a solid amount of power
especially when you compare it to the
five-year-old system that 8th gen Core
processor is also going to be of course
capable of playing back 4k video whether
on the internal laptop screen if you've
got a 4k display or on an external
monitor but something else that sort of
backs up this pavilion is going to be
the dedicate AMD Radeon 530 graphics now
this opens you up for some light virtual
reality and mixed reality use but almost
more importantly than that you can do
some light gaming on this guy as well
now of course this is not going to be a
great dedicated gaming PC for that
you're going to want some better
graphics than the Radeon 530 and this
particular system but the important
thing is the core i7 can definitely
handle it so even when you pair it with
something like an NVIDIA MX 150 as I've
done in previous videos you're going to
be getting some much better performance
and something that could definitely hold
up and with the idea that you can go
with stuff like thunderbolt solutions to
get you even better external graphics
options having a powerful processor is
very important Intel octane memory is an
interesting piece of tech that I'm
actually going to go much more in-depth
on in a future video but the basic idea
is that it functions similarly to an SSD
cache but it allows you to get the full
responsiveness of an SSD while still not
losing the full size capacity of a hard
drive so this is going to speed up
things such as opening up windows some
of your major programs it's also going
to be useful for more creative
applications such as when your photo and
video editing you're going to have that
super fast SSD cache which is all going
to be working in the background this is
one of the queerest differences between
a newer and older system there's so many
more possibilities with this whereas
with the older computer you basically
get what you get in just a few years
we've gone from thin and light laptops
being able to do basic tasks recently
well to having a lot more power to the
point where you can do gaming on these
you can do photo editing and you can do
proper video editing on something that
is going to be this small this thin and
dis light I know this video is sponsored
by Intel but these new H gen core
processors are a legit game changer
having this level of performance and
such a thin and light laptop just wasn't
possible all that long ago it's hard for
me to imagine much of a better time to
upgrade than now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
