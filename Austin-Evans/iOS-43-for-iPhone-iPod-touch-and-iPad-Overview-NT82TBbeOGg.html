look at Iowa's 4.3 for the iphone ipod
touch and ipad so this is the latest
version of iOS and it brings a few nice
new features so let's just jump straight
on in so the first and most noticeable
when you'll see just wrap the bat is
that there is a new face time icon not
really a big deal however i definitely
does look very similar to the one on the
mac kind of make it all look right but
again not a big deal in the slightest
what is a much bigger deal however is
that so far has been updated and it is
now dramatically faster so if we want to
go ahead and open up a new tab here
let's just punch and state of jailbreak
and you guys will see that it is
dramatically faster this is a full
desktop site as you guys can see there
it loaded in just a matter of couple of
seconds pretty much on par with you know
like a netbook as far as i can tell very
very impressive and of course the speed
games are going to be even better on the
next ipad of course the ipad 2 and
you'll be able to see that now you can
actually output video from a variety of
sources via airplay so before it was
just pretty much in the inbuilt apple
apps you know you could just you know
take your movies send it over to your
Apple TV via airplay is pretty much very
very limited however in 4.3 there's
pretty much no restriction so you know
you can do in the browser YouTube app
whatever you want you can output full
video over to your Apple TV so that's
definitely a very nice thing if you have
a gsm iphone 4 you're going to be really
pleased to know that there is now a new
feature called personal hotspot what
this allows you to do is just like on
the verizon iphone 4 you just pull in
you know your standard 3g and you create
a Wi-Fi bubble around you which allows
you to connect various other Wi-Fi
devices to your iphone to allow you to
tether and I do keep mind that this
might cause this might cost a little bit
more depending on your plan you might
not be able to activate it so definitely
check with your carrier in your region
but this is a new feature in 4.3 which
is definitely very much appreciated
anyway guys that's about it for my
overview of iOS 4.3 it's a pretty decent
update again there's not a whole lot
news party is definitely the biggest
feature in my opinion but definitely has
very nice update now there is a downside
however if you have an iphone 3g or an
ipod touch 2nd generation you will not
be able to get 4.3 Apple has officially
dropped support for those devices
definitely a bit of a disappointment
it's kind of seems a little bit odd they
at least let it you know bring 25 iOS 5
however I guess that's kind of how it
goes so if you have one of those devices
I don't look for 4.3 because you're not
going to be able to get it definitely a
little bit of a downside however overall
for the rest of the devices 4.3 is
really solid update anyway guys thanks
