look at Iowa's 4.3 for the iPhone iPod
touch and iPad so this is the latest
version of iOS and it brings a few nice
new features so let's just jump straight
on in so the first and most noticeable
when you'll see just wrap the bat is
that there is a new FaceTime icon not
really a big deal however it definitely
does look very similar to the one on the
Mac kind of make it all look right but
again not a big deal in the slightest
what is a much bigger deal however is
that Safari has been updated and it is
now dramatically faster so we want to go
ahead and open up a new tab here that's
just punching the state of jailbreak and
you guys will see that it is
dramatically faster this is a full
desktop site as you guys can see there
it loaded in just a matter of a couple
of seconds pretty much on par with you
know like a netbook as far as I can tell
very very impressive and of course the
speed games are going to be even better
on the next iPad of course the iPad 2
and you'll be able to see that now you
can actually output video from a variety
of sources via airplay so before it was
just pretty much in the inbuilt
Apple app you know you could just you
know take your movies send it over to
your Apple TV via airplay is pretty much
very very limited however in 4.3 there's
pretty much no restriction so you know
you can do in the browser YouTube app
whatever you want you can output full
video over to your Apple TV so that's
definitely a very nice thing if you have
a GSM iPhone 4 you're going to be really
pleased to know that there is now a new
feature called personal hotspot what
this allows you to do is just like on
the Verizon iPhone 4 you just pull in
you know your standard 3G and you create
a Wi-Fi bubble around you which allows
you to connect various other Wi-Fi
devices to your iPhone to allow you to
tether and I do keep in mind that this
might cause this might cost a little bit
more depending on your plan and you
might not be able to activate it so
definitely check with your carrier in
your region but this is a new feature in
4.3 which is definitely very much
appreciated hey guys that's about it for
my overview of iOS 4.3 it's a pretty
decent update again there's not a whole
lot news Sparty is definitely the
biggest feature in my opinion but
definitely is very nice update now there
is a downside however if you have an
iPhone 3G or an iPod Touch 2nd
generation you will not be able to get
4.3 Apple has officially dropped support
for those devices it's definitely a bit
of a disappointment you
it's kind of it seems a little bit odd
they didn't at least let it you know
bring to five is five however I guess
that's kind of how it goes so if you
have one of those devices I don't look
for a 4.3 because you're not going to be
able to get it definitely had a little
bit of a downside however overall for
the rest of the devices 4.3 is really
solid update anyway guys thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
