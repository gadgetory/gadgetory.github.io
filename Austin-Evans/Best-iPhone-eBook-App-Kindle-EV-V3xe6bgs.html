iPhone and iPod Touch application this
is a bit of a simpler one compared to
iBooks
however it's not nearly as bare-bones as
the Google Books application so as you
see here we do have the Kindle Store so
I'll show you in a minute
you can edit so if we decide that we
don't want any of these books on the
local memory we can easily delete them
you can go ahead and sort through author
title or recent and as you can see there
there is a little refresh icon now that
actually syncs your Kindle application
with your online Amazon account now with
Amazon everything is stored up in the
cloud so if I ever decide let's say I
purchased a book and I decide I want to
delete it on this device that's fine I
can always redownload it no issue at all
and likewise if I decide that hey I'm
going to be on my computer right now and
I decide that hey this is a great book I
want to buy this well but I buy it on my
PC and then immediately all I have to do
is just press that button right there it
will download now be all set to go and
that also syncs your bookmarks as well
as your highlights all that kind of good
stuff so let's show you a little bit
about how it works so we can go ahead
and open up Pride and Prejudice this is
as you can see it automatically defaults
to the full screen view which I do like
you know we have three and a half inches
of screen real estate to work with you
better use it all now it doesn't have
any fancy page transitions so you know
it's not too bad it's really quite
smooth you can see here I scroll really
fast I kind of caused a little bit of
issue but of course there's really no
reason why you'd ever need to do that
now by tapping on it we'll go ahead and
bring up all of our menus we can search
so just do a quick little search here
you can see here it's pretty much on par
with the other applications it's not
extremely fast but it's definitely not
slow by any means and it will do you
know it would be just fine now if you
write down here we can pull up some of
the options there's text color so we can
have it black we have it white or sepia
I prefer to just leave it on black in
the same way it goes for if you want to
change the font size you can absolutely
do that although again I like the
defaults of the Kindle app looks just
fine to me and if we click here we can
see that it has we can go to different
versions of the book on that man that
versions but you see the different you
know parts of it so the table of
contents begin
in center etc and with different ebooks
that are formatted properly you can
actually see even more here such as the
individual chapters now the last thing
is we can just simply bookmark the page
so as you can see right there this is
bookmark
now it's um bookmarked I now want a
really cool thing I'll go ahead and just
hover over it right here you can see
that actually does go ahead and allow
you to both look it up in the dictionary
do several things so all you need to do
is just hover over the well not hover
over it but you need to press it for
just a moment you'll see the dictionary
will automatically pop up explaining
what the word means a very very cool
feature I wish the other apps would use
as you know you can do it 9 books but
you know they have to click another
button and wait for the dictionary to
load this way I mean soon as less they
want to see what indisposed means hover
over it boom there's my you know
definition it's perfect I can also go
ahead and highlight as well as noted so
a very very cool feature with the Kindle
application now that's about it you know
it's pretty smooth like I showed you you
can do a little bit of customization but
I like is it just works and it's really
quite snappy now let's take a look at
the Kindle Store itself this is a pretty
basic store it's not you know no frills
like an iBook in the iBook store but no
big deal you can see here you can search
very quickly and easily browse by
category take a look at the bestsellers
all that kind of good stuff so let's go
ahead and jump into the bestsellers and
I will mention one thing this seems to
load a bit slower than the other two I
don't know if this just that's not quite
up to the speed if it's whatever the
deal is but as you can see it wasn't a
big deal we can go ahead and take a look
at the different books that are on the
top sellers list as you can see I'm
going to take a look at the price the
titles all that cut stuff it's a bit
small but you know yeah not a
deal-breaker but it means so once we
decide to load it up you can see that we
have a few options here pushing see all
the information you can see the list
price you can see that we can buy it
mium by now just by clicking that
especially if you already have your
account logged into on Safari we try a
sample see the more information
description and reviews so it's pretty
simple now overall I like I don't really
think that this is any better than the
iBook store but as far as you know
buying the books it's no big deal and
however I think that most of the time
you probably will want to go ahead and
buy on the PC something
just buying stuff on mobile devices you
know using your credit card now that
kind of stuff just I don't know I'm just
not totally into that so I prefer to buy
the stuff on the PC however of course
that option is there all you need to do
is just log into your Amazon account is
really quite simple and easy so my guys
that's just about it for my you know my
overview of the Kindle app now I'm going
to just say this this is my favorite of
the three now while you know if you're
just using it just for the app if you're
not ever going to you know view your
books on any other device iBooks is
definitely a little bit better it's more
polished a little bit quicker you have a
few nicer options that you don't have in
Kindle however one of the biggest things
is that it doesn't have quite as big of
a library the Kindle library is much
larger than either there and the other
two as far as the paid books anyway I
think the Google book store has a few
more free ebooks but sort of the paid
books this is definitely the way to go
in addition this also has the best
compatibility now this is really key you
know I mean if you're changing over from
you know you standard paper books which
I've always read you know you're going
to have an issue with buying all kinds
of books online and then probably know
that you won't be able to use them on a
different device next year etc etc now
where iBooks is pretty much solely used
for on Apple devices
you know let's say I have a an Android
phone well I can go ahead and read those
books with the Kindle app same way
obviously on the Kindle itself PC Mac
iPad there's a lot of different things
that you can view so really I do prefer
the Kindle app just because I buy it
once I can read on my ipod touch syncs
with all my stuff and then if I decide
that hey you know what I'm touched I
phone here in a few years they're not
really all that cool anymore I want to
go for the latest and greatest well the
odds are that Kindle will go ahead and
support that as well so for pretty much
that reason alone I'm going to go ahead
and recommend to go ahead and pick up
Kindle it's a really nice app the
store's pretty decent they've got a
really nice library and their support is
really great I mean they really do
support a lot
