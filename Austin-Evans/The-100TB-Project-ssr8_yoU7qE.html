ultimate store Nader - what are you
getting ourselves into this it's going
to be over a hundred terabytes can get a
little upset with our previous workflow
Solana's jumped in I actually want to
see is it like how big is the store
haters I didn't see it you know what
this one is actually not that big this
is their all new ad 15 so you actually
have a bigger version of this for your
petabyte project right yes
so petabyte project is using two of the
60 drive units oh sure
so can I get your face on this if you do
good so right now we use an AZ which is
much more kind of a basic sort of like
backup kind of thing but with this with
100 terabytes of storage I'm actually a
little bit more but I think we'll slowly
kind of upgrade over time where she can
store all of our videos all of our raw
footage even stuff like red footage
which is of course enormous dude that is
clean we're actually going to be running
on raid so that's why I prepared this
USB Drive so the whole OS actually boots
off of us do it when it's fully okay
fully off of a USB and that's it we
that's 0s drive and then we're actually
going to grab a couple one terabyte SSDs
to use as a cache so essentially in
addition to having all of our standard
10 terabyte hard drives just stupid on
its own you also have some SSD cache
essentially for dumping like a ton of
footage on it really quickly yeah this
is really cool I feel like we do a lot
of videos on sort of interesting stuff
this is way more in your realm so these
are 10 terabyte hard drives and we have
15 of them these are pretty new drives
right yeah so these are the iron wolf
Pro they're rated for they've got a
five-year warranty they're rated for
like 300 terabytes a year of luggage
drive access per drive so you guys
aren't even going to touch that if one
of them did fail with cools you can pack
this off yeah and Seagate can do their
restoration magic we helped I mean of
course you never know yeah and then even
if you lost like when catastrophic
failure you know multiple drives failed
Conrade doesn't stripe the data across
multiple discs it's isn't files it's
is it in files to disk so you hooked us
up with all this by the way how much do
you think all these drives would have
cost by themselves because either one
what about speech no six grand worth of
drives Thank You Seagate you guys are
great
like completely tools we just drop it
straight in it's well there's one tool
okay hey yeah yeah yeah but other than
that no there are two you guys were kind
of thinking you go what like a hundred
terabytes to start yeah I mean this kind
of expand as you go because I think like
you were saying before we even did this
it doesn't make sense to have all these
drives powered up and sitting in here
forever
if we're not going to come close because
right now we're running off of 12
terabytes and that's more than what we
need but what we're doing right now is
we're deleting all of our raw footage so
we finished up a video essentially we
will say like the main video as well as
we'll save like a master file but we'll
delete all the raw stuff and that is 150
terabytes actually little bit more we've
got we're gonna have some SSD cache but
we won't count that 150 terabytes of raw
storage oh you essentially is a pretty
reasonable size like it's about the same
size like a normal computer chassis
really the cabling I think is what
really jumps out to me it like you think
about like we're trying to put even like
say five or six drives in a normal
computer chassis we need a disaster of
cables everywhere and everything about
the nightmare this is a nice employment
so this is our current setup yeah that
is just just to comment that's oh no it
is kind of close to where we film but
cut-the-knot to a fans I hope it's going
to be pretty quiet only one way to find
out
store Nader and three down okay so all
you got to do is plug it in and then you
navigate to tower but we're going to
change that so they'll make the server
whatever you want to call it okay so
we're activated we're good to go
we're activated we're good to go this is
it so here's info you can see right now
we're connected at gigabit because we
haven't put the 10 gig switch in right
server identification oh wait a name for
it what's it called or can't call this
tornador that's like that's too easy the
big thing we're gonna be staring at this
name for the next five years of our life
Duncan eight oh how do I love it on
three three three oh three did you do it
yeah okay
it's the Duncan eight or three three
three zero three now so the cool things
this is that even though obviously we
can connect via not only gigabit but
also things could be Ethernet I think
we're going to do that sort of later on
yeah this also works over Wi-Fi so if
I'm sitting on the couch over here I can
go download a file upload something
whatever yep so Wi-Fi is going to be
plenty fast enough to do something like
I simple like an archive or you know
just pull a file off but if you want the
full speed especially for editing off of
it we can do is we can use this
Thunderbolt 2 adapter 2 10 Gigabit
Ethernet and then run it through a
switch and get pretty solid speeds I
mean that is really quick I mean you can
ingest huge chunks of footage way way
faster so this is the whole like idea of
not just having it be big but also safe
right so while you're copying that yeah
I can gentle oh don't do it don't do it
oh that's great oh my god that my
fingers are sweaty there it goes ok
don't move it around a little yeah I
feel a tingling but uh we're still
copying so basically all you have to do
if a drive fails you're we've simulated
here yeah it stopped the new one in the
set the array to rebuild and it rebuilt
it it doesn't even skip a beat like it
doesn't even say like paused as the flow
dies just still copy no problem at all
there you go 140 point nine seven
terabytes free dude thank you found out
man this is oh my god this is so cool
hey Lee hopefully you guys enjoy
definitely sure let me know what you
think about a hundred and 50 terabytes
server in the comments below
also this guy's kind of a write you can
check out his channel and I or we or
someone will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
