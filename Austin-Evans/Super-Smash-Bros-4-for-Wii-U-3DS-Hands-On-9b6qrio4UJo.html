here at the Nintendo booth at e3 2014
with my good buddy Kevin from tomorrow
and my own channel now he's everywhere
all those out and we just played Super
Smash Brothers for both the 3ds and the
Wii U and my goal I there was a lot of
fun
all right so first of all let's talk
about the 3ds version because to be
entirely honest I was not expecting much
like I was like 3ds gonna be like the
lame version but it's fun yeah I mean I
sure that's why I thought they were
doing the early release for that one
first because people would buy that
because they just want smash now and
then by wii u later but it was actually
a lot of fun I mean I'm kind of down to
pick up both versions really same for
sure I mean the thing is with the 3ds
version you're really not losing a whole
lot it still runs nice and smooth 60fps
you know what controls were really
surprisingly good I would had such low
expectations for that but it played
nicely I mean it really felt like the
normal you know Smash Brothers on
anything else yeah I just had to adjust
to a different gamepad to compare to
like GameCube that and the one cool
thing was different stages different
stages you guys I like that so I mean
yeah there's like slight differences
especially like with the graphics and
whatnot but it overall its 3ds Smash
it's just it's awesome I gotta say I
like the Wii U version a lot more mainly
just because I got to destroy this guy
here and once hold this up for me hold
up my trophy got one lesson dice up
t-shirt for destroying it with little
Mac that was that was fun hey hey so in
terms of gameplay we actually had a
really interesting thought on the Wii U
version yeah in terms of speed there's a
notable difference from both prior
versions it's faster than brawl which is
a good thing because that was molasses
compared to what we got used to but at
the same time it's not as fast as melee
which might be a good balance I'm happy
with it well just a physio more people
respond to it once they get their hands
on it start getting more advanced
techniques going on and such because I'm
not a pro gamer and I noticed some of
the characters were also like grey ninja
a lot of them had like crazy aerials and
I was it was very much more of a
vertical kind of game you know for you
not for me a little Mac has no a hair
game whatsoever I just kept running back
and forth punching people and it worked
really well I mean I one's open now
officer noobs like you I'm sorry some of
us like a little skill in our game what
just because I happen to get all the
items assist trophies and get the final
Spanish doesn't mean a note know how to
play jeez he was cheating just just
throwing that out there by playing the
game the way it's meant to be so what do
you guys think about the new Super Smash
Brothers I know after I played it I'm
really excited but what did you think
yeah no I can't wait to get my hands on
it actually try more characters because
I only got two today so try more out as
soon as possible especially pac-man for
sure so anyway you guys want more videos
including some more Nintendo coverage
you're about to do what hi
