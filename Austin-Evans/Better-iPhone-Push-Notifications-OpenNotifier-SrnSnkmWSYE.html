video showing you a very useful in handy
little tweak in cydia called open
notifier basically open notifier allows
you to go ahead and kind of it's not a
replacement per se however is this kind
of a similar thing to Android wear if
you've ever used an android phone you
know that you can you pull the another
fire down and you can see all your
notifications all what's new and what's
happening all over through all your apps
of course iOS has something similar
however the pop-up notifications
certainly are not the best I'm so
basically open notifier does is actually
you can see here I do have a couple of
them up in the top right-hand corner
basically we'll just go ahead and give a
small little notifier just letting you
know that you know you have this or that
so as you can see here it's totally
customizable I have two of them so watch
for my mail and the one is I have a few
Game Center requests the way I've set it
up so go ahead and show you guys head
download it and how to set it up now to
find it in cydia audience do is go ahead
and type and open go the fire all one
word you want to open it up it is free
so it's definitely great so all you need
to do is just go ahead and click on the
top right hand corner and click install
okay so now once you've respring your
device you can go ahead and go into the
settings app and go ahead and select
open notifier now they're going to be a
few options but you can pretty much
ignore all these except for the apps now
once you go into the app basically this
is why you decide what apps you want to
go ahead and display and what icons so
let's go ahead just take for example
this way it's a we want the App Store so
it comes with five icon you can't
install more however five are ok for me
for the moment I'm so let's say we want
when we get a notification for the App
Store let's say we want you know the !
or whatever we can go ahead select that
and the same goes you can go ahead and
scroll through all your apps the
pre-installed one so maybe like you know
you want to set up when you get a
FaceTime message or you can go ahead and
scroll down here maybe you know your
facebook or your Twitter whatever you
want to do you can go ahead and set it
up through open notifier okay so that's
it as you can see it's a really handy
little tweak works very well and
personally I like it because you know
instead of having getting push
notifications or having to look for
badges these pops up very non
intrusively in my status bar and when I
see the icon say oh I've got an email or
a bad new friend request or however you
decide set up</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
