and quicker but which one is fastest the
specs are the easiest place to start the
iPhone 6 is definitely down on paper
with only a dual-core processor + 1
gigabyte of RAM compared to a 6-quart
chip and 3 gigs of ram on the LG g4 and
a whopping 8 cores on the galaxy s6 edge
things aren't quite so simple however
kicking things off we have the graphics
benchmarks these are mostly helpful for
measuring gaming performance but also
affect how smooth the phones run in
everyday use first off we have the 3d
mark ice storm unlimited test and here
all three are reasonably well matched
although the galaxy s6 edge is the clear
winner move over to GFX bench Manhattan
and things change up slightly with the
iPhone beating out the g4 and the off
screen test and easily winning over both
in the on screen test both the galaxy s6
and LG g4 have team Krispy approved quad
HD screens that while great come with a
performance penalty the phones have to
drive a lot of pixels the iPhone needs
to push less than one third as many
pixels which can give it an advantage in
some situations but there's no doubt
that the Samsung Galaxy s6 pulls out the
win in the graphics department next
let's take a look at the processors the
octane benchmark is a good test of CPU
and browser performance and here the
galaxy s6 edge easily wins out over the
g4 and iPhone which end up being
surprisingly close next we have
Geekbench 3 which is a peer test of the
processors in single traded performance
the iPhone wins however the Galaxy s6 is
really able to stretch its legs in the
multi-core part of the test this doesn't
seem to make much sense on the surface
the iPhone should be way less powerful
what's going on it might have a big
disadvantage on paper but the iPhone
actually has the most powerful CPU cores
of the bunch
both the g4 and galaxy s6 take advantage
of what's known as big.little which
pairs a set of powerful CPU cores along
the less power-hungry ones this allows
the weaker cores to handle most basic
usage while being able to switch to the
bigger cores when you need more
performance the g4 has only two of the
more powerful a 57 cores where the
galaxy s6 has for been really used it's
rare to need for pores much less eight
all that tech jargon means that for most
tasks the iPhone is slightly faster but
having the extra cores when you need
them gets the slight edge to the galaxy
s6
having lots of performance is great but
if your battery immediately dies it's
not doing you much good
here I turn to the GFX bench battery
test which loops a complex 3d scene 30
times
here the iPhone and Galaxy S six come up
short where the LG g4 wins out thanks to
its bigger battery and slightly less
powerful specs compared to the s6
there's another side effect of having a
lot of power packed inside a phone and
that's Heat
not only can this make phones
uncomfortable to hold they can also hurt
performance using a thermal camera you
can see there's a pretty major
difference in how each phone is able to
cope under a gaming load the iPhone
evenly disperses the heat at around 31
degrees Celsius which is only slightly
warm to the touch
move over to the g4 and it tops out at
36 degrees which is warm but the heat is
kept at the top making most of the phone
perfectly fine the galaxy s6 edge is
even warmer at 38 degrees and this is
spread throughout the phone making it
slightly uncomfortable to the touch they
might not have the most raw power but
the iPhone is clearly the winner here so
at the end of the day how do these phone
stack up the iPhone and g4 both perform
well and have advantages but it's safe
to say the Samsung Galaxy s6 is the
fastest phone out well for now anyway
