of d3 live so today we're going to be
talking about a topic that's going on a
lot of people's minds this week which is
which one is better the iphone 4 or the
google nexus s enough horses in case
you're not familiar the iphone 4 and
that whole lot of introduction needed it
is the latest apple smartphone lightest
in the really really successful i phone
line you know the iphone 4 has a lot of
really great features i'm going to
prepare them in just a second i'm now on
the other hand there's the brand new
google nexus s typically made by samsung
but it's kind of branded as both
basically the Nexus S is the latest
generation of Android smartphones and it
brings with a lot of really cool
features namely the fact that has
gingerbread or rather android 2.3
gingerbread pre-installed so a lot of
people were kind of thinking well these
are probably two of the best smartphones
available on the market but which one's
going to be for you sometime go ahead
and try and give you guys some of my
thoughts and opinions try to help you
out so one of the major things about the
nexus s that i like is the fact that it
does run android now if you've ever
watched any of my videos you know that
I'm a big fan of Android I like the fact
that it's open there aren't a whole lot
of restriction you know it's really
simple to do most of the things you need
to do so but this means is you can go
ahead and download pretty much any app
you want you can go ahead and route it
fairly simply usually on most phones so
you have total access you can you know
change up the look of it feel of it
pretty much anything you want to do is
totally up to you on an android phone
now on the iphone you can do this
somewhat as well however it's a little
bit more difficult generally involves
jailbreaking which I'm a big supporter
of that as well I've do lots videos on
it but generally just seems to be Apple
does not like it nearly as much as
Google does they kind of tend to lock it
down so a lot of things you might have
problems with on the iphone as far as
modding and you know kind of customizing
your phone however that's a small point
not a big deal for most people now what
the big wheels are of course is how they
work how they function you know all that
kind of stuff well both of them are
going to be very good as far as this
goes now the iphone 4 in the united
states of course it is available at
different carriers around the world but
the united states it's only on a GT
which has less than stellar no coverage
they're not this just
the greatest carrier likewise on the
google nexus s may come you can bind on
a prepaid contract and a prepaid but i
just on a standard to your contract
through t-mobile in the united states or
you can also just buy unlocked use it
anywhere you like so just go ahead go
ahead and just assume that it's on
tmobile as far as the coverage on
tmobile not the greatest in the world
either so really i think it's kind of a
wash you know for both phones going to
be decent but not spectacular I know
where it comes in to where the real
differences lie are the operating
systems themselves now obviously the
iphone 4 is going to run the iOS four
operating system you know this is the
Apple operating system that's on the
iphone the ipod touch as well as slow
they switch version on the ipad now this
operating system in my opinion is the
simplest easiest to use of any phone
available in my opinion I mean it's very
very polished you know they've had a lot
of time do you know to work out the
little kinks you know they've got the
app store which is really phenomenal has
I believe over a hundred thousand
applications i believe well over that so
you can find all kinds of excellent
applications games etc etc what i really
like about iOS and of course by
extension the iphone if the fact that
it's just simple to use you know there's
no complicated well of course there's
some complicated but for the most part
you want to see something just touch on
the screen happens no problem man just
as simple as that there's not a whole
lot of unnecessary complication now
that's not to say the android does
however i've just found that apple and
iOS just seems to be a little bit
simpler and more user-friendly now
moving over to android of course i
previously mentioned how it's a lot more
open and allows you to do more things
but on top of that it's still just seems
to be just a little bit less polished i
know that's not safe you do buy the
nexus s and you do right on android 2.3
it's gonna be some terrible experience
or anything i just find that in my
experience it's just not right they're
very very close but not quite there I
know that said android 2.3 the latest
version of Android has got a lot of
really nice improvements now namely of
course is going to be faster but a lot
of the UI and experiences so you know
they've changed the look of the phone it
runs very very nicely so I do like that
quite a bit
standpoint kind of give it to the iphone
however both of them will probably be
okay for what you need to do now the
nexus s does have a few nice features
that are brand-new of course does have a
front and rear facing camera just like
on the iphone now on the iphone it does
have facetime we can actually go ahead
and just you know hold the phone up and
i should go ahead and video chat with
people you can technically do the same
thing on the nexus s however it's not
quite as good there's no simple easy way
to do it you just have to find some app
so the cameras there you just need to
find an apt and make sure that your
friend or your family or whatever who
talked to is also has the same app so a
little bit less bug easy and simple but
it's not the hugest deal now one of the
really cool things the Nexus S does is
it supports NFC also known as near field
communication now this actually has a
lot of potential while today you
probably won't have buying much use of
it you may be in a month or six months
probably even a year from now it will be
very very useful I would expect that a
lot of phones going to start using it
basically what allows is you can go
ahead just take the phone and it turns
almost into like a wireless little
device where there are a lot of
different things such as you want to use
it as a credit card but the options
there again not not carpooling but it
will be there where if you just say you
you're in the store and you not pay for
something you just take your phone set
it down near a sensor you know go ahead
and automatically do everything you need
so there are really a lot of really
interesting things of course is not
anywhere near limits that there's many
many more things you can do that's one
of the really cool things i do like
about the nexus s assertive guys you
know if you're really having to pick
between the two of them you know carrier
isn't an option you know you don't have
to worry about anything else you just
want to pick which phone you like more
it's really going to come down to what
kind of user you are you know if modding
isn't a big deal if you do--if you have
just like the stock experience from both
phones you know if you like it doesn't
matter about the apps a lot of stuff you
just want a good phones going to make a
good phone calls you know surfing
internet dwell fun stuff the iphone is
probably going to be the way it go like
I said it's dead simple to use that are
of course more options and everything
you can do but I phone is just very very
simple however if you're up to modding
your phone if you like to customize it a
bunch and you don't mind using a thought
in the operating system that's
a little bit less supportive of course
and memory by apps you won't find quite
as many apps but overall it's still very
very solid experience you won't have a
problem going with the nexus s so really
it's kind of up to you and what you like
to do ok so for the second segment of d3
live I'll be taking live questions from
everyone as always every episode of d3
live is filmed in front of blog TV and
we've got over 40 people in there now so
avoid just take some questions when will
there be an iphone for verizon had a
question I've heard so many times
honestly I don't know the answer and I
don't think anybody is shorter maybe
Steve Jobs knows that answer you know
we've heard a lot I mean so much talk
about it may be coming out january or at
least sometime early next year for the
with the iphone 4i i didn't believe it
there's so much evidence but the problem
is is that there's always rumors with
rumors rumors rumors and what really
comes down to is whether or not you can
pick the bad ones from the good ones so
you know you'll hear a lot of chatter
you here oh I've got a picture of this
picture that but what really comes down
to is if you can decide wait that's not
real that's real and to be honest I'm
not smart enough to figure that out so
to be entirely honest I have no idea
when or if it's ever going to come out I
wouldn't be surprised if it comes out of
the next few months but I really
couldn't say why is it the delay in the
white iphone 4 um again kind of not not
nothin I really really know we've heard
some things that they're having issues
with making them something about like
light leakage like a if you've ever seen
a lot of the white like white phones in
general that white even white
electronics with screens you would like
with black you know it kind of seals up
the light so but what I mean by lightly
key did leakage is if you take the
iphone and you look at especially in the
dark you'll see that around the screen
you'll see like little bits of like
light you know leaking from the side and
stuff which obviously you don't want
that's what the may think main thing
I've heard do that or they can't quite
get the white color right but anyway it
does seem like it's some kind of
manufacturing issue where they just
can't make the wipe the iphone and
something other than black however it
does sound like they will have it out
here sometime early next year i believe
spring is pretty much they've been
pretty fun that they will be able to get
done by then the next i don't going to
call the iphone
orgy you know I don't think it will for
a couple of reasons for one I don't
think that 4g will be ready next year I
know obviously 80 is one of the last
people with 4G service but another
reason I don't think that they will
actually call the 4g it's just because
it's already the iphone for now it's
absolutely possible don't get me wrong I
especially I'm going to be quoted here a
few a few months when actually they do
call the iphone 4g but i just don't
really think so i just it just doesn't
make sense i think the probably call it
maybe the iphone 5 or something but
again this is it just guesses it's just
you know my opinion so don't don't take
it too seriously well the iphone 5 you
better than iphone 4i yeah i would say
so I've read every time they refresh the
iphone i like that new features make it
faster they do something um can I do a
drop test of the nexus s okay i don't
have an exercise if i did though i would
definitely not try to demolish it just
for a video i love you guys but I
couldn't do that the nexus s had
different colors no not that I know of
now it's always boss bullies they might
do a little bit later on but for now you
can have any cloud you want as long as
it's black the nexus s how much memory
does it have you know it's a good
question you know i believe it's going
to be either 8 or 16 gigabytes i dunno
perfect that it does not have any kind
of expandable which kind of a little bit
odd for an android phone there's no
place we can add extra storage via
microSD card I believe it's either 8 or
16 gigabytes um can you jailbreak your
nexus s to be like an iphone 4 and
somebody told me here but i know you
can't there's you can get android on the
iphone 4 but you can't really get iOS on
an android device but think android 2.3
is better than 2.2 absolutely I there's
a lot of really cool things in android
2.3 namely a lot of it is just near the
style of it looks a lot better you know
it's more polishing you actually you
know for example when you scroll up on
the screen you've got a nice little
overlay on the bottom that kind of looks
really nice so a lot of it just minor
touches just to make it look better
although there are some really important
things that is the key
board which is much much better um is it
possible to run the mac OS on ipad no i
don't really think so I mean of course
anything is possible but it would it
would take a lot of work to try to get
OS 10 on an eye patches because it
actually runs in a different pitcher for
Kyle I get into too technical but it
runs different kind of hardware that's
really not compatible it's the iOS 4.2
or Android 2.3 I'll kind of got into
this in the earlier video I kind of
prefer iOS for a little bit but again it
kind of depends on what kind of user you
are I really like well I like the
modding everything I know I know I'm
fairly good experience with jailbreaking
so that's not a big deal to me and I
just know I've got so much invested in
you know the iOS and all the you know
the ins and outs and everything so first
like for me I kind of like iOS however
android 2.3 is such a phenomenal OS it's
it's just hard for me to say well this
one's better that one's better when
they're both just just equally good I
suppose do I like I was four point two
point one four point two point one of
course we don't know is the latest
version for the iphone 4 of course the
ipad ipod i like it it's it's okay i
mean as far as the update i mean overall
is no west like i said i like a lot um
sort of thought that goes not a big
update but you know it's not too bad
