here with a review of the Circle Pad Pro
for the Nintendo 3ds this is an add-on
that adds a second circle pad to your
3ds along with another pair of shoulder
buttons as the PSP showed so well having
only one control pad can really hurt a
lot of games but is the circle pad pro
really the answer the box looks just
like any other accessory and has incited
the circle pad itself a triple-a battery
for powering it a strap in case you
randomly decide to throw your 3ds across
the room and some instructions on the
circle pad pro all we need to do is get
a coin or screwdriver to unscrew the
door
toss the triple-a battery inside and
you're good to go according to Nintendo
a single battery should last you around
480 hours which takes it rather nicely
with 3ds is roughly 30 seconds of
battery life the hardware itself is
plain but very sturdy to hook it up all
you need to do is firmly press your 3ds
into it and the rubber pads will keep it
secure over on the right side is the
circle pad which looks and feels
identical to the one on the 3ds and on
top you'll see the new ZL and Zr
shoulder buttons which are a welcome
addition because of how the grip extends
farther on the right side than the left
the R button on your 3ds is duplicated
on the circle pad pro the back has a
nicely ergonomic design which almost
feels like a console controller and the
entire unit is made of a soft black
plastic as you would expect game play
has helped quite a bit by the addition
of a second control pad even though the
3ds gains quite a bit of bulk in the
hand I actually think it feels better
than the 3ds by itself the second circle
pad is directly across from the one on
the 3ds and together they do a
respectable job with the third-person
shooter like Resident Evil Revelations
oh and on a quick side note I would
definitely recommend the Konami hires a
better proof reader you know someone who
can spell the name of their game right
anyway while traveling that as good as
what you'll find on an xbox or ps3 -
circle badges are vastly better than one
same thing goes for the added shoulder
buttons I found that they made the game
quite a bit better for aiming and
shooting with the r button relegated to
melee attacks the distance between the
right circle pad and the function
buttons is a bit long and can trip you
up occasionally but overall the circle
pad pro is a very positive thing for the
ergonomics and control the 3ds it's not
all good news though I already consider
the 3ds borderline pocketable
and what
the circle pad attached you're pretty
much going to need to carry it around in
a bag or case on top of that it's just
flat-out ugly especially if your 3ds is
in the other color than black it also
covers up a lot of 3d exports if you
want to change SD cards swap games or
get the stylus out you'll need to remove
your 3ds which while not a deal-breaker
can definitely be a bit annoying the
Circle Pad communicates with the 3ds via
IR and enjoy it works fine who over a
king sometimes get a bit screwy when you
remove the 3ds and put it back in and of
course the biggest downside is the
simple fact that not all games will work
with the servo pad several new games
like Metal Gear Solid and Kid Icarus
well but if you're looking to use this
with Ocarina of Time you're out of luck
same goes for using it inside the 3ds
menus the only time it's recognized is
when playing a compatible game while far
from perfect I do have to admit the
circle pad really does make gaming
better on the 3ds there are definitely
some downsides but for twenty dollars if
you're interested in playing any games
that are compatible with the grip I
recommend taking a look at the circle
pad pro if you enjoyed and want to be
awesome definitely be sure to leave this
