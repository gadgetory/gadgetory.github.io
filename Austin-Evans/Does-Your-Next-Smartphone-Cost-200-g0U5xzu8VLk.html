hey guys Zhou stood with flagship
smartphones cost in excess of $1,000
sometimes it really got me thinking is
it possible to get yourself an actually
decent smartphone for less than $200
which brings us here so in front of me I
have 4 phones all costing less than $200
so it just a look at the Nokia 2 as part
of my widest nuki exists in 2018 video
and my verdict on it was actually really
positive so for $100 you're going to be
getting some premium build quality
features like an actual aluminum chassis
a giant 40 100 million power battery
solos decent software a nice screen it
really wasn't a lot to complain about
besides the performance move up to the
blue and for another $40 you're getting
a much larger phone so this actually
looks a lot more modern in a lot of ways
I feel like the main thing that you're
going to immediately notice is the 18 by
9 aspect ratio on the screen they're
still going to be bezels but there are a
lot smaller than on the Nokia one thing
that is that on the blue though is a
rear-facing fingerprint sensor something
that is really nice to see on a budget
device like this it's been in another
$30 though and you can get yourself the
do G mix now this phone easily feels
like it could cost twice its price so
the first thing you notice is the near
bezel this design yeah there's gonna be
a tiny bezel up top and there's a fairly
big chin but it looks very distinctive
and that combining with the heft as well
as the nice metal build the glass front
and back this really does feel like a
phone that could easily cost $500 of
course it's not going to be perfect so
with that chain comes a fingerprint
sensor that's going to be down here
unfortunately you still have on-screen
Android keys which feels like a little
bit of a waste and also very bizarrely
the front-facing camera is on the bottom
right side I guess they didn't really
have anywhere else to put it
with the new g3 you're getting something
that looks very very similar to a
certain series of Samsung Galaxy devices
that's less she's not going to be a bad
thing in my opinion
so around back it's got that same sort
of curved edges you've got the dual
cameras as well as the fingerprint
sensor but interestingly you're also
going to be getting a tapered glass
finish on the back as well as even on
the display it does curved a little bit
on the edges and bizarrely even though
they did add a USBC port you only have
these phones that actually does have USB
see they removed the headphone jack
which weirdly the Galaxy S nine actually
was able to keep this generation as far
as the screens go all four phones
actually do have decent displays so the
nokia 2 has a 5 inch 720p panel step up
to the
and you're getting that taller 18 by 9
aspect ratio with a 1440 by 720
resolution however it's going to be
stretched on a 6-inch display which does
look a little bit soft sometimes the
doogee is rocking a 5.5 inch 720p panel
and interestingly this is actually going
to be a Samsung AMOLED panel now the
colors to my eye are going to be a
little bit oversaturated but it's a
good-looking panel however my favorite
if I should going to be on the new so
this is still a 5.7 inch 720p panel same
as basically all of these however the
color the brightness the contrast
especially the viewing angles really do
set this a slight bit above the rest of
the other phones when you're spending $2
on a smart phone you shouldn't expect
any kind of crazy performance however
two of these phones actually do perform
pretty well one of the phones that does
not however is being Nokia too and this
is honestly a case where I feel like
Nokia made a lot of the right decisions
when they were designing this phone but
I think the cheaped out just a little
bit too much when it comes to
performance so inside you're going to
find a Snapdragon 212 processor which is
a very old very slow quad core chip and
that is one be paired with a mere one
gigabyte of RAM and eight gigabytes of
storage now the eight gigs of storage
you can kind of get around because you
do have a micro SD card slot there only
one gig of ram and that slow cpu just
makes android feel not great move up to
the vevo and you're going to be getting
an upgraded snapdragon 425 processor
that's still going to be quad-core
however they're going to be updated
cortex a53 s which is pretty much shared
with the rest of these phones and
importantly you're going to be getting
three gigs of ram as well as 32 gigs of
storage that's going to be plenty to run
pretty much any kind of Android app or
game right now and on top of that what
you're going to be getting is a pretty
decently sized 3000 milliamp hour
battery interestingly both the doochie
as well as the new are rocking very
similar specs so they each have the
immediate X 67 57 eight core processor
they're both paired with four gigabytes
of RAM and they both also have 64
gigabytes of built-in storage with
microsd expandable 'ti the biggest
difference here is that while the new
has at 3000 milliamp hour battery the
doogee is going to have a slightly
bigger 3380 milliamp hour cell that was
a lot of words use these phones in the
real world though and you'll see this is
one of the best examples of why specs
and benchmarks aren't everything
so inside Geekbench what you're going to
find is that the do
you are going to be significantly faster
but in practice that's actually not the
case so the blue actually feels really
nice sure on paper it's not going to
have quite the sense back and quite as
much memory but it's fairly snappy it's
going to be responsive and it is going
to have the power to do some gaming
however when you step up to the Yugi
what you're going to find is something
that feels really really old-school
there's one clear reason for that these
software is straight garbage town now I
think what it is is going to be a really
poorly optimized build of Android
pairing with a pretty heavy skin so what
I'm scrolling around here where I feel
is just the frame rate is slow it
doesn't feel responsive it really feels
like I'm using a foam from five six
seven years ago and that's totally not
OK at any price especially when you
consider that cheaper phones are going
to perform and feel much much better the
best of both worlds though is going to
be the new so now that you have the on
paper specs and the potential of those
specs but you also have a build of
Android which is going to be fairly
clean and you know not laggy and slow
not sure if you put the side-by-side
with something like a pixel it's not
going to be able to hold up but for a
normal person just to pick up the phone
and use it is going to be totally
respectable of course what better way to
take advantage of those awesome specs
then by playing some clash Royale the
sponsor of today's video don't you love
my super clean Segway I've had a lot of
travel lately which is giving me a lot
of time to play some mobile games and I
found the clash Royale has little gently
taking up almost all of my phone gaming
time clash Royale is a free-to-play game
we can duel players in real time while
unlocking arenas cards and collecting
treasure now I got to say I'm not
usually into freemium mobile games but
clash Royale is really well dying so
it's really simple to be able to get
into a match and once you get in there
while it's easy to learn there's plenty
of depth to make it challenging and you
can still play with your friends as well
and if you really want to get into it
they released a new feature called clan
wars where you can assemble a clan and
compete against others in a series of
battle modes to see who's the best so if
this will school you you can check it
out the link in the description or you
can just search up clash Royale on
Google Play as well as the App Store
while it might be slow the nokia 2 has
the cleanest build of Android here now
right now it's running on Android 7
although we'll be getting an update to
Oreo pretty soon but even though this
isn't an Android 1 device it really does
feel like it there's essentially no
bloat and actually no key has been
pretty good with updates to the new
three isn't far off now yes there are a
couple of apps and they've done a little
bit of tweaking but for the most part
you are getting a stock build of Android
which you're not necessarily getting
though is there any real guarantee of
solid Android updates in the future but
right now it seems to be working out
okay if you don't mind taking the risk
come over to the blue and well we've got
some software issues first of all is a
pretty offensive skin so now I do not
even have an app drawer but there's a
lot of bloat on this guy no get it
they've got to make some sacrifices to
be able to hit this price point but if
this is me I put some serious work into
cleaning up as much as I could changing
the launcher because right now yeah not
good whereas the doogee has 12 some
straight garbage town software that i've
already complained about but yeah it's
just not good but what could be good are
the cameras on all four of these phones
or they might not be good actually they
are less than $200 so yeah so to start
with let's give me $100 nokia to a try
and this guy has a single 8 megapixel
rear-facing camera so as with a lot of
things on the nokia - the performance is
not going to be fast when it comes to
taking photos and to be fair this is a
really challenging shot which it really
doesn't hold the highlights well in
that's a very white sky mm-hmm there's
some detail there although and what
seems like the processing is a little
bit soft although I say processing most
likely it's the less than stellar optics
on this tiny tiny little camera stepping
up in the budget range to the $140 blue
we do get a 13 megapixel camera and well
it looks bigger so it must be better
right allow camera to phone why yes I
want my camera to phone that's
definitely something I want all right so
let's throw that really contrast II shot
at it so it's definitely more detail
with the blue shot however actually feel
like there's even less dynamic range it
really does have a hard time with those
highlights whereas the Nokia actually
did a better job of keeping them in
here's gonna be a shot it's a little bit
more normal
get a exit close-up of one of Ken's
waifu's yeah that's actually not bad at
all it's actually fairly sharp the
dynamic range really isn't as big of a
problem here with a less contrasty shot
I'm actually pretty happy with that
especially for a hundred and forty bucks
now a lot of smartphones have some sort
of beauty mode in the camera but
something I've never seen is on this
blue we have a beauty video mode
alright so this is a test of beauty
video
so you guys can be the judge for
yourselves I'm whether I am more
beautiful or I look exactly the same and
there's a stupid softening filter on my
face step up to the $170 doogee and
we're going to find dual cameras now
here we're going to be getting a 16
megapixel main sensor paired with an 8
megapixel telephoto camera you know
that's actually not bad
so it does still have issues with the
dynamic range but there's a lot of
detail it's nice and sharp and
importantly a kept exposure of the main
subject pretty much all in here let's
try blur mode oh wow let's not try blur
mode a serious that's a photo I just
took in 2018 some some quality doogee
images right there that is Wow
well last but certainly not least we
have the new g3 at $200 and this guy's
also going to be rockin dual cameras
however what's different about this one
is that while they're not only going to
be slightly lower resolution 13 plus 5
as opposed to 16 plus 8
but that secondary camera actually
doesn't really function as a telephoto
option this is just going to be there
for extra depth data for stuff like the
portrait mode first thing I noticed is
that the processing seems to be a lot
faster when you take a shot that really
isn't that huge shutter like that there
was on some of the other phones oh man
this portrait mode is not good oh I can
tell already this is not gonna be pretty
I think you could do something a little
bit creative with this but uh yeah
portrait mode not really gonna be the
strong suit of sub $200 smartphones
comparing the selfies the first thing
that jumps out to me is the do G the
color is just really really washed out
sure there's a detail there but it just
looks terrible the nokia actually has
very vibrant rich colors I think it's a
maybe a little bit soft there's
definitely some sort of chromatic
aberrations going on or it looks like
there's some weird filter almost it's
passable the new doesn't do a terrible
job of getting detail in there's plenty
of dynamic range but the color just
looks off it just looks very sort of
cool very d saturated and not not a fan
what should be no surprise is that the
blue takes the best selfie now a big
part of that is that not only does it
have a front-facing flash but it also
has a 16 megapixel selfie shooter
something that's way beyond any of these
cameras alright so it is conclusion time
now coming in at number 4 is the Nokia 2
but don't get me wrong there's a lot
that I like about this phone the build
quality is nice the battery is going to
be massive and the software is really
clean
however what really undoes it is going
to be
super low-end internals now I can kind
of get by the low-end processor but only
one gig of ram really makes this almost
unusable especially when consider that
for only a little bit more you can get a
ton more phone a solid third place goes
to the do G mix now there's a lot to
like with this phone the idea that it
has a nearly bezel this design really
does make it stand out
I love the heft the way that the phone
feels and the hardware is great but what
undoes it is the software I said before
and I'll say it again it is a straight
up deal-breaker for me a very solid
second place goes to the blue vivo XL
three plus and there is a ton to like
with this guy $140 price tag feels like
it's right in the sweet spot you're
getting a solid build you're getting a
nice sized screen you're getting decent
performance the cameras are decent the
selfie camera is great really the only
major problem is that the software is
going to need some tweaking now if you
don't mind putting a little bit of time
into your phone to customize things like
your launcher then the blue is really
worth a look if you're buying a phone
under $200 though I really do like the
new g3 it pairs an awesome build that
really is very similar to phones such as
the galaxy s 9 which cost three four
five times as much with a really nice
screen you're getting that taller aspect
ratio the camera is going to be decent
but importantly the software is clean
and the performance is top-notch it's a
close one I feel like a lot of people
might be happier with the blue but if
it's my money I'm going to spend a
little bit more to get a much nicer
overall package</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
