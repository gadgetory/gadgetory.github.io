review of Minecraft so I'm sure a lot of
you guys have played it had probably
already bought it or already or you know
know about it however for a lot of you
guys who probably haven't this is my
review of it it's a fantastic game and
really the best way I can kind of
describe it is it's almost kind of like
a like a real-life Lego game which I
know this kind of sounds a little bit
weird but basically you are able to
commune build things very similar to you
know if you were actually like building
like real size of Legos it's a lot of
fun so let's go ahead and just kind of
give you guys a little bit demonstration
so as you can see here pretty much
everything is in these blocks and to
destroy it all you got to do is destroy
it so I have a show here which does
great for dirt there are a lot of
different kind that's just quite just
pick up my other shovel there are a lot
of different kinds of textures so
there's dirt stone there's even some
stuff like coal and diamonds which you
use to build different things
but as you can see here I can go ahead
with this shovel it kind of blows this
dirt and the really cool thing is you go
ahead and pick up the dirt now if I want
pick it out then I go ahead and rebuild
put all that dirt back where it was or
go ahead and just build myself like a
little Tower here just kind of jump up
and really you can do all kinds of stuff
with it actually you guys can see a
little bit of my kind of base set up
here so that's going to show you guys a
little bit about the game play minecraft
like I said it's a lot of fun and there
are actually are two versions now what
I'm doing it I'm playing the paid
version which actually has a survival
mode to it so basically what the
survival mode is that you can go ahead
you know it has a lot more to it it
actually gets day and night and excuse
the graphics are turned way down my
computer did not want report it so that
to turn the graphics practically all the
way down normally you can see quite a
bit farther than this but there's a kind
of a fog everywhere but like I say there
are two different modes there's the
survival mode which but well it's the
paid version it gives a lot more
dynamics there's a lot more bricks you
actually have tools you know there's day
and night animals will come out too you
know you have two monsters you have to
deal with all kinds of stuff
there also is a free version that
actually runs in your browsers on
minecraft net I'm in fact this is the
version that I like to play if you guys
ever come to d3 live I like to play that
a lot with you guys after the show is
done which is that's definitely a really
fun way didn't you know to test out
minecraft for free so like I said guys
minecraft is a really in-depth game the
developers constantly adding new
features I mean like all the time
there's this added this added different
dynamics but I can just give you guys
kind of a brief kind of overview so one
of the most important things is how to
build stuff so I just kind of just set
this here just to show you guys
basically you crack things so you know
there's all kinds of different things
you mean torches doors their boats there
are all kinds of different things and I
mean it's really really cool that's
logic behind it give you guys just a
little brief overview so let's go ahead
and build a let's go and build just one
stone axe so go ahead just drop a couple
of bricks of stone here and then let's
go ahead grab a couple of sticks and
there we go so now we have ourselves an
axe now an axe is great for chopping
down wood which is another really
important thing and so that's quite an
actually I do you guys can see you're
starting to get dark so probably better
hurry up I'm playing on peaceful I like
I'll kind of like the aspect I'm not
having to worry about anything besides
you can see there's a chicken come here
but I don't like to have to worry about
a whole lot of stuff but it is a kind of
a lot of fun to go ahead and you know
get into the survival aspect so let's go
ahead and just run down here and you see
here there are doors I've go ahead and
I've got a nice my I could I could go
down for like an hour trying to show you
guys that whole line over that way but
here's an actually they use you guys can
see the torches I'm sorry this is not
the greatest review ever it's minecraft
is a really in-depth game I probably
spent about an hour going over the
different things and as you guys can see
here this is my main line I've got like
glass up top and just if I can show you
guys that falling and dying huh boy down
here a little bit
whoo yeah I'm difficult falling here but
there's my mines you guys can see here
this is a great way to mine and all this
stuff because the cool thing is you pick
it all up so I basically have all of
these bricks which
I can use to build you know you know
castles and it really guys
I really recommend take a look at some
of the really great things that people
have built with Minecraft I mean it's
really impressive and people built
ridiculous things it's really fun really
easy so guys that's just about it yeah
there's there's like I said I could go
on for an hour talking about all the
different ins and outs but overall
minecraft is a ton of fun I like it a
lot and basically I recommend go ahead
check it out on minecraft net play the
free version first you know it's not
exactly the same as the paid version
which is actually going to be going up
in price soon so why recommend guys go
ahead and take a look at on the website
play it some if you like it go ahead I
definitely recommend pick up the paid
version because it is going to be going
up in price and I think it's well worth
it right now so yeah anyway guys thanks
