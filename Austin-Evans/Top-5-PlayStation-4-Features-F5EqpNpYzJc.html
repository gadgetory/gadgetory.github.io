with the top 5 best things about the
brand new Playstation 4 so Sony
announced this last night and while they
didn't give us all the information like
you know
a picture of the console which I don't
think would have been that hard but
beyond that they did show off some
really cool things about it so let's go
over some of the best features of the
PlayStation 4 coming in at number 5 is
that the PlayStation 4 will allow you to
use used games on the console now first
glance this might seem like something
really really stupid to include however
if the rumors are true the next version
of the Xbox the Xbox infinity or
whatever they decide to call it will
actually block used games now while I'm
not a huge fan of use games typically
it's not really worth saving like five
dollars on a brand new game for me what
is really annoying is the fact that
let's say I have an Xbox and I want to
take a game over to my friend's house
well it wouldn't work on his xbox so no
just a lot of really stupid stuff if you
buy a game I feel like you should
totally be able to use it sell it do
whatever you want with it so the fact
that the PlayStation 4 will allow you to
do that is a big thumbs-up in my book at
number four we have the brand new
controller the DualShock 4 now this
actually looks to be a major upgrade
from previous versions including the
DualShock 3 and well basically every
other playstation controller ever so for
starters it's a little bit bigger and a
little bit more ergonomic looking so it
almost looks like the cat took some
creative inspiration from the Xbox 360
controller which is all good by me as
that is in my opinion the best
controller ever there's also a touchpad
built in similar to what you'll find on
the back of the PS Vita now well I don't
think this is going to be a huge deal it
will be nice for some games like
LittleBigPlanet now on top of that
there's also what's basically a
PlayStation Move also built into the top
there's a little window on the top with
different light switch the cameras on
the PlayStation 4 will be able to pick
up which I don't really think that I was
ever a huge fan of the move however
since it is going to be built into the
controller you don't have to buy
anything else or you know deal with
add-ons and all that kind of stuff I do
think it will be pretty nice to have for
motion gaming on the PlayStation 4
number three is that updating is way way
way easier so I'm sure if you guys have
a PlayStation 3 you'll know that if you
don't play for a week or two the second
you turn it on you want to play a game
it's got to go download a system update
a games got to update this that and it
can take forever however with the
PlayStation 4 it will be able to update
pretty much entirely silently in the
background even when the console is off
on top of that there are also a couple
of other cool things for example when
you turn the console off it actually
goes into what's basically sleep mode
like
a PC so if you want to jump back into
the game instead having to wait for it
to boot up and all that kind of stuff
you'll pretty much shoot you straight
back into the game
another cool behind-the-scenes feature
on the ps4 is that will allow you to
actually play games as you download them
so normally if you want to play a game
on the PlayStation Network you buy it
you wait for it to download you wait for
it to install and then you play it
however with the PlayStation 4 is soon
as you download a little bit of it it
will allow you to start the game in the
background as you're playing it will
download the rest of the levels and
everything else that you need coming at
number two is the fact that the
PlayStation 4 can stream games straight
from the console so I'm sure most of you
guys are probably watching or subscribe
to somebody who does Let's Plays or
walkthroughs or anything like that of a
video game and typically what you have
to do is you have to buy like an HD PVR
to download it bring it over to computer
edit all that kind of stuff however with
the PlayStation 4 there's a chip
built-in that will allow you to
automatically record gameplay you can go
ahead and put it up on Ustream and
actually stream live you can also take
clips and upload them to YouTube
straight from your Playstation 4 which
is absolutely awesome lastly and number
one the PlayStation 4 is going to be one
seriously powerful console now of course
comparing it to the xbox and ps3 is kind
of a little unfair as both of those are
six seven eight years old right now
however the fact remains the PlayStation
4 is going to be just about as powerful
as a mid-range gaming PC so as far as
the space go it has an 8 core AMD CPU
which 8 cores that's pretty impressive
and on top of that also has a pretty
decent graphics card so what you can
expect if you guys are familiar with pcs
something like a Radeon 7850 78 70
something like that on top of that the
entire thing will be fed by a gigabytes
of gddr5 memory which is very fast
typically what you will find in high-end
graphics cards in fact that's going to
be in your console should make it very
very fast
anyway I'm curious to know what do you
guys think about the PlayStation 4 do
you think it's good enough and you plan
on upgrading from your Xbox or
Playstation or do you want to wait and
see what Microsoft's got cooked up for
the next Xbox if we'll be sure to let me
know what you think in the comments
