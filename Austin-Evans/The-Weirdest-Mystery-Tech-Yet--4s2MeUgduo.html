with mystery tech with a very special
guest Lamarr Wilson hi I'm on a
professional set oh well how appropriate
how how that you put the KFC one out
while I'm here what is this going on so
this is the KFC phone it's by oh it's by
Khloe only for sale and warranty in
mainland China Wow so we saw that here
so is this illegal so you actually have
any idea how much this costs short fifty
dollars okay sorry it's just a person
why don't you back up
no her doesn't want to kill anybody
maybe okay so this is a coupon for some
chickens wait actually I think it is so
if anyone can speak or especially read
Chinese please comment what this means
oh that's mark oh oh god I like this oh
that's pretty good-looking so it's got
the kernel here and it says 1987 that is
sexy all right I'll let you this is
literally finger licking good alright so
the next step is all sorry to fire up
the phone okay
normally you know oh that's the kernel
right there and you're looking good so
this isn't Android this is their this is
Android do it in Mui skin on top of an
pho but it does run Android okay alright
so we've got the kernel and uh actually
wait no that's a statue of the colonel
isn't it yeah and it's not even Saturday
this thing is a fake Oh actually it's a
Saturday in Chenery oh well see how the
KFC performs I see if it's original or
crispy hey that's actually a good one
Thank You Maegan i working on every one
three hours down sue got here oh wow
that's a little slow you know what
that's actually not bad though it's kind
of slimming
yeah I'm kind of diggin what that's
doing yeah it's it's the the beauty move
exactly so if you're looking for a KFC
phone this is the only option so
I'm ready right oh okay this is a very
mysterious box
wait wait it says happy unboxing on it
yeah calm box no wait we are excited hey
there's another box ooh okay this is a
very suspicious looking envelope I say
it is a movie a movie oh you think yes
and the movies ended so I think the idea
here is that this is something that you
put over the top of your trackpad so if
you want to be able to quickly put
numbers in it's also trackpad protection
apparently oh that's where you put it so
you can see if you put it on the tripod
I mean much perfectly fits and then you
have to like download some drivers to
make it work I guess so like the idea is
that you can actually immediately like
turn on and off like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
and use this too in certain numbers so
in theory if I press on this seven key
right now it will go to Lamarr Wilson's
channel so not good I don't understand
it's like literally just not doing
anything this is like I've calibrated it
like I've assigned shortcuts like hang
on wait wait let me just try one more
thing
so if I actually go into the calculator
will this actually work as numbers so if
I'm gonna say 1 2 3 okay
so short answer Savior $34 whoa wow that
was loud that was very loud
okay Advent and great raise so what I'm
assuming is that this is an incredibly
expensive bumper for the iPhone 10 so
you want to slide this going on okay
does it just like slide on like really
nervous about this sorry is it it's not
my phone okay it's Kim's phone it's fine
this is his fault anyway no he's just my
new friend now
okay alright so that's that's it that's
it and actually is it hold together it's
holding alright I will say the red
actually does look pretty nice I like
this the only problem is it comes in a
metal box which I know means this is
going to be wildly expensive from what
it is yes okay come on others 1666 zero
yeah I'm gonna say 150 it's probably a
good sign when the very first thing I
see in the Google search is great Advent
knock off so they have a whole series of
these this is the Advent titanium Oh
$645 no way oh this is pretty aerospace
grade titanium with a friction fit
assembly and an aluminum display case so
you know when you want to display your
645 dollar bumper for the iPhone if
we're being real here this actually does
feel nice right like no no it feels
great super nice but $645 is the most
insanely expensive iPhone case I've ever
seen I will rock-paper-scissors you for
this over here right now I am so baby
winner of the rock-paper-scissors get to
the $645 bumper so we go one two and
draw whatever yeah okay ready one two
three
all right more time one two three yeah
got me a new phone okay I'm sorry
all right this is something else that
looks like an Amazon books no no let's
let's let's do it the normal way oh come
on
I don't understand why something needs
to be wrapped like this I think I know
why because it is a massager we get
intelligent air pressure infrared
heating a point massager multi frequency
vibration and soothing music because it
can in fact download music alright well
we've got to try this thing
I just gave you a 600 $45 bumper so you
get to demo this now no I don't want to
be the guinea couple it's like a VR
headset what's the name of it is blow
Mikey um anyway good well like a brick
it alien are you ready no okay three way
to insurance Oh honestly the triple rub
I'm really liking the vibrating it
doesn't really do anything but I like
tough I like the sensation I think it's
my turn
no convince me no I like it now yeah
there we go oh that's what I wanted oh
yeah oh it's getting so hot to it like
legitimately feels that there's so much
heat on my face right now that's where
that is feel the heat because I'm
already how I think I turned it off oh
now it's like grabbing like my temple oh
yo this is it's weird but I actually
don't hate it
I know it's weird it's kind of its kind
of Awesome but like the temples I'm
really digging hey welcome
welcome back um okay so I massager
that's a thing I'm with the pavlok
insert the module into the wristband
pressing the lightning bolt to release
the zap wait what this is a shock collar
so this can pavlok is a wearable device
that helps users break bad habits using
classical stimulation techniques have
what ministers a slight negative
stimulus when a user doesn't unwanted
action so it's basically shock okay
three two one
Wow gonna be nyet is it dead or
something
