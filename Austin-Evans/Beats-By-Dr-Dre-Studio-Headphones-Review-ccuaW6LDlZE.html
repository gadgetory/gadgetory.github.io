the beats by dr. dre studio headphones
by monster so i do before we do anything
i do want to go ahead and give a big
thanks to monster for sending these
headphones out to me for free to review
so I've had these for a little while and
ready to give you guys my full review
okay so you just get quite a few
accessories inside the box I excuse me
it's not quite as nice as it was when it
first came the first thing you do is you
do get actually two ked two cables to go
ahead and connected so you know you plug
one end into your headphones one end
into your iPod or your computer whatever
so if you have a red pair as well as a
black pair
however the black pair actually does
have you guys as you can see here the
control talks you guys should go ahead
you know control your iPod with you know
just to click or as well as it also had
does have a microphone and we do have a
little little bit of information so I
should go ahead and pull it out here I
mean do have a little cleaning clause
which is definitely very nice is then to
provide and then we go ahead just pull a
couple extra things out here we do have
a couple of you know little leaflets
warranty information this just talks
about their other headphones so pretty
simple so let's go and just take all of
this out of the way and get to what the
most important thing obviously is which
is going to be the headphones themselves
come in this nice kind of understated
thing of course you know you don't
really want people to realize hey these
are your expensive headphones and steal
them so it's pretty nice that they kept
it pretty subtle here and once you open
it up you do get these studios
themselves okay so let's go and take a
look at some of the things I really
liked about these headphones so the
first was absolutely the build quality
as you guys can see here it they're all
pretty much every little bit of it is on
this you know a shiny black plastic
which nothing gives it a really nice
look and feel well of course it does
come in white as well but you know the
build quality was very very solid you
know you definitely felt like they could
take some abuse you know everything is
fairly flexible so you know especially
for you know it works for different
sizes heads but also you know if you
drop them or you know you had a little
bit of a mistake or whatever on they
definitely do feel like they could take
some abuse now as far as the comfort
goes these that was actually my favorite
think part of these headphones the
comfort was really second to none
so as you guys can see here you do have
a pad up top as well as the ear cups are
very very nicely cushioned I mean really
really nice and comfortable now I do
want to mention they are very very hefty
they you know they do have a very
substantial feel in the hand and as well
as on your head however I really like
that you know the you know it was just a
really nice experience as far as
especially you know you don't even need
to be listening to music and these still
do a lot of noise cancellation you know
so you need to chill for a few minutes
just put these on you only need to
listen to music and you know it will get
much quieter which is definitely
something I appreciated so there really
as far as when you have the build
quality and all that kind stuff goes
very very impressed however there were a
few kind of minor things I really wasn't
that impressed with so definitely the
main thing was is that these used
batteries uh yeah I mean I can
understand they do have great audio
quality and of course I will get to that
in a minute
but the fact that these used batteries
definitely did kind of it wasn't a deal
breaker by any means but it was kind of
annoying I'm so you guys can see you're
on the right side you do have a little
switch which turns them on and off and
that's very important to go ahead and
turn them off when you're not using them
and then over on this side you go ahead
just twist this and I was kind of a
little bit difficult to get out there
you I mean there we go you will see that
the two triple A batteries are here but
the problem was though is that well I
mean I guess I wouldn't mind this too
much as you know the batteries lasted
you know in weeks or months or whatever
but I pretty much I was able to go ahead
and get these from you know brand new to
almost dead in about five or six days
now that's not terrible considering that
was you know I was using these quite a
bit
however definitely not that great and
you know expected definitely I highly
highly will recommend go and pick up
some hair of her chargeable batteries
and these do use triple A's but you can
find some rechargeable triple A's or
maybe even already have them that
definitely would be a good thing so
that's definitely something to keep in
mind with these headphones now let's go
ahead get on to the meat and potatoes of
the review which obviously has to be the
sound quality you know you're not gonna
go ahead and spend you know hundreds of
dollars on that a pair of headphones if
they don't sound good and on that front
I have absolutely no complaints the
beats by dre studio headphones are very
very good sounding
you know one of the major things a lot
of people talk about is the bass and
it's absolutely here I was actually kind
of a funny story you know I first got
bees I was kind of listening to some
music I was listening to a song there's
really bass heavy and I know I was like
really enjoying the music and I kind of
leaned back on a wall well then I looked
over in a picture like a few feet away
from me on the wall started vibrating
which I thought was pretty funny because
I didn't even have them up that loud so
it definitely should give you a good
idea the bass on these are very powerful
and in general I mean it really sounds
great I mean you know one of them really
actually the unexpected things that will
I wasn't expecting was that these are
great directions listening to movies you
know it actually has a really rich
almost like a surround sound kind of
feel so you know after listening to you
know like some really kind of great
movies as far as the sound goes on you
know these definitely really really
impressed me now they don't really have
a whole lot of downsides as far as the
sound goes I mean everything is really
richly you know it done like I said
there's a lot of bass but you know the
bass doesn't overpower everything else
in the songs um however you know we're
really I just don't even have anything
to say dad about the audio quality I
mean of course you know there's always
little things you that you can improve
but you know that was that gets into
kind of you know where you're splitting
hairs I mean if you really want a
fantastic audio experience really like
listening to your music your movies
video games all that kind of stuff you
definitely will not be disappointed the
audio quality is really really fantastic
okay guys so that's it for my review of
the beats by dr. dre studio headphones
overall very very impressed you know
the audio quality was really really
solid and the comfort was fantastic and
I love the how comfortable these are you
know the fact that you know it uses
triple-a batteries that doesn't get that
great of battery life yeah kind of a
minor complaint although I don't really
think it's going to be that big a deal
in the end so if this looks good to you
I definitely don't hesitate to recommend
them they are fairly pricey but you do
get what you're pay for so if you're
interested I don't really hesitate to
recommend them at all they're very very
competent headphones and you know I
definitely have enjoyed my time with
them quite a bit so anyway guys thanks
for watching for another review
now the perspective on these headphones
definitely be sure to hit the annotation
on the screen right now will take you to
my good friend marques Brownlee's review
of these exact same headphones so if
you're interested in learning more you
can go ahead and take a look at his
review as well using these headphones I
found that they were extremely
comfortable this has been by far the
most comfortable easy to use pair of
headphones I've ever used up at the top
here this is a very soft foam you can
probably go to Best Buy and check these
out but this all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
