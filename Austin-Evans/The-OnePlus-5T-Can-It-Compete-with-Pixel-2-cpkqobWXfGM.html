delivering flagship performance at a
much lower price and that trend
continues with the brand new 5t you're
getting a lot of features from phones
like the iPhone 10 and Galaxy Note 8
except at about half the price but the
question is is it worth it
hey guys this is Austin I spent the last
week playing with the 1 + 5 t and there
is a lot to like compared to the already
solid 1 + 5 the most noticeable change
is with the screen gone is the old 5.5
inch panel and in its place is a much
taller 6 inch screen in the exact same
size - chassis sure it's bezels might
not be as thin as something like the
iPhone 10 but you're still getting a lot
more screen real estate with the
two-to-one aspect ratio it's a great
panel - well the resolution is a little
low at 2160 by 1080 it's still plenty
sharp to my eye
unlike the pixel 2 XL it's actually a
nice looking OLED display it looks nice
right out of the box but you have
several other screen modes including
srgb and DCI p3 which is my personal
favorite because you've got the larger
screen the capacitive keys are gone and
the fingerprint sensor has been moved
around back I'm totally fine with this
just like the pixel this feels like a
really natural spot for it the 5g does
add facial recognition and while it's
not in the same league is the iPhone 10
it's pretty quick although it's
definitely not perfectly accurate
unfortunately it's still running Android
7 but oxygen OS remains pretty close to
stock Android with basically no
bloatware there's a lot of great
customization options like rearranging
your on screen buttons and what things
like a long press will do as well as
tweaking the notification shade and
status bar to be exactly how you like
this is a great option if you really
want to tweak your phone which is why a
lot of people go with oneplus in the
first place the rest of the design looks
almost identical to the one plus 5 and
that's not really a bad thing you've got
the same almost too slippery aluminum
back with the addition of that
fingerprint sensor and amazingly for a
new flagship in 2017 a headphone jack
you're also getting solid performance
with a snapdragon 835 6 or 8 gigs of ram
and either 64 or 128 gigabytes of
storage this is backed up with a 3300
milliamp hour battery while not massive
with the lower res screen and oneplus is
super fast - charging it makes it pretty
easy to keep the phone topped off if
this feels like a classic s model update
- you
then you'd be right I can't fault one
Klaus for not totally overhauling the
phone the original one plus five was
really solid the issue was that it came
out only five months ago look I'm all
for pushing tech forward but it's kind
of ridiculous that a five month old
phone is already obsolete why didn't
they just make the 1 + 5 t the 1 + 5 in
the first place to be fair I feel the
same about the way that Samsung updates
the Galaxy S and note lines six months
later it seems like you just get a
slightly updated Galaxy s8 but at least
with the note you're getting some major
upgrades like the s-pen and dual cameras
this strategy kind of worked last year
with the 1 + 3 T but 2017 has proven to
be one of the most competitive years for
smartphones ever and nothing shows that
off better it's in the Google pixel - I
absolutely love this phone software
updates have improved the excel screen
but for me the standard pixel to check
so many boxes that it's basically the
gold standard put it side-by-side and
it's clear that the 1 + 5 t is a much
larger phone the smaller bezels
absolutely dwarfed the pixel twos 5 inch
display and having a headphone jack is a
real win for a lot of people the 5g
still only has a single downward firing
speaker which actually does get
reasonably loud and has some bass but it
just can't match the terrific stereo
speakers on the pixel the oneplus also
lacks any kind of waterproofing or
wireless charging know I can live
without these but knowing that the pixel
2 isn't afraid of getting wet is a big
selling point while oxygen OS is good as
far as skins go I can't get away from
just how great Android looks and feels
running on the pixel to emily has it had
Android Oreo since day one but it is
blisteringly fast I've said it before
and I'll say it again Google has worked
some real magic with this phone one area
where oneplus has really stepped it up
is in the camera department the main
wide-angle shooter is unchanged but
they've swapped the telephoto option for
a 20 megapixel secondary camera with
this same focal length on one hand this
is a downgrade as you don't get optical
zoom
however they're using the same camera to
improve low-light performance it works
side-by-side with the pixel it holds up
really well with noise although it can't
quite touch the pixel twos incredible
dynamic range they've gone for a
slightly punchy er more saturated look
which I think most people will like but
it comes to the expense of some detail
even looking a bit soft at times
you do have portrait mode on both and
while the five T does an adequate job I
really prefer the colors and that crazy
range of the pixel to my eye it looks
like a significantly more expensive
camera this is what 4k video looks like
only one plus five T so I think audio is
actually surprisingly decent and the
stabilization even though it's not
optical does a pretty good job of
keeping up the one plus five T is a
great phone when you consider the $500
price it's easy to reconsider that
Galaxy Note 8 or pixel to excel if you
can look past the screen though I think
these standard pixel two is worth every
penny of the one hundred and fifty
dollar price premium so what do you guys
think above the 1 + 5 t let me know in
the comments below and I will catch you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
