is Austin and welcome to yet another
Kent torments me with terrible products
video this time where I'm apparently
looking at pickles electronic yodeling
pickle yodelayheehoo says the pickle
should I ask how much this was $11 much
better than I was expecting
all right let's see what we get with our
crews remnants pickle this is a very
detailed looking pickle the Odin
Seraphin world's first projection mouse
ken do you realize that I actually had
ordered one of these already right not
even kidding this is actually a product
I wanted to do a video on anyway how
much was this 70 bucks oh I'm sorry
69 dollars to be very correct on my my
pricing here I've got to say after the
last one where I was wearing a pink suit
at this point in the video
much happier with my laser mouse oh yo
it totally works look at this so if I
swipe it with it it actually is totally
possible if I click whoa that actually
kind of works I mean it's not the
greatest tracking service in the world
but that's a laser mouse well I think
more specifically a laser trackpad but
still that actually is really cool you
know what I mean if I actually move a
little bit more quickly with this it's
pretty responsive I mean it's a little
bit inaccurate I think but I mean that
doesn't feel terrible
Oh even tap to click works dude this is
like a legitimate trackpad that just
happens to be a lazier next item please
you did not so for those who are not in
the know a little while ago this Super
Mario puzzle came out and what was so
special about it is that because it's
all red it's basically impossible to
actually put together plus
or educational challenging and fine yeah
challenging and fun when it's literally
impossible to put together oh boy that's
it's quite the bag so with a thousand
pieces on board you know this is gonna
be a fun time for all ages look at these
pieces they're all the exact same they
just have a little bit of a texture on
them I honestly think that uh this is
the extent of how uh how much this
puzzles gonna be put together all right
moving on all right I'm afraid to ask
what's next the BlackBerry leap how much
was this $75 for a BlackBerry okay not
exactly what I expected
starting blackberry 10 OS okay so it's
actually like at a legit original
blackberry I mean the harbor is not bad
I kind of like the sort of rubberized
finished on the back it's got a
headphone jack
hard to argue with that that's a rare
commodity these days as well as a pretty
impressive eight megapixel autofocus
camera on the back I got to say those
bezels are straight out of 2015 and that
looks very bizarre these days so we are
now inside blackberry 10 OS and I will
say this actually is aged pretty well I
mean sure the app support is well
minimal at this point but the actual
sort of interface help smooth everything
is it actually doesn't feel too far
behind if only you know Android wasn't a
thing but of course with an 8 megapixel
camera we're probably dealing with some
crispy images wow that's a lot of
shutter lag actually you know what
that's not that bad
all right the real test is going to be
the selfie though a little bit color a
full but I will give that a pass I'm
curious do you know how much this was
when it was brand new $275 well I mean
if you look at it like that this is a
relative bargain at only $75 today of
course you're gonna have to deal with
BlackBerry 10 OS which is basically dead
but I mean besides that the Edifier p84
won all right if it wants to obtain a
look at a new pair of headphones this
actually looks like a kind of reasonable
and not stupid thing to take a look at
well
first glance they're actually a little
lightweight maybe a little more
lightweight than I'd like
of course that's not the only thing that
matters I mean certain headphones will
put weights in their headphones just to
make them feel more hefty so you know no
I mean they passed the Hotel California
test now the soundstage isn't exactly
super wide which isn't really a big
surprise and there's not a ton of
clarity there I think there's definitely
little bit more bass than I would like
but they sound decent for $65 though I
will probably lean toward the status CB
ones which guys watch me videos you know
that I've recommended many many times
I'm excited what do we have Prince Hoss
what but this is very Japanese can did
you get this in Japan so the entire box
is basically in Japanese it looks like
something that you put your phone in and
then a picture comes out maybe I'm very
confused I'm just thinking in my head
right now right at what point where I
want to scan my screen and print it
versus just you know transfer a photo to
a printer I'm not gonna think about it
I'm just gonna see if this thing works
wait wait wait wait this isn't a scanner
this is like actually film inside isn't
it it is
Instax film inside wait wait wait wait
wait wait wait wait so you put your
phone on here you take a picture of the
screen and it will print out on Instax
film I guess so it's not even a printer
it's just a camera that takes pictures
of your phone screen one pack of minion
themed Instax film later let's actually
see if we can get this thing to work
look at this that looks much more
realistic and reasonable in the real
test is what am I going to print alright
here goes nothing
oh yeah there we go okay so the point
right now that's fine just let it sort
of bake here for a second develop is
what's uh the cool kids call it and
hopefully we see a picture of something
you know what that's actually not that
bad I mean yeah it's in stacked so it's
not going to look just quite as crystal
clear it's this wonderful pixel photo
that I have here one thing I will say is
that even though they say to crank your
phone up to max brightness so you have a
newer smartphone it actually might be a
little too much so gonna bring it down
just a little bit for the next one all
right shot number two this is obviously
a toy it's not like some super high-end
printer but I will say it's actually
kind of cool I mean stuff like Instax is
really fun anyway and the idea that you
can print photos on your phone instead
of just taking shots on a Cameron hoping
it works I can see this being something
a lot of people could be into so as
always links to check out all this stuff
including the print toss will be in the
description and I'm curious what do you
guys think about Ken's picks on this one
I gotta say I'm not in a bunny suit so
I'm not complaining so anyway let me
what you guys think in the comments
below and I will catch you on the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
