with the demo of the Microsoft Surface
RT tablet with a full sized USB 2.0 port
I got to thinking what exactly can we do
with it first off I grabbed a normal USB
flash drive and plugged it in surprise
surprise it works just fine and lets us
get at all our data I didn't have luck
with a USB 3.0 Drive but that may be a
hardware issue next I grabbed the
Logitech MX performance which is an
amazing mouse but Dez needs and drivers
plug the wireless receiver in and the
surface recognizes it no problem even
the additional buttons with that out of
the way hooking up a Razer BlackWidow
with no problem with zero lag at all as
I work with a ton of video next up I
wanted to try a 64 gigabyte SDXC card
with a normal USB card reader plug it in
and bam instant access to my 1080p
videos and 24 megapixel stills since
it's been working so well I decided to
see what happens if you plug an iPhone 5
in it immediately starts charging in the
driver installs cover pulling pictures
off doesn't quite work even though it
shows up still handy in a pinch though
plug in Nexus 7 in and the surface
recognizes it no problem and begin some
serious tablet section action since I
really haven't been able to stop it yet
how about we try a USB hub with the
mouse keyboard SD card reader and a blue
Yeti microphone hooked up the surface
powers them all from the single USB port
and they're all detected and working
fine I doubt anyone will ever use the
surface like this but it looks so
ridiculous I couldn't help but do it the
surface can do more than just plug a ton
of USB devices in though flash works
fine an internet explorer which
amazingly enough actually isn't bad and
multitasking and a switching is leagues
ahead of any other tablet out there it's
not perfect but I've been having a lot
of fun with the surface so far if you
enjoyed be sure to hit that like button
if you're interested in my unboxing and
review you can check out my full
thoughts on the surface here anyway I
will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
