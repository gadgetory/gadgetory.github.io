what to expect in next week's Apple iPad
2 event so you don't already know Apple
today send out the press invites for
their iPad 2 event coming March 2nd
which of course is one week from today
now before I get into all my predictions
and what to expect I just gotta give you
guys a quick update I'm not going to be
live-streaming the event however if you
are interested and seeing what the you
know the blow-by-blow exactly as it
happened you can follow me on Facebook
and/or Twitter my Twitter is just Duncan
330 303 and my facebook I'll have the
links down there so if you guys are at
work at school whatever and you can't
watch the event live you can go ahead
and follow me up and I'll be tweeting
live updates just continuously anyway so
so what we can expect to see I again
like I said - nobody surprise is going
to be the iPad to the current iPad is
done tremendously well however it's
really starting to look out class there
are a huge variety of other tablets such
as the zoom the playbook the touchpad I
mean there's lots of really really good
looking tablets that are coming out
right now so this is Apple the
opportunity to step it up by increasing
your the specs
I'm your add new features not like kind
of stuff so what I definitely expect to
see is an upgraded processor almost
definitely a dual core processor
probably like the Apple a5 or I know
what they decide to call it but most
likely either a 1 or 1.2 gigahertz
dual-core processor hopefully about a
gigabyte of RAM maybe 512 megabytes but
at any rate should have a substantial
boost in RAM now some of the other
things about it I does seem like it will
have the same size and then basically
the same display so we're not going to
be seeing any Retina display as far as I
know which a little bit this morning but
to be honest the current iPad display is
pretty good now it should be the overall
design should be redesigned a bit now
don't expect a huge you know just rework
just know they're gonna throw it all out
it's just going to be some moderate
upgrades so it should be a thinner I'm
if you guys know about the iPod Touch
4th generation as they when they
redesign that I expect to see a very
similar in design for the iPad make a
little bit thinner and make the edges
more taper it also should have both the
front and rear facing cameras so the
front facing camera should just be VGA
quality for FaceTime and the rear facing
camera will most likely also be from the
iPod touch should be about 720p although
it won't be really that great for
teachers and stuff but for FaceTime and
that sort of thing that should do the
trick very well now a lot of the leaks
we've seen actually seem to indicate
that the iPad is going to have a lot
more options so of course going to have
the 30-pin dock connector all of your
standard buttons however it very well
also might have a speaker which is
something of course the current iPad
action has pretty good speakers got some
good sound but I'm very well might have
better sound an addition also might have
a new port called light peak but perhaps
Thunderbolt so this is something
interesting that we've only just now
been hearing about Apple and Intel have
been working together on a new sort of
thing similar like USB except much much
faster called light peak well now
there's a lot of talk about it actually
being available and the new MacBook Pros
coming out in a few days and if it's
there I would not be surprised
whatsoever if we actually do see it in
the iPad so there might be definitely
something to watch for anyway guys
that's it for all of our predictions of
course do keep an eye out for next
Wednesday the Union check all I have all
the different time zones for when it
begins of course you follow me on
Facebook or Twitter to be the live
updates anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
