while but I am officially back with a
brand new gaming PC build meet the
photon 4.0 the last year has been a
really really rough one for building a
computer thanks to a crypto mining it
has been incredibly difficult to get
your hands on graphics cards especially
the ones that most people want to put in
gaming builds when you can find them
they're incredibly expensive more often
than not they're just going to be
completely out of stock then to make
things even worse other components have
also been driven up in price so high in
power supplies are really expensive
right now and memory is especially bad
with a lot of prices going for about
double the price that they were last
year put all of this together and it has
been really difficult to recommend any
kind of new build well at least until
now thankfully that changes today with
the launch of AMD's new Rison processors
with vega graphics now know this is not
a sponsored video however AMD did send
out a little press kit including both
Verizon 3 as well as rising 5 I mean
Verizon 3 and rising 5 the rise in 320
200 G is going to give you 4 rise in CPU
cores 3 an clock up to 3.7 gigahertz as
well as 8 Vega GPU cores very similar to
the rise in mobile laptop that I
recently reviewed not only $100
this guy looks to be a pretty good
performance bargain especially
considering that what those kind of
specs some names are going to be
playable even at 1080p however for this
build we're going to be going with you
risin 5 2400 G now this adds
hyper-threading to the quad core
processor bring the thread count up to 8
and you're also going to be getting a
clock speed of nearly 4 gigahertz almost
more importantly for gaming the Vega GPU
course has been bumped up from 8 to 11
on this guy though this does come with a
hefty or 170 dollar price tag which in
context makes rising three looks like a
pretty good deal however because this
build we're going to go it a little bit
higher end we decided to go with you
risin 5 2400 G for the rest of the build
we're using 16 gigabytes of g.skill
flair X ddr4 memory now in a super-fast
3200 megahertz clock speed this is
specifically meant to work with Rison
and that extra of power is going to be
super helpful if you have a rise in APU
however at a price on Amazon right now
of over 260 dollars this is probably not
the best idea to pair with your $170
processor instead I do tune this memory
to run at
66 megahertz to simulate running a much
more reasonable $100 HyperX fury X kit
which is going to have eight gigs of RAM
I will say though that if you're looking
to pick up a risin with Vega chip make
sure that at the very least you get some
reasonably fast dual channel memory
those graphics definitely need some
memory to be fed at this point it's hard
not to notice our slightly unusual case
pick so this is the thermaltake core p1
and uh yeah it's a little different what
we usually do here especially for budget
builds with a solid piece of tempered
glass upfront it looks really nice of
course it's not going to be the most
practical system with the entire sides
being open however it does mean that you
have a lot of different mounting options
including on this feat you can even put
this on a wall now because we're using a
Rison apu there's actually plenty of
space here because we're not installing
the graphics card however if you do want
to do that there is an included riser
cable where you can just drop it in so
for example if you want to upgrade later
down the road you're set for the
motherboard we're using the MSI be 350
Pro AC now this actually isn't out yet
so I don't have the final price but it
is a pretty loaded little board so
addition to full support for a rise in
APU including overclocking you're also
getting RGB you have into a Wi-Fi built
and there's also a full size DisplayPort
which means that especially for a be 350
board you're getting a lot of features
storage is being handled by a 500
gigabyte WD blue SSD now if use these in
a few previous builds and I like the
price to reliability however one of the
nice things about this guy is that is
available in an m2 form factor which
especially for a CLE build like this
means that we can actually stick it on
the back of the motherboard to make the
cabling even nicer
even though power supplies you guys will
see leaves a little bit to be desired
for that power supply we're using a 500
watt EVGA bronze unit now there's
nothing really wrong with it I've used a
lot of these in builds they're gonna
last a while and they're fairly quiet
however it's not a modular supply which
even though it is a little bit cheaper
means that your cabling is going to be a
little bit challenged in this guy
thankfully though especially on the back
side of this thermal tech case there's a
fair bit of room to be able to run some
stuff so you've got the cleanest thing
in the world it'll work with a system
like this especially if you're going
with a Rison APU a game
a lot of people are probably going to
want to play is csgo now here with high
settings at 1080p as I died we're
getting a pretty respectable 50 to 60
frames per second it's one of the nice
things is because we are using a free
sync high refresh rate monitor if we do
want to turn the graphics settings down
to something like medium we couldn't
theory take advantage of that full 120
parts refresh rate this is a bad idea I
want to do this movie owner rocket
League and other games I think a lot of
people would play on a system like this
getting high quality settings at 1080p
with a pretty solid frame rate of
between 40 to 50 just like csgo if you
do like that higher frame rate over oh
come on get it get it yeah
if you do want to get that higher frame
rate all you need to do is you create
the graphics settings down a little bit
and you can easily get well over 60 and
pre-much all of these games oh that was
that one that guy it's funny I've done a
lot of videos on super budget systems
lately it's nice to see what rocket
League looks like when you actually
create the graphics up right on low all
the time trying to get it to run on like
$2 laptops moving on we have grand theft
auto 5 now here running on normal
settings at 1080p we're between 40 to 50
frames per second now the smoothest
thing in the world but GTA 5 even for an
older game does run reasonably well
however what I'm really curious about is
how Rison especially with those Vega GPU
cores are going to handle any more
modern games when it comes to Middle
Earth shadow of war we're dealing with a
much more demanding game so here at 720p
on medium settings we're getting between
35 to 40 frames per second it's totally
playable but when you get into those
newer triple-a titles the graphics
settings are definitely gonna have to
come down so how does rise in with Vegas
stack up for the most part pretty well
you're getting a solid CPU or on with
decent graphics now if you're only doing
lighter titles it's totally fine but if
you want to get into more hardcore
gaming at some point you probably do
want to add a graphics card to this guy
with the photon 4.0 itself there's a lot
of room for expansion it already has a
really cool case but there's lots of
room in here to add that liquid cooling
overclock your processor add a graphics
card more drives this guy's pretty much
the limit considering where the PC
market is today I'm pretty happy with
how the photon 4.0 came out it's a
unique looking system that won't break
the bank so as always links just check
out all the parts you guys need to build
this will be in the description and
something else you might want to check
out is my 2018 gaming PC tutorial where
I show how to build everything here
although on a slightly different case so
feel free to go check that out over here
and I will catch you guys in the next
