iMac worth it from the outside things
look basically identical that's not
necessarily a bad thing though the iMac
is one sexy-looking computer it's all
aluminum and for most angles it looks
crazy thin only when you look at it from
the back can you see where everything is
hidden this is where you'll find the
exhaust and the ports which include
Ethernet a couple Thunderbolt ports for
USB 3.0 an SD card reader and headphone
jack
having the ports tucked around back
looks nice but it's not the most
convenient way to access things you
basically have to spend the iMac around
every time you want to plug something in
the speakers were hidden on the bottom
and sound surprisingly solid paired with
the decent magic keyboard and still
annoying Magic Mouse - that comes with
it you can really get away with just
plugging a power cable into the iMac and
calling it a day it has a fairly large
bezel but there's no denying that this
is a nice looking computer the real star
of the show here is that new 4k display
there's no other way of putting this
this is a terrific screen with an
expanded P three color gamut it might
not come through on YouTube but the new
display looks awesome it has great
contrast and solid viewing angles but
the real draw is that crispy resolution
coming in at 4096 by 23:04 it's actually
higher resolution than standard 4k video
on a 21 inch screen this comes out to an
impressive 218 pixels per inch which is
just as sharp as retina MacBook screens
OS 10 does a great job of scaling to
give you what looks like at a AP screen
but with four actual pixels making up
each pixel of screen real estate you can
also use this to scale your resolution
up to 1440p if you like this display
would cost a fortune on its own which
makes this iMac actually reasonably
priced for a change inside we're looking
at a quad-core Broadwell Core i5 that's
clocked at 3.1 gigahertz iris pro
graphics 6200 and eight gigabytes of
memory while dedicated graphics might
not be ideal in a 4k desktop intel's
iris pro 6200 graphics are surprisingly
up to the task for normal use in El
Capitan things are nice and smooth even
while multitasking and you can even do a
bit of gaming if you install a copy of
Windows via boot camp you'll find that
grand theft auto 5 is playable on normal
settings 1080p and lighter titles like
rocket League will also work at 1080p on
medium it's absolutely not a gaming PC
but if you want to play a few games the
4k iMac handles itself pretty well
unfortunately there's a weak link and
that's the storage the base model comes
with a seriously slow one terabyte 5400
rpm
hard drive this is just not acceptable
on a high-end computer in 2015
normal tasks they're nearly instant on
an SSD equipped computer are a test of
your patience on the iMac and while you
can't upgrade to a fusion drive or a
pure SSD that's going to jump up the
price significantly there's no easy way
of upgrading the storage yourself and
the RAM is soldered down so if you want
to upgrade you better do it before
buying the 4k iMac fits an awesome
display in an impressively designed
all-in-one for some the screen alone
will be worth the price but once you
upgrade the base hard drive spend a
little more to upgrade to the 27-inch
iMac is probably worth it so what do you
guys think about the 4k iMac let me know
in the comments below and I will catch
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
