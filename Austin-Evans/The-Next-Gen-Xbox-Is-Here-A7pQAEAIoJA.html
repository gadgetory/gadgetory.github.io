Xbox finally has their next
generation, Project Scarlett.
So first of all let's talk specs,
inside there is going to
be another AMD based APU.
It has their latest Zen 2 core
as well as they have Navi graphics.
This is going to give it a huge
leap in two different areas.
First of all the CPU on the
Xbox One as well as the PS4
is notoriously weak,
it's a Jaguar based CPU,
it's really meant for
like mobile applications,
super, super underpowered.
So the fact that these new consoles
are getting a huge CPU bump
are going to bring them much, much closer
to what the PC is capable of.
The other aspect is the graphics.
So with Navi graphics on board
this will not only support 8K,
although that'll most likely be for video,
but importantly it does support 4K
at a full 120 frames per second.
That paired with the
variable refresh display
means that you can actually get
some proper PC like graphics
out of the brand new Xbox,
as well as of course the brand new PS5,
as again, all these specs are literally
identical as far as I can tell.
Jacques, are you ready to buy
an Xbox Project Scarlett?
- I am ready to buy an Xbox (mumbles)
- [Austin] It will be $800, are you ready?
- $800?
- I just made that up.
- Yes, I'll buy one for $8.
I think it should be $499,
that's what I'm gonna call.
I'm gonna call $499 in 2020 and,
it comes with a fancy box as well.
- An Xbox some might say.
So there's no doubt that this
thing is going to be pricey
but there are a lot of other
cool features on board.
So it does support GDDR6,
not a huge surprise,
as well as it does support ray-tracing.
Now this is actually one area
where Sony wasn't super clear
on what exactly they're
doing with the ray-tracing
but it should be nice to see exactly
that we are getting this on the
next generation of consoles.
Again, we're seeing very much
that same level of PC spec
just coming over to the
console side of things.
Now Project Scarlett, and to be fair
that's probably not going
to be the final name
when it actually ships next year,
is very much an evolution
of what we've seen
with the Xbox One as well as the PS4.
It's an AMD based CPU
architecture, GPU architecture,
basically just essentially
it's just a PC in a box
but the cool part about this one
is that we're actually seeing
a huge leap on both fronts.
Last time we had good graphics
but the CPUs really let it down.
And something else that has let
the current generation of
consoles down is the storage.
So right now we have hard
drives across the board,
however both the PS5 as
well as Project Scarlett
will ship with an SSD.
This is probably the second biggest thing
behind the CPU jump in that
not only are load times
going to be significantly shorter,
but on top of that we're
going to be able to see
bigger, wider worlds that
can load very quickly, right?
Real question.
- Yes?
- How much is the
next-gen Xbox gonna cost?
[Jeopardy music]
- I'm gonna go with...
[Jeopardy music]
$500.
- $500.
All right, all right,
I can get behind that.
No, for real though,
$500 sounds about right.
- Competitive, yeah.
'Cause PlayStation is probably
to be six, if not higher.
- I feel like they're gonna be
the same spec and probably same price.
I don't know, to me these two consoles
feel incredibly similar.
- I think Xbox is more
willing take the loss
for the sake of competition.
- Well another thing they did announce
is that this new Xbox is
four times more powerful
than the Xbox One X.
As far as gameplay goes
we did get to take a look
at Halo Infinite which
will be a launch title
for the brand new Xbox Scarlett.
Now I've got to say that
this looked awesome, right,
I mean, simple things
like the depth of field
was incredibly high quality,
the textures were so detailed,
and the fact this is
going to be a launch title
means that we are, I'm
just, I'm excited, man.
It's finally time for new gen of consoles.
In fact, I actually have, like
literally my very first E3
was actually when they
announced the Xbox One
so I feel like it's a
full circle kind of thing.
Hi.
- The highlight, oh,
hello, Starbucks nearby.
- You're like ready for this right now.
- I always place an order
at the end of the Xbox press conference
and then I go and everything's ready.
- All right.
- That's the end of my story.
- So how much do you think
the Xbox Scarlett will cost?
- I thought you were gonna ask
me how much was the Mac Pro.
(laughs)
- Wrong, that was last
week, come on, get with it.
- I think probably like
$700, maybe, do you think?
You can't make it to high
but you can, you know,
I don't know, is that too much?
- My guess is probably
somewhere between $400 to $600,
probably leaning towards $500 to $600.
- Yeah, I think that's fair.
- They also talked a
lot about cloud gaming
and how this is going to impact Scarlett.
So on top of their xCloud service
which they've talked about in the past,
it's very similar to
something like PlayStation Now
where you can stream Xbox
games pretty much anywhere.
On top of that you actually
don't even have to necessarily
pay Microsoft for it because
if you already have an Xbox One
you can use that to stream
no matter where you are.
Now this is of course
going to be very dependent on the internet
but it's a really cool feature.
They're also expanding
Xbox Game Pass to PC.
So for $10 a month you get access to
somewhere in the neighborhood
of about 100 games
and the cool part about it
is that there's also an additional
Xbox Game Pass Ultimate feature
which will be $15 a month
but includes Xbox Game Pass
for Xbox, PC, and Xbox Live.
I swear just said the word Xbox 12 times
in that one sentence.
Okay, so I'm asking a literally
everyone this question,
how much will Scarlett cost?
- I feel like Microsoft
won't go crazy high
'cause we saw what
happened with the Xbox One.
I'd be surprised, I'd say $500 to $600.
If it were higher than that,
even five to six is like pushing it.
I'm hoping five, if
it's six that's the max.
- When you figure the
One X right now is $500
and you're adding an SSD,
which is going to be very expensive,
brand new CPU, GPU, ray-tracing,
all that kind of fun stuff,
I think $500 is to me
probably close to the floor.
- Yeah, no, I think that'd be great.
If people expect, if, I don't know,
if they price it any higher
people are just gonna,
you know people, they're gonna be upset.
- People, getting upset on the
internet since forever ago.
Microsoft also announced
a brand-new version
of the Elite Controller.
So there are a lot of small
but important improvements.
So it finally has a rechargeable battery
that's built in, which
you don't have to pay for,
so that's nice, it has
Bluetooth, it has USB-C,
and the entire controller's
basically been renovated.
Renovated, redesigned?
It's probably a better term.
So not only do have adjustable sticks,
you have more options for
customization, you have new grips,
this thing actually looks pretty dope
but I actually don't think
we have a release date yet,
it's soon, I think.
To me, E3 this Xbox
seems very much focused
on not only the next
generation of consoles
but importantly on the games
that will actually be run there
because put simply, these consoles
are going to be very similar, right,
the games are going to
be the differentiator
and Microsoft is the
company with a lot of money
and they're not afraid
to use it to buy studios
such as Double Fine which
they announced today
to make sure they are
really staying on top
of this next generation of consoles.
I mean, Phil Spencer put it very clearly,
this next console is about
gaming, it's not about Kinect,
it's not about video, it's
not about any of that stuff,
it is about making sure
this is one of the best
places to play games
and from what I've seen so far
it looks like they've done a great job,
this is super, super exciting.
Now, mind you, we have no
price or what it looks like
or what makes this any different than PS5,
but I do know this, make sure to subscribe
for the next five years
of console comparisons.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
