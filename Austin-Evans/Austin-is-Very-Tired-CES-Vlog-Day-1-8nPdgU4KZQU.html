of fun you see my fun face it's been a
long day so my original plan was I would
be in Las Vegas right now I would be
blogging through you guys would be nice
sunny warm I'd be hanging out with a
bunch of friends I had like a dinner and
all kinds of stuff tonight planned
what's actually happened is I am stuck
in lost or black Las Vegas I'm stuck in
Chicago buried underneath a ton of snow
so yeah not quite how I planned the day
to go so what happened was I left my
house I went to the airport heading off
to Las Vegas for CES I got to Chicago
which is where my connecting flight was
got on the plane everything was fine and
then they kicked me off the plane like
legit got kicked off the plane I think
what happened was there was a flight
crew and they took priority over like I
think six or seven of us on the plane so
they kicked us off the plane they let
the flight crew on and they did give me
a hotel room so at least I'm not stuck
in an airport but uh I've been a long
day so um normally it would actually be
that big of a deal because what they'll
do is they'll just say okay well you'll
get on the next flight or standby or
something but all the flights are booked
and lots of are getting cancelled right
now because Chicago it was had a ton of
snow the other day and it's snowing
right now he's supposed to be like minus
15 tomorrow night cold and snow and so
lots of stuffs getting canceled so I
should be hanging out in Las Vegas right
now but I'm not so I'm gonna go sleep in
that bed and you'll eat some more TGIF
Friday's drinks more sprite and enjoy
some really really terrible hotel Wi-Fi
please and oh good news and bad news so
the good news is my flight is still on
time
oh there's so much snow absolutely
everywhere it's okay there is an entire
army out there that is insane
but everything's flying so I'm not
complaining too much seriously this goes
on and on and on and on and on and on
yeah I'm here yeah sight man yeah I'm
tired of you the most boring vlog ever
just like Austin is very tired period
anyway so I'm finally here I'm in Vegas
I checked to the hotel room that little
four hour flight turned into eight hours
because of all the snow which you know
whatever I'm here so yeah so I pretty
much missed everything I originally
planned to do today but tomorrow is
pressed a so there's gonna be more to do
so yeah not the end of the world so I
think I'm gonna go grab some dinner and
not sleep even though I want to a lot
okay so I guess I'm balding now hi guys
so I have film food
is very very nice it beats me
peanuts all day from the airline
so his I got other care personnel so
I'll be sewing I'm afraid to turn it
around I think you should just take me
out I'll take okay so who decide to
steal my camera oh ah hi who are you so
you taking attention away for yeah I was
just
anyway this is my friend Amy so we're
hanging out having dinner enjoying not
being stuck in a hotel room or an
airport or something that's terrible and
awful and
so CS press day is tomorrow right that's
pretty much are you going of doing that
all day long or do it in the morning
well I'm going to the IAW TV Awards
today until later in the evening but
definitely across during the morning
yeah I definitely want to see Marissa
Mayer yeah go girl
Coquina so scary it is really heavy it's
like it's like you gotta hold it out
because now I got a super wide lens yeah
way out there
but yeah so it's pretty much pressed day
all day and then the real madness
okay anyways so yeah fun but after
flying you being stuck and snowed in
this is a great way to finish the day
hanging out kind of walking along the
strip and kind of relaxing a little bit
so we've been catching up yeah cuz last
time VidCon yeah yeah yeah so
oh yeah yeah yeah it definitely states
so where can they find you just so that
everyone can go and spam you with
subscriptions there we go because
they're not married at least it's not
like how true meringue at how many
threes are in your name so it's not the
end of the world
very true anyway so everybody else is it
yes I'm Valen I like I stopped sucking
I'm gonna vote some tomorrow and used to
talking to a camera that's being held on
we're right
make sure your thing I had to be one of
your videos guys is gonna be better and
I was in tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
