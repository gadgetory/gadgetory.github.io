here with a review of the meze 66
classics headphones with wooden ear cups
a very portable on-ear design and a
punchy sound let's take a look first of
all let's go over the build quality the
66 classics are mostly made out of
plastic but they're coated in a soft
touch rubber finish and they're fairly
flexible so durability doesn't seem to
be a major issue the start of the show
here are the two real wood ear cups
which not only have a great finish but
really give these a unique look the
padding is fairly soft but as these are
on your headphones they aren't going to
be as comfortable for all-day use like
over ear headphones can be on the flip
side you get a pair of cans which are
very easy to fold up making them great
for travel especially considering how
lightweight they are the headband is
also adjustable allowing you to resize
the headphones to fit snugly on your
head the included cable is detachable
which is good to see as if there's ever
a problem you can just swap the cable
out instead of buying an all new pair of
headphones it's great to have style but
if you don't have the audio quality to
back it up it doesn't matter so much
does it thanks to the clothes design the
base is quite good on the 66 classics
however the separation between
instruments tends to be a bit muddy the
soundstage is all right however they do
deliver a punchy focused sound they tend
to be a bit on the warm side but it's a
very pleasant sound signature that
really started to grow on me the more I
listened switching over to using a Pheo
eat n USB amp makes the headphones come
alive the base becomes a lot richer and
the warm sound becomes even more
distinctive for two hundred twenty
dollars the meze 66 classics provides
some serious style purely speaking from
the sound point of view their unique but
not without some issues take them as a
whole hell over and you've got yourself
a pretty decent pair of very
good-looking headphones if you're
interested in more feel free to check
out my coverage of CES 2013 here and if
you enjoy be sure to head out that like
button and subscribe anyway I will catch
you guys next time steam is kind of
touched back here in south hall and
their only meeting with partners so
we're not allowed in but you guys can
definitely see behind me there's a lot
of stuff set up so there's some normal
looking gaming computers are also some
kind of interesting looking console hard
to tell exactly what they are</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
