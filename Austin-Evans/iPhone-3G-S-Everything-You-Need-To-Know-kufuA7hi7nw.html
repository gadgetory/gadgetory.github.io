today I have a full wrap-up on the
iPhone 3GS I'm sure everyone knows the
iPhone 3 just snow I mean everybody
that's that's something but I won't
going to go in-depth I'm going to go as
spend a few days most suspects around
all the pricing and a lot of the pros
and cons around so I'm going to try to
go over as many as I can and I try to
help you guys out and decide if you want
to go ahead and buy one or not so let's
get this one started
okay guys so as everyone knows iPhone
3GS was announced and showing all kinds
of new features such as the new camera
with video recording much faster specs
all kinds of stuff I'm going to go over
some of it try to help you guys out and
see if you want to go ahead and upgrade
or not now I'll go ahead and run through
some some of the base features just in
case you don't know it's going to be
available and this is the subsidized
surprised the which everyone's talking
about this is the price that if you're a
brand new customer whether or not if you
have a through iPhone 3G or you're
currently under contract anyway so the
iPhone 3GS will be available in 16
gigabyte version for $199 and 32
gigabyte version for $299 which is very
similar to the iPhone 3G except it's got
momentum obviously more memory 16 and 32
compared to 8 and 16 now I'm going to go
into some of the well some of the more
just wrap up um now I will say this is
not a hard person confirmed but I would
definitely bet on it um there's a
there's a leak I guess a couple days ago
basically it's from t-mobile basically
said that the CPU and RAM or big really
ramped up basically the rant the RAM was
doubled from 128 206 and the processor
was from 400 to 600 megahertz that's a
big deal AT&amp;amp;T I mean I had been talking
that obviously that the iPhone will be 2
times faster than all this and when you
see those kind of specs that definitely
does it does make sense um that's kind
of in line with what I was thinking um
so I guess I was right hahaha anyway
okay so let me just go through some of
the things um I'm had a couple questions
and we're gonna try answers me as I
can't well one was what is the S stand
for the S stands for speed I'm not the
best name in my opinion but hey whatever
yes it is the I
phone 3G s or the 3G speed I don't think
anybody would call that but you know
that's what it stands for to get the new
processor like I said it's basically
about 50% faster apple claims it's up to
two times faster than the 3G is here
launching messages is like over two
times faster loading the New York Times
and Safari is almost reaches pattern Oh
it loads SimCity like two times faster I
believe and it also consumes less power
which is good because the battery life
is up that was one thing I was really
surprised about
it's got obviously battery technologies
continuing to evolve and it gets better
and better
but what I was surprised at is what I
was surprised at was that it's got much
better all the better processor better
memory and generally a more upgraded
specs and then it's got much better
battery life than 3G so I thought that
was very cool because I the iPhone both
iPhone and iPod have kind of poor
battery life so adding a couple extra
hours is a pretty big deal anyway okay
let me get into one of the bigger things
probably
well between not quite as big as a
processor in my opinion but still very
big is the camera increase that
increased the megapixels from two to
three which three is not bad I mean I've
my I have an old digital camera that has
three in things you can get that in a
cell phone that's like what half an inch
thick that's that's pretty cool let me
run through some of things it's got
autofocus auto exposure and auto white
balance now those are pretty important
they're not I mean absolutely
necessities I mean you could take okay
pictures with the normal two pixel two
megapixel camera on the iPhone 3G but
believe me you're looking at some of
these pictures that have been taken and
just knowing these specs this this is
going to take some really nice pictures
I think like digital cameras I mean very
very nice one of my really pretty cool
things is that you can tap to focus and
that's pretty cool I think because
instead of having to mess around once
you know
maybe some menu whatever Apple kept it
nice and clean just tap it good it's got
special macro in low light modes low
lights a big deal because obviously 3G
had a kind of didn't take that great
night pictures a lot of time and then it
has a photo and geotech video taken
photo and video geo-tagging as a
mouthful anyway and then the main thing
is video and it from what I've seen they
showed a little bit of video and I
looking at the specs on it looks pretty
good with the 3GS the cameras going to
be more optimized for it it's going to
shoot nice 30 frames per second with the
same auto focus auto white balance and
auto exposure as the normal camera it's
going to be very cool my one of my
favorite things actually that I was not
expecting at all was actually you can
edit and well it's slightly misleading
you're basically just trimming it but
that's still a very cool thing that you
can do automatically on your device just
by twisting and pinching everything now
one of the bigger things was is that the
graphics are going to be very improved
with between the upgrade Ram which I'm
really excited about having extra RAM
because you always run into memory run
out of memory running that memory and
because all the applications are made to
run 128 megabytes of RAM when you put it
on a device with 256 I doubt that until
the applications really start being
optimized for the 3GS I bet that every
all these applications you won't see any
memory freezing glitching besides what
would be normally so that's a really
cool thing um it's going to have some
new 3d graphics support which will mean
much faster and some really nice-looking
3d games um now there are some slight
problems with that because if they
really optimized 3GS obviously it might
work for the 3G or look worse or so it
depends on it probably a little while
before people really start just
forgetting the three gene putting it all
on the 3GS then one thing I'll go over
real quick
everybody's both seeing it the design um
I really wasn't expecting a whole lot of
change in the design but there was no
change I'm I mean there was a very
slight change but it's not I mean it
looks almost identical I mean you can
look at a picture of a 3G and 3GS and
it'll take you a while to tell apart
which I don't know the iPhone is very
recognizable people look at it go oh
that's knife owned so I understand they
want to change a lot but I don't know
anyway I'm just run over a couple of
special features just really quickly
it's got a Magna meter compass which
basically you will have compass you have
a compass application and Google Maps
will let you change your orientation got
voice control which is very cool feature
that you can just speak to it say I want
to listen to Green Day and it will start
playing Green Day same with calls all
kinds of stuff that should be cool
provided it works pretty well
Nike Plus support Nats I was expecting
that and then you can zoom in on text
invert video and then voice over
whenever you touch whatever is on the
screen that's nice just because it's it
adds some accessibility to it that
really wasn't there before I'll run over
the battery life a couple of the specs
real quick with the 3G you had six hours
of Internet over Wi-Fi the 3GS is nine
hours video seven now 10 24 hours of
audio compared to 30 and 2g talktime 10
hours compared to 12 for whatever reason
the 3G talktime is that same at five
hours I totally don't get that because
you would think that with the bigger
battery and everything so maybe it's got
a more powerful 3G antenna actually does
but I guess it takes more power or
whatever anyway now I won't get into the
whole pricing a lot of people really mad
about that what I'll do is in the
description look there's a really great
video by John for Lakers check that out
he totally explains it very nicely
um I agree 100% I won't even begin to
get into it just go watch that video and
he really does it nicely well that's
just about my my wrap-up of the 3GS
definitely stay tuned I will have more
videos it will be coming out here very
soon so on June 19th so definitely watch
out for more videos and I will be
talking about it and yeah
