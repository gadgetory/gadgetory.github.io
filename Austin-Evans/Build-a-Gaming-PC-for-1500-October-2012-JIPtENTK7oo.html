here with a gaming bill for $1,500 now
for this kind of money you're going to
be getting some serious performance now
like you played pretty much any game you
throw at it at 1080p or even 1440p
you're also going to be able to get some
very high frame rates probably at least
60 on most games and you can also turn
pretty much any kind of graphic setting
you want all the way up if you're
interested more I have built all blade
from $400 for 3000 and you guys can
check them out right here and on top of
that if you've never built a computer
before I've done a full series showing
you exactly step-by-step how to do it so
even if this is your first computer
build shouldn't be any problem to get
your build off win be using an Intel
Core i5 35 70 K processor now a lot of
people think that if you're doing a
gaming build you have to have a core i7
however that's not the case at all in
fact the core i7 really isn't going to
give you any better performance in games
sure you may get a couple frames here
and there but considering it's about
$100 more you can get a lot more
performance if you put that money in
other places the Core i5 is a quad core
chip clocked at 3 point 4 gigahertz
however since it's a K series part that
means overclocking is gonna be super
easy
so 42 Hertz is something that absolutely
anyone can get and with this build
you're probably gonna be looking
something more like 4.5 converts once
you get fully overclocked for about $220
this is an excellent start for our build
for CPU cooler we're going to be using a
corsair hae liquid cooler now water
cooling in computers that a lot of times
really expensive and really complicated
so you're going to have to get a
reservoir you're gonna have to get a
pump we're going to get tubing you have
to forget all the fittings you have to
figure out where everything goes and
there's kind of a bit of a mess however
this is gonna be a lot simpler as it's a
fully contained unit so basically all
you need to do is put it on your CPU and
go ahead and mount it in the back of
your case it's gonna be no problem and
on top of that of course since it is a
water cooling you're gonna get some
really really nice performance out of
your CPU for about $80 this is going to
be a great way to go for a graphics card
we're going to be using an EVGA GTX 680
superclocked now in my opinion the GTX
680 is the best single GPU card that you
can buy now you could go with an AMD
Radeon 7970 gigahertz Edition which will
give you similar levels of performance
however the 680 is going to run cooler
it's going to run quieter it's gonna
take up less power while doing it as the
heart of our billet you're going to find
two gigabytes of gddr5 memory which
going to be plenty for any game out
there right now and on top of that it is
the super clocked Edition which means
that it's overclocked right out of the
box so the core clock is going to be
around 1,100 megahertz and even the
memory is going to be slightly
overclocked but of course if you want to
push it farther
have a dual fan design what you kind of
get rid of all that heat and dissipate a
little bit better so for about four
hundred eighty dollars is gonna be a
perfect solution for our build for a
motherboard we're going to be using a
gigabyte gaz 77 xu d3h now phantasm
aside this is a really solid motherboard
so typically I like to use gigabyte
boards in my builds in fact I've got one
in the build right behind me here and
there's a good reason it's a really
nice-looking board with a black PCB and
blue accents which personally I think
look awesome but of course it does have
all the other features that you would
expect including SATA 3 USB 3 up to 32
gigabytes of RAM and one other thing is
it does support SLI so if you want you
can add another gtx 680 to this build
whether you want to do it immediately or
you want to do it six months from now
and it will work in this motherboard and
it will give you insane performance if
you want to like game on maybe three
monitors or something like that it will
work just fine about $155 is gonna be
really really awesome from memory we're
going to be using a gigabytes of course
interventions ram now this stuff i've
used in quite a few different builds
before and that's because it's really
solid so it is ddr3 ram clocked at 1600
megahertz now I can feel it that's the
sweet spot for Sandy Bridge and Ivy
Bridge you can't get faster clocks Ram
but generally gonna be paying a lot more
for really a very very minor performance
increase overall though $40.00 is gonna
be enough RAM to handle pretty much
anything you throw at it
when SSD will end up using a 128
gigabyte Samsung 830 series drive now in
my opinion an SSD is the number one way
to increase performance in your computer
now on top of that since SSDs have
gotten a lot cheaper lately there's
really no reason not to include one
now the 830 is a bit of an older drive
however don't let that put you off at
all in all ways it's still just as fast
it's pretty much the best SSDs out there
right now it's also going to be quite a
bit cheaper and most importantly it's
going to be very very reliable I use one
myself and had zero problems with it for
about ninety dollars this is gonna be a
great way to go for a hard drive one be
using a two terabyte Western Digital
caviar black now as much as I love SSDs
to get something like 1 or 2 terabytes
in an SSD is gonna be ridiculously
expensive so the best way to do is to
pair with a normal mechanical hard drive
and that's what we've done here so the
caviar black is definitely the number 1
way to go as far as hard drives go for
gaming computers it's going to be quite
a bit faster than a normal hard drive
nothing on SS Steve it's still a pretty
good improvement and with 2 terabytes
you're going to be able to have all the
kind of music movies games all the kind
stuff that you want to put on there it's
gonna be no problem about
sixty dollars is going to be perfect for
our build for power supply we're going
to be using a Corsair TX 750 watt this
is the same power supply they using my
own build I have absolutely no
complaints about it so for starters
you're going to get 750 watts of
capacity which is actually overkill for
the system however you want to do some
future upgrades you're not gonna have
any problem with that now what is a
modular supply which is definitely a
good thing what it allows you to do is
only plug in these certain cables that
you need so otherwise you would have a
cold mess of cables inside your case
that you got to kind of tuck everywhere
with a modular supply just plug in what
you're gonna need you're gonna be good
to go buy one hundred five dollars it's
gonna work perfectly for a case we're
going to be using a fractal design
refine our for now recently used the
little brother to this case the core
1000 in my $400 bill I gotta say I was
really impressed so I decided to go with
the bigger brother for this one this is
a quiet cool case which gets a big
thumbs-up for me we're going to find
some noise dampening material built into
the case it's also really designed to
kind of get rid of all the little
vibrations and whatnot which can well be
vibrating and annoying and all that kind
of stuff but you do have plenty room for
all kinds of larger graphics cards tons
of hard drives and just pretty much
anything that you could throw in this
system for about 110 dollars this is
well worth it for an optical drive we
wouldn't be using the sony DVD burner
now this is very optional in fact a lot
of people don't even bother to put DVD
or blu-ray or any kind of drives in
their systems these days I don't blame
you at all however it is gonna be really
cheap and the big thing is that for
example when you're installing windows
or maybe you have a DVD or some kind of
game that you want to install it can't
come in handy considering it's only
about 20 dollars it's generally worth it
for most people however again if you
want to upgrade this to a blu-ray or
just get rid of it altogether absolutely
feel free last but not least we have a
copy of Windows 7 home premium now this
is very very optional in fact I did not
even include it in this build main
reason is is that there are quite a few
other ways of getting Windows right now
for starters you may already have a
version of it in which case of course
it's free or you may want to hold out to
Windows 8 which comes out about a month
or so if you want to recording this
video regardless though if you do want
to go with Windows 7
it'll add about $100 to the system cost
so there you guys have it a fifteen
hundred dollar bill which will handle
pretty much anything you throw at it
of course prices are constantly
fluctuating so I'll have links to all
the current prices in the description of
this video since this is a custom gaming
PC feel free to customize it however you
like so I'll have some links in the
description for some options so for
example if you want to go with AMD on
the graphics side you want to get more
you go with a core i7 or anything else
I'll add some other additional options
that will work just fine if you guys
want to see any of my other builds feel
free to check them out right here and if
you want to see the full tutorial on how
to put together a computer it will be
right here anyway guys if you enjoyed
this video definitely be sure to leave
it a thumbs up and if you're interested
