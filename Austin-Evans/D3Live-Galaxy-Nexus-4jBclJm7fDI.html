to be talking about the google nexus
prime the third version of the nexus
series so what the Nexus phones has
always been about starting with the
google nexus one and follow with the
google nexus s is going to be a phone
that has the newest latest version of
Android wear that any kind of scans or
any kind of modifications at all on the
best hardware available at the time I
both the nexus one and the Nexus S both
were really really good thumbs when they
first came out and like I said they had
a lot of the highest in specs and all
that code stuff and I've expect this to
be the exact same thing with the nexus
prime now some of the things we do know
about this is that's going to have a
ridiculous display of a high definition
720p display now most phones even the
iphone is kept out as a red as a Retina
Display 640 x 960 and that's great don't
we run but 720p is even better and
what's such a high pixel Vince states in
was going to be you know just useless
it's going to be just ridiculously clear
and crisp especially if it's something
like a super amoled or anything like
that so the display on the nexus prime
is going to be top-notch absolutely
without a question on top led a very
like we will have a quad-core processor
so kind of entirely leapfrogging the
whole dual-core processor in the Nexus
line I'm going to go straight from
single core two quad or I know a quad
core obviously is going to give you a
ton of power it's not even funny how
well the graphics going to look and in
fact with a quad-core processor with the
GPU I wouldn't be surprised if the
graphics do approach the xbox 360 and
the playstation 3 and do want to stress
it's going to approach I don't be quite
as good obviously but for a phone it's
going to be absolutely outstanding I
know there are a lot of other things
that we've heard about this and that's
all gonna be room and I don't want to
talk a little bit on about all the
details and what networks not it's going
to be on but the major thing about the
whole reason is the nexus prime exists
is to show off the brand new version of
Android Ice Cream Sandwich so this next
delicious tasty treat from the folks
over in Mountain View is going to be a
really really good overhaul of my
minecraft wrong game Oh Android so with
ice cream sandwich they're growing a lot
of the cool things from honeycomb which
is flatly call the google tablets run of
example to zoom the galaxy tab acceptor
etc and merging
together with standard Android to give
it a little bit of a better look so if
you guys ever tried an Android title
before you know it's got a very kind of
like Tron esque theme and you know very
blue but it's very you know futuristic
and and it's pretty cool I expect a lot
of that stuff will carry over into ice
cream sandwich now beyond that of course
they want to get into it too much they
will be most likely showing this phone
off in the next couple of months or so
and we'll know a little bit more than of
its license am absolutely looking
forward to take a look at what the
google nexus prime has to offer anyway
guys for the second segment of d3 live
are we taking live questions from
everyone in chat as always every episode
of d through diet is fell in front of
live audience we've got quite a few
people here today so let's just take a
couple of questions motorola core or
unlocked nexus prime a little thing is
let's one tablet and what's one phone so
it's kind of hard to tell on the core
looks pretty great but of course it's
been a squad for tablets going to be
pretty similar in specs to the nexus
prime the quarterly is kind-hearted that
comparing our phone and a tablet they do
course do very different things all that
they're kind of someone just ones beer
well gaming take it over at youtube um I
don't think anything they were going to
take over YouTube I mean YouTube's
always going to be very there's going to
be all kinds of different niches from
everything from tech comedy and gameday
you name it the best set of dudes in
gaming is a huge part of YouTube right
now and I definitely think it is going
to continue to grow and continue to be a
really major part of the site which is I
think good for everyone will just be
made by samsung and get on motorola you
know i'm not sure we've heard look I've
heard something about samsung perhaps
but of course it's still up in the air I
wouldn't be surprised if it was perhaps
motorola back to HTC or whatever but i
will said i have her a little bit about
samsung may be making me nexus prime so
take that with potato of the grand salt
but that's what I've heard um amazon
tablet it's a great question and i was
telling these guys that before we
started recording on the amazon tablet
alpha be making full video on it at some
point but the amazon tablet is going to
go really really cool so if you guys
when i heard amazon is playing i'm
building a tablet making of course their
own special version of the android
tablet they will be running a version of
android I don't know what version it
will be but it will almost definitely be
customized to have the amazon appstore
amazonmp3 all different things that you
would expect out of Amazon but also will
be a most likely a quad-core processor
so very very powerful and on top of that
we've heard they very well be at like
hundreds of dollars less than the ipad
which would equate to a price around
three hundred dollars so if you can get
a quad core processor and tablet for 300
bucks it's actually built well and horse
amazon and i cut trust them to make some
pretty decent stuff um i'll eat very
very impressive thing i'll be really
awesome but of course definitely said
you know i probably will be doing a full
video on that once we hit a little bit
more about it but what i've heard the
amazon tablet absolute seems awesome um
ki Toli jailbreak apple products well
jailbreaking is just another form of
hacking you know like just tweaking
modding whatever you want to call it um
you know you can do that kind of stuff
jailbreaking for a lot of different
products it's just called different
things like sometimes call routing
sometimes it's called homebrew there's a
lot of different things but yeah you
can't do a hacking or whatever you like
to call it on several other different
products other than just apple iphones
and that kind of stuff what do I think
about Steve Jobs um I think that I don't
care what you say about Apple or
anything like that you've got to give it
see jobs credit he came up well under
apple with him so many great ideas and
so many great products came out i mean
the macintosh I'm you know the original
iMac you know the big green and blue and
purple ones all that kind of stuff
actually didn't think I don't think they
made purple but close enough whatever
also the I pause the iphones ipads all
these products that really did have a
major impact on the world and tech world
and everything so I mean I know a lot of
people don't disagree with a lot of
people do disagree with apples and
policy and all kind of stuff and I can
understand that but I'm think anyone can
deny that Steve Jobs was a real a really
special person really person who had an
eye for you know what made an idea great
and I think that Apple is maybe not
gonna really start hurting now that he's
gone but it's definitely a sad day for
the tech industry as a whole um what
kind of chips do you think will be
inside the ipad for on about the ipad 4
it's who knows what will be around by
then but I do think the ipad 3 will most
likely have a quad-core processor it
just makes sense mostly in pretty much
the entire industry is moving over from
dual core 2 quad core I wouldn't I don't
see reason why the next apple a6 chip I
suppose it would be in the ipad and
iphone everything next year wouldn't be
quad-core hey guys it's gonna be about
it for this episode d3 lied if you guys
enjoyed definitely be sure to subscribe
