new surface pro so big shout to
Microsoft for inviting us out here all
the way to Shanghai and this is the the
lineup so this is not the surface pro
five instead they're dropping the
numbers and going with a much more
simple and easy to remember new surface
pro name but what's cool is pretty much
all the stuff that you expect out of the
surface pro is still here so you still
have access to the type cover you do
have a new surface pen but most
importantly this is sort of the most
advanced tablet this side of an iPad so
there's actually a lot new with the
surface pro even though it actually
doesn't look all that different so one
of the big things is they've actually
refined the design a fair bit so even
though it's very very similar on the
outside
they've smooth a lot of the edges down
it's a little bit lighter a little bit
thinner it does feel nice in the hand
while the real improvements have been on
the inside so those are now rocking
Intel cable eight processors so this
particular model is outfitted with the
i7 7660 you there's also Core M 3 and
Core i5 model what's interesting is the
core i5 model actually is completely
painless so you can imagine that while
it looks pretty much the exact same on
the outside it is completely passively
cooled not exactly like this is going to
be a loud device to begin with but it's
really cool to have a proper Core i5
without a fan so with those new chips
come better performance so they're
claiming around 20% better performance
which probably is a little bit
optimistic what should be a big
improvement is the battery life so the
new surface pro 4 is rated for up to 13
hours of use now that's compared to nine
hours on the previous generation and
that is a big big bump they've achieved
this in a couple different ways first of
all it has a bigger battery which is
always helpful
those KB Lake chips are a little bit
more efficient and Windows 10 creator
update is a little bit more well
optimized for the surface now this is
actually a big jump not sure it doesn't
quite match these 14 hours of the
surface laptop we're talking about a
device you can pretty confidently take
with you all day without needing to
charged up something that hasn't really
changed are the ports so you still have
a single USB 3.0 type-a
I mean a display port as well as the
magnetic surface connector for charging
that's not really a huge deal but it's
bizarre to see a mini display port on a
brand new device in 2017 it really would
be nice if it had USB type C or even
Thunderbolt 3 for this price
speaking of price the new service Pro
starts at 799 dollars which is about the
same as the last gen however it no
longer comes with the surface pin add
the Box now to be fair this is a
upgraded version of the surface pen but
if you want it's going to run you an
additional $99 the new surface pen has
four times more levels of sensitivity
which is nice if you're actually
talented unlike me what I can't tell is
there's a lot less lag here so it pretty
much feels almost one-to-one it's not
quite perfect but it is a big
improvement over previous surfaces now
what's cool is this 10 actually is going
to be compatible other surface models
it's going to be pretty much ready to go
add the Box 15 new surface pro the
kickstand now goes almost entirely flat
which is nice so they call this the
studio mode but of course if you want a
fully flat tablet you can just you know
not use the kickstand and that's one of
the cool things about the new surface
pro well sure there aren't a lot of huge
new upgrades it's a salt update there's
a lot of small things that do add up so
if we drop it on the tide cover you'll
see this is a little bit different from
the previous generation so it now has
the new Alcantara touch that is very
similar to what you'll find on the
surface laptop the keyboard is not bad
at all it's maybe not my favorite I
think a lot of laptop keyboards are a
little bit better but you have to keep
in mind that this is built into a cover
which is easily detachable it's fully
magnetic and honestly doesn't feel bad
so one of the cool things about this new
tight cover is it does have a fair bit
of travel I believe they quoted
something like one point two millimeters
which is a little bit more than on some
certain other macro I mean laptops
there's like an entire meeting right
here ok so I got a little loud time to
bust out the big guns something
interesting is that Microsoft repeatedly
called the surface pro a laptop and not
a tablet which is interesting because
it's exactly as much of a tablet as it
was before as not only does it not come
with the pen it also does not come with
the keyboard so yeah
the pro will also be available with an
LTE option in a couple months which is
nice as it does help to differentiate it
between the other surface products as
you can see on the table behind me there
are now quite a few so the surface book
is a little bit of an oddball it's
definitely the most powerful laptop that
Microsoft selves it's also just quirky
and it doesn't close all the way and
it's very expensive so I feel like a
little bit more of a nice sort of thing
the serpent's laptop I think is much
more interesting because it really does
feel like a major
attack on stuff like the MacBook Air
it's around the same price and I would
argue that the hardware is much much
nicer which leads the surface pro as a
sort of tablet sort of laptop sort of
not sure where it's at my life thing
honestly for the surface line to have
started with the tablets it feels like
it's kind of gotten to a point where I'm
not really sure well if they can take it
from here and that isn't that
necessarily a bad thing I think a lot of
people really do like the surface pro
line but with stuff like the surface
laptop which kind of does the laptop
thing better it's weird I'm not really
totally sure who should really be
picking this up we have options like
this or that or this or that the new
surface pro will be available on June
15th the same day as the surface laptop
so let me know in the comments below
what you guys think about this and I
will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
