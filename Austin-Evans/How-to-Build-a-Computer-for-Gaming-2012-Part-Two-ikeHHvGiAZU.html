with part 2 of my tutorial on how to
build a gaming pc last time we prepared
the case install the power supply and
got the motherboard all set up the next
step is to install the motherboard end
of the case before doing this you need
to keep in mind that there are different
sizes of motherboards in each wheel
mount differently on the back of the
case you should see a few brass
standoffs already installed grab the
motherboard by the heatsink and roughly
line it up with where it will be
installed now look to see where the six
screw holes line up compared to your
case here the middle two standoffs are
correct but we'll need to add four more
grab your bag of screws that came with
the motherboard and get the standoffs
that you need you need to be sure to use
the correct parts here as if you don't
use standoffs the motherboard will grind
itself out on the steel case not good
now screw the standoffs
into the holes that you know match where
the motherboard goes you don't need to
use any tools to do this but be sure
that they're pretty tight then spend the
case around as we need to install the
i/o shield that came with the
motherboard it's easy to put this in
backwards
so it's best to take a look at how the
motherboard mounts before pushing it
into place put the case down on side so
that you have plenty of room to work
gently lay it down on top of the
standoffs in the position it needs to be
in then adjust it back and forth until
it lines up with all six standoffs as
well as the i/o shield this can be
tricky so take your time and make sure
to lined up right then grab your
screwdriver and using the screws that
came with the case screw also screws
into the standoffs be sure everything is
lined up perfectly at this point as it's
a pain to fix if it isn't once
everything looks good go back and
tighten each screw and the motherboard
is officially installed now sit back and
admire your work moving on let's install
the graphics card slice the seal on the
box and pop it open inside you'll see a
driver CD in case badge installation
guide registration card a DVI to VGA
adapter a full-sized DisplayPort 2 mini
DisplayPort adapter and a molex to 6-pin
SATA power cable o in the graphics card
itself which is slightly important on
the bottom of the car you'll see the PCI
connector along with a six pin power
connector on the back of the card on the
front are your display outs for
connecting monitors on this motherboard
there's only one full size PCI connector
however many motherboards will have two
or more generally you should install a
graphics card in the topmost one and
then add extra cards below that on the
case you should see a few metal covers
block
the way just unscrew these and set the
screws aside for a second you won't need
the covers anymore but you might as well
hang on to them you never know when they
might come in handy
flip the case on its side again and push
down on the graphics card until it
clicks into place nice and easy huh pick
the case back upright and then put the
two screws back in to make sure the card
doesn't go anywhere once you're done you
should see all the connectors poking out
the back of your case
voila the graphics card is installed the
next step is to install the hard drive
pull it out of the protective bag and
you're ready to go slide it into one of
the empty three and a half inch drive
bays over on this side you'll see a pair
of holes so just the drive until both of
these line up now grab four screws and
wait for it screw them in if you didn't
see that one coming now it's time to
toss the DVD drive in take the front
panel off the case by pushing the
plastic tabs backward and then pull the
panel off now we're going to need to
remove one of the five and a quarter
inch bay covers by pressing the tabs
aside until it comes out pop the front
panel back on and then slide the optical
drive into place just like the hard
drive line it up with the screw holes
and secure it with at least four screws
simple as that we now have all of our
parts installed so that'll be it for
part two of this tutorial if you guys
enjoyed this video definitely be sure to
leave it a thumbs up and be sure to
check out the finale in part three where
we finish the build up</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
