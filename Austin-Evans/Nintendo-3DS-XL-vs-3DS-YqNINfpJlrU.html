here with a comparison between the
Nintendo 3ds XL and the original 30s the
size is obviously a big difference but
there's more to it than that
first of all let's go over the design
the original 3ds breaks away from all
other DS models with the distinctive
triple layer design as well as a coating
of glossy plastic inside you'll find a
3.5 inch 3d display up top with a
resolution of 400 by 240 and below
you'll see the 3 inch 320 by 240
resistive touchscreen one thing that
should be easily noticeable is the large
bezel which makes the screen seem
smaller than it could be moving on to
the 3ds XL it's a much more traditional
design that looks quite similar to the
DSi the layered design has been
simplified with just the top and bottom
shelves being colored and the rest of
matte black plastic open it up and
you'll see the 4.9 inch top 3d display
and the 4.2 inch bottom screen something
to keep in mind is that both of these
sport identical specs other than the
size which means the already low pixel
density on the 3ds is magnified on the
XL I was never much of a fan of the
Select home and start buttons on the 3ds
as they've got nearly no feedback on the
XL they've built in some proper buttons
otherwise everything seems to feel very
similar inside which is a good thing
Nintendo figured out the whole button
deal a long time ago one change I'm a
big fan of is the stylus not only is it
a proper size without needing to be
extended but it's also moved over to the
right side just like on the DS instead
of being buried up top on the 3ds the XL
comes with a four gigabyte SD card
instead of the two gigabyte card from
the 3ds but on the flip side there's no
charging dock and the XL doesn't even
come with a charger in some countries
outside the US cameras on the 3ds XL on
3ds are disappointingly the same which
means you can expect VGA photos and
video the software is also identical
between the 3ds which should come as no
surprise battery life is much better on
the 3ds XL while the 3ds has about three
or four hours of gaming on a charge it
burns through the entire battery in just
a couple days of standby the XL does a
bit better averaging just over 4 hours
of gaming
better yet standby doesn't dent the
battery anywhere nearly as badly as
before so if you don't play your 3ds for
a couple days you probably won't find it
dead doing a little simple math you'll
be able to figure out that if you take
the same amount of pixels from a 3.5
inch screen and put them on a 4.9 inch
one things aren't going to look as good
that said you're getting a screen that's
nearly twice as big so it's going to
depend on your preference most 3ds games
ones that rely on 3d graphics look just
fine however more pixel based games like
New Super Mario 3 can be fairly
noticeable after a while though you
really get used to it the extra screen
real estate is a plus across the board
when playing older games
I never liked playing DS games on the
3ds as you either had to deal with
blurry upscaling or shrink it down to
the native resolution which is way too
small to see very well on the XL the
upscaling still is really no good but
when you hold the starter select buttons
while loading the game the overall size
is a lot closer to the DS screen same
goes for playing Virtual Console games
the extra screen real estate makes it a
lot easier to play games without
upscaling overall the 3ds XL is a solid
improvement if you already own a 3ds
it's probably not enough to get you to
upgrade unless you have to has a larger
screen but if you're looking to buy your
first 3ds the XL is the one to go for
