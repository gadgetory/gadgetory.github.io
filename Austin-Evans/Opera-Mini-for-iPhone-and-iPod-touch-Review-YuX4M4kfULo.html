today I'm here with an application
review on opera mini now this just came
out last night and I've spent a lot of
last night and a lot of today testing it
I actually did some pretty thorough test
to test it in different places different
networks lots and lots of different
websites and yeah I'm ready to give you
guys a full review on it anyway let's
get this one started okay so let's go
ahead and fire it up so it when you load
it it's pretty simple this takes just a
second to load and you're greeted with
this really nice home screen it's very
similar to offer on the computer whereas
you have different customizable panels
so basically let's say I want to do this
one so let's hold on for a second and
then we can eat the clearer edit so I'm
just going to go ahead and edit so now
we just come up here to enter address
exit out let me put whatever we want so
let's say we want opera com seems like a
pretty cool deal so let's go ahead and
punch it in here autocom had done and
now if we give it a second you see the
little pin wheels start spinning and
give it just a second it will go ahead
and grab the website what basically a
thumbnail of the website add it down
there to take just a second when you
first do it and then as soon as the
thumbnail is rendered like that then i
gotta do is just click on it and then it
will kind of gray everything out which
looks pretty cool and go ahead and load
the page so what's loading the page him
to go ahead and explain to you guys a
little bit about what opera is all about
so as you can see here it's actually
pretty pretty fast sometimes it can take
a little bit to start to load but once
it loads i mean it's very very fast you
know that when go ahead and you know
scroll around here it's really pretty
smooth especially you can see the
zooming in zooming out is really nice
now the pinch to zoom it's there
technically it's multi-touch but its
not perfect make sure you what it means
let's go ahead and let's go over this
iphone when you want to zoom in on it
it's pretty much basically the same as
tattoo zoom you can't do anything in the
middle um that's not a deal breaker
definitely not I think really it comes
down to you know double tapping to zoom
it's that fast isn't that pretty much
makes it for it okay but yeah so let me
just tell you a little bit about it and
I'm gonna just go ahead I'll explain
this tab patient just one second so
there we go so the way offer many works
is that it does not it's not like Safari
wear it go ahead and you know just like
a normal browser like say on your
computer you know downloads the all the
files of the website and puts it
together on your device instead opera
mini works a little differently it
actually has a bunch of server somewhere
else I'm so like like when I hit that
opera web site for example it went the
Opera those servers went to the Opera
website loaded it all crunched it into a
really compressed file and then sent it
to my ipod and then my ipod with the AL
/ many undid it it's kind of complicated
but in reality it's very simple it what
really really helps it obviously help
page loading a lot but what really helps
is when you're on a slower connection
whether it's a really slow Wi-Fi
connection or if specially if you're on
like an edge connection this is
especially helpful if you have an ipod
touch I mean I'm sorry an iphone
original which obviously doesn't even
have 3g now with this i mean you know
i'm sure you know if you have one of
those or if you have any kind of iphone
that's on edge it takes forever to load
but with this it's it's still not going
to be one hundred percent speedy but
it's pretty fast but enough of this
talking guys let's go ahead and just
show you a little bit so let's load a
couple sites let's open up engadget now
I this is the mobile site page you can
see here boom bloated very very fast we
can go ahead and click on it and again
super super speedy I'm really liking it
a lot one thing I really like is the
back button it is instantly um so let's
go ahead Organo
these tabs and everything just second
let's go ahead and go to a bit of a big
website let's go to a 9to5 mac now this
is going to be a full desktop site and
so go ahead give it just a second and
boom it's pretty much done we're going
to just a second longer but you as you
can see here very very speedy I mean I
won't compare to a safari of this video
but believe me guys it's way faster and
of course we can double tap and one kind
of nice features that I say here it
won't let me move left and right so like
us i'm scrolling down you know you can't
get a perfect line until you really pull
it and i just thought it was kind of
cool then of course down here we have
the back button which turns when you're
zoomed in it will undo you I guess and
yeah so that's basically the browser
itself let's go ahead and talk about a
little bit of the cool features about it
so you have the address bar simple just
like you think and you also have your
google search bar which is good but the
cool thing is if you click the little
arrow you pick not only to search google
but Amazon eBay and Wikipedia as well as
you can manage search engines so you can
actually delete these if you don't want
one for example I probably would never
use Amazon or Ebay oh I like Wikipedia
lon but so you can do that but really
really nice and easy that's works great
now I'll on this page let's go ahead and
show you something you probably have
seen before so let's go ahead and let's
go ahead hold over it and you can open a
new tab open a new tab down go ahead and
select text so you see here I'm going to
pull it across so here if I can grab it
right can't see with my finger to l but
uh just ok so you can copy it you can
search it or you can search with and if
you hit search width it's going to go
ahead and pull up all those so let's go
ahead and just hit it and I'd say we're
going to search display port sikeston I
got too much and there's display board
so that all you got to do is hit Search
it'll pull up a google search telling
you about displayport very very very
neat feature of course the self
explanatory refresh button the tabs go
ahead and explain this to you it's
pretty much as you've seen tabbed
browsing
go ahead and open up a new tab we want
let's just say and get you so we have
that loading let's go ahead and open up
another one let's open up pc world and
you see here I have all these tabs I can
freely change between them so then I can
go ahead and scroll through here let's
say well I'm waiting because sometimes I
mean it's not like it takes a long time
to load or anything but you know of
course you sometimes you don't want to
wait a long time or well 10 seconds I
guess that is a long time to you of
course you can just freely scroll
between them see I'm go ahead and get
that one loading come over here and
really guys what I'm impressed up is the
in performance is really not affected
whatsoever I mean just because your
iphone ipod doesn't actually happen to
really crunch all this data basically is
just downloading basically a file it's
very very quick and easy so let's go
ahead and kill a couple of these so kill
it one thing one small net they caught
while I'm thinking about it is that to
kill it you just have to click it once
click it twice it's not like a glitch
but I don't really agree with that I
think it'd be better they would just let
you click it but no big deal so anyway
I'm moving on let's go ahead and take a
little show you guys options I'm you
have bookmarks self-explanatory have
history which is really nice you know
you like to see the history you can do
the start page and saved pages which
saved pages is bait is kind of similar
to kind of like a mix between start
pages and bookmarks pretty cool settings
i'll show you guys that in a second but
one really cool feature is finding page
select surely let's go ahead and back
out and let's open up another page let's
open up let's go back to the engadget
and just show you some random i'm gonna
say best buyers that look good idea so
go ahead and find in pages hit best
actually yeah there we go so it just go
ahead and highlight best buy on this a
fantastic feature should be in every
browser I of thank really and it's good
that they include it so that's about all
options you can go into settings you
really want to speed up you can tell it
to not load images not sure why you want
to do that but hey I'm going to choose
the image quality it's automatically set
too high and really I would leave it at
that it's plenty fast as is I'm gonna
just font size
the mobile view which doesn't really
work I haven't noticed a whole lot dif
usually either does the mobile view or
the full desktop whether you click that
or not but it might help sometimes we do
full screen browsing which is great as
well as opera link which will allow you
to sync all your all your history and
bookmarks to your opera browser on your
computer I haven't tried this myself I
really don't use opera but I have heard
a lot of people saying that this is this
features not working right now so you
know and we might be looking for an
update or whatever and then probably see
to advance to show you guys Vance real
quick it quick it's nothing exciting so
let's go ahead and kill out of it and I
guess guys that is about it Opera Mini
is a really really great browser take
from me is faster than safari no doubt
this far it has some some things in it
like better much much better pinch to
zoom but it's also a lot slower that
said I absolutely recommend go guys
check this out it is one hundred percent
free in the App Store it works on all
devices all iPods and iPhones but who I
really really recommend it to is that
you have an iphone 2g in one of the
original ones if for over up because
you're just stuck on edge this
absolutely going to mean just speed it
up like crazy and of course I also I
mean I think you pretty much anybody can
use this especially have an iphone 3g
and ipod touch 2nd generation like this
it will also be much faster now if you
have an iphone 3gs maybe like an ipod
touch 3rd generation there might not be
a huge speed difference opera mini is
still going to be faster but not to such
a huge degree so if you have one of
those newer devices you might not need
opera mini that much still recommend it
it's a fantastic browser and at the very
least check it out anyway guys thanks
