in cipher this is a great way to encrypt
various texts so you can send it via
email or however you want and kind of
one of the pros of this is that it keeps
your you know data or whatever it is
safe so let's say you're planning a bank
heist with your best friend or perhaps
you're just sending an email something
more boring like you're just sending an
email with your credit card or your
social security or some important
information that you don't want to get
out well if you'd like you can add an
extra layer of security using insight
for it so the way this is very simple
first any browser you really like I'm
just going to be using Firefox today go
to in cipher dot it now of course I will
have that link in the description so
what is you guys can see here it says
add bookmarks so we will grab this link
and drag it on here so now we have it
installed basically this has works
through a bookmarklet and now we can
take it and pretty much encrypt whatever
we want so I'm gonna come down here
basically the way it works is just any
kind of text box on the Internet
if you have it selected you type you
know whatever you want then you click
this it will allow you to encrypt it and
send it and however you like so I'm
going to be just doing this the cache
isn't a place that you lost it kind of a
cryptic message in the first place but
just in case somebody gets ahold of this
we can further encrypt it so we just
click on this right here it'll ask us to
enter an encryption key so of course
this is what you're going to need to
share with your friend or whatever so
it's kind of like the password so we're
going to do oMG lol best password of all
time click encrypt and here we go so now
we have this so if we want we can you
know copy and paste this we can put into
a notepad document and you know email it
or if you want it on like a USB and you
send it across or if we want to go just
a little bit more new-school we can just
copy and paste this into an email and
basically it just kind of says this
message is encrypted does it in cipher
dot it to learn how to deal with it and
of course if you're a friend who should
have the password anyway you can just
get rid of this and just send it
straight up now this is supposed to work
on pretty much any website as long as
you have a text box however I definitely
found that there are quite a few
problems depending on where you go so my
best bet was just to go come to this
page put my information in or my
whatever it is I wanted to encrypt and
then go ahead from here and copy and
paste it wherever we want anyway guys
it's just a quick little video showing
you guys in cipher it certainly not the
most useful thing in the world but I'm
sure some of you guys might have find
some use for it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
