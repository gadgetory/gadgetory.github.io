best years for smart phones ever so here
are my top 5 favorites kicking things
off we have the Moto e for Plus this is
straight-up the best deal in smartphones
right now back in August when I first
did a video on the e4 plus it was a
hundred and eighty dollars but if you
want to go to Amazon and buy one today
it's only going to be 130 at that kind
of price you shouldn't expect much but
this is a good phone period it has a
metal build which while it's a little
bit on the thicker side does feel good
in the hand the reason it's a little bit
chunky is because this guy is rocking a
massive 5,000 milliamp hour battery this
is straight-up the best battery life
that I've ever tried in a smart phone
now sometimes you can get about a day or
so out of most phones with decent
batteries but with this guy especially
considering the fairly power sipping
internals getting two full days of usage
is actually not too hard to put things
in perspective it has nearly triple the
battery size of the iPhone 8 it's not
just a phone with a giant battery you're
getting a 5.5 inch 720p display which
while a good panel it would be nice to
have a little bit of a higher resolution
but again it's $130 the camera is also
pretty good and Motorola software while
not fully up to date on Oreo just yet is
pretty clean the bottom line is that
this really is all the smart phone that
most people need especially when you
consider that crazy battery life and
great price the Moto e for plus is
definitely worth a look next up we have
these Samsung Galaxy s8 now this is one
of the first flagships of the year
however it is still one of the best
users phone for about two minutes and
it's hard not to be impressed with just
how far Samsung has come with design
it's an all metal and glass build what's
impressive is just how well the glass
tapers round on both the front and back
as nice as the iPhone 10 design is it's
hard for me to argue with just how nice
the Galaxy s8 feels in the hand it's all
the more impressive that I did it over
six months before Apple did the Galaxy S
a really did set the bezel this trend
for 2017 well yes on top of bottom there
are some slight bezels but especially on
the sides they're basically non-existent
it goes deeper than that to van will let
display is still one of the absolute
best that you can buy with rich blacks
and great color you're also getting the
headphone jack which in a year where
most phones have dropped it is
definitely a nice
as you would expect performance is good
whoo I'm still not a huge fan of Samsung
software skin and it doesn't really get
in the way and there's no doubt that the
phone is snappy well the camera isn't
quite on par with the pixel - it's still
terrific one of the nice things about
this is that because it is a few months
old the prices come down in $650 which i
think is more than reasonable for such a
great phone
however it's not perfect the fingerprint
sensor placement around back just
doesn't make sense the idea that it only
has a single mono speaker and 2017 is
kind of annoying
and while the addition of fast charging
and wireless charging is nice it still
doesn't quite make up for the fact that
the battery life isn't too great on its
own the biggest issue is there were only
a few months away from the unveiling of
the galaxy s 9 taken as a whole though
it is hard to argue that the galaxy s 8
isn't one of the best phones of 2017
next we have the one plus 5t one of my
biggest surprises of the year so $500
this is definitely not a budget phone
however when you consider that a lot of
the other flagships or $1000 this year
this actually starts to look like a
bargain while on the surface it looks
very similar to the also released in
2017 one plus five the biggest
difference here is that we're now
getting a basically bezel s display it's
rocking a good but not remarkable six
inch AMOLED display which will not quite
as sharp as the galaxy s 8 it's still
fine for pretty much everyone the
hardware is also good so it's got a
seamless aluminium build which not only
looks good but I feel like almost more
importantly feels really nice in the
hand the fingerprint sensor is also
around back now you know in a sensible
place that you can actually reach and
oneplus was very proud of the idea that
they have still kept the headphone jack
continuing on the good trend performance
is good so with the snapdragon 835 and
eight gigs of ram this is about as good
as it gets on android right now the
software is pretty clean and mostly
stock oxygen OS does add a couple of
useful features but what really stands
out about the 1 + 5 t to me is the
camera phones like the pixel really have
pulled away from pretty much all other
phones out there right now but the 1 + 5
t does a remarkably good job of keeping
up so no it's not quite as good but in a
lot of situations it's close enough
that's going to be really hard to tell
the difference and that's impressive
especially considering that usually when
you step down from those thousand-dollar
flagships to something that's a little
bit cheaper the camera is the first
thing to be cut it might not be the best
in any specific area but it's good
basically
and at $500 the one plus five T is a
rock-solid phone speaking of incredibly
expensive flagship phones we have the
iPhone 10 yes $1000 price tag is
incredibly expensive for a phone but if
you go past that for just a second it's
hard not to be impressed with what Apple
is able to pull off here first of all
are the bezels or rather lack of bezels
so as long as you can look past the
notch which for me only took a few
minutes to get used to you're getting an
absolutely incredible screen here it's
an AMOLED panel that is ever so slightly
better than the one on the galaxy s 8
which is no small feat along with that
you're getting HDR support and apples
still awesome 3d touch the praise
doesn't stop there either the Apple a 11
Bionic chip inside the iPhone 10 not
only shames a lot of phones but even
some computers that combined with iOS 11
means that the iPhone feels incredibly
snappy everything responds basically
immediately and especially now that we
have the new gestures that have replaced
the home button it feels even faster you
do lose touch ID which would be nice to
have but honestly face a fee feels like
some next gen tech raise your phone to
wake give it a half a second to scan
your face and your write into your phone
now it's not a perfect system while it
works really well for me it does vary
from person to person some people have
had a lot of issues with it for the most
part though their hardware is absolutely
top-notch get it not glass and stainless
steel get the iPhone 10 1/2 that
actually does make it feel more
expensive and the battery life is a
noticeable step up from previous iPhones
even the camera is right up there with
the very best smartphones out you now
have wireless charging as well as
waterproofing if it sounds like I'm a
fan of the 10 then you would be right
yes the price tag is steep but as far as
I'm concerned it doesn't get much better
than this before we get to the final
phone I want to give a few honorable
mentions to some phones that did some
really cool stuff this year starting
with the razor phone this came out of
nowhere with some legitimately cool
features it's rocking a 5.7 inch display
with a 1440p resolution but what makes
it really exciting is the 120 Hertz
refresh rate this makes everything from
games to animations look buttery smooth
it will be a feature in phones on 2018
you're also getting the best speakers
I've ever heard on a phone period it's
not even close the only problem is that
it feels like a brick in your pocket and
the camera is straight garbage town
that I feel like was a little underrated
this year is the iPhone 8 plus so take
all the best parts of the iPhone 10
including the camera you're getting the
build quality you're getting even better
battery life but you're adding touch ID
and you're shaving a couple hundred
dollars off the price the biggest issue
is that the iPhone 10 has a bigger
screen and face ID and a smaller chassis
the iPhone 8 plus is a good phone but
the 10 is just a better one
then there's the essential phone this is
a little bit of a weird one on one hand
the hardware is incredible it's got a
ceramic build and a knotch to put the
iPhone 10 to shame it launched it was
held back by an expensive price tag and
a mediocre camera but some software
updates and a price cut have mostly
addressed that at this point the only
real issue is that the essential company
itself is maybe not the most stable in
the world right now but if you're
willing to take a little bit of a gamble
the essential phone is really solid all
this leads me to my favorite phone of
2017 the Google pixel 2 now let me be
clear I prefer these standard pixel to
over the pixel 2 XL not only is it $200
cheaper but the screen is not garbage
town which you know it's helpful we pay
$850 for a phone what you're getting
here is the fastest Android phone I've
ever tried even though on paper it's not
as powerful as the iPhone 10 and real
use it feels right up there which is
really a testament to how well Google
has optimized this phone in an age where
phones get bigger and bigger
I found the standard pixel 2 to be
actually a pretty decent size now the
design isn't quite on par with something
like the galaxy s 8 or the iPhone 10 but
that really isn't a deal-breaker to me
not only does the pixel to add
waterproofing which is basically a
necessity these days but you're also
getting pretty decent battery life where
it really shines is with the camera in
my opinion this is the best smartphone
camera you can buy now a lot of the
credit goes to Google's awesome
optimization of the camera and while yes
sometimes the iPhone 10 does look a
little bit better but generally speaking
I prefer the overall results that you
get from the pixel where the pixels who
really wins for me is price at $650 this
is nearly $400 cheaper than the iPhone
10 sure is iPhone does some things
better than the pixel but for most
people this is a better choice which is
why it is my favorite phone of 2017 so
you guys have seen my picks
I'm curious what is your favorite phone
of 2017 let me know in the comments
below and I will catch you on the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
