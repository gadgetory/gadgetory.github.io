the graphics comparison with destiny
running on the ps3 ps4 Xbox 360 and Xbox
one starting with the ps3 version we're
looking at a fairly low resolution of
1024 by 6 24 which isn't that surprising
for a last gen console importantly
things stay right up at 30 frames per
second for the most part with only
occasional dips with major action and
fast motion jump over to the Xbox 360
edition of destiny and things are
similar with a few improvements we still
have the same sub 720p resolution
however the game seems to be just
slightly smoother almost never dipping
below the 30 FPS vsync limit move on to
the Xbox one and there's a major
difference not only are we working with
the full 1080p resolution but those
minor framerate dips are almost
completely gone with the more powerful
current consoles load up the ps4 version
of destiny and it's incredibly close to
the Xbox one version both run at 1080p
at a locked 30fps and even though the
ps4 is technically a fair bit more
powerful you'd be hard-pressed to notice
a major difference at first glance to
really take a close look at the graphics
let's put the console side-by-side the
difference between the Xbox 360 and ps3
is minor at best with the 360 generally
pulling out a slight advantage in detail
moving up to the Xbox one shows a much
bigger improvement with the higher
resolution and more detailed textures
but interestingly the ps4 looks almost
identical down to the individual
textures move to a darker scene and you
can see the lighting actually holds up
very nicely on the ps3 and 360 with the
biggest difference on the current
consoles being the resolution there's a
more noticeable difference with the
slightly over-the-top lens flares but
the ps3 version Falls quite a bit behind
with this very pixelated shadows where
the 360 one and ps4 all look much better
impressively Bungie was able to include
the entire gameplay experience
regardless of console which means you
get the same amount of characters on
screen in the same levels make the
graphics the only key difference
if you buy the digital last-gen version
of destiny before January you can
download the ps4 or Xbox one version for
free which combined with the awesome
save sync across consoles is a huge plus
details like your custom character also
translated across platforms nicely
although these are hardly the nicest
looking faces I've seen in a game
overall destiny delivers the same
experience regardless of console but it
does look quite a bit better on the
current gen the 360 version is more
polished than the ps3 but graphically
destiny on the Xbox one and ps4 are
essentially identical so are you guys
picking up destiny for consoles are you
