unboxing at the Nikon d3100 so you know
I was looking for a DSLR for video of
course my major thing was I really just
wanted something that would get the best
quality video and without here obviously
spending a ton of money I've seen I
looked at a couple of different ones
obviously the Canon t2i which is what
seems like everybody on YouTube has
looked at it and it was okay I also
looked at the Sony 833 which I was
actually came really close to getting
however in the end I decided on the
Nikon d3100 for several reasons which
we'll go ahead and get into in the full
review either go ahead and pick it up
with the 1855 kit lens should be just
fine for me for the moment at least
probably a different lens a couple
different lenses later but like I said
this is just going to be to start out
with should be just fine
so we go ahead and open up the box here
and we've got some warranty
I got a QuickStart guide I think there
might be a couple CDs in there so make
sure to take a look at that I don't
think this software is going to be great
on this but should be decent so let's go
ahead and just pick this up see what get
a couple boxes here um looks like this
is gonna be all our accessories so we've
got the big old Nikon strap should be
pretty handy we've got the battery quit
take this out um this is gonna be a
thousand 30 milli amp hour battery so
should give you plenty of charge for
take a lot of pictures and video but
will be probably picking up another
secondary battery we've got a couple of
Clips here and find the other one here
these are to avoid interference prime
not gonna be that big deal but actually
no that one's not that is for the hot
shoe ah
hey here they are so gotta leave it for
just to you know to put in to get rid of
the interference on you a USB cable or
something but not actually think this
comes with USB cable but we will see and
we just have the charger itself now
actually I really like I mean I can't
stand when Chargers uhactually I have to
charge it in the the battery has to
charge the camera and this is a much
better way to go you just slide the
battery right in in addition to that you
go ahead and just plug it straight into
the wall so there's no extra wires or
anything like that take the camera take
the battery take the charger just as one
piece and you're good to go
so that's always good now it's going to
get to the camera itself so go ahead and
take out of this box here I believe this
is Karen body anyway so we'll open this
up cardboard either way and here we go
so nicely head in here and nothing else
in the box we do have the camera itself
so foot and get out here this should be
pretty cool I had some hands-on with the
D 3100 very very impressed so if there
we go so here's the camera okay so let's
go ahead and take a look at the lens now
it just comes in a separate box here now
of course like I said this is the
standard kit lens that will probably
come with most of these jun 18 2014 3 mm
but never deal pop it to the side and
here we go
so got a pretty nice lens here button
drop there very nice so there we go okay
guys so here is the camera itself very
very nice I'll give you guys a quick
tour around here I won't go through
everything but of course we've got the
lens here looks very very nice we've got
you know the controls for autofocus
we've got you know vibration reduction
kind of stuff out there it's pretty cool
I'm coming around to the back here
actually got this plastic you've got a
nice three inch display it's not going
to be fantastic I don't know off the top
my head but it's not as really high
quality display but shouldn't be a big
deal we've got this nice now that's one
thing I really want to say it's good so
nice to hold you've got a rubber grip
here which is a improvement over the
d3000 you've also got a nice deep grip
right here so this is really really nice
for going ahead and holding I love that
was like I said one of the major things
so we have this which is a live view
switch so you can go ahead and pull that
press the button to record video pretty
quickly you can go ahead and lock
autofocus
all kinds of mini buttons we got you
know all purchased all kinds of stuff
trash you've got our little d-pad of
course we do have a hot shoe we've got
our little guide select remove and go
ahead and switch to our different modes
this will go ahead and choose between
single shot believe multiple shot that's
timer and I'm fairly sure if you guys
can see that that that's quiet shutter I
believe that just makes it what it
doesn't make a noise when you take a
picture go ahead and turn it on I don't
have the battery in here so I can't show
you guys that just yet and then we go
ahead over here and we have room for a
SD h SD SDHC or SDXC card so let up
whatever we want in there over here we
do have a flat now one thing is that one
one kind of minor downside is that this
does not have an audio input so if
you're going to be recording a lot of
video not the greatest but go ahead and
show you guys you do have believe that's
for GPS that's the USB you got HDMI and
then actually that is this over here
this is to the a/v out so you can go
ahead and just hook it up to you know a
standard TV or whatever so guys that's
about it of course I definitely stay
tuned to the channel I will be not only
doing you know quality tests I will do a
review at some point but I'll also
definitely mean pretty much all the
videos I've shoot from now and will be
shot on the D 3100 so if you want a lot
of quality tests just go ahead and check
out my channel so anyway guys thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
