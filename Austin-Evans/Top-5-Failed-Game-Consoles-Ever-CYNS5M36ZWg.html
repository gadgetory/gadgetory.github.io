here with the top five failed videogame
consoles ever so in the last 30 years
we've seen a lot of consoles come and go
most have been pretty good a few of in
spectacular while the rest will be a
little of we'll call them questionable
so whether this is because they are
ahead of their time because there are
some poor business decisions or just the
simple fact that they sucked here are
the top 5 worst video game failures of
all time coming in at number 5 is the
Philips CDI from 1991 now this actually
wasn't strictly a game console what they
were trying to do here was actually make
something that was a little bit of a
computer a little bit of a game console
and it was ahead of its time in some
aspects especially considering the fact
that it used CDs well before the
PlayStation 1 did unfortunately the CDI
wasn't a very good console or computer
now part of this was due to the fact
that since it was launched in 1991 is in
between generations and because of this
the hardware was really pretty
underpowered on top of that this was the
controller it uh it used so on that may
have played a slight role in what what
were they thinking as if the $700 price
tag wasn't enough the CDI also had some
license Nintendo games or more
specifically the Legend of Zelda which
was horrible it was seriously one of the
worst video games of all time making the
CDI fittingly enough
one of the worst consoles of all time
coming in at number 4 is on live from
2010 now this one actually is still
technically around so I guess we can't
fully call it failed yet but for the
most part this was one of those things
it was a great idea because ahead of its
time and pretty much crashed and burned
on live used what's known as cloud
gaming which meant that it was entirely
limited by your internet connection as
everything was going to be rendered and
all the games were being run on some
server somewhere if you had a decent
internet connection I actually was not
half bad however and this is the big
part you still had to deal with a little
bit of lag as every time you hit a
button it wasn't just going three feet
to your console it was going five ten
hundred maybe even a thousand miles to
the nearest OnLive station unless you
had an amazing internet connection on
life was really difficult to work with
all it took was someone in the house to
start watching Netflix or downloading
something and you start seeing lag in
your game it would even start to get
lower quality and just it did not work
very well
now when OnLive was first being
announced and before it actually came
out it was valued at up to 1.8 billion
dollars
however a short two years later when it
actually went under
it's sold for more like four million
dollars coming in at number three is the
Apple Pippin from 1995 now this is the
first and only console apple ever
designed and just like the CDI it wasn't
strictly for games as there were other
applications that were available on the
console the pickle is mostly based on
Macs at the time just cut down to a
console like form-factor and while there
are advantages to this one of the big
disadvantages was price is it was $600
brand-new in a time where there was the
amazing PlayStation 1 for much less than
that it made Pippin a really tough sell
while the Pippin saw some very mild
success mostly thanks to Bandai who
actually licensed it and created quite a
few of these consoles for the most part
it was a flop and as soon as Steve Jobs
came back to Apple it was one of the
first things axed and number two we have
the Nintendo Virtual Boy from 1995 on
paper this looks really impressive even
by today's standards it was a bit of
goggles as well as a controller that
allows you to see 3d images and play
games and everything and it looks really
cool except that well imagine what 3d
and virtual reality looked like with
1995 technology not particularly good
the Virtual Boy could only display the
color red and the graphics were very
simple making the 3d effect not quite as
good as it could be on top of that just
like with the Nintendo 3ds of today the
3d effect gave a lot of people headaches
as you might expect at $180 the Virtual
Boy didn't last too long as it's so well
under a million units Nintendo quickly
pulled the plug to go back to making
piles of money with the Nintendo 64
lastly in number one we have the Sega
Dreamcast from 1998 unlike the rest of
the failed consoles on this list the
Dreamcast was actually one of the best
of all time it just so happened to sing
Sega's Hardware business in the mean
time the Dreamcast was a heavens time in
several ways for example it was the very
first console to include a modem which
allowed you to play online games years
before Xbox Live in the PlayStation
Network ever showed up there were other
good ideas as well including the fact
that the controllers had the memory card
slots now while this wasn't anything
amazing what was cool was the fact that
the controllers actually had buttons and
a screen which meant that of course you
go and load up all your data and
everything like that but some of them
actually had mini games that you could
play straight on your memory card while
the Dreamcast didn't have a long
lifespan it did have a ton of potential
and in fact a lot of what they worked on
for the Dreamcast was moved on to the
Xbox and we all know how that one turned
out anyway I'm curious to know what's
the worst video game console you guys
have ever used definitely be sure to let
