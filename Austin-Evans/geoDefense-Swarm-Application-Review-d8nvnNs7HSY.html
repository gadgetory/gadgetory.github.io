today I'm here with an application
review on a really cool application
called geodefense swarm now you guys
might know about the original version of
this geodefense this is kind of the
sequel and you know it brings a lot of
really cool things at the table um if
you've ever seen geodefense originally
you will know it had amazing rapper to
me they really really something
basically geodefense one marine really
the same graphics but some just so cool
you know some coolant gameplay it's a
tower defense game but it's among the
best probably glad it there I'd say
along the Sentinel so you know I'm just
gonna go ahead and do let's see here
just a second mission because I'm not
that great at it but okay so basically
you have to tower you have bought least
in this you know starting basically you
basically build a maze you see that
little thing down there as it fills up
that tells you when they're about to
come it's basically you they're going to
start here the creeps or whatever they
start from here and they got to get here
and basically you basically build a
defense you know you kill them and then
you can upgrade and you know etc it's a
really pretty cool game um you'll see
she actually you know i'll let some by
here in a second watch when they do that
it's really it's really cool and you see
a already some of the graph except me
knock there you see when they explode
really cool but actually i'm not going
to do anything for just one second see
if i can that some get by yeah okay I
got one by maybe yeah so I'm go ahead
and build some more stuff right here but
watch when these two go by it's very
cool when I explode and you as you can
see here that's constantly filling up so
you know these guys are coming and going
there go see what I mean the graphics
are just man I'm I'm sure love them this
is quite operates more stuff than now
that I've only got two different types
telogen this but as you advance you know
you get different types of towers and
all the different things and I'm about
to punch those
but it's a it's a tower defense game
just like you know any other I mean
there's nothing amazing about it it's
it's you know the graphics are great and
I do like the fact that you know you
build your kind of you kind of build a
maze I mean you know different places
will have you know like because
obviously they can't go around these and
that that was at the game right there
these I mean look at that's awesome but
as you go through the game I mean you
know they will come faster it'll be
different types and she actually I'm
instead here so I'll go ahead and just
let it die but it can get kind of
difficult um I mean it's not it's
nothing terrible I mean there's the once
you have like a lot of towers when you
upgrade them and you know you kind of
give them all all line and see there you
go but guys this is just a really quick
video on there's not a whole lot to this
um I mean it's a very cool game I'm
going good at this back here but it's a
very cool game I'm liking a lot you know
I generally don't go for tower defense
games too much but what's this and
Sentinel both are really really great
games and currently this is a launch
price so i have no idea Helens can last
juice mint swarm is 99 cents so guys
definitely i recommend go check it out
my nan census I mean awesome game
they're playing on a how many levels are
but there's a favor for you I won't
gotten into a few of them but guys that
is just quick video definitely recommend
take a look at this thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
