laptop and I'm about to give you five
reasons why you should pick one up
starting off at number one we have the
price at 188 dollars the HP stream is
one of the cheapest Windows laptops that
you can buy brand-new today now I took a
look at the HP stream a couple years ago
the original model and it was good but
it had a lot of compromises over over
the last couple years while keeping that
price low they've actually done a fair
bit to make it a better laptop recently
I did a video on a $200 MacBook that I
picked up off of ebay now it was a good
system however it is not for the faint
of heart now not only is it going to be
nearly ten years old but there's no
warranty and no guarantee that it's ever
going to get updates at least with the
HP stream you know that if something
goes wrong you can just go yell at HP
about it it's really put the 188 dollar
price tag into context you can pick up
15 of these HP streams for less than the
price of a mid Spectre 15-inch MacBook
Pro now obviously the MacBook is going
to be a better laptop when you consider
it just how much this is able to do for
so much less starts to make sense for a
lot of people and that brings us to
reason number two this is really all
that you need sure some people do have
specific things they have to do with
their laptops but a lot of people
rocking a thousand dollar MacBook Air
and their backpack and doing nothing
besides watching videos and typing some
Docs or emails or whatever and it just
so happens that the HP stream will also
do that for less than a fifth of the
price so no you should not buy the HP
stream if you plan on doing hardcore
gaming or any kind of video editing
however if you're doing lighter stuff
like most people do web browsing
watching video playing games you know on
Facebook wait people still play games on
Facebook okay well if you're doing any
of that stuff
the HP stream is going to be totally
fine it's also still a full fledged
Windows computer so unlike a Chromebook
you have all the advantages of running a
complete copy of Windows 10 as well as
all the disadvantages of running a
complete copy of Windows 10 this gives
you the freedom of using incredibly
advanced technology like not Google
Chrome you can install heavy apps such
as Photoshop if you have a lot of
patience and you're going to get access
to the full library of thousands and
thousands of Windows apps that have been
created over the years number three is
the hardware
and when you hear the words 188 dollar
laptop it probably doesn't fill you with
confidence but the stream is well
actually not that bad pick the keyboard
for example a lot of ultra cheap laptops
it definitely feels cheap and while it
isn't on the most premium side for the
stream it has a little bit of a click
enos that does feel pretty nice the
tripod also isn't too bad and that
follows through with the rest of the
chassis sure it's all made of plastic at
this price point you shouldn't expect
anything else but there's no real flex
besides a little bit with the screen and
the overall hardware feels pretty decent
especially considering how light it is
it's definitely not fancy but you have
all the basics including three USB ports
HDMI a headphone jack as well as an SD
card reader which is important for
something that I'll get into in just a
second one of the biggest downsides is
the screen so with a 14 inch 1366 by 768
panel it was never going to be the
sharpest thing in the world but what
really lets it down is the fact that it
is a thoroughly average TN panel color
accuracy isn't great the brightness
could be better but that being said $188
it is going to be usable reason number
four is the performance it exists so
$188 you should expect this to be a
blistering fast PC and surprise-surprise
blistering fast it is not inside you're
getting a dual-core Intel Celeron
processor 4 gigabytes of RAM as well as
a massive 32 gigabytes of flash storage
nothing is what I would call snappy but
at least it works and a big part of that
is because this guy has 4 gigs of RAM
unlike earlier versions which only had 2
as you can imagine Windows computers
really aren't that happy with only 2
gigabytes of RAM especially with certain
apps oh sorry it's cough I don't know
what that was the processor is decent
enough for basic tasks so because it is
so low powered you actually don't need a
fan inside the stream which at least
does make it completely silence one of
the bigger issues is that 32 gigabytes
of storage though now yes you can get
Windows on 32 gigs of storage but
installed more than a couple apps it's
going to fill up quickly thankfully
though that full size SD card reader
actually does come in handy put
something like a 128 gig card for about
$40 in and you should actually be pretty
well set reason number 5 is that it's
practical so when you think of a lot of
the
that will make a good laptop good the HP
stream has them I mean some of them at
least battery life is a big one so with
a 41 watt hour battery while that might
not be impressive for a lot of laptops
this has such power sipping internals
that even when you're completely
cranking it at 100% you're going to be
getting decent battery life and for
normal usage you're looking at around 10
hours you're also getting some
surprising features at the price point
including 2x2 802 2.11 AC Wi-Fi now yes
this is not going to be as reliant on
the internet as something like a
Chromebook but you still you think about
it it's called the HP stream for a
reason and most of the time you're going
to be online so it's nice that it has
solid Wi-Fi the HP stream is definitely
not for everyone but I'm continuously
impressed with just how much you're able
to get for so little so I'm curious what
do you guys think about ultra cheap
laptops like the stream let me know in
the comments below and I will catch you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
