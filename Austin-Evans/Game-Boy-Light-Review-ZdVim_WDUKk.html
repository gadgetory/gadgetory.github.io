reviewing the Gameboy light
so actually this is probably the rarest
of all game boys as it was only made
japan for about a year a little bit less
than that and it only ended up making
about 11,000 of them so at first glance
you look at it it looks very much like
another Gameboy the Gameboy pocket as
you can see here there is a pretty big
difference between them the Gameboy
liest image what I pulled up pull this
back a little bit the Gameboy light it's
actually quite a bit larger set them on
top of each other as you can see here
Gameboy that's quite a bit larger and
also is a good bit thicker
due to the fact that instead of using
triple a batteries it uses two double-a
batteries um so the Gameboy light though
was those one major thing that will
obviously by the name the major thing
about the Gameboy light was that it not
only had you know just a standard
Gameboy play but also did have a
backlight now I'll show you guys that in
a second now this was actually like I
said a really rare model and it was
actually for a good reason
so the Gameboy light came out right
about the time the gameboy color came
out and obviously the gameboy color was
a successor it had a lot of additional
features at color screen better graphics
all that kind of stuff
and so the Gameboy like really never
took off so basically they went ahead
they designed it and they did launch in
Japan and it did it didn't really just
didn't do that well because obviously
who would buy you know spend this on a
Gameboy that's been out for you know
this plays the standard gameboy games
which had been out for almost 10 years
by then or you could buy you know
obviously by the brand-new Game Boy
Color however these are still pretty
cool little uh pretty cool game boys and
obviously the backlight which is a
pretty nice feature because obviously no
game boys actually had a backlight until
the Gameboy Advance SP which was back in
2003
so they just gave you guys a quick tour
of it and of course this one is not in
perfect condition but like I said these
are pretty hard to come by so if you can
get one brand new in the box they will
cost you a ridiculous amount so up at
the top you guys should see one of the
first things is that the switch is
actually a little bit different so you
turn it off you can turn it on
and then you flip it all the way over to
the right you actually turn on with the
backlight on so I'll show you guys how I
flight and show you guys that in just a
second
I'm not the standard same size screen as
the Gameboy pocket and of course the
same buttons and plastic over here we do
have the Gameboy link port as well as
the volume and we have just the standard
contrast of any standard sort of Gameboy
and of course the power switch I know it
slipping over on the back and actually I
do have a chapter knees Yoshi game in
here which I'll show you guys in a
second but uh we do have just all the
standard sort of stuff talking about it
and it does actually does take two
double-a rather than two triple A
batteries so you know that was obviously
it had to power the backlit screen so
you know that's not bad
well it did kind of protrude a little
bit um
and although actually a lot of people
you know if you look at just pictures of
it Game Boy light looks pretty much
identical to the Gameboy pocket but
actually is it it is different it is
bigger and pretty much all dimensions
you know it's a little bit thicker a
little bit longer a little bit wider and
everything so it's pretty interesting so
I did shut the light and show you guys
what the backlight looks like so one
major thing about game boys was
obviously in the dark you really
couldn't see so this is just without the
light off this is just what any game
would look like and you can't see
anything like we're go ahead and turn
the backlight voila we actually do have
a pretty decent light on here um so the
camera like she's not quite picking up
it's a little bit greener than this but
it's absolutely playable on this nowhere
near as bright as oh say the Gameboy
Advance SP for example but it is
absolutely playable you know you
actually go ahead and see it really
nicely and it actually works now the
battery life on the Gameboy light was
actually not too bad of course because
it was instead of using trip lights to
use double A's it had about the same
battery life even with the light on and
with the light off it actually lasted I
believe about three or four hours longer
I'm saying you guys can see I mean the
screens pretty nice of course you do
have the contrast so just like on any
standard Gameboy you go ahead and just
contrast however you like you know it's
just a really solid package I like it
now obviously the major reason you would
you know you want a Game Boy light these
days is just for your for collecting
purposes obviously like I said the
Gameboy Advance SP does have a far
superior backlight but these are really
cool a little game boys to kind of have
like I said that are really rare and so
for you know nerds like me who like to
collect key boys you know I was just
something I wanted to have there you go
guys that is my review of the game boy
light now that actually did come in two
different colors it did come in as gold
as well as it came in a silver color now
if you're interested in getting one of
these ebay is probably going to be your
best bet you really don't find them
pretty much anywhere outside of Japan
unless you know if you do find one
outside Japan they're probably marked up
quite a bit more but in general these
are not cheap at all you're going to
have to probably spend a decent amount
of money to go ahead and get one this
one's not in great condition but
obviously it does work one thing that
you that you do definitely want to look
out for when buying one of these
especially spend a bunch of money and
make sure that the back of the screen
the backlit screen does work that is a
huge thing obviously it's not a Game Boy
light unless the screen actually lights
up anyway guys that's my review of the
Game Boy light it's pretty cool Game Boy
really one of those rare ones that you
know you'd never see these days and most
people never even heard of but anyway
guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
