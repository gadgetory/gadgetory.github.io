worth it so usually when it comes to a
budget laptop you're not getting a lot
sure you're gonna get a usual screen and
enough specs to handle basic tasks but
this is a slightly different take on a
budget laptop so immediately you can
feel that that is actual metal
I hope it's metal so this is also
fanless which means that well there are
no fans no vents nothing like that it's
also fairly lightweight the bottom of
the laptop is plastic but I've got to
say this does not feel like a 400 laptop
there's a lot of accessories there's
literally a single power brick as far as
ports go it has the standard variety but
what's interesting is the USB type-c
port so the first thing is trying to
charge a Nexus 6p which also uses images
boom
charging whoo charging rapidly all right
next is some laptop inception so if I
connect these to the USBC cable up this
charging one nice thing about the vivo
book is that it has Windows 10 signature
edition so what that means is if you go
through you'll find it it's a pretty
clean install of Windows now you will
find a couple base ESU's apps that
already been put installed but for the
most part your guys see any bloatware
browser performance really isn't bad I
mean sure you can tell a slight
difference with a higher powered desktop
but honestly for like most tasks it
doesn't you trip up at all the viga book
also has AC Wi-Fi and so you can see
here it's pretty quick so that's one of
the nice things about lower in laptops
especially in the last year to the Wi-Fi
has cut so much better as far as space
go we have an Intel Pentium in 3700 now
this might not be the most powerful CPU
in the world it's closer to an atom than
a core however it is reasonably powerful
its quad core and it can clock up to 2.4
gigahertz it also has 4 gigabytes of
memory now that might not be spectacular
but again this is a 400 laptop for
storage we have a 128 gigabyte SSD you
know what technically is an SSD
in real world use it's much more similar
to what you would find inside your phone
it's decent it's about the same as what
you would get with a normal hard drive
but there are still advantages it's much
smaller than a hard drive it's going to
be more reliable especially if you
happen to drop your laptop not that fast
though
this is definitely not a gaming PC or
for lighter titles especially
browser-based games like agario it seems
to run just fine
what the what is that next up I'm going
to try csgo I mean it's not the greatest
gaming experience I've ever tried but
this is totally playable mind you I am
playing at 720p on low settings for 400
hours I wasn't exactly expecting a
really great gaming laptop but this is
fine so as long as you can't keep your
expectations low I don't expect to be
able to play crysis at max settings or
anything as far as the screen goes we
have a 14 inch 1080p display it's
actually pretty solid now the colors
especially the contrast isn't quite as
nice as what you would get on a
higher-end laptop but most laptops this
size and especially this price have a
much lower resolution screen so having a
full 1080p is a big bonus there is one
area where you can notice a budget price
and that is with the VGA webcam now
honestly this is sort of castable for a
quick video chat but honestly you could
do a lot better if you flip the laptop
over you'll see there two downward
firing speakers they're actually not bad
they're a little bit on the quiet side
but I've heard a lot worse out of a
laptop
this is definitely not a perfect laptop
when you get to this kind of price range
a lot of times you're dealing with a lot
of compromises this actually checks a
lot of the boxes it's built pretty well
there's still some plastic in there it's
a lot better than what you would usually
expect the specs are decent again
nothing spectacular the screen is good
there's a lot of things that are solid
right did I get anything amazing it's
not the best laptop that you've ever
seen or $400 you could do a lot worse
than the vive bull as always I'll have a
link to check this guy on the
description and you guys should
definitely go check out some of the
other is it worth of episodes that
you've missed maybe guys thank you so
much for watching and I will catch you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
