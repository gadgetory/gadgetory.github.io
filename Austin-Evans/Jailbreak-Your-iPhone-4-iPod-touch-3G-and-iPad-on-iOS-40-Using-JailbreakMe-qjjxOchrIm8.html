showing you how to jailbreak your iPhone
iPod Touch or iPad so guys before I
begin this is going to be a very simple
jailbreak but I want to just let you
know what will work and what won't so if
you have an iPod Touch will work with
any iPod Touch except the first
generation and you jitney just need to
be on iOS 4 okay it's not it's not
currently support iOS 4.1 so if you're
on a beta you do need to downgrade
likewise if you're on any iPhone 2g
except the 2g if you're on the 3G 3GS or
the iPhone 4 you're all set I gotta do
this run this again on iOS 4 if you're
on the iPad it will work on 3.2.1 okay
so to begin all you have to do is just
going to Safari okay so guys so this
actually is a very simple browser-based
jailbreak so guys what you'll need to do
is you'll need to come to jailbreak me
calm leave go ahead and come to
jailbreak me calm and all you guys do is
slide the jailbreak then you just need
to give it a minute and it will download
this actually uses a PDF based exploit
so it's actually really cool and it runs
entirely inside the browser so you don't
need to hook up to a computer or run any
programs basically all you will need to
do beforehand is just plug it into the
computer you will need to go ahead and
just sync it with iTunes just in case
something goes wrong and then just go
ahead and let download and run through
so guys I'm gonna go ahead this server
is just a little bit slower now so I'll
go ahead and let it finish downloading
and there we go those done downloading
and now it's just jailbreaking
so guys look I take mint so I'll be
right back as soon as it's done okay
guys so they're really just finished up
yeah now it says city has been added to
the home screen so we go ahead and click
OK I mean we'll just kind of talk a
little bit about it what's the jailbreak
on kind of stuff but that's not a big
deal
come over here we have Cydia guys so
that is the full jailbreak right there
but open up cydia and I'm sure it will
take a minute to go ahead and load so go
ahead and just give it a minute but yeah
guys that's it go ahead and get city is
loaded for the first time and we are
joking guys seriously spirit the
original spirit was really really fast
but I've got to say this one was even
faster so it's really really great and I
definitely highly recommend guys go
ahead and check it out if you're on 4.0
definitely go ahead hit Lincoln
go ahead and go to jail bring me calm on
your iPhone iPod Touch or iPad you'll be
all set to go anyway guys thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
