you how to install preware on your HP
TouchPad this is a pretty simple
procedure it's very similar to
jailbreaking or routing and will allow
you to install patches and apps and all
kinds of stuff on your HP TouchPad so
before I begin there's a couple things
you will need obviously you're going to
need your HP TouchPad you should be
running the three-point appoint to
firmware which is the most recent
version in addition to that you'll need
the original USB cable that came with
the touchpad and a Windows or Mac
computer so to start with it's going to
be we're going to need to open up and
put it into developer mode so let's go
ahead and do it going to be web OS and
it's going to be two thousand nine then
0606 and when you put this in you'll see
the launch developer mode go ahead and
tap on that let it open up and then we
just need to enable it so why didn't
click this turn on as far as the this we
can just ignore the developer mode
password we can just hit submit and give
it just one moment and we're good to go
okay so now that our touchpad is in
developer mode all we need to do is
connect it via USB to our computer
ignoring any USB Drive options and then
we can go ahead and begin so you're
going to be one program to do this it's
going to be called webos quick install
now i have a link in the description of
the video where you can download this
but of course it's very simple so it's
going to be is going to be the exact
same file for both windows and mac so
you're going to need to open it up and
the first time you open it up it will
ask you to install a few drivers that
shouldn't take just a minute but once
you go ahead and do that it should pop
up now over here on the right hand side
you should see device so it should
automatically see your HP TouchPad so
once you have this go ahead and just
click this button here and we'll
download and parse all the packages that
you need and this will take just a
couple of minutes and here we go so now
we're basically done you'll see a lot of
things for example services plugins and
all this kind of stuff which is very
helpful over what we're going to be
doing is allowing us to install all this
on the device so if we scroll down here
and in fact we'll just type it in pretty
where and the search is we'll see you
right here now what pretty where is is
kind of like cydia for the touchpad so
instead of having to use this to install
all the apps that you want you can do it
straight from the device from freeware
so we need to just need to hit install
hit connecting and will download and
that
pretty much it guys it's very very
simple just need to install it and after
you do this you can just install all the
apps and mods and whatever you like from
the touch pad so there we go okay so
once we have preware installed it is
super easy I need to do is open up your
applications it should be the first
thing in your downloads and just open it
up so once you open it up it will go
ahead and give you some things example
some tips and all that kind of stuff but
we're obviously experts let's just go
ahead and continue it will install all
the stuff for the very first time and
that's it so you guys can see oh it's
just going to be finding all the
different kinds of packages and whatnot
we just did on the computer but of
course it's going to be all on the touch
pad so we can install whatever we want
so anyway guys it'll ask you if you want
to do that obviously we do and we go so
if we want we can go through available
packages just like on the computer
example find good patches or anything
else that you like anyway guys that's it
for my tutorial showing you how to
install preware on your HP TouchPad like
this has a very very simple procedure a
lot easier than a lot of jailbreaks and
roots and will allow you to install
pretty much anything you want no problem
