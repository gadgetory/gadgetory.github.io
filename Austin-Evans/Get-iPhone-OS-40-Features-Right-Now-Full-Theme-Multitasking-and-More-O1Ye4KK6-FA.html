oh just was announced and shown off
yesterday and brought a lot of really
cool features well what some people
don't know is that if you jailbreak your
iphone or ipod touch you can get these
features immediately in fact a lot of us
who have jailbroken have been enjoying
these features for years so in this
video i'm going to go ahead and show you
guys how to very quickly and very simply
go ahead and get many of the very cool
features such as customizable
backgrounds um see the very nice dog you
saw really quick and easy multitasking
as well as in folders one go ahead and
show you guys how to get all this very
quickly and very simply anyway let's get
this one started okay so the first step
is going to be to jailbreak your iphone
or ipod touch now if you've never joke
broken before it can be a little bit
intimidating really it's not all that
bad okay now if you look on the screen
and now i'm going to have an annotation
go ahead and click that that will bring
you to my video on how to jailbreak with
redsnow redsnow is a fantastic jailbreak
program really really really solid you
shouldn't have any problems whatsoever
so go ahead pause video right now and
click on the annotation we'll head watch
the video make sure that you do have the
right device and go ahead and jailbreak
it they're already jailbroken good job
now we'll go ahead and go on to the next
step okay so now that you have a
jailbroken iphone or ipod touch you
ready to go on and get all the really
cool add-ons and mods okay so the first
thing that you're going to need to do is
open up cydia it should be this icon
right here just click on it get them at
load and you will be at this screen so
now you can see on the bottom you have
five tabs very simply go over to manage
okay and come to sources come to edit
you if you if this is if you're brand
new to jailbreaking you will not have
these but it's no big deal just come up
here to edit and then click Add okay now
we are going to add a source don't worry
about how this works what other sources
were basically just ways to get
different packages themes all kind of
stuff basically just where you get it
from okay so we're going to want you to
go ahead
type this down I'll have it in the
description of underwater whether they
called these days it is paji locom so
p.o.d you l 0 dot com okay just punch an
exactly like that click Add source okay
just a minute and then it will update
the source and download all the goodies
from it and get you all set up so just
give it a minute now be right back hey
guys so now basically should just
redirect you right back to where you
were and now you should see the pod
euless repo okay so as long as you see
it you should be 110 good to go now that
we have the repo all we have to do is
come over here to search more you're
going to download for packages okay the
first one you're going to want to go
ahead and do is this is I theme that i
actually created last night it's
basically an iphone OS 4.0 theme so keep
in mind when you do search in cydia
again if you're new to this the keyboard
legs like crazy so don't worry about
it's not dying anything just type it
very slowly just type an iphone you can
type faster just like a bunch okay it's
space OS mm-hmm and there you go and
there's a few things in here but what
you need to look for is the iphone OS
4.0 thing okay you should say from pod
euless quite click on and then you will
be brought to this screen again I made
this theme it's not a very in-depth
thing but iphone OS four point oh isn't
you know a ton of amazing stuff so
basically this is just just going to
allow you to take a look at it so scroll
through here and you can read a little
bit of the description I'm you're gonna
check out download stats and screenshots
but obviously you guys going to about to
see this in a second so I got to do is
come up and hit install and then then
basically just hit confirm I already had
this on my device so I'll do it just
confirming you should be good okay so
the next thing you'll need is reflective
doc little simply just like we did
before type in reflective in there
reflective doc will come up ahead and
click on and install it you will need to
it will respring your device meaning it
will shut off for a second and turn back
on no big deal okay soon as you get that
completed
go ahead and go ahead and let your
device shutdown then go ahead and open
up cydia and i will show you the next
thing you need to install so the third
package you will be installing is
proswitcher and it might be a couple
different pro switchers and to be honest
really doesn't matter they should all be
the exact same thing so go ahead just
like before go ahead and open it install
it read spring your device and then come
right back here to cydia so the last
package you need is going to be
categories now i will mention really
briefly here that this is actually not
necessary all this is is basically will
I to create a folder free apps it's not
going to be the exact same thing as an
iphone OS four point oh it's going to be
some more and if you think that looks
handy go ahead and install categories if
not feel free to not to and you can go
ahead and just enjoy the other parts of
the thing this one's kind of up to you
she's like you might want to try it out
but anyway whether you download this or
not we should be done so as soon as
you've either got had this on your
device or you don't have it on your
device we're ready to go ahead and set
all the stuff up guys so as soon as you
do all this you should be ready to go
now if you now if you don't you don't
know how to jail breaker if you're new
to it all you need to do is open up
winterboard it should only take a second
click select themes and then you should
see there might be a couple others I
have a lot here but I'm you should see
iphone OS four point oh click on it and
then exit and it will go ahead and load
up this theme okay now reflective duck
should be activated already so you
should see the doc you should see all
the icons are reflective and if I want
looks why I want to move them the iconic
shins still stay which is very cool
you'll have that and then you'll have
this full thing back creating so now you
have the look of it proswitcher should
also be all set up you really shouldn't
have to worry about it and to reduce
proswitcher it's extremely simple just
go ahead and open up any app will say
come so just quite an open up terminal
of course this could be any app I will
note that if you do have some apps it
can kind of hurt your formats and lat
lag and glitch a little bit so you know
don't have 50 apps up and stuff because
it can kind of get a little bad but I
told you guys can figure that out
now proswitcher is a little bit little
odd you can you can change on that odd
you can change how to activate it I have
it all you have to do is go into options
and proswitcher that's really simple I
have it set where I want to double put
the home button it brings it up and as
soon as you do that is back rounded so
I'll go ahead and open it up and then
kill it but if I double click the home
button it's still there and then I can
open it up still do you know whatever I
want or if I just want to kill it and
just click the X it's gone it says no
apps running so I just go ahead and hit
it it's okay now categories is a little
bit different the course is optional
really personally I don't like
categories that much but I think I go
ahead and show you guys to do it just
open up the application hit manage
folder and as I said it's you can be a
little dangerous if you don't know what
you're doing you can hit edit and then
you can go ahead and create a category
title move apps into it and then
basically when you click on it all it's
a full cat folder for your apps I'm not
going to do that I don't really like
quatorze to be honest they're not that
little clunky but if you do want the
full iphone OS 4.0 experience it's
pretty handy so that guys that is my
video on how to get a lot of the really
cool features from iphone OS 4.0 onto
your iphone or ipod touch right now for
free you know of course not perfect but
personally I like it a lot I mean like
for example the pro switcher I mean this
is an ipod touch 2nd generation one of
the models that supposedly can't do
multitasking according to Apple well you
guys you saw it right now so I mean you
know it's and I mean if you have
especially heavy like an original device
I device such as like original iphone
original ipod touch this is fantastic
for you guys so hopefully this helped
anyway thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
