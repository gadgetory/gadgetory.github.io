today I've got a video that should be
pretty interesting a lot more has come
out about the Microsoft kurtter
Microsoft's take on the tablet space
which obviously just about everybody's
getting into you know obviously the
Apple iPad and just about everyone else
including Sony which my latest video was
about actually so if you guys remember a
few months ago they had a video and so a
lot of information came out about the
courier and you know it really got a lot
of people excited well so today a bunch
more information has come out including
more pictures more information some
stuff has changed and a lot more so I'm
going to cover it all for you guys
anyway let's get this one started
okay so before we begin let me just give
you guys a quick background on the
Microsoft courier it's a bit different
from normal tablets and the fact that
instead of being you know a single
screen and a single you know just one
flat thing it's actually more of like a
notebook where it has two different
screens on the left and right and it
folds so really you actually walk around
and pull it it's kind of like a notebook
and when you open it up you have the two
screens on either side now the really
cool thing is is that the curse
interface is almost entirely designed
around you know using a pen now a lot of
people like styluses who i don't want to
use my finger but the way this works
it's pretty cool it's basically really
really heavily designed around
handwriting recognition you know it
actually will you know read where like
you know you write something down and
you know let's say I write down iPad
okay we're gonna all I have to do is
search write down search iPad and it
will flip through all my pages into it
and while I'm on the subject I might as
well go ahead the interface itself is
really really really nice it all is
centered around you know like a very
like like a book almost they you know a
notebook or whatever you want to say I'm
you know it's a lot has to do with you
know pages turning and a lot of stuff
like that which really makes it unique
and very very cool
okay so as you guys can see the
interface is extremely cool you know
those are the official renders well
they're elite renders but I mean
obviously they're real so you guys can
really get a sense of how it's gonna
work and how it really mean II looks
solid so what we know about it when it
first that was leaked it was going to be
running on Windows 7 but since then
there have been some changes apparently
and instead they decided to go with a
Windows Mobile 7 it's going to be around
it's the same
one is that as well as off of the Zune
HD so it's going to be more of a mobile
focus platform but that's okay
obviously the iPad is done and several
others are doing it and to be honest I
personally think that even though you
know desktop is great I like Windows 7
or XP or whatever tablets really need
the room so you know when you go and try
to put Windows 7 everything on it I can
see how you know it's gonna be a lot
harder to get an interface like that ok
so that's about all we know about the
Microsoft career right now you know it
just looked really really great anything
between the fact that it's going to have
that very unique folding design which
you know is pretty much the best of both
worlds so far we don't know everything
and but I mean to me that sounded like a
great idea the interface looks amazing I
don't know so much about really being
focused on the pen you know and drawing
stuff but still I think that has a lot
of potential and as long as you actually
can use your finger and you know just
use a pen for meetings like the
intricate stuff you know I will not have
a problem with it whatsoever so just
about the only thing really the we're
waiting for is you know an official word
or something because officially this
doesn't exist well just like you know
every other company is not gonna say oh
that's not exist until actually they're
ready to announce it but what we do know
is that it will likely probably be
released and you know the fall or the
winter so really I think that this fall
winter the end of the year is going to
be really filled with a lot of solid
tablets you're really just going to be
excellent so guys that's about all we
know about Korea right now be sure to
subscribe to the channel I will
definitely keep you updated with
everything
Microsoft Courier tablets tech you know
all that kind of stuff so yeah anyway
guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
