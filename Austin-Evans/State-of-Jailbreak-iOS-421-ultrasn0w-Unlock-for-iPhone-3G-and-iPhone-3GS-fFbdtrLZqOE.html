another state of jailbreak video today I
want to go ahead and give you guys a big
update the iphone dev team has just
released the latest update to ultrasnow
basically this update allows you to go
ahead and unlock your iphone 3g your
iphone 3gs the latest firmware and the
latest baseband i know this is gonna be
really helpful for a lot of you guys who
you know got caught out accidentally
upgraded or for whatever reason you know
you're you're on a new firmware and new
baseband and you cannot unlock however
this is going to be a little bit of a
different unlock it's not going to be no
just the standard new jailbreak you know
run ultrasnow gonna be a little bit more
complicated than that so basically this
actually is both huge first of all huge
props to the iphone dev team for finding
this for coming up with a really cool
idea instead of just you know doing a
standard you know finding and exploit
and all that kind of good stuff
basically they're going to go ahead and
allow you to take the baseband from the
ipad 3g so you actually go ahead and
take that baseband put it on your iphone
and then on ultrasnow con sounds crazy
but actually will work just fine you
don't have to worry about it because
they do have practically identical parts
but like i said this is going to be a
little bit of a different unlock so let
me go ahead and tell you some of the
cons of doing this the first thing
there's not going to be any way to go
ahead and downgrade so if there's any
kind of new updates to the baseband that
helps you know if you have any issues
whatever you're not going to be able to
get them until apple go ahead goes ahead
and increases the baseband beyond the
current version that you're going to do
a little complicated i know so you
definitely don't need to be you know you
need to be at least fairly you know well
versed in bass bands and unlocking all
that kind of stuff to do this because
there are some things you definitely
have to pay attention to another thing
is is that after four point two point
one once you do this and you have the
unlock you're never going to be able to
restore to a normal firmware and this is
going to be a bit of a problem you know
you can't go ahead and restore to a
standard firmware what you'll need to do
is you can only restore to custom ipsw
using either snow buries or I believe
snowbreeze I'm not 100 sure but I
believe it will be snowbreeze and at
least pwnage tool so that's definitely a
fairly big downside however if like I
said if you're currently unlocked or you
I need to be unlocked you know that's
probably going to your only option for
the moment so the way you're going to do
this is fairly simple I of course will
have all the download links everything
you need in the description of this
video you're going to need to go ahead
and download the ipad ipsw file and this
is really key you need to download this
almost immediately Apple could take this
down at any time and then you will
pretty much out of luck you won't be
able to download the iPad I guess W so
again go ahead check it out everything
is in the description download the ipsw
file then you're going to need to run
pwnage tool now of course punish tool is
mac only for the moment so if you do
have a windows computer you're going to
need to go ahead and wait for redsnow
now I've heard the vegetable probably
out today so odds are by the time you
watch this video i will also have a link
to ultra to rather head snow in the
description after that you can go ahead
and just run them through and then
install ultrasnow so once you do that
it's going to be fairly simple however
do keep in mind that there are some
fairly big downsides to this so only do
this if you absolutely need to have your
unlock you know if you're already
unlocked in your not having any issues
definitely do not do this you know you
just wait for some other way to update I
really don't recommend that the only way
I do is if you really need your unlock
today and you're on the latest baseband
I'm sorry guys that's it just wanted to
give you guys a full update on what's
all going on here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
