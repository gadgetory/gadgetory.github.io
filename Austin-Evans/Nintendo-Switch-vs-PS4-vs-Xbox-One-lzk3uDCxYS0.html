been just a couple of new consoles
released over the last few months but
the question is which one is right for
you first of all we have the brand new
Nintendo switch but firstly this might
look like a weird sort of comparison to
make as of course this is much more
portable than something like ps4 but the
big advantage of the switch is it not
only can you use it in portable mode but
once you're ready you drop it on the
dock and it is every bit the console
that's something like a ps4 Xbox is for
about the same money is the switch
though not only can you pick up an Xbox
one S but you could also pick up a ps4
slim so let's find out which one is
going to be best for you if you cut the
isn't worth that episode on the switch
you'll know that I really like it so I
think Nintendo did a great job of
blending all the best parts of a
portable console with something that can
totally work as a traditional game
console drop it on the dock and of
course you have your full HDMI output
but when you're ready to go play on the
go it's as simple as just picking it
right up portability really is a huge
selling point for the switch now sure it
might not be as graphically impressive
as something like a ps4 Xbox but keep in
mind that this is a very small very thin
what's essentially a gaming tablet it is
really cool to have a proper game
console that you can take with you
everywhere it really does set the switch
apart from the competition speaking of
flexibility one of the coolest parts of
the switch are the joy con controllers
so as simple as just sliding them right
off the side you get two fully
independent controllers that you can use
like this or drop them on more of a
traditional grip that looks a lot more
like a controller honestly though using
them in the fully independent
configuration I feel like works really
well you can easily scroll through your
games it's nice to be able to kind of
have that freedom to do dance moves
while you play the switch don't do that
it's a bad idea
of course the switch is not perfect as a
brand new game console the biggest issue
is the game library there just aren't
that many games out for this guy yet
essentially right now this is a three
hundred dollar Zelda machine that's not
exactly a bad thing breath of the wild
is a terrific game but if you want to
play things like Super Mario Odyssey
splatoon 2 or Mario Kart you're going to
be waiting a while the feature is
already looking a lot more bright for
the switch than it ever did for the Wii
U but you have to keep your expectations
in check now sure they're going to be
lots of great Nintendo titles for the
switch and there is some promising
third-party support coming however this
is never going to be your primary
console to play games like mad
battlefield or call of duty that is
where the Xbox one comes in
so the 1s is an updated version for 2016
where you're getting a much slimmer
console with an integrated power supply
and some key upgrades including 4k and
Ultra HD blu-ray support but most
importantly this is a game console even
though the Xbox one is technically $300
you can usually find it for less than
that for example right now on Amazon
there's a minecraft Xbox one s bundle
which costs only 240 dollars this is a
lot of console for that cheap and since
the Xbox has been out for a few years
it's seen a lot of major updates since
the original version including support
for some Xbox 360 games a ton of
accessories a pretty decent game library
and my personal favorite is the
controller I really do feel like the
Xbox one controller is one of the best
ever for that kind of price you can pick
up an Xbox one ass and a few games it's
still going to cost you less than the
switch by itself but there's more to the
Xbox than just gaming the Xbox one has
always had a fairly strong media focus
with an HDMI IN port to connect it to
something like a cable box so you can
control it all from one spot but with
the Xbox one s you're getting not only
4k support so for example you can watch
Netflix and 4k on this but it also can
handle HDR as well as it has an Ultra HD
blu-ray player something you're not
going to find on any other console and
just look at it I honestly feel like the
Xbox one especially in white is such a
classy clean looking console especially
compared to some of its competition I
mean just look at the ps4 might be a
solid console but looks wise this is
kind of like someone took a ps4 Pro and
just chop it in half but there's a lot
more to the ps4 slim than just the looks
so like the Xbox 1s this was released a
few months ago and while technically
it's a $300 console again if you go on
Amazon it's not difficult to find
something like this for about 260 bucks
and that includes a full copy of
uncharted 4 one of the big advantages of
the ps4 though is performance this is
hands down the most powerful console
that you can buy today now that is
really going to be noticeable
on a lot of multi-platform games
typically if a game runs on Xbox and ps4
it's either going to run at a higher
resolution or better frame rate when
you're playing on the PlayStation the
ps4 also has a lot of exclusive titles
so games like Uncharted 4 horizon zero
dawn Gran Turismo
these are all only going to be found on
the ps4
sure a lot of times you can say it works
better on PC but really with the ps4
you're getting a lot of games that you
just cannot get elsewhere something else
going for the ps4 is PlayStation VR now
this is the most affordable proper VR
headset that you can get and while is by
no means cheap it is an easy way for you
to get into VR and honestly there are
some pretty decent titles available on
it it might not be a must-have just yet
but it's only going to continue to get
better there are plenty of reasons to
pick up any of these consoles what it
really comes down to are the games there
is no talking about the switch without
looking at breath of the wild I think
some people get a little bit caught up
with the idea that since this is
essentially a tablet and inside the
switch it's running a basically tablet
processor then it is not in the same
league as the ps4 Xbox one but one look
at breath of the wild should really kind
of tell you otherwise
yes graphically it is not quite on par
but it's still more powerful than
something like a 360 or ps3 and just
look at this this is a really nice
looking game so yeah if you look closely
you'll see the resolution is a little
bit down at 900p the lack of
anti-aliasing can mean there are a few
rough edges especially with all the
sharp grass and whatnot around but the
most important thing is this is a
different style of console you can pick
it up take it with you wherever I think
all that said Nintendo did a good job of
blending sort of portability with power
as I try not to die that's that's a good
software wise the switch is an
improvement over the Wii U but the real
issue is a lack of actual titles to play
so not only are there not a ton of games
that you can actually play on the switch
but on top of that there's really not a
lot of other stuff you can do there's no
Netflix there's no youtube there's no
web browser now a lot of this stuff is
coming soon but for now this is the
Zelda machine moving over to the Xbox
one there are quite a few exclusive
titles but my favorite is definitely the
fort's of series I have a soft spot for
racing games and I feel like forts that
does a good job of blending some of the
fun stuff with our horizon with some of
the more serious stuff like rock band
for rock band 4 is an excellent game
what just happened
what
the Xbox is at a disadvantage compared
to the ps4 on a multi-platform stuff but
it's not a huge difference sometimes
you'll notice maybe a little bit of a
resolution drop but for the most part
you're getting a very similar experience
and if you really like games like Forza
it's not a bad console to get one big
advantage for the Xbox is in software
another do I feel like it does the best
job of handling things like multitasking
but the video apps are solid there's a
good selection but more importantly
you're able to get 4k out which is
something you can't do on the
PlayStation unless you upgrade to a ps4
pro games are absolutely the strong suit
of the ps4 so exclusive titles like
horizon zero dawn now I look incredible
but there are a lot of games that you
will just not find anywhere else besides
the PlayStation 4 developers have done a
great job of taking advantage of the
extra horsepower up the ps4 and while I
sound like a broken record here there
are so many titles that are just only on
ps4 that are absolutely worth the
playing software wise there's not a lot
to complain about with the ps4 the menu
is snappy there are a few cool features
such as Spotify as well as you have
PlayStation now if you want to stream
games and the video apps are completely
fine
the thing you're really missing here is
just that 4k support there are totally
legit reasons to pick up any of these
consoles the switch is something
legitimately different and has tons of
potential the Xbox has the media side
down and still has a lot of great games
and the ps4 is hands-down one of the
best places to play games period
assuming of course you don't have a PC
so which console would you guys go with
let me know in the comments below and I
will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
