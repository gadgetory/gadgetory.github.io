here with the top 5 coolest new gaming
tech from GDC this year and number 5 we
have the new steam machines and
controller while it'll be just a little
while before we see steam machines start
popping up in the wild that was showing
off the latest version of their
controller at GDC this time they've
dropped the touchscreen in favor of a
d-pad and standard Xbox like buttons
they work well enough although the
position is a little weird due to the
touch pads speaking of this is a very
different controller than what you're
probably used to built in or what are
essentially 2.click pads that work
similarly to a trackpad you just swipe
instead of pushing a stake and for the
most part it works that said it
definitely takes some getting used to so
there's a bit of feedback when you swipe
on the pads almost a little bit like
rolling a ball in an arcade cabinet
while I will be playing titanfall with
this steam controller any time soon you
will be seeing steam machines before
much longer the show valve had their own
custom boxes that they sent to beta
testers with a seriously overkill GTX
780 inside there was also a much more
reasonable Intel iris Pro box from
gigabyte which is much more like the
steam machines that you'll be seeing at
launch coming in at number 4 is the new
DirectX 12 if you're not a game
developer and the DirectX might not be
the most exciting thing in the world but
it's actually a fairly big deal so if
you're not familiar DirectX is
essentially the glue that goes between a
game and your computer DirectX 11 is
what most games on the PC and Xbox one
are using these days however dx12 plans
to crack open even more performance if
you guys follow PC gaming you'll
probably have heard of AMD's mantle
which allows you to get extra
performance in games like Battlefield 4
well DirectX 12 is very very similar to
mantle except that it'll be working
across both gaming pcs the Xbox one and
even some windows phones and tablets
it works by allowing developers to dig
deeper into the hardware which is
helpful especially in CPU bound games
unfortunately it'll be just a little
while before it comes out so games based
on directx12 should start shipping late
next year
for both the PC as well as Xbox one well
it might not be an enormous improvement
I'll definitely take some free
performance when I can get it at number
three we have a pair of accessories the
virtuix Omni and pre OVR we'll all the
craziness around virtual reality at GDC
this year there are also some very cool
add-ons pretty OVR
is essentially a ton of motion sensors
you strap on to be able to use your
entire body in a game the version I
tried was a very early prototype with
wires all over the place and using a
couple wee controllers hacked together
once you strap in you're all set and the
demo I tried was full of smashing
zombies all together it feels a little
bit like the Wii as well as the Kinect
kind of mixed into one so the motion
tracking definitely wasn't perfect
everyone at work it was actually pretty
cool on the flip side we've got virtuix
Omni the best way to describe it would
be a stationary treadmill that
translates your movements into the game
put on the special low friction shoes
and buckle yourself into the harness and
you're ready to go they had a couple
demos but the best one was with oculus
and a gun accessory which makes you run
on the omni to move in the game well I
definitely wouldn't be playing fallout 3
on the Omni it's a very cool concept and
if they're able to figure out a way to
make it a little bit smaller so it
doesn't take up half your room it could
be very cool at number two we have the
new oculus rift Developer Kit 2 with the
big news that Facebook is bought oculus
there's been a ton of internet uproar
however that the topic for another video
what is new is the latest developer kit
at GDC based on the Crystal Cove
prototype I did a video on back at CES
this latest oculus pairs an OLED 1080p
screen inside the headset to deliver the
best VR experience yet built in or
motion sensors like you would find it a
phone to keep track of your movement and
new our series of IR lights that are
hidden all over the oculus that an
included camera tracks you with so you
can really move in full 3d space if you
haven't tried Virtual Reality yet oculus
really is the place to start the screen
has gotten so much better as has the
tracking and the feeling of being
entirely immersed in the game is so
awesome
on top of that the new developer kit 2
is actually on sale now so you can
pre-order it it should be shipping in
the next couple months it runs you a
fairly reasonable $350
finally at number one we have the sony
project Morpheus for the ps4 this was
easily the biggest draw of GDC as there
are a ton of people who are really and
see what so do you would do with first
for reality though wanting to try it
wrapped around the booth the second the
show floor opened and for good reason
one look at Morpheus and it looks like
someone shopped the - Punk helmet up and
it kind of works admittedly it's way
bigger than the oculus or even the
pictures show but once you put it on
you'll find it's pretty impressive it's
also featuring a 1080p screen which
looks good although not quite up to the
oculus
but then again Morpheus is a very early
prototype one of the big advantages of
Sony is that they have all kinds of tech
that they can pick up right off the
shelf with a standard PlayStation camera
the ps4 is able to track your motion
thanks to the bright LEDs on the headset
the light bar inside the ps4 controller
can also be used depending on the game
and they also had a demo with the
PlayStation Move which works decently
but is about the dirtiest thing I've
ever seen right now Morpheus is
connected via couple cables however Sony
said they'd like to actually make it
Wireless by the time it ships
regardless it's awesome to see Sony
jumping in big time and bringing virtual
reality to a console so what do you guys
think is there anything at GDC that
you're excited for let me know in the
