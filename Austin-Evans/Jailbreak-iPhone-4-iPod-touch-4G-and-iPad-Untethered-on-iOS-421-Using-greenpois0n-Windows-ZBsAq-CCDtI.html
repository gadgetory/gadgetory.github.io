tutorial showing you how to jailbreak
your iphone ipod touch or ipad on four
point two point one from running windows
so the way we're going to be doing it
today is using green poison which is the
latest jailbreak tool and it's going to
be your best debt before can i do want
to mention a couple of things first of
all using green poison you are going to
need only a couple of devices it
supports almost all but not quite it
will support the ipod touch 2nd
generation doesn't matter nvm see model
all ipod touch 2nd generations are
supported same goes for the ipod touch
3rd generation the ipod touch 4th
generation the iphone 3gs doesn't matter
what boo grommet is the iphone 4 as well
as the ipad now what this does not
support is the iphone 3g so if you have
that 3g you're not going to be able to
do this it also does not support the
Apple TV yet Apple TV support will be
coming very soon now do keep in mind
that you will need to be on iOS 4.2
point 14 this geo back to work if you're
on some earlier version you're going to
need to update and then run the
jailbreak so without any further ado
let's just go ahead and jump straight on
into it the first thing I wanted to need
to do is go ahead and download
greenpoison for your Windows computer I
will have a link in the description the
servers are getting hamburger now so
i'll have a couple of different lengths
if one of them isn't working just try
the other and you should be able to get
a no problem okay so now that you have
greenpoison download it's going to be
pretty simple now before we begin there
is just one last step i do want to
mention now while this is not necessary
I definitely do recommend that you take
a connect your device obviously via USB
I'm connect it and let it fully sync up
with itunes now you should not lose your
data in this jailbreak but as a general
rule of thumb i always recommend back
your stuff up it's not going to do just
going to take just a meant to do it and
that way no matter what happens you will
be covered so if for Sam for some reason
the jailbreak goes wrong all you I do
plug your device in restore you have all
your data back and you're good to go I'm
any rate yeah go ahead and just plug
your device in rut you know what go
ahead and sink all ready to begin so as
you guys can see here i am on four point
two point one now what we're going to be
doing today is putting it into dfu mode
so i recommend going ahead just shutting
off your the device make sure it's
totally off
I give just a minute here and then we're
going to go ahead and go through this
steps for dfu mode so we're all good now
over here and great boys it will go
ahead and tell you to prepare to
jailbreak we're going to need to press
the hold hold hold the power button I'm
sorry hold the power button for about
three seconds then hold the home button
as well for ten seconds release the
power button continue holding the home
button until it says if we're good to go
so let's just go and do it i will tell
you guys how to do it and of course walk
you through it and there's old timer
here so we'll click on this so get ready
three two one start holding the home
button power button and now we're
holding the power and the home button
for 10 seconds be sure to keep a firm
hold on if you have a case you might
want to remove it because it's easy to
lose a button you have to restart and
we're now we're going to release the
power button and continue holding the
home button so it says 15 seconds
usually doesn't take quite that long
will widen continue holding it and there
we go so as you can see if we can just
set our device down and says we're ready
to jailbreak and it will hit the
jailbreak button so glad you to move
this over and show you guys the process
will hit jailbreak it'll take just a
moment here to get all set up but we're
pretty much done now all we got to do is
just give greenpoison a few minutes see
the loading screen will go through and
it will go ahead and run some lines of
code but as soon as you get it to this
point you know that we're good so I'll
go ahead and just cut and I'll be right
back as soon as it's done ok so just
finished so that was pretty simple now
there's like one more step and we're
going to be good to go so you should see
a brand new app on your home screen
called loader I need to open this up and
what we need to do is download City this
should be very simple all you need to do
is just tap on city and click install
now it will get it will download this
should not take very long and install so
as soon as this is done we'll be good to
go ok so after a quick respring you
should now see cydia on your device
