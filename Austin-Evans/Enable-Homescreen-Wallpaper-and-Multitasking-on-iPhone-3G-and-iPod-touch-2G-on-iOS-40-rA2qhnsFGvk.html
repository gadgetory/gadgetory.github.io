guys a tutorial on how to enable both
your background wallpaper as well as
multitasking on your either your iPhone
3G or your iPod Touch second generation
now of course I just did a video on
jailbreak me if you guys want to check
that out an all-in-one jailbreak
solution really fantastic but the one
downside to using JailbreakMe is that
you cannot actually go ahead and enable
these features and your iPhone or iPod
Touch MA
so guys want to do is I'm going to show
you guys a fairly brief tutorial on how
to do it it's not all that difficult so
let's go ahead and get this one started
okay so once you have city open we're
just going to need to search for an
application and this is AI file so go
ahead over to search and then type in AI
file will be a little bit laggy so there
we go there's the one it should say from
Big Boss so go ahead click on it now I
will mention that right now actually as
you see it with the spinning wheel it is
taking a little while to go ahead and
download from Big Boss so if it does
take a minute and just leave it alone on
now it does say free trial it's
commercial package but guys don't worry
you do not have to pay for this at all
you can go ahead and use the free
version of it as long as you want it's
just entirely optional to go ahead and
pay for it so once it's go ahead and
downloaded go ahead and back out a cydia
okay so just go ahead and open up I file
um now it might now you watch Ana you do
need to go ahead ahead and backspace all
the way out to as far as it'll go and
the back button will disappear okay so
what you're going to need to do is
you're going to need to go to system
then the library thank you scroll down
just a little bit to course services and
lastly springboard app okay so now guys
we're going to be looking for a file let
me just it's a little bit of a hassle
dozen you know scroll through all these
files but it's not a big deal and once
you're once you're in there it's not too
bad so you scroll all the way down then
down and down and right here okay so if
you're on an ipod touch it will say n7
to a PP list if you're on iPhone 3G
we'll say an 82 doesn't matter it works
both the same way so go ahead and click
on this P list file now I'll go ahead
and just show you a bunch of codes not a
big deal which we're going to need to do
is edit and what you need to do is come
down where sue that says accelerometer
right there so as soon as you see
accelerometer and then the truth file
we're going to need to go ahead put it
below that now be sure to not go ahead
and separate these so as you guys can
see so there's going to be a key and
then a true file for each one okay so
what you're gonna do is just tap on and
type it out and I'm gonna go ahead and
show you that there are three different
ones are on rather two different ones
that you're going to be adding so you
guys can see here you're going to want
to type in key Internet I'm sorry key
home screen
- wallpaper then out of key then true
I'll go ahead and have this so you guys
can read it so that is what you're going
to need to do just type that in exactly
as it is just be sure like I said guys
to put it in the right spot go right up
here to where the accelerometer and then
the true is then backspace down once so
for I'm just going to show you because
if you do it wrong you can actually mess
some stuff up so go ahead hit return and
then now you would go ahead and type it
okay so when I go ahead and ignore that
but so you go ahead and put that in for
a home screen wallpaper now if you want
multitasking come on down do you again
you can do it the same way it'll
automatically alphabetize itself so then
you're going to go ahead and do key
multitasking key then true okay
so again go ahead take a look on the
screen that's exactly how to spell it
and everything now guys once you're done
go ahead and hit done and then go ahead
and hit save and then just go ahead and
exit out of your iPhone or iPod Touch
and then go ahead and just manually
reboot it so guys here it is on my iPod
Touch 2nd generation and you obviously
can say ok and jump in settings and show
you guys
we have wallpaper so we can go ahead and
do it however we like so let's just pick
this one I said as both just as a
demonstration I'm sure you guys trust me
but there you guys go and if we go ahead
and double click the home button there
we go we have multitasking
thank you guys it's a little bit of a
complicated tutorial but really it's not
that match and taking more than three or
four minutes to go ahead and complete it
from start to finish and there you go
guys that's how to go ahead and get home
screen wallpaper as well as motive
multitasking on your iPod Touch 2nd
generation or iPhone 3G anyway guys
