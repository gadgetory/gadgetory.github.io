thousand dollar Chromebook which begs
the question why does it even exist this
is the Google pixel book now this is
actually not the first time the Google
has made a high-end Chromebook a few
years ago they make the Chromebook pixel
which is very much an earlier version of
what they've got here to me spending a
thousand dollars on a Chromebook doesn't
make a ton of sense
so really the sweet spot for these is
typically in the two to three hundred
dollar price range there you're getting
pretty decent hardware well yes it's not
going to be quite as usable as something
like a Windows computer for a lot of
people Chrome OS is all you actually
need pop open the box and the first
thing we see is the pixel book itself
actually I will say this is really
unique Hardware for a laptop
unlike basically all other high end
laptops these days that are made out of
aluminum or sometimes stainless instead
you have this sort of glass finish on
the both front as well as back of the
computer if you look at it side by side
with something like a pixel - you'll
definitely see the family resemblance
so port wise there's not going to be a
ton essentially you have one USB C port
on the side as well as a headphone jack
and on the other side you're going to
get one more USB C port so the nice
things about the pixel book is it
actually does share pretty much all this
with the pixel - so in theory you can
use the same charger for your phone and
your laptop pop this guy open and we see
that yeah that is actually rubber this
is such a really designed laptop say
what you want about Chrome OS and
whether it belongs on a $1000 laptop but
this hardware it is really nice yeah I'm
doing a 180 on this computer way too
fast so when I'm here at work a lot of
times I will be using a Windows laptop
to plug it into a USB C monitor but this
hover is so nice I actually might give
the Chromebook up sorry the pixel book a
try well this guy updates something else
you might want to consider is picking up
the pixel book pen so that wasn't a lot
of Chromebook isn't enough you can spend
another $100 on a stylus sometimes it's
hard for me to justify using a stylus on
a computer I know a lot of people like
to be able to take know to do sketching
and stuff on a computer especially with
this guy where you can actually flip the
screen all the way around it might be
helpful but I just don't find a ton of
use for it although this actually does
look nice touchpad firmware update in
progress
keep your hands off the touchpad this
will take around two minutes I have
never seen that in my life what happens
if I touch the touchpad now Oh
Kenneth a bad influence okay a bad
influence inside the pixel book is a
seventh generation Core i5 processor
eight gigabytes of RAM and I 128
gigabyte SSD those are the specs of the
base model that I have here if you want
to upgrade to the model with the core i7
16 gigs of ram and a 512 gig SSD that's
going to run you sixteen hundred and
fifty dollars and of course if you want
the pen don't forget to throw another
$100 on that so what are you getting
with $1000 plus Chromebook well the
hardware like I said is pretty nice so
you do have a fully flexible hinge so
not only can you use it in sort of a
display mode but you can flip it over to
10th or if you want you can use it in
tablet mode you can tell they optimized
this for tablet mode because the bezels
are kind of huge now to be fair when
you're using it like this it does give
you a little bit of space for your
thumbs to sort of rest on the screen but
when you're spending this much money on
a laptop smaller bezels would have been
really nice so it is a twelve point
three inch panel with a resolution of
2400 by 1600 as you'd expect it has a
touchscreen and it looks really nice
nelli do the speaker sound good but it
is a really sharp screen this is a very
high resolution for a 12 inch panel I
had nothing but good things to say about
the typing experience either the
keyboard feels good with solid spacing
and it just has a nice sort of tactile
feel and the trackpad is surprisingly
good not only does it have a glass
surface but has somebody most accurate
scrolling I've ever felt this is right
up there with a lot of MacBooks
the real question here though is what
exactly can you do on a thousand dollar
Chromebook well first of all you have
chrome and well yes that doesn't sound
like much of a selling point for me I
actually do spend a lot of time and
stuff like YouTube Google Docs and Gmail
and for that this works fine what newer
Chromebooks like this have is the Google
Play Store now this essentially will
give you access to a ton of different
Android apps that will run straight on
Chrome OS oh my god recommended for me
love life school idol festival no no no
I touch the trackpad for you I'm not
doing anything else of course the first
thing I have to try is Super Mario run
because this is not ridiculous in any
way oh this is so huge my hand kind of
hurts from holding a laptop like that
but I mean that's one way you can play
games on your supercool pixel book there
are some slightly more practical
benefits of having Android apps such as
things like Photoshop sketch so this
combined with the pixel pen means that
you can actually do some pretty decent
drawing having access to Android apps
like Instagram and snapchat on a laptop
can be really cool but the problem is is
that while some of these apps are pretty
decent and do support Chrome OS a lot of
them are either just stretched out
versions of the phone or worse yet
they're just running in a phone sized
window the pixel book also has Google
assistant so there's a few different
ways of launching this but one of my
favorites is with the pen so you hold
the button you can just draw on a
particular part of a webpage and it will
use Google assistant to try to figure
out what you're looking at so here it
figures out that I'm talking about the
iPhone 10 the pixel 2 it gives a link to
the actual page as well as to my channel
and it will also transcribe any text
that I select so should the Google pixel
book exist I'm sure there's a market out
there for someone to spend $1000 on a
Chromebook and yes this is some of the
nicest laptop hardware I've ever tried
but it is really hard to justify buying
this we didn't get a great PC or Mac
Book so what do you guys think about the
pixel book let me know in the comments
below and I will catch you on the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
