today I'm here with an application
review on an app I'm really really
impressed with this one is it's got a
ton of good and a lot of bad but it's
it's definitely an interesting app it is
called duty world at war
zombies now if you've played called the
world war you know that there it is a
mode where you basically shoot nazi
zombies personally I think it's a little
stupid you know but it doesn't matter
because they cut down this is the on
that they've cut down all the Call of
Duty everything all it is is the zombies
and I gotta say it works pretty well
go ahead there are quite a different
quite a few different modes their
single-player which is probably the bulk
but probably the coolest is there's a
lot of cool
there's co-op over Wi-Fi there's called
over Bluetooth which is really handy if
you know you have a friend who has you
know an iPod besides whatever and then
there's online let me just show you I
can't wait to show you guys the whole
thing because it does take a little bit
which is you can see they're online and
basically you can go up to fruits two to
four players in a room you can you can
join and do your own but usually just
hit quick game the online performance is
really good it's smooth its solid you
don't really have to worry about you
know being slow whatever people do tend
to drop out fairly quickly so I'm not
really sure if that's people leaving or
connection but I've never really been
kicked out so you know that's definitely
a really cool game let me just explain
to you real quick
it's if you've never played world at war
it's basically you're shooting zombies
it's that simple there's only one level
in this which is not that great underst
right here there's the tutorial which
definitely you should take a look at and
then there's just the name I can't read
that stuff but there's just this
standard so I'm going to show you guys
and before again I will note they are
not using your normal controls you
normal controls which I definitely
highly recommend when you guys get this
to chip to change is there's tilts the
tilt actually work really quite well I'm
going to be using the whole this half of
the screen you can use to turn and it
doesn't water that well but it's the
best way so I don't I'm not shaking this
off now if you guys okay so yeah loading
screens are pretty decent but you guys
really like this the graphics are
absolutely phenomenal it's a full
first-person shooter and it's it's
impressive it's definitely very
impressive okay so see here if I can do
this without shaking that camera around
a bunch so okay so here is how to move
and I can basically do this anywhere I
like so I'm gonna have to turn this a
little bit and now let's go ahead and
begin so first thing I do is grab a new
weapon so grab this gun now basically
the whole game it's like a mini game
it's not there's no story there you're
basically just running around okay so
here's a guy right here so boom that's
that simple you see this right here that
is a barricade and basically hard to
this with my hands behind the camera
basically these barricades you need to
keep up and the zombies will be coming
at you so basically you need to when
they come up like but when you look you
just walk around and you look for the
zombies to basically come in so you know
what I'm so I'm gonna give it a minute
and let them break down there we go so
you see here I don't know how well you
can see it it's actually really good I
mean the gore actually is really
impressive it really does just look like
a standard game for like you know the
ps3 or whatever that's just been you
know dragged down I mean there's some
weird dynamics basically you're stuck in
this room but you can continue and you
see these chuckle outline like right
there of different guns that you can go
ahead and get and you see up top as the
points and I get points for a couple of
ways I get points for
hearing a barricade so you can see here
the reason you need barricades is
because they will come at you and the
barricades are really nice because they
it takes in a minute no there's a zombie
behind isn't it so you don't have to go
into your sights okay here actually I
use my knife here so if I just stab him
it's actually really cool it's really
quite a violent game but you know that's
that's a good thing for a lot of time
because I mean there's not a whole lot
of games that have any kind of decent
looking Gore so let's see here actually
I'm gonna hang out here for just a
minute a lot a bunch of me come up you
also do have grenades and you can just
tap that to uh reload as you can sell
them graphics are really great there's a
lot of good things about it
once you because these controls are not
that great but once you get the full
controls they're really pretty solid so
let's see of course they're not here
anymore
spec 91 and of course these barrels
standard-issue about all you see
explodes there yeah okay and I would
just note real quick bit you see like
right here this is one kind of a peeve
of mine but it's not that big deal to
clear the debris you have to have a
thousand and to move on through the map
you have you basically have to get more
points and clear it it's not that mine
isn't oh there's much here just grenade
so gonna show you guys actually that's
just go ahead and die start nice Frank
I'm still that guy hang on one second
there we go
so guys that is basically it um know if
you there are a few things I'm not so
crazy about this a couple of things if
you look here you just saw you're gonna
go back in there's only the one level
you don't unlock you don't continue now
if you can see this is very much like a
minigame you know there's no story
there's no teams you shoot zombies new
survive as long as you can you unlock a
lot of different weapons
I want you showed you one as you go
along you get flamethrower or machine
guns different rifles it's pretty
impressive now if you see here there's
new maps this is going to feature in
in-app purchasing which I know you guys
have heard about it's basically gonna
say you see they have two more maps that
soon will be available this is ten
dollars guys and you know kind of become
paying $10 for this shouldn't I get you
know more than one map you know what
that kind of got me but overall I don't
know how much that's would be I hope
some will be included for free and later
updates but guys this is Call of Duty
world or zombies probably the best first
person shooter available for the iPhone
and iPod Touch I highly recommend it
guys if you don't mind spending $10 you
will definitely not be disappointed
anyway
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
