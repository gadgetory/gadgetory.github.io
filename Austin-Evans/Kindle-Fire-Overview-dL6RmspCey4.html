look at the new kindle fire first glance
you'll find it's a kind of plain looking
tablet very similar in build to the
blackberry playbook up front is a 7-inch
IPS display with a resolution of 1024 x
600 on bottom you'll find the small
power button micro USB port for charging
and syncing along with the 3.5
millimeter headphone jack up top you
will find the recess stereo speakers and
around back is the kindle and amazon
branding oddly there are no home or
volume buttons which is a bit of a
problem the overall size that kindle
fire is going to be great for a lot of
people delivering plenty of screen real
estate while being very portable and
very nearly pocketable if you have large
pockets that is the kindle fires based
on android 2.3 but amazon has done a lot
of work making the android bits go away
and replaced with an all new UI at the
top left you will find the notification
tray and over to the right is where
several options are housed including
volume brightness and Wi-Fi the rest of
DUI is divided into a few slices the
search menu up top the links to your
books music and more a cover flow like
carousel with your most recently viewed
items and finally adopt for your
favorite content that's about it for my
first look at the kindle fire that will
be sure to stay tuned to the channel is
i'll be posting lots of other kindle
fire videos in the near future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
