live at CES 2012 in Las Vegas with hey
I'm Ellie from app chat what's up in
some ways of what we're going to be
doing is going over some of our CES gear
so of course we're going to be doing the
show it's a huge show it's what like
three four days on my back now taste the
first day but we're not we're being cool
and doing a video on a gear instead of
so you might have five guys instead of
yes you yes but yes and we're gonna go
over some of our gear we're also going
to take some questions so we jumped out
on Twitter and I asked him you guys like
hey what do you wanna know about ces and
all that kind stuff so also gonna answer
some questions so yeah that a really
important thing when you're at CES is
having a laptop so what do you write I'm
rockin just a baseline 30 inch macbook
pro with this pretty sweet battle that's
cool it's cool if you want to get just
Google you know I'm in macbook decal
yeah so baseline MacBook Pro editing
with final cut pro x yes i'm using a
macbook air 11-inch i love this actually
more of a pc guy like at home like my
main rig is a pc i built but up as far
as editing and stuff goes i love using a
macbook air it's so tiny and thin and
the livin it doesn't take up any room
like I walk around yeah I walk around it
on the show floor all day long with this
is my bag not a big deal like that's
that's that's it as way something pretty
it does add to the back yeah I feel at
the end of the day yeah it's good I mean
it's got a lot of power there are these
are pretty pre-emptive it's not bad
seriously I had all 1080p video on this
I mean I had it on premiere adobe
premiere cs6 i'm not i'm not a pro x
material yet maybe next year covering
CES microphones are also a really huge
deal especially for us since we do video
of course like pretty much any kind of
camera or camcorder has a microphone
built in but CES is so noise mean what
is like 150,000 people yeah never get
all at one time like on it like right
around you but there's still tons of
people super loud booths musical a kind
of stuff so it really does pay to have
some different kind of auctions to get
some sound because if you guys don't
want you know just video no audio here
is going
so I guess I have a couple microphones
um I have this sennheiser g3 evolution
packs this is a wireless mic so you guys
ever see like a clip to like a shirt or
something i'll be using this tomorrow
and probably all week long basically is
just a little mind eclipse here so it's
just a lot closer to your to your face
so it kind of picks it up better and
then just yeah it's nice and just this
goes and puts on to my back pocket and
this goes on top of the camera and that
way someone can be over behind the
camera just like listening making sure
that you know i'm not like the mics not
touching anything or like I'm not like
breathing into it or something silly
come on be stealing this thing you're
gonna steal but anyway i'm using the
zoom h1 this is like a portable camera
has an SD card in it and yeah it's
really great it's affordable i've also
got the windscreen which is really
really handy do i use it without ya
otherwise if i speak into it you're
gonna hear like all the breathing and
stuff like that Austin's also got one on
the top of the camera with filming with
yeah it's really great it's so good
because like example since this is
Wireless sometimes like there can be
interfering stuff that I could just
unplug this and plug it into a zoom and
use it to record yeah like it's like a
like a what Swiss Army knife what is
handy it's like having two supportable
recorder yeah where you can plug it into
cameras it's fantastic and of course
when you're carrying a ten gear around
yet have a bag and that's where I use
this this is a kata 22 its got like a
really long name and I don't think they
make it anymore so but will point like a
link that nature pretty funny that your
bag has a name though cuz my I'm just
rockin black bag is the plain black bag
playing black bag i got it for 12 bucks
and yet the size but tell me about your
cool bag well my bags cool than yours
i'll just start by saying right now it's
just awesome cuz i can keep my macbook
air in here and ipad camera lenses
accessories all the kind of stuff in
here and it's it's small enough where
like I can work carry around all day
long put underneath the airline see
whatever also been Logan
that my random yeah and also I've got
this awesome CES bags they gave me yeah
you don't get one of these you're not
cool enough for that for the special way
maybe I haven't been there yet sure i
got my paws is this prejudice just
repress your an exhibitor you youtube
you're cooler than me on some hands but
you don't get a bag so how cool can you
really be not cool enough is the answer
it's not cool enough we also jumped on
twitter and ask you guys we had any
questions about ces or anything as far
as the tempering so yeah do you edit at
the event itself are at the hotel room I
always edited the hotel room by the time
i'm at the event i'm dead by two three
o'clock i'm dead i'm going back and I'll
like sitting just like that's all I can
do um and plus it's crowded there you
might not have a seat anywhere and gets
in it like all the way in not a place
for editing it's just crazy filming
who's taller between us I feel like this
was a slightly troll question she is
actually much taller than I am certain
seven-foot tall yeah no I'm sure we've
been too long why did you guys bring so
much gear couldn't you edit on an iPad
you ain't it on an iPad edited videos
remember what was that game or traveling
yeah I did edit a lot of videos on my
iPad site I guess that's a bit well I
guess you did bring the connection kit
so I could I can there's an emergency
but the iPads not really great for any
ins for something like CES you need the
desktop to like new things with the
mouse I don't know touchscreen it's just
it's not very powerful like we're
cranking out I know how many videos will
do but like you need it back you want to
be able to get the videos done you don't
have to spend you know free hours
editing a video on ipad when you could
do in 30 minutes on a macbook yeah it's
just a lot easier to get it on a
computer and that's what I got anyway
that's going to be about it if you guys
watch it got part 2 of this video where
we go over the rest of our gear as well
as some more questions and all that kind
of stuff you should go click on a face
right now I'm gonna add an annotation to
your face just say yeah okay there's
also a link in the description you guys
can check out part 2 which is on her
channel yeah youtube.com slash akshat
and on top of that I definitely be sure
to stay tuned to both of our channels as
we're going to be lots and lots of CES
coverage starting to
ro bike through the next Anna how long a
while take us three days yeah I'll take
several days for us to go do all of our
videos also one of the things you guys
want to see anything in particular at
CES let us know drop a comment down
below and we will do our best one of us
or both of us will try to go and do a
video on you if you don't see a really
cool new TV saw an ounce or anything
