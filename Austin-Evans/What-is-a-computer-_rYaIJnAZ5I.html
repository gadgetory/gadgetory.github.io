is a computer now obviously it's the
tower that sits on your desk or the
laptop that goes into your bag what
about the phone in your pocket or even
to watch on your wrist has it all even
work head back to the 1940s and one of
the first computers was the ENIAC which
was based on vacuum tubes with over
17,000 of them weighing 30 tons
altogether and taking up as much space
as a large house completed the tail end
of World War 2 the ENIAC was designed to
test the feasibility of things like the
hydrogen bomb however at its core it was
simply something that could do a lot of
math very fast today the brains of a
computer is called a processor or CPU
for short essentially what it does is
the same thing as the ENIAC although on
a much faster scale instead of doing
thousands of calculations a second it's
in the billions while the hardware used
to actually create a processor has
definitely changed the general ideas
behind it really haven't so if you
should a modern CPU - a design or 50
years ago they're pretty much be able to
figure everything out although it
definitely would be on a much much much
smaller scale because modern processors
are so powerful allows us to do things
like create an online video service such
as YouTube so actually speaking of let's
take a look at this video so right now
you're watching a 1080p video playback
at 30 frames per second so essentially
that is is 2 million pixels that are
being changed 30 times every single
second to create the illusion of actual
motion now in reality it's just a series
of still images that are played back
very quickly kind of trick your brain
however with the modern computer you can
play lots of images play them very fast
and you really won't be able to tell the
difference however if you're using a
computer say from 20 years ago the
output might look a little something
like this so there's absolutely no
smooth motion it looks very jittery it
looks very weird
however because there's so much power so
many transistors so many calculations
every single second it makes fluid
cool-looking motion like this over the
Internet totally possible so far I've
spent a lot of time talking about more
standard kinds of computers however the
term computer actually applies to a lot
of things including not only your phone
but basically anything that can actually
execute a program which includes a lot
of things when you start looking at it
let's say I want to play a game of
flappy bird on my Moto X as I play the
system on a chip is lighting up a pair
of CPU cores for GPU cores and 16
billion
ones and zeroes that make up the memory
for storing the application this is an
enormous ly complicated series of parts
that all have to work together perfectly
to do something as seemingly simple as
play a game however the entire system on
a chip will actually fit on this dime
this is definitely a computer however I
can see making an argument that so is
this I mean yeah it might be a printer
however it does have a processor it has
an operating system screen it even
connects via Wi-Fi even a mouse and
keyboard has some logic as well as some
wireless capabilities something as
seemingly simple as a hard drive has a
full-blown processor that is more
powerful than what some of the moon
missions had and even some webcams can
actually have some pretty decent
horsepower inside that you would never
really expect now take a minute and look
around the room that you're in right now
how many computers are around you at
this very second odds are probably more
than you think computers like this are
absolutely everywhere around us today
and they're only going to get more and
more common as things get cheaper and
smaller a term you're going to be
hearing a lot about soon is the Internet
of Things things like the nest
thermostat and hue light bulbs that are
smart enough to connect to the internet
and report back to your phone are the
first step but before long devices like
these as well as wearables are going to
be just as much a part of our lives
today as phones are coming back full
circle to the ENIAC what 70 years ago
required a computer the size of a house
over a day to complete can now be done
in a single second on a device that fits
in your pocket just imagine where we'll
be in another 10 years much less 70
anyway thank you guys for watching and I
will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
