IdeaPad 100's looks good on paper but is
$150 laptop worth it the unboxing
experience is pretty straightforward
crack open the box and you'll find a
laptop itself the power adapter and a
QuickStart guide for such a cheap laptop
the design really isn't bad
it looks especially dope and bright red
while it's under an inch thin and made
of plastic it feels surprisingly well
built you've got a power port full size
HDMI headphone jack and a micro SD card
slot to expand the built-in storage it's
also got a pair of USB ports although
they are of the slower 2.0 variety the
real draw here is being able to run full
windows on such a cheap laptop
performance is totally respectable when
you get into juggling more than a few
apps it can start to slow down but for
normal use it's actually snappy since
it's running Windows 10 out of the box
that means you got features like Cortana
and multiple desktop support all of
which work fine here I've also got to
give lenovo props for not loading it
with blow air either there are a couple
apps pre-installed all of which are easy
enough to get rid of it's powered by a
quad-core Intel Atom processor which is
good enough for some light gaming as
well minecraft Windows 10 Edition works
and while you won't want to try more
hardcore games it's usable for casual
stuff it's also passively cool which
means there's no fan and while it would
be nice to have more than 2 gigs of
memory is enough to handle a few tabs
without slowing down having only 32
gigabytes of storage is about what you'd
expect on a low-end PC it's reasonably
quick but you'll probably want to take
advantage of that microSD card slot to
cheaply get some more space all of this
put together means you can expect some
impressive battery life upwards of 6 to
7 hours even with moderately heavy usage
the 100 I should really be considered
either a first computer or a secondary
machine well it's perfectly at home
doing things like web browsing it's not
going to crush things like photoshop and
4k video one area where the budget price
is more noticeable is in the screen it's
got an 11 point 6 inch 1366 by 768
display and it's average in every way it
gets reasonably bright but the colour
tends to be on the blue side and the
viewing angles leave a lot to be desired
you can adjust the screen all the way
flat if you like though to make sure you
keep it in the sweet spot audio is also
average it has a pair of speakers on the
bottom which are a bit tinny but totally
usable the webcam on the one who does
exists it's not exactly
has that anything but for a quick
Skyfall or something is totally fine
right now
by far the biggest issue with the 100's
is the trackpad it's a decent size for
an 11 inch laptop but it completely
lacks multi-touch which makes scrolling
a massive pain you either have to tap to
click or use the mushy buttons it's
usable but it makes something as simple
as scrolling on a webpage way more
annoying than it should be
luckily the keyboard is one area where
Lenovo has things well sorted it's
nicely spaced with slightly curved keys
which feel really nice to type on
slightly mushy action is the main
giveaway that this isn't a far more
expensive laptop but it's really not bad
one spot where options like a Chromebook
win out is Wi-Fi the idea pad tops out
with Wireless and compared to the much
faster AC Wi-Fi and Chromebooks are
absolutely the biggest competition for
this laptop for about the same price
you're able to get a similar laptop
that's running Google's Chrome OS the
main advantage is being able to run
Windows app on the IdeaPad but the
basics are just as good if not better on
Chrome OS for $150 though you're getting
a laptop that's not only usable but
nicely designed with the exception of
the trackpad with solid battery life and
plenty of performance what do you guys
think about the idea pad let me know in
the comments below and I will catch you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
