htc inspire 4G with the AT&amp;amp;T network so
this is one of the newer Android phones
available and by all accounts a pretty
good android phone on AT&amp;amp;T so let's just
jump straight into the unboxing so
particularly the box is pretty small on
there's some information not cast off
but where I know it's going to be in the
boxes as well if I find out so if we
open it up now I will do wanna mention
this is a review unit so this has been
open before so well everything should be
about the same as when you buy your own
so you see here there's an htc inspire
4G quick start guide so it's got some
information kind of telling you a little
bit about how to use the phone how to
put your microSD card sim card all that
kind of good stuff but we'll take a look
at that in a second now we have the
phone itself which actually ship and get
it out without falling so there's the
phone itself but we'll set that aside
and take a look at that in a minute so
this look like there's going to be a ton
in the box yeah so we've got a HTC wall
adapter and bleep that's yeah that's
microUSB um a little bit more leaflets
and warranties connect to Wi-Fi on the
ATT network so of course you can do that
safety &amp;amp; R I used to let regulatory
guide a couple things like that but not
a whole lot so let's push all this off
to the side and take a look at the phone
itself okay so let me give you guys a
quick tour around the phone so up front
you'll find a 4.3 inch display it's
going to be a super LCD display it's
going to have a resolution of 480 x 800
which is about the standard for phones
like this along the bottom to find for
Android capacitive touch buttons and now
they're all part of the same ah let's
see the glass or plastic I have no idea
but it's all part of the same thing of
course you had the HTC logo capacitive
touch buttons are usually you love it or
you hate it you know pinzon how
responsive they are they light up all
that kind of good stuff of course I will
take a look at that a little bit later
also flipping around on the bottom
you'll find that there's a
three-and-a-half millimeter headset jack
I believe that looks like a micro USB
and there's your microphone flipping it
over to the left side you'll find that
there's a volume rocker and up top
you'll find the power button actually I
will kind of want to point this out here
power button is basically flush it
doesn't really I mean might raise up
just a slight bit but it's pretty much
flush so I'm definitely interested to
see how well that works on you know in
real world testing it
actually going to be easy to get to and
all that kind of good stuff around here
on the right side you'll water they
won't find anything and on the back
you'll find your 8 megapixel camera as
well as your dual LED flash and now I've
got to say something about this phone it
seems really really sturdy and really
well-built so it's not really that thick
at all you guys can see here the camera
does probe just get up a little bit but
I think there's enough of a lip to keep
the camera from getting scratched or
anything like that but it definitely
feels very very nice in the hand very
sturdy it's got a decent heft to it
certainly not really heavy or anything
but feels nice definitely a sturdy phone
I believe that's probably metal but I
really don't know definitely feels
pretty sturdy you've got some nice soft
touch plastic here here and here so
anyway guys let's go ahead and just take
this opportunity to give you guys a
little rundown of the specs so this runs
the these Qualcomm Snapdragon processor
which is costed about 1 gigahertz it
runs android 2.2 froyo with the HTC
Sense UI which of course I'll take a
look at in the full review I've had
seven or six t 8 megabytes of RAM 4
gigabytes of internal storage along with
an 8 gigabyte microSD card so imagine
it's probably somewhere inside there you
get your SD card it weighs about 5.7 8
ounces which again that kind of come
back around to it's nice and thick and
all that nice and thick but it's rather
nice and heavy feels really solid in the
hand so no issues there and then the
battery is a 1230 milliamp hour battery
so I'll definitely test the battery life
and all that kind of good stuff so
anyway guys that's about it of my
unboxing of the htc inspire 4G I
definitely stay tuned to the channel
I'll be doing lots more coverage of the
phone so if you're interested definitely
