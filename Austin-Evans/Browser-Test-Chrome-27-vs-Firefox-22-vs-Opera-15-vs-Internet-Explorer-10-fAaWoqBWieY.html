was a web-browser comparison so we all
spend a lot of time online probably more
than we should so it definitely pays to
be using the best browsers that you can
so today I'm going to be comparing four
of the biggest browsers around so we
have Google Chrome 27 Mozilla Firefox 22
opera 15 as well as Internet Explorer 10
to start with we have peacekeeper which
is a great overall test of a browser so
this is a very general kind of test so
it doesn't just focus on one thing or
another surprisingly opera wins out here
with a score of three thousand eight
hundred and twenty-nine followed closely
by Chrome with just under thirty eight
hundred in Firefox and Internet Explorer
are much farther behind with scores
around 1,900 next up we have the html5
test now hTML is kind of like the
rulebook for the Internet so the better
that each browser will support it means
that in turn they will be able to
support more cool and new things that
you'll be able to do online here chrome
was almost perfect with a score of 476
with opera and Firefox doing quite well
with 432 and 424 points and Internet
Explorer bring up the rear with a score
of just 326 now we're testing memory
usage with seven tabs open so this test
is especially important if you have a
little bit of an older or slower
computer as generally speaking the more
memory a browser needs the slower it
will run here Firefox does very well
needing only three hundred and thirty
megabytes of RAM with opera doing decent
at just over 400 Meg's in both Chrome
and Internet Explorer needing about four
hundred and fifty megabytes of RAM
continuing on we have octane now this is
a pure test of JavaScript performance
and generally speaking if it browse it
as well in JavaScript is going to be a
very fast browser overall as JavaScript
is basically everywhere you go online
here again opera does very well posting
a score of over 14,000 with Chrome right
behind Firefox does decently with just
under 12,000 points and Internet
Explorer finishes a distant last next is
a test to see how long it takes to open
each web browser now something to keep
in mind is that I did do my testing with
a standard mechanical hard drive this
should be very applicable to most
computers out there surprisingly
Internet Explorer actually did very well
here thanks to the fact that it's built
into Windows loading in only 1.4 seconds
Firefox is also pretty snappy taking
only 2 seconds with opera and crow
three and three and a half seconds to
load a new test I'm using this time
around is browser scope so any web
browser can have issues with a security
hole however generally speaking some
browsers do better than others so this
is going to take a look at some of the
more common threats and if they can stop
them or not here all four do very well
with chrome blocking the most threats
followed closely by opera Internet
Explorer and then Firefox so how do the
browser stack up well there are very
good reasons to use Chrome Firefox or
opera so Firefox is the easiest on your
memory as well as the quickest to load
up chrome is going to be very fast
pretty much across the board and it's
also the most compliant with html5 as
well as being the most secure however
this time the winner is going to be
opera 15 it narrowly beats out chrome to
be the fastest web browser and it's
solid in pretty much every single
category leaving it no major weaknesses
but of course tests can't show
everything so what's your pick for the
best web browser definitely be sure to
