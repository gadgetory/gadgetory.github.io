here with a review of the Moto X the
first thing you'll notice about it is
that it's quite a bit smaller than
several other flagships while still
giving you the same sized screen in fact
I've got nothing but good things to say
about the hardware the back is nicely
curved to fit your hand and it's got a
little indent with the Motorola logo
which works great is a place to rest
your finger my review unit came with a
black soft touch woven back however you
can use the Moto maker to fully
customise the phone it's a really cool
feature and there are lots of awesome
combinations you can make however
unfortunately it's 18t exclusive right
now one area where the Moto X has caught
some criticism is with the specs on
paper it's not that impressive but in
actual real world use it's absolutely
screaming fast lag is basically nowhere
to be found making this one of these
snappiest Android phones I've ever used
so don't be fooled that it's just a
dual-core even graphically intense games
like Riptide gp2 are no problem at all
for the Moto X motorola has made some
changes to stock Android and by far my
favorite are the active notifications
pull the phone out of your pocket and
the screen will light up with the time
and your notifications it's very smart
about when it does this for example if
you leave the phone face up on a table
it will pop up every few minutes without
being annoying the reason they can do
this is because the phone uses an AMOLED
display which means only a small part of
the screen actually turns on instead of
draining your battery all the time
unfortunately color isn't incredibly
accurate on the Moto X which is
especially noticeable compared to the
amazing screen on the HTC One another
custom motorola feature is the Tesla's
control so all you need to do is train
the phone to your voice when you first
get it and then all you need to do even
if it's locked is say okay Google now
how tall is the Empire State Building
where Motorola made a big step back is
with the camera app it's super simple to
use as you just tap and it takes the
shot the problem is there's practically
no actual control of even being able to
focus really as as soon as you tap it
will automatically expose focus and take
the picture because of this I
frustratingly missed some shots thanks
to the camera not full
cursing on what I wanted or exposing
incorrectly the actual pictures
themselves are alright but again are hit
and miss some shots came out very nicely
with nice depth of field but the vast
majority of the pictures I took were
very washed out and a bit soft it also
handles bright light poorly with major
overexposing
in quite a bit of purple flaring
low-light is really nothing impressive
either as the noise reduction is
incredibly aggressive pretty much
destroying all the details in the shot
it's definitely capable of getting a
nice picture but the camera is
absolutely the weakest part of the motox
I'll upload an album of full resolution
pictures from the phone over on Google+
if you guys want to check them out for
yourself as far as call quality goes the
Moto X was really impressive
with three microphones it cancels noise
well and the speaker is nice and clear
battery life is also rock-solid it was
more than enough to get me through a
full day of use and then some the Moto X
is one of the best phones period right
now with lots of legitimately useful
features and awesome customization
probably the only major downside would
be the camera but beyond that I think
it's absolutely worth a look however
what do you guys think are you going to
be interested in picking up a Moto X are
you gonna be waiting out for something
else like the iPhone or the note 3 or
something like that definitely be sure
to let me know what you're thinking in
the comments below anyway guys thank you
so much for watching if you enjoyed and
you want to see more like this
