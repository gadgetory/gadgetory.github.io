up and to be honest it was a bit of a
letdown so while they didn't ask a
couple of new things that was really
nothing dramatically brand-new there was
no iphone 5 no new ipod touch really
wasn't a whole lot new but they did
announce a couple of things so we'll go
ahead and go over them so the first and
most important of which is the new
iphone 4s I know we had long been
rumored that there would be a 4s and
most people myself included expected
there would be a 5 being above it
naturally but turns out that there's no
going to be no iphone 5 this year in
fact we're going to be stuck with the 4s
now if you guys were interested in 4s
there are a couple of new changes from
the four but to be honest it's not a
major update so you will find the app
the dual core apple a5 processor from
the ipad so we'll have a decent amount
of power it also will have a new 8
megapixel camera which does look awesome
definitely not gonna say anything about
that the camera does look great and on
top of that it will be available with a
64 gigabyte variety now beyond that
really wasn't a whole lot new that still
has basically the same designs the
iphone 4 there's no new teardrop design
or anything like that i will be
available on AT&amp;amp;T verizon as well as
sprint so not too bad if you guys are
interested pick up the 4s will be on
sale for pre-orders a couple of days i
believe october seventh it'll be on sale
october fourteenth now moving on there
was a new ipod touch model but again it
was wasn't that knew it was just the
ipod touch that we have today with a new
color so not a big deal although if you
guys are interested in the 8 gigabyte
model is now down from 230 dollars to
200 so that's your bed lastly there was
the ipod nano again not a major update
you guys are starting to get a theme
here but it is does now have the nike+
sensors built in as well as it has a
little bit of a UI change where instead
of having before small icons on the
screen you can now change it to have one
addition there are also lots of new new
clock faces although still no wrist
strap which kind of sucks but you guys
are you interested in using a walker
watch there are several new cool clock
faces including a Mickey Mouse one and
quite a few others a price drop was
definitely needed but there's no cameras
or nothing anything really doll that new
and last thing was Syrian alcira was
definitely the biggest thing in this
entire announcement is basically voice
control x about a hundred so what you
can do is you can ask your iphone or
ipod touch like real like actual
questions like do i need an umbrella
today or
or I don't know what's the weather or
what's 500 x 300 or whatever you can
actually ask it some real questions
instead of having to use like previous
you had to say you know the actual words
like new what changed song 2 or whatever
you can actually just pretty much talk
to it freely doesn't let this is going
to require data so it's not going to be
specifically on the 4s which it is
exclusive to so if you guys are
interested in I would HIGHLY be
surprised if we don't have a jailbreak
tweak out to get on you know the older
devices like the ipods and the iphone i
suppose it's going to be about it you
guys interested in picking up the iphone
4s again you'll be able to pick it up
pre-order october seventh I will run
pretty much the same pricing so be two
hundred dollars for the 16 gigabyte
model three hundred dollars for the 32
gigabyte model and four hundred dollars
for the 64 gigabyte model on again all
of those are on contract in the United
States so overall guys Mully curious
know what do you think to be honest it
was a big letdown for me I mean the
camera on the 4s looks nice I can't say
that I really was you know expecting
anything on the ipod's front but I was
really hope the iphone 5 we didn't see
it so no not a big deal so you guys
again definitely be sure to leave your
thoughts in the comment section below if
