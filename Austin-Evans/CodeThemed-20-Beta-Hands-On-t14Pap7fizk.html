hands-on of code theme 2 point 0 so as
I'm sure most of you guys know code
theme the original was a website that
allows you to go ahead and create your
own custom winterboard themes and to go
ahead download straight to your device
so you don't have to worry about you
know knowing what all the names the
icons are all this kind of stuff
basically go ahead just pick stuff out
click that you're good to go well now
code themed is being redesigned from the
ground up for the version 2 point 0 and
it adds a ton of really cool new
features and thanks to the developers of
code think i have a beta invite to go
ahead and show you guys a little bit
about it now the full version will
launch october 10th so you guys can go
ahead take a look at it then however it
on go ahead and let me just show you a
little bit about it i'll show you what
you can do it's very pretty it's very
very impressive let's guy should go
ahead and start with backgrounds now
like I said this is very simple I need
to do is click on it and you're done
you're basically creating the entire
theme so new and code theme two point oh
is that the support for video wallpapers
so let's go ahead and just pick this one
so we go ahead and hit set or previews
go ahead just set it to the home screen
now actually in the in the browser
itself you won't see it but once you go
ahead and download this to your device
will actually see a full video wallpaper
and of course with code veins while
there are lots of pre-built options as
you guys can see here we're going to
scroll down here take a look at some of
them but you can also obviously upload
your own so while you you can create a
really nice thing just from what they
have here there's absolutely nothing
stopping you from going ahead and
downloading and cut stick theming way
more so let's go ahead just pick three
let's go ahead pick a little head and
you create a custom theme so when set
this to the home screen so there we go
now another a really cool new feature is
that you can actually go ahead and set
the images choose individual home
screens so most of the time obviously
you know you want the background to be
stay the same however if you want let's
say this this kind of would like that
wrench should be on one but not no other
pages we go ahead and hit up up that's
actually removed from these other pages
so there we go so that's go ahead you
just apply it to the first page so as
you can see here we had this but we go
over to the other page is that original
video wallpaper so again very very
robust support for that which is pretty
cool now it's going to take a look at
the icons I'm using code thing you can
go ahead and cuts custom lee style your
icons so let's go ahead and pick and
again they have quite a few really high
quality icons as you can use so let's
see here I like this one so we can go
ahead and drag and drop or you can go
ahead and just click on it so let's
click on this one and to automatically
change and another really cool thing is
that while obviously you can just click
on but let's say I want for some reason
SMS to look like the clock so we can go
ahead and drop it on there and we
actually make our clock look like SMS so
there really is a really nice variety of
customization so let's go ahead just
scroll through here as you can see here
there are quite a few different well
it's pretty much for every all the
default ones so let's quit the Safari
and see here which one do we might use
let's use this one so every other Safari
just changed another cool feature and
while this actually doesn't work
perfectly as far as what it looks like
you can actually rotate the rotate the
icons so with just a single click all of
our icons are now sideways all right now
as it actually just pops up it looks a
little bit blurry in the emulator but
once you go ahead download to your
device it should look just fine let's
glad just click this a couple more times
to rotate the icons back to the normal
way and let's just go ahead and continue
on so now it's going to take a look at
dots and then go ahead dogs pretty much
support the same way so we can go ahead
and pick this one you can see here the
really cool thing is the emulator has
just been rebuilt so it works it very
very fast it's pretty it's pretty
impressive as far as me I just click on
it and it changes really nicely and the
last thing i'll go ahead and show you
guys today is the labels so you actually
can go ahead change the font of all your
labels so that wants okay but let's try
and this one and that looks pretty good
but and of course when go ahead and just
scroll up and down as far as the font
size then we go ahead and choose color
so let's make this purple I like the
purple so there we go so now we have
purple text just as simple as that now
guys there's going to be quite a bit
more
this is just the beta version they're
really working hard to finish it all up
but you will be able to work on the
lockscreen the status bar as well as
quite a few other extras of the you know
the different parts of the operating
system so guys that's it for my hands on
of coke theme two point oh very very
impressed i'm definitely looking forward
to checking it out so guys remember it
will be live in the full version with
all of the you know it will be totally
set up on the 10th so grappling go ahead
check back on the 10th going to codeine
calm so anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
