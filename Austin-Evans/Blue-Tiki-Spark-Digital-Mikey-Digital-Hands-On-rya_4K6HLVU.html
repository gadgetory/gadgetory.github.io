from CES 2012 with some of the new blue
microphone products so Jonathan you
might go ahead take it away absolutely
so this year we're showing off three new
products all of which are kind of taking
a step in a different direction from
what we normally done what we're doing
now is we're integrating a lot of
digital signal processing into our
consumer products for instance we have
our new USB mic called the Tiki so the
Tiki is designed for communication is
the first mark that we're kind of
designing from something other than home
recording there's over a billion skype
user accounts and hundreds of millions
of other i chat and gotomeeting accounts
and we wanted to kind of fill that need
of missing quality audio for that type
of situation now one of the biggest
problems when you're on a Skype
conference call somebody starts typing
and that basically eliminates the
possibility of anybody else on that call
hearing what's going on plus there's
dogs barking toilets flushing babies
crying in the background we wanted to be
able to just be able to focus on the
talkers voice and not anything else so
inside of here there's a very very
powerful DSP chip in here it's going to
let it act like an intelligent sensor so
as you're moving around the microphone
it's actually going to follow your voice
and eliminate all the noise coming from
the sides in the back so there's two
capsules in here one going that way one
going that way but it doesn't mean it's
an omnidirectional or figure eight Mike
the polar pattern is actually adaptable
so it's a very impressive Mike what it's
doing is incredible and this mike is
only going to be $59 retail and it's
going to be out and about mid-april so
the second cool product that we have is
our new spark digital so anybody that's
been following blue for the last couple
of years has probably seen us come out
with spark it's one of our best-selling
studio microphones spark has this little
button on the back called the focus
control when you push this in it's
actually going to increase the voltage
to the capsule gives you more in your
face focus sound when you release it you
get a flatter smoother zone so what we
did is we took all the analog components
that we love about this mic and put them
into here into this chassis and this is
a basically a digital version of the
spark microphone now instead of being
XLR out the bottom of this guy has a
mini HDMI and it's going to come with
two cables one of which is going to be
able to plug into your iOS
devices like your iPad the other cable
will allow you to plug in USB into your
computer so unlike most USB mics that
are going to use like smaller condenser
capsules and draw a little bit less
power those mics are designed
specifically for you know USB production
this mic right here is was originally
designed as a studio mic in by the
physics of the size and the shape of the
capsule just going to give you a little
bit warmer richer sound than you get out
of a typical USB mic so last but not
least we have our Mikey digital up
Spencer so if you know blue for the past
three years we've been showing off
versions one in version 2 of the Mikey
which is stereo mic that goes in your
iPod or iPhone turns an interval field
recorder when Apple came out with iphone
4 they changed the connector the 30 pin
connector to only accept digital audio
so kind of went to back to the drawing
board rework town we're doing the
electronics inside of this microphone so
Mikey digital is going to be able to be
compatible with your iPad your iPhone 4
and above and your later versions your
ipod touches one thing that we had
upgraded on this also is on the previous
version of the Mikey there was a stereo
line input now this stereo line input
will also be able to switch impedance to
be able to take in the jack from a
guitar so you can plug a guitar directly
into here and it's going to sound
amazing so which is great because now
the iPads have garageband and all these
crazy new guitar effects apps so I've
even heard of people showing up at their
shows and just plugging a guitar
directly into their iPhone and using a
distortion or guitar amplifying
simulator so there's a lot of cool stuff
you can do with just that but on top of
that you're still getting your
award-winning sound out of your
microphones inside of here another
change we did still has this little
switch on the back that you'll see on
Mikey version 1 and 2 for your games but
here we have a high gain a low gain but
the middle setting is auto gain so we're
using a very strong DSP chip in hearing
to allow you to do that auto gain is
actually going to be taking about a
hundred times more samples a second than
what's out on the market right now for
auto gain so it's a very intelligent
auto gain system so that way you can
just set the gain and forget it so if
something gets really loud or look
really quiet it's not going to take a
few seconds for the microphone to get
back to a normal listening level so this
is a really cool Mike it's going to be
out in mid April is going to be ninety
nine dollars retail the spark digital be
199 retail about the same time if you
want any more information on these mics
you can go to blue Mike com that's BL
you e mi si.com and check out some more
stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
