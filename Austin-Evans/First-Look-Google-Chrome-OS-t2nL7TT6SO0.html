open-source operating system Chrome OS
it's based on the lightweight Linux
kernel and is almost entirely focused
around the browser let's take a look at
what all Chrome is all about Google
Chrome OS is an entirely different
operating system than Windows or OS 10
it features nearly instant-on capability
with boots in under 10 seconds and
literally almost no data is stored on
your computer it is all synced online
with your Google account even including
data brought from something such as a
USB Drive in a demo they show how
opening a file a PDF is done on Google
Docs as opposed to an application on the
computer this holds true for all
applications has any file that needs to
be opened will be associated with a web
application as opposed to an application
stored and installed on your hard drive
you won't be able to easily do more
intensive tasks such as photo or video
editing right now but Google is working
with software makers to get web
applications set up to help that said it
does seem that you won't be able to do
everything with Chrome OS so it's likely
that a computer with Windows or OS 10
will still be needed security is a major
emphasis in Chrome OS at first glance it
appears to be nearly full between the
fact that it updates itself every day as
soon as you turn it on which is the way
that each part of the OS is signed so
that if one piece is corrupted or
attacked by a virus then you have the
option to reboot and go back to how the
computer was before as literally no data
is kept on a computer theoretically you
could wipe the entire computer and it
wouldn't make a difference Chrome OS is
very distinctive looking nearly always
you will be looking at the main Chrome
browser window along the top you have a
row of tabs just like in the normal
Chrome browser but you can also have
shortcuts such as Gmail or Google Docs
along the top to launch you will be able
to change windows which looks and works
similarly to opening a new window of the
Chrome browser from there open up
different web applications or websites
as you wish
Chrome OS looks like a great breath of
fresh air for operating systems in
general the fact that literally no data
is stored on the computer the small
cache of data that is on it is even
synced online and the nearly foolproof
looking security makes this look great
for even non tech oriented people Chrome
OS won't start shipping until late 2010
but the entire project is open-source
and you are free to download it today
unfortunately Chrome OS doesn't support
standard hard drives and only a few
select types of netbooks with
solid-state drives so it's unlikely that
you will be able to test it right now
that is that chrome OS looks fantastic
and could easily be a contender in the
operating system Wars</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
