xbox360 bundle and start back to is
ready for download I'm Duncan and this
is d3 game
Microsoft just announced they will be
releasing a full Xbox 360 bundle with
Halo reached this September so this is
actually a pretty cool looking bundle as
it comes with a custom Xbox 360 and it
is the new Xbox 360 so it comes with
instead of having to get it in a really
shiny black you can get it in a mat with
a very very cool graphic design on it
also an in the included in the package
two custom halo reach controllers as
well as obviously halo reach the game so
this is a really cool thing personally
I'm not a huge fan I like the Xbox
design but I'm not a huge fan of the
really shiny glossy black plastic on it
so I almost might want to buy this not
even counting the Halo Reach just
because it looks cool but of course it's
a great thing and if you're interested
you'll be able to pick it up on
September 14th for $399 Starcraft 2 is
about to be released and Blizzard has
taken some pre-emptive steps to in order
to make sure that you can get the game
on time so right now you can go ahead
and download the game and go ahead and
have it all set up and so the second you
want on release date all you have to do
is just pay the money and you can go
ahead and how to activate this is
actually a really cool thing and I
applaud blizzard for doing this because
for big game launches it always happens
especially with something as big as
Starcraft 2 there's always going to be
problems whether you want to go ahead
and buy a physical coffee and then you
have to deal with waiting for it way in
line or you know people selling out of
them or whether you want to download it
and then you're going to have to deal
with everyone you know 30 million people
hit hitting the server at once trying to
download it so gonna be a real big pain
but fortunately all you have to do is
right now
of course while the servers are nice and
clean go ahead just download the game
have it all set up then the second
you're ready to do it on release date
when pay the sixty dollars which of
course is the same for any coffee and
then we're just go ahead and activate
and you'll be good to go
so if you enjoy feel free to subscribe I
do these videos as well as many other
things covering all sorts of Technology
and video games anyway thanks for
