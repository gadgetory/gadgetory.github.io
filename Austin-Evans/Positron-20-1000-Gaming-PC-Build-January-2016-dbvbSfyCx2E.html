positron 2.0 as my first build of 2016 I
wanted to kick it off with a bang and
what better way than to start with the
most requested build I've had in a long
time the biggest upgrade is on the CPU
side we're now using an Intel Core i5
6500 as one of Intel's new skylake
processors not only is it still a quad
core chip that can clock well over three
gigahertz but it's also based on the new
skylake architecture which is two
generations newer than what was in the
old positron one of the nice parts about
this chip is that as much less expensive
than its bigger brother now part of this
is due to the fact that it's not
overclockable however it's still fairly
fast and one of the most important
things is is that you can still upgrade
in the future so with our z170
motherboard if you ever want to go to
say and unlock to four i5 or even a core
i7 it's a super simple upgrade the real
heart of the build though is the MSI
Radeon r9 390 graphics card compared to
the GTX 970 in the original positron
it's able to outperform and benchmarks
like fire strike however the real
advantage is having that whopping eight
gigabytes of gddr5 memory get into games
as you would expect this thing is no
joke
so in grand theft auto 5 you're easily
able to run it 1440p very high settings
and you're still getting roughly around
60 frames per second move over to Metro
last light Redux
and again it's easily playable at 1440p
and you're still getting some really
rock solid frame rates
shadow of Mordor is another demanding
game and here again we're able to play
on ultra settings at 1440p with just
over 50 frames per second while 1440p
really is a sweet spot for this system
you can play games of 4k as well The
Witcher 3 is playable on medium settings
around 30 frames per second which while
might not be ideal is totally playable
especially if you want those extra
pixels now I would usually I focus on
the gaming side of these systems you can
also do video editing on the positron
2.0 as well I loaded up some 4k sony fs7
footage using premiere and it handles it
reasonably well this is a dedicated
editing PC I probably bump it up to a
core i7 and 16 gigs of ram the
considering that they can handle 4k
footage right out of the box it's not
too bad and speaking of the Box I'm kind
of partial to the NZXT s340 case it's
got a big window to show off your build
and all of its glory well depending on
your cable management but it's got a
really good cable management as well to
kind of help things be nice and neat and
on top of that it has this awesome red
black finish
seriously this is one sexy-looking PC
and of course going through the rest of
the system we do have a gigabytes of
corsair ddr4 memory for storage we're
using a 250 gigabyte crucial px 100 SSD
alongside a one terabyte WD blue hard
drive this is a great combo for giving
you not only that SSD speed that you
really should have in a system like this
but also giving you plenty of storage
for your extra files and media on top of
that the combo is really not that
expensive either and powering the build
is a 600 watt corsair CX 600 power
supply pretty standard stuff they'll get
the job done put it all together and the
positron 2.0 is a build I'm really happy
with as always I'll have all the links
you guys need in the description of this
video and I will catch you in the next
one however with that extra memory it
means that you can do other stuff that I
haven't really remembered you can do
stuff though probably</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
