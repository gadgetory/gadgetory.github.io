and iPod Touch there have been a lot of
really big improvements such as
multitasking folders and more but one
thing that really hasn't been documented
much is the speed difference so guys
what I've done is I have taken my iPod
Touch 2nd generation and I have went
ahead and restored it three point one
point two a purely stock version and
went ahead and ran a couple tests and
then I did these same things on a
totally stop version of iOS 4 just kind
of give you guys a good sense of what
the difference is in speed you know
there have been a lot of things about
iPhone 3G being a lot slower on iOS 4
because I wanted to go ahead and test on
the iPod Touch 2nd generation which is
of course a slightly faster device to go
ahead and give you guys a good feel for
how much faster or slower iOS 4 is
compared to iOS 3 ok so the first test
will be up Safari now of course iOS 3 is
on the left and iOS 4s on the right so
the first website will load is Apple
comm it's pretty simple site but yeah so
guys as you can see already the I the
iOS 4 is quite a bit faster and yeah
it's already done guys in 10 seconds or
as iOS sorry is still sitting there and
still sitting there so yeah guys
definitely iOS 4 definitely took the
cake on this one and guys I will mention
that these this is just an average I did
run this test many many times so no
worries about you know Wi-Fi issues okay
so the second one is didrik and it's a
mobile site and as it should be very
quickly and yes there yo I Oh s4 is
already done and there's iOS 3 so guys
again
iOS 4 browser is quite a bit faster not
a huge difference but it's a pretty
substantial upgrade next we have engage
calm so guys this is the full site not
the mobile and instantly iOS 4 jumps to
lead but guys one thing I noticed is
that when you're loading big sites such
as in gadget which has lots and lots of
images you know it's a very very you
know featured full site both both times
it kind of just gets ball knifed by the
fact that the iPod touch only has a 500
megahertz processor so you can see guys
i mean we're closing on 30 seconds here
neither of them are done of course you
can pan the zoom slightly while it is
loading but generally
like to go ahead and you know wait so as
we'll see here actually they pretty much
end up as a tie so I'm almost done right
now you probably could go ahead and
scroll some bad yeah there you go so iOS
3 and iOS 4 both done so guys let's say
that's a tie but in general guys I
definitely do like Safari on iOS 4 it is
quite a bit faster so it's definitely a
good thing ok guys so the next thing is
the Maps application and guys I speed
tested this and really there's not a
whole lot of a difference iowa's for
looks slightly better as you guys can
see it seems to kind of cache it a bit
faster but guys there's not a huge
difference Maps is practically the same
ok guys so the last one will be
launching an app and I did this many
times but this is real racing guys again
not a huge difference um it was slightly
faster on iOS 3 sometimes sometimes it's
slightly faster on iOS 4 so as you guys
can see here this time iOS 3 barely won
but guys there's not a huge difference
nothing like you know on Android 2.2
where it's gonna load your apps faster
or anything it's pretty much the same
just because you know of course it is
really based on the hardware so guys
apps and maps neither of them are too
much faster on iOS 4 oh wait guys so
that's it for my you know brief speed
test so guys there's not a ton of a
difference um I will mention I did not
see a whole lot of slowdown in general
on iOS for like some people are saying
so guys I would really definitely
recommend going ahead and upgrading to
iOS 4 so far is good bit a good bit
faster and generally the OS does seem
really nice quick and responsive anyway
guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
