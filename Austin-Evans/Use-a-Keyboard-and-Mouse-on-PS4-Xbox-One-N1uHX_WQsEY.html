wanted to use a mouse and keyboard on a
console while the Xbox one controller is
about as good as it gets for a gamepad
and the DualShock 4 is a huge step up
from the last generation there's still
no substitute for a proper mouse and
keyboard that's where the commander
comes in this is an emulator that lets
you use a mouse and keyboard to replace
a normal controller it's pretty
straightforward grab the box and inside
you'll find the commander itself a pair
of mini USB cables for connecting to the
console and PC and some paperwork along
with the driver CD which you should
definitely not use what the commander
does is pretend to be a normal Xbox or
Playstation controller by using your
actual controller and passing the signal
through along with the mouse and
keyboard
the commander itself is pretty small on
one side you'll see three USB ports for
the controller keyboard and mouse on the
other side are ports to connect to the
console your PC as well as an optional
power port to get everything up and
running you'll need a keyboard as well
as a mouse and either an Xbox one or ps4
controller you can also use the
commander on the ps3 or 360 although for
the 360 you will meet the wired
controller just plug in your keyboard
mouse and controller on one side and
connect the mini USB cables to the game
and PC ports then just hook it up to
your PC and console out of the box it
won't work so you'll need to head over
to their site which I'll have linked in
the description and download both the
firmware as well as the software which
is Windows only here go to menu and then
select upgrade firmware then just select
the downloaded firmware and give it a
few minutes to update the commander you
can create your own profiles for each
console and game and you'll want to
spend some time customizing these by
default that map's things reasonably
well but some of the buttons are weirdly
set up on a keyboard tweaking the mouse
sensitivity can also be a big help
once everything is setup you can save
your profile and disconnect your PC now
you will need to keep the controller
connected to the commander but besides
that it's pretty seamless navigating the
menu with the keyboard works just like
you'd expect the directional keys
replace the d-pad and the spacebar works
for the X button although of course you
can customize this to whatever you want
jump into a game like Last of Us and the
advantage of using a mouse and keyboard
is noticeable even though it might not
be a super twitchy shooter like Call of
Duty or counter-strike the keyboard
works very well with essentially no lag
but the mouse can be a bit weird
is essentially replacing the right stick
on the controller the movements aren't
quite as clean as on a PC but as long as
you get the sensitivity right it's close
enough
using a decent gaming mouse helps a lot
here there is a slight amount of lag
with the mouse but it's not a
deal-breaker it's probably not good
enough if you're a super competitive
gamer but it's still an improvement over
a controller for me using a keyboard can
be a big advantage for some other games
as well the buttons on the DualShock for
decent they can't quite match up with a
feeling of a solid mechanical keyboard
if you have any issues with mice and
keyboards networking or just want to use
a laptop you can use play mode plug
anything you want to use including
joysticks into your computer and then
with the commander connected pick play
mode in the software this will disable
any keyboards mice or track pads from
working on Windows however you'll now be
able to use them to control the game I
definitely wouldn't recommend using a
trackpad for gaming however this is
really helpful for keyboards and mice
that don't want to work directly into
the commander move over to the Xbox one
and things are a bit simpler the
controller works without a problem and
it recognizes more keyboard to mice and
the ps4 does a driving game like Forza
horizon 2 is a lot better with the
controller than a keyboard but it will
work minecraft makes a bit more sense as
I always preferred the PC controls
Howard this is a good example of where
the mouse doesn't quite match how a
controller works navigating tight spaces
can be a bit of a chore first-person
shooters like titanfall are really where
the mouse and keyboard shine after a
quick customization of the controls I
felt a lot sharper than I ever have with
the Xbox one controller it's definitely
not for everyone but if you're a PC
gamer using a mouse and keyboard for
console exclusives like The Last of Us
can be a big help this setup can be a
bit finicky and the slight lag on the
mouse is less than ideal but overall the
commander is a very cool little
accessory so what do you guys think is
the controller good enough or would you
prefer a mouse and keyboard definitely
be sure to let me know in the comments
below anyway I've got to give a big
shout-out to shape up for making this
video possible only for the Xbox one
shape up is a game that's all about
making working out fun it gives you a
variety of different workouts that range
from running punching push-ups and way
more and quick 92nd bursts clearly I go
to the gym all the time I mean have you
guys seen this but seriously I was
really surprised at how much more fun
working out is with shape up it all uses
the Kinect which does a really solid job
of tracking your body no need for a
controller or even a mouse and keyboard
and you can record your replay
to compete against yourself or friends
Shay Pope is out now so definitely be
sure to check out the trailer in the
link in the description of this video
anyway guys thank you so much for
watching and I will catch you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
