going on an adventure
so a meme reached out and want to
sponsor a video on their Powerbank Pro I
felt like what better way of showing it
off than to give you guys a sneak peek
at the kind of travel Tecna we take with
us with 10,000 milliamp hours of
capacity this is going to have plenty of
juice to power all of our devices during
the trip and it does common a pretty
small and sleek form factor unlike some
other larger battery banks this is gonna
be easy to fit in your pocket easy to
fit in a bag no problem so as you'd
expect it's straightforward to use we
have a full sized USB a port to charge
your devices the power bank itself is
charged with a USB C port and you do
have a little battery indicator here to
see how much charge your battery bank
has the main power bank also comes with
this USB a cable to USB C so you just
plug it in you can charge your devices
this way but if you don't have something
that charges with USB C you just pop off
this little end here you're also going
to be getting micro USB and of course
you can't leave without making sure your
phone is charged so the power bank Pro
has enough juice to charge something
like the pixel two two and a half times
and it does support a full 18 watts of
output so something like the pixel is
going to be easy to fast charge alright
that's enough talk let's get out of here
and actually will show the travel tank
that's what you came for right so the
first things we do want any trip is well
spend time on a plane and what better
way to do that then with a Nintendo
switch so not only is it great for a
little bit of two-player and Mario Kart
but of course the me power bank is able
to fully charge it no problem just keep
in mind that you can't fast charge the
switch and I will have you know that I
would have won the mario kart match if
it weren't for Ken not actually shooting
the video you know it's kinda hard to
play with one hand and shoot with the
other and yes these are excuses in fact
now because we're just up here for about
24 hours and we're shooting a couple
videos I'm traveling pretty light so in
addition to the camera we're shooting
with right now I also have my Sony rx100
it was that's about this guy is that
even though it's a tiny little pocket
ball camera we're actually still getting
some pretty nice looking for K video so
this camera also has its fair bit of
trade-offs like for example it only
records for five minutes and 4k which
obviously I'd like for that to be longer
but also it doesn't have the greatest
battery life of the world which is where
something like the V power bank comes in
the main camera we're using today though
is the sony a6000 now in a lot of ways
you can think of this as the bigger
brother to the rx100
so not only do we have an
interchangeable lens we're also getting
a proper microphone input and
importantly a much bigger super 35
sensor however we actually forgot to
charge the batteries so the new power
bank about to come in handy
I should've the Jimin I'm gonna plug
your camera in right now now I can
legitimately say that me is literally
powering this video of course no travel
is complete without a smartphone which
is where the iPhone 10 comes in so this
is my daily driver right now and for the
most part I've been pretty happy however
both Ken and I are also rocking the
Google pixel - I like the pixel -
whereas Ken's rocking the XL but we both
use it for pretty much the same reason
the camera is absolutely the best you
can get on a smartphone right now so
what are the things I've been doing
recently is taking thumbnails for
YouTube using the pixel - and this is
gonna be the one for this video so after
a day of shooting the next step is to
bring the footage back and actually
start editing so our weapon of choice
here is going to be the 2016 MacBook Pro
I actually never really updated to the
newer one but this is sort of our mobile
workstation as you can see the desk is a
little bit of a mess thanks - well all
the stuff we need including dongles and
SSDs to edit off of one of the most
important things is going to be our
headphones so talked about these in many
videos before but these are the status
CB ones and especially when you're
editing on like planes and hotel rooms
and all over the place it's nice to have
a good pair of headphones that you know
you can trust especially when you're
editing footage that was shot in a park
in Chinatown and on a plane it's nice to
actually know that your audio is not
going to be terrible so that is
everything that is in our travel bag now
of course you shout out to me for
sponsoring this video
if he has one she got the Powerbank Pro
for yourselves the links will be in the
description over on Amazon now you might
be wondering why am i riding this
incredibly stylish scooter well this is
the me electric scooter and they
actually gave me one to another check
out for this video but also to give away
for you guys this is really cool because
none are you getting 18 miles of range
on this guy but it's also convenient if
you need to take it for a little trip
for example I know ken takes this back
and forth around work all the time and
what's cool is if you want to actually
travel with it it's simple just undoing
this one thing and then it'll clip
together right here
and you just pick it up and walk around
with it like this it's pretty
lightweight so just like with the
Powerbank pro you can check out a link
to this guy on Amazon in the description
and I do have one extra to give away to
you guys to enter all you do is just
leave the word scooter in a comment in
this video and two weeks I'm going to
randomly select one and send you guys a
scooter hey guys thank you so much for
watching and I will catch you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
