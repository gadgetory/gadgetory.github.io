big step forward but how does it compare
to the iPhone 6 1 look at the phone and
you'll see some similarities between the
pair but where samsung phones of the
past were mostly plastic on the GS 6
we're looking at an all glass and
aluminum body I don't think it's a bad
thing that Samsung kind of took a
radical change that they kind of stepped
outside their box because it was getting
a little repetitive and boring but
they're both relatively slippery phones
I think if I had to choose between the
two I'd say the galaxy s6 feels better
but it's really close personally I think
the Galaxy s6 edge looks even better
than the normal s6 but regardless when
put beside the iPhone
I think Samsung has delivered a much
nicer looking and feeling package if
you're buying a high-end smartphone in
2015 it had better have a great display
and thankfully both the iPhone and
Galaxy deliver here the G s6 has a
bigger 5.1 inch screen with a massive
resolution of 2560 by 1440 compared to
the iPhone which measures in at 4.7
inches at 1334 by 750 while the galaxy
s6 on paper has a screen that's nearly
twice as sharp the difference isn't
anywhere near as noticeable in real
usage if you get close yes you can see
pixels on the iPhone and there's no
doubt that the AMOLED screen on the
galaxy s6 is superior but it's a narrow
victory to be sure alright so now let's
see how the slow-motion video on these
compare and what better way to do that
than on swings oh you stuck the landing
dude high five
you
yeah that's definitely not particularly
smooth breathing 15 frames something
like that yeah deafblind out there E and
the gloriousness out points for style
that's actually not bad that's not bad
at all
you're next more more all right all
right this time it was at this moment
that Austin you he thought
and up up oh okay
so for the conclusion here I think you
went on the dismount and the iPhone wins
so yeah that's fair to say I'm gonna go
like brush-off now
juggler John and I recently did an
in-depth comparison between the cameras
on the iPhone galaxy s6 along with the
HTC One m9 which you guys can check out
but the fact that you can get cameras
this good on smartphones is nothing
short of Awesome
if specs are your thing the galaxy s6 is
rocking an 8 core processor 3 gigabytes
of RAM and up to 128 gigabytes of memory
the iPhone 6 has the awesome Apple a8
which while down on paper is a serious
powerhouse a less impressive one gig of
ram and options up to 128 gigabytes of
storage as well benchmarks show a
respectable multi-core leave for the s6
with a smaller but still substantial
lead in graphics on the flipside the
galaxy s6 has to push over three times
as many pixels so it needs all the power
I can get side by side it's hard to say
that one is significantly faster than
the other I think we got to this point
in smartphones where nothing really
sucks or is terrible anymore
if you're going to browse through basic
apps and email and web browsing they're
both really snappy phones both phones
are loaded up on features as well on the
iPhone you've got Apple pay which is a
very cool way of paying for things
however in a few months the galaxy s6
should get samsung pay which promises to
do much the same thing they're also
sporting fingerprint readers and unlike
on the galaxy s5 samsung has made an
actually usable setup here touch ID is
one of those features that doesn't seem
like a big deal until you don't have it
and thankfully Samsung's implementation
is almost indistinguishable from the
iPhone you also get a heart rate monitor
on the back of the s6 compared to the
reversible lightning port on the iPhone
no matter which way you go you're
getting feature-packed phones the galaxy
s6 battery hasn't been too impressive at
the end of a workday and then finding
myself having to charge it luckily a
charges pretty quickly but it hasn't
been too impressive so far the iPhone 6
battery is not great
I think it's subpar and from my initial
experience with the galaxy s6 that's not
great as well I know they actually
brought the battery down slightly from
last year's galaxy s5 so really if
you're a powerhouse user I don't think
either phone is really going to get you
through
full day on one hand you've got iOS a
thin if a bit slippery design and a
camera that's hard to beat on the other
you've got all the customizability of
Android a classy glass and metal build
and an absolute ton of features in the
end it's going to come down to your own
taste but for my money it's hard to pass
up the Galaxy s6</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
