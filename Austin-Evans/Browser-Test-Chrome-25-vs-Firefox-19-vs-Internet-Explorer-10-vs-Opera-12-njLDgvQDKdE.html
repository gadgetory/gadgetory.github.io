here with the browser test so question I
get asked all the time is what's the
best web browser considering how many
choices are out there it definitely
makes sense to find the best especially
considering how much time everyone
spends checking email going on Facebook
YouTube all that kind of stuff every
single day so today I'm going to be
comparing four of the best so I'm going
to be taking a look at Google Chrome
Mozilla Firefox Opera as well as
Microsoft Internet Explorer to see which
one is going to be the best of the best
to test
I used a mid-range PC with an AMD FX
4300 quad-core processor a gigabytes of
RAM and a Radeon 6850 graphics card
running Windows 8 to start with we're
using the peacekeeper benchmark which is
a fantastic overall test of a browser's
performance now this tests quite a few
things about the browsers so for example
how fast they are rendering JavaScript
how will they handle various different
web standards and all kinds of funky
stuff that you guys probably don't care
about Google Chrome clearly wins this
one with a score well above the rest of
the competition opera does fairly well
as does Firefox Internet Explorer
however especially when you consider
JavaScript chrome is really second to
none next step we have the html5 test
which measures how well each browser
adheres to the latest web standards the
way to think of HTML is kind of like the
rule book for the Internet as basically
every single web page uses it so this
kind of tells you how well each browser
will be able to support some of the
really cool things you'll find all over
the Internet here again chrome does very
well coming up on a perfect 500 score
both opera and Firefox also do very well
here
and even Internet Explorer 10 which does
come in a distant last still supports a
vast majority of html5 that you'll find
on the Internet moving on we have the
html5 fishbowl which measures how well
each browser supports GPU acceleration
as more and more the internet moves away
from flash for all kinds of cool things
it's definitely important to see how all
of these browsers support cool things
such as games even while rendering 2,000
fish at one time
Firefox easily aced this one with a
perfect score of 60 frames per second
Internet Explorer 10 also did very well
as did Chrome however Opera felt way
behind due to the fact that the GPU
acceleration really didn't seem to be
working well with this test now it's
time to see exactly how fast all of
these browsers load web pages so that's
what I did
I loaded up amazon.com each time in the
browser's multiple times and averaged
this course is exactly how fast they
really are impressively opera was the
fastest browser in this test followed up
very closely by chrome as
Internet Explorer and finally Firefox
next up I took a look at the memory
usage of each of the browsers with seven
tabs open now this is especially
important if you have a slower computer
it's generally the more lightweight the
browser is the better it will run
Firefox is the clear winner here taking
up much less memory than the other three
internet explorer did alright however
both opera and chrome took up much more
memory to do the exact same thing than
the others overall there are a few
things to take away from this for
starters all four browsers actually did
really quite well so the days of having
to immediately ditch Internet Explorer
are mostly over as it's become a very
competent browser Firefox also did well
especially if you have a slower computer
and opera did really well and most all
tests didn't really win a whole lot it's
still very fast browsers still a very
good way to go however the winner for
this one has to be Chrome as it was
consistently one of the fastest browsers
out there as long as you have a fairly
decent computer to run it it should be a
really solid choice I'm interested to
know what browser are you guys using
well I tried to go over as much as I
could in this test of course there are
other things that didn't go over for
example extensions and all kinds of
special features of the each browser has
so definitely be sure to let me know
what browser you guys use in the
comments below if you're interested in
more feel free to check out my last
video where I went over the top five
features of the brand new Playstation 4
if you enjoyed be sure to leave this
video a thumbs up and if you're
interested in more videos like this be
sure to subscribe anyway guys I will
catch you next time
