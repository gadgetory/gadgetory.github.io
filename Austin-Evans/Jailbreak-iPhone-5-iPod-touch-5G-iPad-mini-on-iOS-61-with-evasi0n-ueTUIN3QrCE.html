here with the tutorial on how to
jailbreak your iPhone iPod Touch or iPad
to do the jailbreak you'll need a couple
things first the device that you want to
jailbreak this includes the iPhone 5 4 s
4 and 3GS the iPod Touch 4th and 5th
generation and the iPad 2 3 4 along with
the iPad Mini 2 make sure your device
can be jailbroken open up the settings
app go to general and then select about
now take a look at the version tab this
needs to show 6.0 6.0 point one six
point 0.2 or 6.1 if it does you're good
to go if not just update to the latest
iOS 6.1 firmware and you'll be ready
next up you'll need a computer running
Windows Mac or Linux and the USB cable
for your device I'll be doing the
tutorial on a MacBook Air but the
process is identical no matter what
computer you're using if you have a
passcode set on your device you'll need
to disable it while we jailbreak so head
over to settings and just make sure it's
off you can always turn this back on
once we're done now that we're all set
there's just one thing left to do and
that's back up your device you shouldn't
lose any data in the jailbreak however
it's always better to be safe than sorry
if you use iCloud just hop into settings
and select backup now to make sure
everything is safe you can also use
iTunes to backup all of your data
whichever is easiest for you
alright we're already connect your
device to your computer via USB and now
let's download the program we're using
to jailbreak evasion which I'll have a
link to in the description of this video
open it up and you should see your
device listed in my case it's an iPhone
5 on iOS 6.1 now all you need to do is
click jailbreak and let it do its magic
it will take a little while so just be
patient after a few minutes it will ask
you to unlock your device do this and
then scroll to your last page and you'll
see a new jailbreak icon press this once
innovation will continue once we're all
done with evasion that's about it you
should now see Cydia on your device
which is basically a new app store with
all the jailbreak tweaks and apps
congratulations you now have a
jailbroken iPhone iPod Touch or iPad if
you enjoyed definitely be sure to leave
this video a thumbs up and subscribe and
if you had any problems feel free to let
me know in the comments down below
anyway guys I will catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
