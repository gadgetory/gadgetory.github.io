episode of d3 live so today we've
actually got a special episode where we
have a guest so today I'm going to
actually be talking a little bit with I
hate snow so I so he's made a lot of
different jailbreak such as snowbreeze
so yeah and it go ahead and introduce
yourself what do you want me to say I
don't come whatever you want so what is
the one you should be talking to him a
little bit and you know you have some
questions just kind of talk a little bit
of course you just release snowbreeze
this morning so how many things you said
how about how many downloads have you
had so far 10,000 10,000 nuts and you
just would put it out like last night
last night midnight or so so that's
pretty good if you guys actually wants
you I've already done my full tutorial
on how to do snow buries works really
pretty good I'm so naps you have snow
buries um what do you have any plans for
jailbreaking 4.2 coming soon well still
raise 2.1 that I just push though
actually took advantage of comics's new
ones have an exploit meaning that when
you put up your device it has the food
chain is not actually like poem by
jailbroken it actually kicks it right
when the colonel boots up so it's like
you can't use custom firmware right
after the reason that yet the like put
it back to dfu mode stuff as for a 4.2
jailbreak we can see a tailored one for
sure for sure each other job ray the out
for on tethered I heard that comics is
actually trying to get the old exploit
working that used on 4.1 then it will
work on 4.2 as long as your SHSH blobs I
don't know how they're gonna do I get
but it's in the works it's all I know
yeah I've heard the same thing then that
was it the better sense it was about
either the 4.1 or even the 4.2 beta 3 sh
sh yeah yeah so i don't know how like a
dead but so you definitely will be able
to do snowbreeze updated middle east
tethered for 4.2 then right yeah you
know I wanted to actually include back
backwards compatibility like I didn't
you point oh we went all the way back to
three-point oh there's stuff like that
it just got really really like choppy
and it looked all garbage yeah I the
cold so I just kind of slept everything
way supposed to be just for 4.1 and
what's your point you yeah I can
understand that I mean you know there
are some people who are still in older
firmwares but really I don't know how
many people you know if you're going to
be updating or jailbreaking why don't
you just go ahead and update I mean some
people i guess the abacus compatibility
would be useful but i think most people
you know just update to the latest
firmware and you know don't worry about
it oh so you're also going to be getting
up an updated version of high reps in
yeah i'm not sure we're going on right
now that you're talking oh you are cool
any idea when that's going to be out oh
okay cool cool um so you gots no Bruce
you've got I Reb any other new projects
that you've been working on lately not
really like it's just no reason thinking
up a lot of time because of the way that
new their exploits are working these
days complicating yeah so it took me a
while to actually put that one out but I
did last night and so that's probably at
this much as I going to do right now
until summer Oh what sounds great so
actually you think that I really hurt
too much about it or actually these lace
Joe breaks a lot harder than before I
think people are just thinking that it's
a lot harder because I got to put it in
dfu mode you think yeah that's it yeah I
mean yeah I mean there have been all
kinds of jumpers I know I get tons of
people like you know like like where is
the new jailbreak me or where's the new
spirit and I don't think I mean how big
of a deal is it you know to you know put
into DFU mode I mean it you know it
turns from a 30-second jailbreak to a
two-minute jail where I got it's not
that big a deal I don't know but I guess
what people just want it as simple as
possible oh I don't understand real hard
like the exploits are here to like Joe
break me and I'm rated everything yeah
yeah I mean jailbreak me I mean that was
Jim Bettis through the browser I was you
know using a PDF s that's a lot
different from actually I think do you
know get all the exploits set up and you
know actually get especially you know
what you do with getting the custom
firmware and getting itunes to you know
you're not giving error message and all
that kind of stuff so I know it's a lot
more complicated okay so for the second
segment of d3 live will be taking live
questions for my body in the chat as
always every episode III life is filmed
in front blog TV we have quite a few
people in there so wyd just take some
questions um so what devices do you have
I hate snow okay ready 2g iphone 3g
iphone 3gs old bootrom iphone for ipod
touch 2g mb model ipod touch 4 and ipod
touch 1g ipad and that's about it for
now oh yeah actually I need to get
myself an apple TV yeah I don't have
that I only have an ipod touch 2nd
generation mb model and ipod touch 4th
generation I really I need to get a lot
more especially I need to give myself an
iphone but yeah I will ever talk to you
about jailbreaking and I never received
an email from them unless a very my spam
folder hahaha III just measure that Amy
would look like hi would you quit nope
owning our devices thanks Steve Jobs um
but Joe bright do I / I hate snow
recommend hmm so what kind of gym what
what's your favorite jailbreak what what
what do you like like I just like her
like specific ones oh if you're looking
for a quick and easy solution and you're
not in a walker greenpoison redsnow or
line rate is the way to go as long as
you're on 4.1 4.1 if you're a nun locker
and you need to preserve your base then
you're on four point oh so you can use
an unlock then snowbreeze are punished
will be the way to go I couldn't agree
more actually I really a really bad you
didn't just say automatically just say
snow resets that's pretty cool and I'm
sure a lot of people just said he's mine
he's mine but yeah that's pretty cool
can I hate snow control for making a
jailbreak or have you ever um I don't
think so what do you think I'm in
trouble yeah hmm no because
this will Millennium Copyright Act that
she doesn't like tennis completely legal
mmhmm yeah i agree i mean i'm sure they
can go after you for proving video if
Apple 12 they can go after anyone but I
don't I think yeah I think making the
jailbreaks I don't think that's that big
a deal um i hate's know your real name
steam cool yeah that would be pretty
cool if your real name was aight aight
to know especially with you can delete
their yes is making jailbreaks heart
well in the sea today it's difficult to
just come into the scene right now I
mean colonists you look at it he just
came into the scene when I was three
point one point three buddies has had
previous experience with we happy yeah
we good mmm but if you're just like
popping to the scene you need to have
some experience previously with other
skills such as arm assembly packing it
too I don't know whatever whatever you
previously done with hacking you have to
understand how to actually exploit a
vulnerability stuff like that yeah yeah
i agree i mean the iphone ipod touch is
it's apples had a long time to really
you know build up all kinds of security
so you know a newbie probably would not
be able to get very far you get the name
snowbreeze well you know has always been
whether names like rain snow something
bad hi football reason because i was the
only thing that i came up with after in
weather drops your favorite hat from
cydia um i would have to say XP settings
yeah yeah yeah I should have to agree
with you there sbsettings is I I can't
tell you how many people I get like
comments and stuff going like I
jailbreak just presby settings like
they're actually like tons of people who
don't even do anything else jailbreak
they just download sbsettings and they
just look at that that's uh I'm sure I'm
sure we'll probably see Apple probably
rip off sbsettings in iOS 5 but yeah
you noticed on the ipad 4 4.2 if you
poll eyes the the right you'll see that
they started playing in the brightness
toggle on the left side yeah it's
actually yeah that's actually a good
point so well i guess i won't complain
too much I'd like type sbsettings
everywhere always so uh I wouldn't
applying too much so yeah guys that's it
for this week's episode of d3 live I'm
it definitely like to give a special
thanks to I hate snow for being my guest
definitely eyes go ahead and check him
out I'm going to check out snowbreeze
his website all kind good stuff but yeah
