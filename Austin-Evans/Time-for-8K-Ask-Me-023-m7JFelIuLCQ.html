think it will take a que resolution to
become more affordable a que is an
entirely different world it ret actually
just announced that there's going to be
a new aka red camera which I'm sure it's
gonna be just ridiculously expensive and
there have been a few 8k displays for
example I've seen a couple and see yes
the last few years but 4k I think is
gonna be here it's almost kind of here
right now and especially if you give it
like another year or two it's gonna be
pretty much the norm 8k I'm not so sold
that that's gonna be in everyone's homes
anytime soon what do you think about UHD
coming to next-gen consoles I think at
this point UHD is going to be coming on
the next next-gen consoles so right now
the ps4 and the Xbox one don't support
4k I think it might be possible that
they might see some kind of update to be
able to watch like 4k video at some
point I have no idea if that's actually
the case but it seems somewhat
believable to me but as far as I should
be able to play like hardcore games at
4k a lot of times console games aren't
even hitting 1080p so to make that jump
to 4k don't think we're gonna see it
this generation can you start vlogging
it'll be good
it's funny you mention that because I've
actually been doing a lot of periscope
streams lately so if you guys don't know
what periscope is it's a live streaming
app and it links in with Twitter and
I've actually be doing a lot of them and
I've been out here in LA the last few
days and it's a really cool thing it
reminds me kind of like vlogging so the
way it works is if you watch the stream
live obviously you get to you know check
it out and comment in that kind of stuff
but if you watch it later you've got 24
hours to see the replay on periscope so
even if you're a little bit late or you
know you check out the stream after it's
over so I know I get like a vibe of I
don't think I would ever start like a
vlog Channel or anything like that but
periscope I mean it's so easy I just
pull out my phone shoot like a quick
little live stream and you know it could
be to take like 5 minutes and people can
watch it so I know I'm a big fan of
periscope if you guys want to follow me
I'll have the link in the description
but it's at Austin at Duncan seems like
Twitter and Facebook and that kind of
stuff while editing your videos what's
the piece of equipment or software that
saves you the most time
for me it's definitely the camera so I
use a Canon c100 and it's an expensive
camera for sure don't get me wrong but
there's a lot of features about the
camera they just make my life a lot
easier
so for example when I'm talking to you
guys right now I have a mic right above
me and just go straight into the camera
so I have to go and sync two microphones
and have like extra recorders all over
the place there's a lot of features like
ND filters and the fact that can like
punch in to get focus there's a lot of
cool stuff about the c100 that makes my
life a lot easier it's actually part of
the reason why I haven't gone to 4k the
file sizes on this camera are tiny so I
can edit it on anything whereas when you
get 4k footage it becomes a lot more of
a pain to edit upload there's a lot of
stuff that you know kind of goes into
making 4k possible so c100 is definitely
the the workhorse behind the scenes are
you Austin not Duncan in disguise
Allison no even though the MacBook has a
core M CPU do you think it'll handle
Final Cut Pro 10 yeah I think it will I
mean I haven't tried it yet but the
thing is with the new MacBook yes it's
very low powered it's like a 5 watt CPU
there's no fan like on paper it looks
like it's really really underpowered but
the thing is it's actually not that bad
so we've been seeing benchmarks coming
out that shows it's really not that far
behind a MacBook Air and I've actually
edited a lot of my own videos on a
MacBook Air so it won't be the perfect
experience for sure but it should be
able to handle it what is your
motivation for making a youtube video
almost every week I've been doing
youtube since I was 16
that's a huge huge chunk of my life and
so at this point I can't even remember
what like my life was like before
YouTube and I know that sounds so stupid
and I get it but like I just been doing
it for so long this is just how I do
things right like I don't think there's
been a single day in the last six years
where I've not thought about YouTube
it's just I don't know it's I don't even
know how to describe it but I don't
there's not really a motivation there
it's like I don't need to be motivated
to go eat or go to sleep or you know
whatever so I don't need motivation to
make youtube videos I just do it so if
you guys have any more questions you
want to ask for next time feel free to
hit me up on Twitter and Facebook and of
course those links will be in the
description of this video along with
things like periscope and some of the
videos that John and I have been doing
this weekend anyway guys thank you so
much for watching and I will catch you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
