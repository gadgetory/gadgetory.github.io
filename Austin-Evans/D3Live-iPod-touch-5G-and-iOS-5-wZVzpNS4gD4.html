talking about the next generation of
ipod touch along with iOS 5 so starting
to get a little bit later in the year
the rumors and all that kinda stuff is
really starting to pick up so I'm going
to do today is condensed what all I've
heard well I expect and what all we all
of us expect to see in the next
generation of ipod touch along with iOS
5 so the begin with we're going to talk
a little about the ipod touch and now of
course every year apple updates their
iphone ipod touch and now the ipad lines
so we've got a good idea what to expect
now the first thing is is the Apple a5
dual-core CPU this is the same way it
came there's a new apple last year apple
a4 and the ipad that came out in iphone
4 and finally came around the ipod touch
so absolutely expect to see the same
processor from the ipad trickle down to
both the iphone the ipod touch later
this year I know what that will mean is
that internet browser will be much
faster and especially in gains the
graphical performance is going to be
much much superior to the current
generation of processors in the iphone
the ipod touch so that's going to be a
big deal but as far as no gaming and all
that kind of good stuff always more
speed is better now as far as the actual
design itself goes up not really i
wasn't sure there's a couple of people
that have a couple of different ideas of
what's floating around as far what we're
going to see on the one hand it might be
just a basically a super super minor
upgrade just like when they did with the
third generation meaning there's not
going to be any major how we're
improving survivor it's going to look
basically the same just some internal
stuff on speed and all that kind of
stuff on the other hand though there's a
lot of talk about a larger display on
the iphone and of course i would imagine
that would trickle down to the ipod
touch so what that would mean is that a
larger screen press preps 3.7 inches or
so maybe even a little bit bigger than
that and in the same footprint which
means that it basically would just get
rid of a lot of the bezel just kind of
stretch out a little bit more which of
course is always good and it should
remain a Retina display now as far as
the that goes i'm not a harmston sure if
we're going to see that um i would i
would expect we you see on the iphone
but whether actually comes down to ipod
touch on that how to ensure a better
area i don't think a slightly bigger
screen is going to make all that big of
a difference and now one thing that i am
really really hoping forward to seeing
the next ipod touch is a better camera
and of course having
ipod touch that's great but the one that
they put in the ipod touch 4th
generation is not very good at all I'm
it does shoot 720p video but the point 7
megapixel stills are not good in the
slightest I I don't care which way you
look at it on they're really small and I
just don't look back right so what I
hope for is they could increase the you
know the camera quality at it I'm not
asking for something as good as on the
iphone 4 of course that's a fairly thick
sensor would probably require them
redesigning a lot of it making the ipod
touch a bit thicker but i really do
believe that they could make a better
quality camera inside the ipod touch 5th
generation that's mostly what I'm
looking for far as when we can expect to
see this hour typically we do see it in
September however it looks like the
iPhone 5 is going to be pushed back to
September so we might see in September
or it might even be a little bit farther
so definitely keep an eye out for that
but I would imagine would probably be in
the sep tember to october time frame and
then moving on to the software side of
course it's going to apply a lot to the
iphone 5 as well is iOS 5 now iOS 5 is
again something that we've been waiting
for for quite a while it's going to be
the next generation operating system for
both the iphone ipod touch and
eventually the ipad another a lot of
speculations a lot of people who have
been talking about iOS 5 and that it's
probably going to be a lot of big
features so I'm going to try condense it
down to some of the bigger ones that I
think are going to be the most important
the first of which is widget support and
this is not confirmed we don't know this
going to happen but I absolutely would
really love if that they bring widgets
over just like on Android now if you've
ever used an Android device you'll know
that there are a wide variety of widgets
the thought you to look at the time
whether i turn on and off Wi-Fi there's
a wide variety of stuff you can do it
off straight from your home screen so
you know it's really quick you don't
have to go into settings not kind of
good stuff something else I expect to
see in the next version of iOS 5 is
better Facebook and Twitter integration
of course there are standard facebook
and twitter apps that are available I
mean they work really quite nicely but
what I would like to see is better
integration into the OS itself and
there's a lot you know talk about this
the most been called the friend stream
feature on as far as how it works
exactly i don't really know but overall
if it's going to help you get your
Twitter and Facebook and all that kind
of stuff a lot easier i'm all for it now
that's most of what i expect to see now
of course there
other things such as like a UI overhaul
but I won't really get into that right
now but suffice it to say believes that
both the ipod touch 5th generation and
iOS 5 should be a solid upgrade okay so
for the second segment of did three live
I'm going to be taking live questions
from everyone in the chat started a lot
of people in your now so just gotta go
ahead and take some questions and I see
what you guys have to say it's more
realistic the ipod touch 5th generation
has a 2 megapixel camera yeah I think
yeah I think it's somewhere along lines
what I was thinking I mean I really let
me think that we need 1080p video or not
a 5 megapixel camera or anything like
that but I'm just hoping for an
improvement i mean the points of
megapixels that's just I mean that was
okay in 1998 but this is 2011 that bed
just doesn't cut in my opinion do I
think it will cost considerably more no
I'm pretty sure I mean they typically
have always lowered the price now with
the recent generation they did raise it
up i believe about thirty dollars or so
um but i think if it cost any more i
think it's going to be a small amount i
don't think it's going to be like
dramatically more expensive in fact it
might even be a little bit cheaper
knowing apple what devices will have
Iowa's available yeah thatthat such a
great point if you guys are not familiar
with the the earlier version um just
recently they drop support for the
iphone 3gs in the ipod touch 2nd
generation so a lot of people were kind
of worried about whether their devices
are ever going to get updates or not i
can tell you this i would be surprised
if the iphone 3gs in the ipod touch 3rd
generation the third generation the
third generation of devices never see
iOS 5 um i think it's possible I mean we
oh and that we never know what features
they decide to add but in my opinion I
would be pretty surprised if they don't
at least see iOS 5 they've pretty much
gotten to the deal where you know you
comes out in iOS to you see iOS three
iOS four so hopefully yeah you at least
get one more major update will apple
change iOS 5 multitasking right question
that's something that I really honestly
don't have any clue about I'd certainly
hope that they would um the multitasking
it works decently but another huge fan
of having to scroll through and it's
just it's just not a seamless experience
in my opinion but yeah I honestly have
no idea i mean i think
some things that they could do but if
whether they will actually do it or not
um no idea anyway guys that's about it
