to be doing an application review on
fruit ninja this is a pretty cool app
guys I got to say it is currently $0.99
in the App Store and I'm liking a lot so
let's go ahead just jump right on into
the review um so it's guys we got a
really cool menu screen so let's say we
want to about about so you don't just
tap it not for you cut in half so it
kind of tells about that kind of good
stuff
oh my god there so it's a very simple
application you know you can check out
more games and OpenFeint but what
shouldn't go strange a new game it's
very simple you just have to cut the
fruit so it's really simple just cut the
fruit it's a lot of fun as you guys can
see the graphics are really nice um up
on the top right you have three X's now
okay that's a bomb you don't need to do
that but hang on let's love wait for a
fruit to come I'm not gonna get on
purpose okay so you see guys well I'm
all right dad okay sorry as you can see
there's two ways to die in this you can
let a fruit fall down to the bottom of
the screen and that will take those X's
or you did a bomb actually I'll take a
look to destroy bomb and show you guys
what that looks like - so it's really
simple guys I mean this is literally the
entire game right here it's nothing
amazing or you know anything you've
never seen before but it's it's a unique
concept I mean you know you basically
just take your finger here watch out
that see and it's really cool how it
explodes and you lose but now let's go
ahead one more time and show you guys a
little more gameplay it's got some nice
it's got some nice sound effects but
what I love is just the graphics
everything is 3d you start cutting the
step up it's a lot of fun guys I mean
what I like to use this game for is uh
is using it kind of you know like you
know when you're in waiting in line or
something because you can see these
games do not last very long I mean my
high scores about 173 and I think I got
that took maybe like three minutes or
four minutes to do so I mean this is a
great pick up and play game your iPhone
iPod Touch or I guess your iPad although
it's not
a specific version as far as I know for
the iPad yet but yeah guys that's about
it you see it gets more difficult as you
go along more bombs will come yeah okay
you got a bunch of stuff but uh yeah
guys so that's about it so this has been
fruit ninja at my application review I
definitely recommend to guys it's only a
dollar in the App Store right now
it's a lot of fun so you definitely
might want to go ahead and take a look
at it anyway thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
