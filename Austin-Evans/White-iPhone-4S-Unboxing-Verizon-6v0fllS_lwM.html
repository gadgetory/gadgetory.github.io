of the brand new iPhone 4s so let's not
just mess around let's just go ahead and
get this thing's open right up of course
this is the brand new iPhone that did
come out today this model I do have here
is a white one as you guys may have
guessed it is a 16 gigabyte model and it
is running on Verizon so yeah I don't
think there's gonna be any difference
between this and say a sprint or a 32
gigabyte or anything like that but we
shall see so hold on the box we have
iPhone 4s have an iCloud logo it's on
for us again an Apple logo put that and
open up and see what we have so we're
gonna separate this here nothing in
there we do have the phone itself which
in true and boxing fashion we'll take a
look at in just about 10 seconds but
first let's see what all accessories we
get so I'm just a little thing here
designed by Apple in California and
Apple stickers we have better had some
Apple stickers I'm gonna be very upset
all right let's see we have fingertips
so it's just a Quick Start Guide nothing
particularly amazing in there you have
the iPhone 4s important information
product information guide which is not
important in the slightest and we have
our Apple stickers so we can in the
bottom box me right now I did order my
brand-new Apple stickers it came with an
iPhone anyway we do have a new 30-pin
dock connector which actually this
actually looks really small I mean it
probably isn't but yeah okay that's a
normal size but yeah normal 30-pin dock
connector I'm sure if you guys have ever
had an Apple product if it already have
one or ten of those right here we do
have the Apple in your head buds which I
believe we're just gonna have the
actually they might have microphones I'm
not sure let's take a look here I guess
they do indeed have and guys here a
microphone so if you want to use these
which you really shouldn't should buy
some nice ones but there you go
and the last blade books actually at is
Lisa we do have a AC adapter for the
wall so course you can just plug this
right in and depending on what country
you live in
it will probably be different but United
States that's what we get all right
get all this junk out of the way look at
the iPhone itself and of course as you
guys can see here now as I mentioned it
is white annum I thought about getting a
black one but I figured you know what
it's about time to get something a
little different so give you guys a
quick run around the phone up here we do
have the VGA front-facing camera this is
the 3.5 inch Retina display with a
resolution of 640 by 960 down here we do
have the home button moving over on to
this side this camera focus you guys can
see we do have the antenna this is going
to be the volume buttons it's going to
be the mute switch yes we do have the
headphone jet the sleep/wake button I'm
not much over on here except for the SIM
card ejector and you go back over here
did we get a sim card that's actually
something out to check we can you think
to eject the sim card I don't actually
think we did it's kind of make sure we
didn't know we didn't so since this is a
Verizon iPhone I suppose unless I'm
missing it somewhere no so we didn't get
anything to eject the sim cards so kind
of interesting but since this course
this doesn't use a sim card
I don't think it'll be a big deal on the
bottom here you guys will find the
30-pin dock connector these speakers as
well as there may be a microphone around
here that I'm not paying attention to
and on the back we do have the eight
megapixel rear facing camera just shoot
1080p video and does have an LED flash
so you guys it's gonna be about it for
my unboxing definitely stay tuned to the
channel I will be doing many many more
videos including a full review demos a
theory and all that kind of good stuff
so if you guys enjoy the video
definitely be sure to leave a thumbs up
