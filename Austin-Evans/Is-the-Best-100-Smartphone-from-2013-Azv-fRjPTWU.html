videos on budget smartphones however
this doesn't something a little bit
different meet the galaxy s4 the hottest
flagship of 2013 that now cost about
$100 this might sound like a weird idea
to do a video on but it's something
that's really interesting to me so one
hand you have a new smartphone that's
meant to hit a budget price but on the
other get something like this it is
dramatically cheaper that was when it
first came out you're still getting all
the advantages of a proper flagship so I
was able to find dis galaxy s4 brand-new
in-the-box however there are still tons
and tons and tons of these phones that
are available on the use market from
anywhere between 70 to 100 dollars so
this brings me back I actually was at
the launch event for the galaxy s4 it's
hard to believe that that was a full
four years ago but what I'm really
curious to see is how old this phone
actually holds up today wow this is so
much smaller than I remember it being
you get that hyper glazed finish on the
back man I remember how much of a
fingerprint magnet this was but I
remember right there's actually a lot of
interesting stuff in the box so not only
do we have the micro USB cable we have a
wall adapter as well it looks like some
fairly generic looking headphones but
because this is an old-school symptom
phone we also have a removable battery
when it comes to the hottest phone of
2013 the galaxy s4 actually doesn't look
too bad today so yes it is definitely
all plastic with a sort of hyper glazed
finish it does look a little bit cheap
so over this go is actually rocking
pretty decent specs for back in the day
oh it's those the charge was it with me
and pulling super old smartphones out of
the boxes actually can turn on that's
crazy
and that's Android 4.2 life this thing
is interesting this was definitely like
sort of peak TouchWiz when they would
throw every possible feature at it and
almost none of them more useful of
course taking a look at a galaxy s4 and
a vacuum is no good so to compare we
have the blue life max now for $100
there's actually a lot to like with this
phone there are a ton of accessories
here and also it's like we have a case
and the screen protectors for $100
that's actually a lot but look at this
phone is very interesting for a budget
device so it has a soft touch rubber
which is meant to look like a leather
and even has sort of fake stitching on
the side actually reminds me of some
older sense
phones I don't hate it though especially
compared to the super generic black
plastic not that bad one thing this does
up going forward is a pretty giant 3,700
million power battery which would
definitely give it tons of longevity
especially considering the specs on top
of that we do have dual SIM cards as
well as a micro SD card slot and if I
pop the back on they'll also be able to
see that in addition to the camera there
is a fingerprint reader on the back that
is really cool for $100 Android phone so
to try the fingerprint reader huh that's
not she pretty quick maybe a little bit
slower than newer flagships but that's
actually not that at all I mean pretty
much leaving your finger on it and
almost immediately unlocks side by side
with the galaxy s4 one of the first
things that you'll notice is just how
much bigger this is and this is fairly
standard for a lot of phones these days
the galaxy s4 just looks tiny in
comparison and what's interesting about
this is that while it does have the
bigger screen at 5.5 inches it's only
720p whereas the galaxy s4 was one of
the very first phones that moved up to
1080 it's an AMOLED display and it does
look a lot nicer it is super interesting
that both of these phones now cost about
$100 especially considering that while
this bone was kind of made to kind of
hit that price point this one has come
so far and yet there's a lot of areas
where they're actually very similar
nobody did both phones have LTE but I
also have quad-core processors with 2
gigabytes of RAM however the biggest
difference here is going to be in
software where's the light Mac ships
with Android 6.0 the Garcias tour
actually has Android 4.2 jelly bean now
that we care you can't upgrade this to
Android 5 which should make a fairly big
difference but a lot of apps out of the
box are just not going to work on this
guy where the galaxy s4 has touch with
pretty much everywhere you look and most
of its not really going to be all that
useful
luckily the light max actually is going
to be a fairly stock build of Android
now to be fair there are a lot of
pre-installed apps which definitely kind
of help to keep the price low but the
good thing is nothing's all that crazy
and of course all of it can be disabled
one of the interesting comparisons
between these two phones are the cameras
so the galaxy s4 is rocking a 13
megapixel camera whereas the blue has a
maple but of course it has four years of
advancement so see how they actually
compare there's a lot of contrast here
but there's a really difficult shot it's
not bad but the background is blown out
and can it
for dirt now I'll take a shot with the
blue oh wow that is a lot more in it to
be fear it's a little bit of an older
school style of doing HDR so you can
actually see it taking multiple
exposures but this is a much more usable
image get a little bit of a more normal
shot though and the gallery has four it
looks a lot better colors a lot more
vibrant you can see it's a bigger sense
there's a little bit of depth of field
in the background whereas with the blue
it's very washed out and yeah that is
not sharp at all I'm actually really
impressed with how good this galaxy has
for camera is now yeah if you push it
really hard with a very contrast the
image it's not quite so great looking
but you get a decent looking shot and it
is really clean one area where things
definitely have improved over the last
few years is in selfie technology so
that's actually pretty close I think I
might have to give a slight edge to the
galaxy s4 based on sharpness the blue
just looks a little soft
the more you use these phones more
realize that they are very very similar
in most ways but the biggest difference
the software but simply Android 6 is
totally modern vintage all apps will run
on it well yes this is nothing most
colorful in the world for $100 it will
be basically everything you needed to
you can go to options here a safe one
and a risky one so with blue not only
you're getting a brand new phone that's
running that newer version of Android
which just simply means it's going to
last longer on the other hand I like the
Galaxy s4 as a phone more but at some
point in the not-too-distant future app
support really just isn't going to be a
thing here so $400 which of these phones
would you guys go for let me know in the
comments below and I will catch you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
