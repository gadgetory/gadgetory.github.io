of the re earth rank case to the ipod
touch 4th generation so I've been using
this case for almost two weeks now and
I've got to say I am very very impressed
it's got some really cool features about
it and I look without any further ado
let's just go ahead and jump right on
into it and obviously I had used this
before just put it back in the packaging
just show you how it comes it's pretty
nice packaging it's very very basic very
plain but that's okay because I'll be
sleeping you're not buying this with
packaging you're buying this for the
case so when we take this out there are
a few really key things i'd like to go
ahead and point out about this case it
really made it stand out from a lot of
the others um so well i was looking at
this on the website it looks kind of
like silicon and it kind of looks like
it I mean you see here you know I can
bend it and stuff like that however um
it's not it's it's I've never seen
anything like this um I know I'm a big
fan of TPU cases I've actually done a
review on one before what it's kind of
like our rubber it's kind of like a
hardened rubber however this is
something totally different as far as I
know as it has you know it's got some
flexibility and everything we can go
ahead and bend it however it is not you
know doesn't feel like silicone
whatsoever it does feel like like a
vinyl or something really it's very
interesting and I actually like it quite
a bit you know it's not going to be the
best for protection you know I would
guess it would do better than silicon
I'm how I just like the feel of it
because it's not like a most silicone
cases I don't like just because you know
they can't get all sticky and whatnot
but this one's very very smooth and it
looks quite nice so let's go ahead and
just take my ipod touch here and just
slide it in it works fairly similar to
how a silicone case works as far as you
know putting it in you just line it up
here and just smooth down the edges so
it's quite just slide it in here and
just pull the edges over and there we go
so once it's in you'll find that it's a
very nice-looking case it does have a
minor lay on the table design again not
the best protection will do with this
case I mean I don't have any problems at
all doing that with it but you know
it'll be a bit ly a low-bred protection
and it looks quite nice you know when
you're
are using it like this so there we go
obviously you can still get your home
button you know the front a touchscreen
everything is totally exposed I know we
flip it over to the bank you find a
couple of really cool things so they
actually have a cutout for the apple
logo uh you know I'm not the biggest fan
I'm a big fan of rotation of my cases
I'm really personally I'll i buy a case
i buy it just for tool protection i
don't i don't really like I don't really
care what it looks like so much that
that's a smaller facture than the
protection however I've gotta admit this
is kind of cool so you can see the apple
logo you know you can it is exposed I'm
going to bring it in however the cutouts
not a one hundred percent perfect
however it's pretty close it looks
pretty decent same goes for the camera
not a hundred percent perfect but you
know for a case like this I'm not going
to worry about the envy the slightest
tiny portion of a millimeter not a big
deal the important thing is is that this
is you know you can still see the apple
logo and the camera microphone are
totally unobstructed so definitely
really good so go in just give you guys
a quick little walkthrough or so i
already showed the front now one really
cool thing that well obviously this is
one of the biggest things why i like
cases on the ipod touch 4th generation
is the buttons now i can't stand these
volume buttons without a case on it's
just they're just too hard to get at
however i'm not so sure you guys should
be able to see that pretty well they are
very very raised here and they work
fantastic love love love how they do the
buttons in this case excellent same goes
for the power button I'm very simple and
very easy to get at so you know you
don't actually have to look around and
you know try to pull your fingers wrong
way or whatever like normal the case
absolutely takes care for you now on the
bottom one the camera to focus here
you'll see that it does have a small cut
out for the speaker again what's just
fun you have a spot for the 30-pin
adapter and also the headphones so
that's about it guys overall I am very
impressed with this case I like it a lot
more than I thought I did it's
definitely going to be my daily case
from now on you know it's just a nice
material it's nothing special it's not
going to be you know anything amazing
you know like stylistically or anything
like that however it's a nice looking
case it will give you some decent
protection and it's fairly cheap you can
go ahead I of course have a link in the
description it costs about seventeen
dollars currently on the rear earth
website
and that includes free shipping so it's
pretty good deal anyway I would
definitely like to give a big thanks to
the folks over to earth who sent this
out to me for free to review so you can
go ahead and check them out of course in
the link in the description below anyway
guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
