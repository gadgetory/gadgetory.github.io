how about the best ever for this top
five I've teamed up with my friend mkbhd
so Marquette is take it away all right
so it's a tough task rounding up any
all-time list but we're starting off at
number five here with a classic and when
I say classic I mean we're going way
back to the Motorola DynaTAC so the
commercials for this phone are hilarious
to watch now in 2013 because the DynaTAC
came out in the beginning of the era of
completely portable phones so phones
first were so big you really only had
house phones and they got them down
small enough that people could have car
phones and then finally the wealthy
early adopters of completely portable
phones so this was a pioneer that came
out in 1984 it supported a call time of
roughly 30 minutes on battery and an
eight-hour standby time and it had a
memory of well it could fit 30 contacts
in the phone also fun fact DynaTAC the
name is actually an abbreviation for
dynamic active total area control now
I'm not going to say this is the
smallest phone in the world and it's
certainly not the cheapest coming in at
$39.99 99 but I can definitely guarantee
you that the smart phones we have today
are a direct result of this huge leap of
faith and the DynaTAC was easily one of
the most influential and one of the most
important phones of all time and number
four is the HTC hd2 now this probably
sounds like a weird choice but this was
an important phone for a few reasons
first of all is the huge for the time
4.3 inch screen back in 2009 the iPhone
had what was considered a big display
but the HD 2 blew it away in both size
and resolution it also featured a 1
gigahertz Snapdragon processor making it
at least at the time the most powerful
phone you could buy now Windows Mobile
was definitely starting to get outdated
by 2009 however what has made the HD 2
special is that it's able to run
basically every operating system ever it
even runs Android and no not some
three-year old version you can load
Android 4.4 KitKat on the HD 2 right now
you know what phone doesn't come with
kitkat you know the Galaxy s4 but no big
deal this for your old phone can handle
it
even Windows Phone 8 and Windows RT have
been shown running on the hd2 it even
works with a bun - in Firefox OS so
between the crazy software support and
the awesome screen specs the HD 2 was
one hell of a phone so coming in at
number three is the original the og
Motorola Droid so this slider came out
in late 2009 which was perfect timing
along with its massive
I don't dry does ad campaign to become
the face of the Android vs. iPhone war
that still wages today as a matter of
fact this phone was so popular because
of that campaign that people four years
after it came out called all Android
phones droids and not only that but this
droid was sort of a flagship for all
Android phones for the masses and you
can kind of think of it acting as a
Nexus phone before the Nexus line even
existed so this phone launched with
brand new Android 2.0 it was an
exclusive it was on Verizon and it was
the only phone to launch with vanilla
Android 2.0 and it got official updates
for two full years after it came out
till the end of 2011 and even after that
it continued to get more unofficial
updates similar to the HTC hd2 in that a
lot of the hackers and people who put
roms on it ended up actually
overclocking their phones to keep it up
with the newest operating system I
personally had mine at one point two
five gigahertz which is more than double
the stock clock speed so this phone was
super durable and it lasted a very long
time for a lot of people so essentially
this phone represented the birth of a
new very competitive operating system
and it became the face of it all so our
IP physical keyboards coming in at
number two is the original Apple iPhone
if you take a look at smart phones
before the iPhone things looked very
differently before smart phones look
like this with small screens terrible
operating systems hardly any apps kind
of a mess after the iPhone well I think
it's pretty obviously was a major game
changer
while the first iPhone definitely wasn't
perfect it did bring a lot of very
important new features it sported a full
3.5 inch multi-touch display that didn't
require a stylus and just as importantly
a new operating system iPhone OS or as
we know it today
iOS after the
launched within a few years giants like
Nokia blackberry and palm we're all
either a fraction of the previous size
if not outright dead not bad for Apple's
first crack at a phone alright so number
one the greatest phone of all time you
may have seen this one coming already
it's the Nokia 3310 now there were
actually also a lot of similar Nokia
phones I came out around the same time
in 2001 a 3310 came out but what can say
I mean there were just so many legendary
things about this phone this is the
phone that people think of when they
think of old phones are classic phones
it was the epitome of a device that
could appeal to the masses easily it
became one of the first phones to ditch
those retractable plastic antennas that
so many Philip phones had so that became
a cool thing to do it was one of the
first phones to have a screen saver kind
of like a wallpaper and that became a
cool thing to do it had a battery life
for days on days on days even if you
used it full time for all of those days
I wish that was still a popular thing to
do
moto maker this is way before moto maker
and it still had the custom designs way
before it actually took off you could
actually snap on and off the front of
the phone to have different designs or
different colors and this phone was and
still is basically indestructible a lot
of it is because of how compact it was I
mean you could scratch the phone not a
problem still works you could drop the
phone not a problem still works you
could step on it not a problem
roll it over with a car not a problem
people have shot this phone there are
videos of it on YouTube and let's just
say that the 3310 takes a bullet way
better than any of the other phones on
this list my dad used to have a 3310 and
I remember spending hours playing snake
on it after school
but the crazy thing is it's actually
held up pretty well it has threaded SMS
voice dialing and even a few small apps
all of this combined with over 125
million units shipped and I don't think
it's an exaggeration to say that the
Nokia 3310 helped connect the world so
what do you guys think is the best phone
ever let us know in the comments below
