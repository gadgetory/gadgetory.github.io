words Mac and gaming don't go in the
same sentence but is it possible if you
want a gaming computer a Mac shouldn't
be your first choice but what I want to
know is can you game it all on a macbook
take a look at the specs of this 2015 13
inch MacBook Pro and it's got a decent
Core i7 CPU but the integrated iris 6100
graphics aren't exactly made for
hardcore gaming last year I tried a few
games on a Mac Pro with much better
specs and it did reasonably well but how
will the MacBook stack up the first
problem is just finding games that work
on OS 10 there are a few titles in
origin and in the Mac App Store but your
choices are pretty limited
luckily steam is also available and here
there's a pretty decent selection with
quite a few games from my library that
will work on Mac first we have
Borderlands the pre-sequel here is
totally playable on low at 720p on the
MacBook and just like on steamos
the pre-sequel as a solid port that's
basically identical to the Windows
version move over to Tomb Raider and
it's not quite so nice it's almost
playable at 720p but we're getting
pretty significant framerate drops jump
over to Metro last light Redux and
things are a bit smoother but we're
still dealing with the occasional
choppiness during the more intense
scenes things aren't off to a great
start but has the macbook handle less
hardcore games minecraft is a staple of
basically every gaming platform on the
planet and the Mac is no exception
performance is just fine even at 1080p
as long as you notch the render distance
back up it League of Legends is the same
story this is a rock-solid version of
the game for Mac that runs no problem on
Macs at 1080p so a MacBook can handle
mainstream games fairly well but next I
want to see what we could do running
Windows using boot camp I loaded a
preview copy of Windows 10 which opens a
much bigger library of PC games trying
to murder again it's clear that Windows
makes a big difference we're seeing much
more playable frame rates even with the
graphics bumped up to medium which got
me curious how much of a difference is
there
I ran the built-in benchmark on medium
at 720p and the windows performance was
over double what it was on OS 10
averaging 43 frames per second compared
to just shy of 20 running Yosemite for a
laptop with integrated graphics this
isn't half bad but let's try a couple
newer more demanding titles load up
Grand Theft Auto 5 and is totally
playable on low at 720p well as long as
you have a mouse anyway the only problem
was a weird texture issue that made
something
this seems more like a GTA problem than
the MacBooks fault
shadow of Mordor is another great
looking game and here we're able to get
decent frame rates on low nothing to
blow you away but it's entirely usable
if you want to play more casual games a
MacBook is fine but for demanding titles
it might not be a bad idea to install
Windows via boot camp it'll give you way
more options and things should run a
fair bit better the addition of metal to
OS 10 El Capitan should improve gaming
performance similar to DirectX 12 so
will be interesting to revisit this next
year
so as a Macbook of good gaming PC no not
even close but if you want to play the
occasional game on a macbook it's
totally possible</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
