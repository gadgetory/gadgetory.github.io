today I'm here is a video going over my
picks for the best Android Ice Cream
Sandwich phones the first phone is going
to be the Samsung Galaxy Nexus now this
was announced a couple of weeks ago and
is going to be the first official phone
to hit with I android 4.0 AKA Ice Cream
Sandwich some of the specs include a 4.6
5 inch Super AMOLED HD display with a
whopping resolution of 1280 by 720
you'll also find a 1.2 gigahertz
dual-core processor a full gigabyte of
RAM as well as either 16 or 32 gigabytes
of storage there are a couple of reasons
why I like the galaxy nexus for starters
is going to be the fastest way for you
get your hands on ice cream sandwich is
that will be out before the end of the
month on top of that since it is a nexus
branded phone it should get updates much
quicker than its other non-nexus
counterparts so this means that you'll
be able to get the latest versions of
Android as soon as possible as opposed
to happen to wait months for skins and
all kinds of stuff to be updated you'll
be able to get the pure Android
experience as quick as possible the
Galaxy Nexus will be launching as I said
before the end of the month and should
run you about $300 or so on contract a
little bit pricey be definitely worth it
if you're really interested in the
latest and greatest it will be coming in
both hspa+ as well as LTE variations so
no matter what carriers anything like
that around the world you will have an
excellent very fast phone moving on
we're going to have one of the first HTC
phones to launch with ice cream sandwich
the villa this one is going to support a
4.3 inch qhd Super AMOLED display an 8
megapixel camera as well as I 1.5
gigahertz snapdragon dual-core processor
now this one is still rumoured it has
not been officially announced however
definitely wouldn't be surprised as to
your phone just like it specs everything
line up with exactly what HTC has been
doing lately so if you're interested in
this one it will most likely will be
released sometime early next year moving
on we have what is codenamed the LGU one
just from this picture alone I'm real
excited about the design of the lgu one
you can see here it looks to be very
thin most likely somewhere within the
seven to nine millimeter range as far as
thickness goes which is very close to
some other phones such as the razor as
well as the Galaxy Nexus it also seems
to have an eight megapixel camera as
well as most likely a full 720p display
just like the HTC villa this is not
official yet however I would definitely
keep an eye out for both of these phones
at CES on top of these phones which are
going to be shipping with ice cream
sandwich there are also several
current phones such as the HTC reason
which will be getting an ice cream
sandwich update a little bit later if
you enjoyed this video definitely sure
to leave a thumbs up and if you're
interested more videos on all these
phones when they come out be sure to
