here with the video going over what to
expect at CES 2013 if you guys are not
familiar CES is the consumer electronic
show this is by far the biggest walleye
convention of tech where all the major
companies with a couple exceptions like
Apple but pretty much everyone else will
come be there showing off all kinds of
new tech and I will also be there so I'm
hopping on a plane this weekend i'll be
spending an entire week in Las Vegas
next week to cover all the cool new tech
goodies and gadgets and all that kind of
stuff exactly just for you guys trust me
i know i'll be in vegas for a week but
I've been what I won't have any fun no
enjoyment whatsoever my end it's a
hundred percent for you guys did the not
sell it cuz I hope you did if you've
ever been to CES you know that there are
a lot of TVs there when I say that I'm
not like using that word lightly there
are so many TVs absolutely everywhere
and usually there's some kind of gimmick
so a couple years ago it was 3d TVs
which kind of sort of took off but not
really last year is all about smart TVs
whether it would be Google TV or some
kind of proprietary bit but this year I
feel like we're going to be going over
to quality and moving on to 4k TVs a
normal high definition TV has a
resolution of 1920 x 1080 now this has
been around for quite a few years and
there's really nothing wrong with it but
if you ever take a look at a 4k TV it
looks much much better with over four
times as many pixels cramped on to a
really nice large display Sony should be
releasing their new Xperia Z which is a
5-inch phone with a 1080p resolution now
this is something I expect to see on
several phones at the show this year as
1080p is going to be the next step but
from 720p that you see on most
smartphones today I've already taking a
look at one phone with a 1080p screen it
was the HTC droid DNA and while there
are some things that really wasn't a
huge fan of on the phone the screen was
absolutely not one of them the screen
was by far the best screen I've seen on
any mobile device it's definitely going
to make a big difference when it comes
to other phones such as the Xperia Z
Windows 8 is also going to be big at the
show this year so it's only been out for
a little while now and believe me when I
say they were going to see some new and
cool different things running Windows 8
so of course we're going to see normal
laptops and desktops it's pretty much a
given we're also going to see some cool
new ultrabooks definitely some new
tablets maybe even something from Nokia
so we definitely been hearing some
things about nokia being able to make a
tablet running Windows RT and we'll see
if that shows up at CES my money's
probably will see a little bit later on
the year but regardless definite expect
all kinds of crazy and wild can
captions running Windows 8 that we may
or may not ever actually be able to buy
CES is such a big show there are also
lots of other slightly smaller things
that will be all over the place so for
example we're always going to see cool
new gaming pc stuff whether it's going
to be new cases graphics cards
motherboards until of course we'll be
there and most likely will be talking
about the new upcoming Haswell
architecture which was what we're going
to be writing in core i3 s and core i5
and core i7 is a little bit later on
this year now guys I have a question for
you what are you interested in seeing at
CES 2013 like I said I'll be there I'll
be doing lots and lots of videos from
the show floor so you guys have anything
in particular that you want to see me
cover definitely be sure to let me know
in the comments down below if you guys
want to see all the awesome CES 2013
coverage be sure to subscribe to the
channel by clicking on my face right now
so it's a little bit awkward but as long
as you click on my face you'll be able
to check out all the awesome new
coverage from CES so of course there's
gonna be all the kind of stuff that I
talked about here there's well some cool
stuff I can't quite talk about yet but
definitely I've got some cool meeting
set up a couple of cool hands on some
products that you guys are not going to
want to miss beyond that be sure to hit
that like button if you guys enjoyed and
I will catch you guys next time
large phones we get eaten bigger and
bigger and bigger as the name what I
definitely feel that lots of other
manufacturers they've kind of been
probably paid attention to that so
definitely expect to see some more large
screen TVs and phone phones large screen
TVs you know because that's totally
relevant to what I was talking about and
you say hey hit a button and uploads it
via Wi-Fi and scram or something I mean
you know it might not Adam okay so what
we're going to do this time is talk
about all the cool stuff that will be
coming out this year whether it be a
tablet phone TV magical robot that does
the dishes whatever actually that's a
dishwasher whatever we're going to be
talking about right now dishwasher
that's actually have you ever thought
about that a dishwasher is actually like
I robot that pretty much everyone has I
don't know it's actually kind of cool i
just just kind of realize that everyone
has a robot and it's called a dishwasher
and it washes your dishes for you you
put it in and wash your dish that is
really cool isn't appliance a robot I
think I should move on</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
