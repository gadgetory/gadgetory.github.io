the first three android 3.0 honeycomb
tablets that are going to be available
the motorola xoom the LG optimus tab
which is also going to be known as the
t-mobile g slate in the United States
and the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 each of
these tablets will be on sale soon and
have their own strengths and weaknesses
so let's take a look to start with we
have the motorola xoom i had some
hands-on time of the zoom at cts last
month and came away very impressed the
hardware is undoubtedly solid with a
10.1 inch display with a resolution of
1280 by 800 along with an impressively
small bezel you also will find support
for verizon 3g along with the ability to
upgrade to 4g later on in the summer
there also should be a Wi-Fi only model
which should be available in spring some
of the smaller touches include a user
replaceable battery which certainly a
great addition along with a swamp for a
microSD card it also features a
2-megapixel front-facing camera and a
5-megapixel rear-facing camera along
with HDMI out for outputting up to 1080p
video on a high-definition television
the zoom has a 1 gigahertz dual-core
nvidia to processor along with one
gigabyte of ram which gives it more than
enough power to run android 3.0
honeycomb speaking of the operating
system it runs a pure stock version of
android just like the other two tablets
which have been faster updates to future
firmwares the biggest question with the
zoom is price most rumours peg it at
around eight hundred dollars for the 32
gigabyte 3g model which while I don't
think as a deal-breaker is certainly
quite a bit next let's take a look at
the LG optimus tab this tablet
differentiates itself from the others
was the smaller 8.9 inch display however
the key is that supports 3d a bike with
glasses while the requirement for
glasses to view any 3d content is less
than ideal you can of course new content
and standard 2d like other tablets the
Optimus tab is going to come with
support for t-mobile 4g along with of
course Wi-Fi and 32 gigabytes of
internal storage a very cool feature of
the tablet is that in addition to having
a standard front-facing camera if sports
dual 5 megapixel rear facing cameras
which can record up to 1080p 3d video
the optimist tab is
powered by the same 1 gigahertz Tegra 2
processors from the zoom what you give
it plenty of grunt to go through 1080p
3d video it is scheduled to be on sale
during the first quarter of this year
for an undisclosed and likely a very
expensive price lastly we have the
samsung galaxy tab 10.1 the latest
galaxy tab sports a brand-new 10.1 inch
display keeping it a very similar size
and shape to the motorola xoom in fact
you can compare it directly to the zoom
in many categories as it features the
same 1 gigahertz dual-core Tegra 3
processor same 1280 x 800 resolution on
the 32 gigabytes of internal storage and
support for hspa+ on the other hand you
won't find a standard USB port or HDMI
on this nor will you see a slot for a
microSD card for expanding the memory
the galaxy tab does have some nice looks
going forward along with a 2-megapixel
front-facing camera and a
high-resolution 8 megapixel rear facing
camera with LED flash that's capable of
1080p video capture the key here I
believe will be the price as with the
smaller feature set it really does need
to undercut the zoom in the price
department so that wraps it up
personally I'm keeping an eye on the
zoom as it seems like right now it's
going to offer the best ratio of tablet
to cash especially once the Wi-Fi model
comes around to knock some of the price
off</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
