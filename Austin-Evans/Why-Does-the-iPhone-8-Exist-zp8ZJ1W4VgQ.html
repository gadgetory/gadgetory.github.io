and this bone would be called the iPhone
7s it has a new design with a glass back
upgraded cameras faster internals and
even a new feature in wireless charging
and yet all of this is under the shadow
of the upcoming iPhone 10 which really
does beg the question why does the
iPhone 8 exist of course plenty of
companies have a wide variety of phones
to choose from ranging from budget
options all the way to the incredibly
expensive and surprisingly Apple is
actually no exception this year you have
options ranging all the way from the
$350 iPhone se to the 4 and 50 l or
iPhone 6s the $550 iPhone 7 of course
you've got the $700 iPhone 8 as well as
all the way up in the top of the range
the $1000 iPhone 10 the issue is that
Samsung has already been shipping a
truly next-generation feeling piece of
hardware with the galaxy s 8 melia isn't
going to cost you about the same amount
as the iPhone 8 but it's been shipping
for the better part of a year already in
the vacuum the iPhone 8 is a nice design
however when you put it side-by-side
with the galaxy s 8 that iPhone really
doesn't look a lot less like a brand new
2017 flagship and a lot more like a 2014
iPhone 6
Apple has made some small improvements
to the iPhone 8 most notably including
their true tone tech so this is borrowed
from the iPad and it adjusts the white
balance of the display to better suit
the environment that you're in
it's a cool feature of course the iPhone
still has a solid IPS display when you
put it side-by-side with the galaxy s 8
it is absolutely no contest the AMOLED
display of the SI not only has far
better color brightness and especially
contrast but the infinity display means
that not only doesn't have curved edges
but essentially no bezel on top and
bottom of the phone either this is
pretty much the approach that Apple is
taking with the iPhone 10 and I would
actually argue that they're taking it
even farther
so yes you do have to deal with the
knotch but in exchange the rest of the
phone is pretty much entirely screen
there's essentially no puzzles in sight
the only issue is is that the iPhone 10
costs a whopping $300 more than both the
s8 as well as the iPhone 8 it's not all
bad though the iPhone 8 shares a lot of
specs with the 10 including very very
similar cameras so paired with better
processing and new sensors this is
actually a surprisingly big leap over
the previous generation of iPhones it
brings out a lot closer to stuff like
the galaxy s 8 as well as the pixel
especially when you consider just how
much detail you're able to get in a
single
ha you want to be in a video this is
like actually perfect this is the iPhone
8 this is the iPhone a right now what
are you guys names I'm Davey
nice to meet you I guess there's a
little occasion going on today or
something congratulations
cut take some pictures with this yeah
all right let's do it let's do it all
right ready and that looks really good
all right let me try some portrait mode
here that's pretty nice right it messed
up a little bit with the with the veil
but that's not that's pretty nice video
on the 8th is really impressive it's
second to only maybe the LGV 30 so the
stabilization works really well
especially when you're handheld and you
do have some new 4k shooting modes
including 4k 24 which I'm actually a big
fan of but you also can't shoot at a
pretty impressive 4k 60 frames per
second we're also getting upgraded 240
frames per second mode at a full 1080p
so the last iPhone could do 240 but it
was at 720p and honestly it was pretty
grainy with your iPhone 8 you're getting
surprisingly usable footage
especially when you slow it down by 10
times some of the results can actually
look surprisingly good you're also
getting the Apple a lovin Bionic chip
now I'll spare you all the technical
details but both the iPhone 8 as well as
the iPhone 10 which share the same spec
are very very fast put the iPhone 8
side-by-side with not only the 7 but
also the galaxy s 8 as well as the note
8 and you'll see the iPhone 8 is
hands-down these fastest phone out right
now and Geekbench it's a similar story
on the graphics side with GFX bench
although here it's less of a runaway
victory but the iPhone still does went
out
it's impressive enough that I slightly
lost my mind and compared it to the
PlayStation 4 and you guys can check
that video out if you want to see how
they stack up but suffice it to say the
iPhone is very very fast it's not
perfect though well the glass back
doesn't get as warm under extended
gaming like the iPhone 7 did when you
compared side by side with the galaxy s
8 as well as the node 8 you will see the
iPhone 8 does exhibit some thermal
throttling and actual use though the
iPhone 8 is incredibly snappy and that
should be shared with the iPhone 10 that
is a surprisingly common thread between
the eight and the 10 Meli do they both
support wireless charging but they also
have fast charging via a USB C lightning
cable which my friend Danny one jet test
and it actually stacks up fairly well
compared to a lot of other Android
flagships you're also getting the same
ip67 water resistance on both the 8 as
well as the 10 now I don't have a tenon
to test just yet but I can't say the
iPhone 8 speakers sound phenomenal it's
the same basic stereo designed from the
iPhone 7 it's much louder much richer it
really does put not only other Android
phones to shame but it's really the
first phone in years that's come close
to matching HTC's boomsound so yes the
iPhone 8 does give up the bezel as OLED
display from the 10 but in return the 10
gives up touch ID now face ID is
interesting and there's no doubt that
Apple is put a ton of really interesting
technology into it but it is the only
option short of using a passcode there
are tons of situations where I'd rather
pull my phone out and use touch ID on
the iPhone 8 versus hold the 10 in front
of my face and hope that it actually
unlocks in if it's a perfect setup I
would still prefer to have the option of
using touch ID at first glance the
iPhone 8 seems like a weird choice at a
20-17 world of super thin bezels but
look past the screen and everything else
is there to me the iPhone 10 is looking
like a classic first generation Apple
product it's a beautiful design and
there's a ton of potential but it's also
really expensive and if the supply
rumors are true it is going to be quite
a while before it's easy to actually get
your hands on one I can understand why
someone might want to pick up an iPhone
8 today it might not even be crazy to
skip the 10 altogether and wait for the
next generation which hopefully brings
the same design but with the lower price
and hopefully stuff like touch ID will
be re adding but what do you guys think
should the iPhone 8 exist of 2017 let me
know in the comments below and I will
catch you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
