comparison between two really unlikely
things so before we begin let me just
give you a little backstory earlier
today apple released iOS 4.3 for the
iphone ipod touch and ipad now this
latest update brings some various fixes
and tweaks and everything but probably
the most noble thing is that safaris
performance has been really dramatically
boosted most notably in the JavaScript
performance area so I thought hey you
know for a laugh why don't I compare it
with Internet Explorer 8 now IE 8 of
course is the latest version of the
Microsoft browser as an explorer 9 isn't
set to actually officially come out of
beta until the next month so this is a
fairly decent comparison so what I used
was of course my ipod touch 4th
generation quite about all the apps all
the multitasking everything I could to
ensure optimal performance now on the
other hand I have a Windows 7 laptop
with a 2.1 gigahertz dual-core processor
4 gigabytes of RAM running the latest
version of internet explorer 8 the first
test iran is the j s benchmark which is
a solid overall test of javascript speed
as you can see the ipod touch beat out
internet explorer 8 by a pretty
considerable margin the second test iran
was the SunSpider benchmark as you can
see here the ipod touch was able to
finish the entire roof slew of tests and
under the third of the time it took
internet explorer 8 to finish them now
be sure to take these results with a
grain of salt i only was able to
complete two tests and both of these
tests were 100 sent based on JavaScript
speed so as far as normal day-to-day web
browsing pretty much viewing any website
that's not 100 in JavaScript an explorer
was faster however I still thought that
this was pretty interesting to note how
far that the iphone and the ipod touch
have come</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
