sweet sweet
RTX graphics and desktops for a little
while now however today is the day that
it is finally time for all this power to
come down to the laptop side of things
to test we have the brand new rog
Zephyrus s 17-inch they actually took a
brief look at this laptop at CES however
at that time Nvidia had the performance
testing side of things locked down but
with this in our hands it's time to see
exactly what we can get out of our
checks for laptops here we've got the
top in our TX 2080 pair with a core i7
8750 H now the main cut back going from
the full desktop GPU to the laptop max2
Edition is in TDP instead of having over
200 watts to work with this has to fit
and they 100 watt budget which basically
just means that the clock speed comes
down desktop is about 1700 megahertz
this is a little bit over 1200 as far as
boost clocks go take a look at the
benchmarks though and it is not a
massive improvement but you will see a
pretty good performance bump over the
previous generation gtx 1080 and
especially that max-q implementation now
benchmarks are one thing what I want to
know is what will it take to get this
RTX 2080 running at a full 1080p at 144
frames per second which is what this
screen can do now starting off with
let's see what we can do with overwatch
well three seconds into overwatch it
looks like this is no problem
we're completely maxed out on ultra
settings at 1080p and right now we're
about a hundred and sixty frames per
second I gotta say overwatch looks like
a solid thumbs up on this front next up
we have everyone's favorite game
fortnight so this I think should be
pretty easy for the 2080 to handle even
on full epic settings I don't think
it'll be an issue for tonight is another
game that is no problem to run although
we're a little bit closer here at what a
hundred and I are oh no we're 2120 so
especially a pair with that g-sync panel
144 frames per second is no problem in
fortnight so now let's move on to black
ops so it comes to black ops I'm not
super sure that we're actually going to
be able to max it out fully and still
had 144 frames but uh it's gonna try I
guess I will mention that I am running
this on the balanced power mode so you
can crank the fan up to turbo but in my
testing it only gives you another couple
percentage or so of performance but it's
like twice as loud so I'm not gonna do
that okay yeah I immediately I can tell
that we're at a hundred frames per
second
which is good and to be fair we do have
a g-sync panel which means that's nice
and smooth but a ninety hundred frames
per second that's not what we're looking
for it's all I needed to do is crank
things down to high and we're pretty
much locked at 140 fps next let's see
how battlefield 5 fares we are in the
game this is not 144 frames this is
about 50 frames so the thing with
battlefield that's going to be difficult
is it does support rate racing there's
one of the very few games that does
support rate racing right now but it is
incredibly demanding especially on the
ultra setting ok so turning rate racing
down to low gave us a big boost in
frames we're now up to about 90 which on
this g-sync panel honestly really is not
a problem I would be totally happy to
play the game like this damn look look
at that look at the reflection every
time I see a car I have to go and like
oh I should probably do that so this is
a playable game absolutely but I want
144 frames per second which means it's
time to start cranking that thing down
now that's more like it
we're about a hundred and thirty one
hundred and forty frames per second
right now I did have to turn off ray
tracing and set everything down to
medium but I mean we do have a very very
playable 140 frames per second I mean to
be fair medium looks totally fine and
that 144 frames per second is a big deal
but if it's me I'm going to turn the ray
tracing on and give up a few frames per
second to get that extra a little bit of
visual know gaming is great but this
also is great for content creation so
Wes how does it handle resolve and
specifically red stuff so what we have
playing here is seven and a K red
footage playing down at quarter res but
as you can see with a color grade on
there and a few nodes doing kind of a
punch here grade it is playing back at
real time which is something that
resolve would struggle with on lower
inspect this makes a lot of sense as a
laptop to use for content creation then
right because you've got something
that's fairly thin you do have the
Pantone color calibrated display which
realistically well so-so look coming out
of the factory it'll be pretty good it's
going to shift over the first few hours
honestly abuse but by having a good
display that means that if you are
someone that wants to calibrate in the
future you can be fairly comfortable
that you are going to be able to get a
fairly good Cal
raishin out of it next let's talk about
this actual laptop itself these Zephyrus
s which there's actually a lot more to
talk about them purely just the graphic
side this shares a lot of DNA with the
original Zephyrus well it's closed it's
only 18 mm thick when you open it up the
entire deck lid raises to give more
cooling from the bottom there's also a
very unusual placement for the keyboard
and trackpad so it's all put on the
bottom half of the laptop which means
that this top half is entirely dedicated
to cooling that CPU and especially the
GPU now this doesn't take a little bit
of getting used to but it's really not
so bad now the same thing goes with a
touchpad well it's a little bit smaller
than usual most importantly it has a
solid surface and you do have the option
of turning it into a number pad and some
of the best sounding click buttons I've
ever tried on a trackpad all this means
that this is among these smallest
17-inch gaming laptops that you can buy
that being said though it is still a
17-inch gaming laptop sure it's a little
bit closer to something like that 15
inches efforts that came out last year
but realistically there's no getting
around that this is a very very big
footprint for a laptop I'll give them
this though it only six pounds it is way
lighter than you would expect
considering that there is that full
20/80 inside but don't exactly expect to
you know fit this in your backpack
easily the display itself is exactly
what you would expect out of a high-end
gaming laptop it's a 17.3 inch panel
with a 1080p resolution but importantly
9 does it run at a full 144 Hertz but it
also supports g-sync you also have
Nvidia Optimus onboard usually you have
to pick one or the other
g-sync is for keeping those frame rates
nice and smooth to keep any kind of
tearing out whereas optimus allows you
to turn off that graphics card when
you're not using it to save battery life
now in this you do have to manually turn
it on as well as restart the laptop when
you're switching between the two most of
the time when you have a laptop with
g-sync it means that you're gonna get
like an hour of battery life so
thankfully that's not the case here with
Optimus onboard paired with the decently
sized 76 watt hour battery I've been
able to get about three to
three-and-a-half hours of normal use
with the laptop and that's not gaming
mind you but this is actually a laptop
that you can do some other stuff with
not a lot of other stuff but some other
stuff you do have the added benefit of
supporting USB C charging now that's not
enough to fully power the laptop it tops
out at 65 watts so it's a lot more first
kind of charging to overnight or using
it for lighter tasks
but importantly this means that if you
want to take this on the go you don't
have to always carry the giant 200 watt
power brake instead you can take a
smaller one just plug into a USB C
monitor to top off all so what we're
talking about USB C it does have a pair
of USB seaports but neither support
Thunderbolt 3 something that the
previous zephyrus did not exactly like a
deal-breaker it's just kind of an odd
decision something interesting about
this notebook is the webcam it doesn't
have one that is where this comes in in
the box they do include an external
webcam there's a couple reasons for this
first of all they don't have a whole lot
of bezel to work with on the top but
more importantly this is a higher
quality webcam than usual
9 does it'll support 1080p but it also
has a full 60fps output and on top of
that they also have a little stand that
comes with it so if you want to do
something like twitch streaming you can
set the webcam off to the side you know
what this actually does look a lot
better than most webcams employee on a
laptop not sure if not going to be quite
as good as something like a dedicated
camera set up for twitch streaming
you're saying that this comes in the box
I've got to say really not a bad idea
all right not bad so the audio is pretty
impressive here now I do have a pair of
speakers that are firing directly at you
but on top of that there is this awesome
little wheel to control the volume it's
like what you would find on a lot of
mechanical keyboards and I love it look
seriously can everyone just adopt this
like I want this on every laptop ever no
way you might imagine all of this
doesn't exactly come cheap the Zephyrs s
starts at $2,700 and the model I have
here comes in at a full 30,000 $200.00
I don't know why I had to say 0 cents it
just sounds more impressive that way
with that artsy x28 Emacs Q inside you
will not find another gaming laptop
that's this thin as well as this light
while still giving you a full 17 inch
display and importantly this much
performance now whether it's worth the
price tag is kind of up to you but I've
got to say they did a lot right with the
Zephyrus s</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
