of star front collision for the iPhone
and iPod Touch so this is the latest
game from Gameloft it is an RTS and a
very very very similar to Starcraft uh
that's not necessarily a bad thing I'm a
big star crash fan I would love it if
Blizzard decided tomorrow that hey we're
gonna bring Starcraft to the iPhone
until then though I almost like will be
what most likely will be playing star
front it's a pretty good game not
perfect but let's go ahead just jump
right on into it so there's a couple of
things just like in StarCraft you can go
ahead and you guys will trust me you'll
be able I will be comparing it against
Starcraft a lot in this review because
that is pretty much what it is
but there is the action TV this is where
you can view your replays which is
definitely a nice feature I won't be
getting into that review down but
there's also multiplayer you can play
locally against another person who has
an iPhone or iPod Touch or of course you
can play online with a random person one
thing I do want to mention while I meant
while I'm thinking about it is this does
not support all iPhones and iPod touches
you're going to need the third
generation or newer devices for star
front to work so just a heads up there
and then we add single players so let's
just jump straight on in
there's campaign but for this I'm going
to show you guys a skirmish this is just
basically a 1v1 vs. CPU that's there are
a few different mats here let's take a
look um must pick rumble in the jungle
I'm just gonna pick rookie because I'm a
noob and then we're going to pick our
race now there are three races and
they're pretty much the same as in
Starcraft if you guys know that Aaron's
this is the consortium we have desert
which is the mere yet and we had the
Protoss which is the wardens I'm a zerg
player so I'm gonna be playing as a
myriad not like redcoat looks cool um so
we're gonna play against let's play
against the wardens and they look cool
in blue so we'll go ahead and do this
okay so to begin with let me just get
this going really quickly here just get
them over here the way this will work is
go ahead and select this guy I will
create some gas plate right here but the
way this works is just like in StarCraft
do you have three major resources you
have
you have money which is basically
minerals which you get from this you
have to build buildings on top of the
minerals and the resources but it's not
a huge deal
you also have energy which is basically
like gas and you have supply which is
you know supply it's just how many
unions you can have so we'll send this
over here and create more grubs the
grubs are your drones for the most part
we'll set a riot point over inside the
building so yeah it's very similar in
fact you can see that little worm
looking thing is our drone or our grub
and that's pretty much our workhorse
it's gonna allow you to go ahead and get
units it's gonna allow you to get
buildings all of that kind of stuff so
actually now that the beginning of
there's not a whole lot you can do I'll
go ahead just give you guys a quick
little overview of the UI so as you can
see up at the top right you do have a
mini-map yeah so you can scroll around
take a look at the various different
bases all the way around the map you
know it works decently I would prefer if
there was actually uh well if it was a
little bit bigger because obviously your
finger pretty much covers the whole
thing but it is functional it works
pretty decently you also do have a list
of things so for example this is our
main building we can go in here create
grubs or different buildings allow you
to build different things and should
let's create a lower nominally quickly
here this is low or not is what you use
to create units this is for the most
part you're spawning pool from Starcraft
so letting you making grubs just because
you that's basically your lifeblood if
you're not creating grubs you're you're
gonna need more of them just to make
buildings and etc etc anyway so that's
about it for the basics you build
various different buildings which allows
you to get units something you can
upgrade the units all that kind of stuff
I want to get too technical into it but
suffice it to say if you've ever played
Starcraft this is going to feel right at
home so here's our first building and we
can build two units we can build the
Mangler which is pretty much a zergling
we can build a venom slinger which is
pretty similar to a hydra list so let's
build one of each set a rally point
right over here our workers are idle so
let's and we'll just leave it alone
right now but of course you need to
build more
was called a mega mite and bloat to get
more energy and more gas for your more
energy and more crystals for your army
so anyway guys I'll go ahead and cut
here I'm gonna skip ahead and show you
guys a little bit of the there we gots
perfect actually
there's a scouting little probe or
worker in our base but just perfect time
we've got our units out to stop it
okay so I've built up a bit of an army
here just pretty much basically load to
your units but for this match that's not
gonna be an issue
so as you can see here it's kind of
attacking the base on this easy
difficulty it's pretty simple just sit
back and build a base and you know just
win it's it's not that difficult you can
see here I've got my units streaming in
from all sides and my opponent should be
right about here so I'm going to show
you guys really quickly here just how
the combat goes it's pretty impossible
to micro or you're not familiar with it
well that's actually get battle there
you can see here there's battles going
on all the place I'm with my fourth
generation ipod touch there's no issues
whatsoever with with frame rate or
anything like that well actually that
was not a great idea I should have
thought it through a little bit more um
but well if we lose we lose um so yeah
we've we're pushing through pretty well
here
but yeah it's impossible Micro or if you
guys aren't familiar with the term to
basically do your units individually
it's really really difficult to to deal
with that but yeah we're gonna be close
here I'm not sure yeah we might have it
here yeah so I know guys that's it for
star front really fun RTS it's not as
good obviously a Starcraft but it on a
mobile device on iPhone iPod Touch I
love have no issues with it it's a lot
of fun to play definitely very cool to
just be able to pull out of your pocket
and start playing a little bit on you
know on your way doing whatever so
anyway guys that's it enough rambling
check it out it is free in the App Store
it's basically the first mission you get
to play if you want to play any more
than that you will have to go ahead and
in app purchase purchase the entire
thing which is currently $7 anyway guys
