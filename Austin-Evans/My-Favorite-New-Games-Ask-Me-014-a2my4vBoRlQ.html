you were Linus
so Linus and I actually arm wrestled
once and well I don't want to spoil the
result but uh this guy hey guys it's
Austin and today I'm here with ask me
where I go over all kinds of questions
straight from you guys what upcoming
games have you got your eyes on if any I
can't wait to get my hands on wash dogs
so I was able to take a look at it III
last year however I wasn't actually able
to play it so hopefully once it comes
out here in the next couple months it'll
be awesome as well as destiny that's
another one of these big games that I've
been looking forward to for quite a
while is it time to buy a 4k display or
not oh okay it's definitely come down in
price so there's a new 28 inch Samsung
4k monitor that's only $700 which is
still expensive for a monitor when you
consider this stuff was like three or
four thousand dollars just last year
it's come down quite a bit so I would
still probably recommend holding out
maybe just a little while longer as
prices are gonna continue going down
just a bit more I think
but yeah 4k is really getting affordable
well affordable it's getting there
would you wear Superman printed
underwear yeah what do you think about
the oneplus one I know a lot of people
are really excited however my biggest
problem with the oneplus one is that the
Nexus 5 of the thing not sure when you
compare them the Nexus 5 is $50 more
expensive and it loses out on a couple
of the specs
however the oneplus one is running
CyanogenMod which is fine it's pretty
much stock Android however the Nexus 5
is running stock Android and on top of
that it's going to be getting the direct
updates from Google pretty much as soon
as it's done so we have there definitely
advantages of the oneplus one
I think the Nexus line is more
specifically than xs5 getting those
awesome updates immediately is more than
enough to make me pay the extra $50
think about all the people who have seen
a video of yours subscribers or not how
do you think you have impacted society
as a whole I think the scariest that
I've seen is when I go to my YouTube
analytics and see that people spent 221
years watching my videos whoa how do you
feel about lower end GPUs cards between
49 and $100 I actually did a video
comparing a bunch of budget graphics
cards not that long ago
so you guys can check that out on my
channel but that just if it is I really
don't recommend graphics cards that are
less than a hundred dollars so when that
weird like 50 to 100 dollar price
bracket every ten to twenty dollars
you're spending you're almost getting a
doubling of performance so if you say
spend twenty or thirty dollars more you
can get a much much better card are you
ever going to visit India it always
surprises me just how many of you guys
from India watch my channel so India is
actually the fifth most watched country
and my channel analytics and so I don't
know I don't have any plans that over
there but maybe I need to I know this is
more of a guess but should I purchase
the galaxy s5 or wait for the expected
release of the new note in September I
would go for it so there's always new
tech coming out there's always going to
be that next thing that's gonna be out
in a few months or a year or whatever
now there are a couple exceptions like
if you know that something's gonna be
coming out and say a month or two yeah
it probably makes sense to wait but for
the most part it's really easy to be
stuck in a game or if you're always
waiting for the next thing and the next
thing the next thing so yeah if you want
the Galaxy s5 absolutely go for it is it
worth overclocking the APU on my laptop
for better gaming performance should I
do it with MSI Afterburner so I recently
did a tutorial showing you how to
overclock a graphics card and while yes
technically you can overclock your
laptop I really don't recommend it
laptops are very restrained as far as
the power and the heat that they can
actually put off so they're usually
pretty well optimized to be running as
fast as possible without like turning
your laptop into a nuclear reactor so
yes technically you can't overclock it
but I wouldn't recommend it what music
do you listen to favorite artists so if
I jump into my Spotify you guys can see
some of this stuff I've been listening
to so plenty of Daft Punk we've got some
deadmau5 a little bit of mmm The Glitch
Mob is fantastic I've been really really
listening these guys lately same thing
goes for justice and I've also been
listening to the new Skrillex when did
you decide to change your type of genre
of videos so that you could get more
viewers one thing I've never done is put
my channel on a box so when I started
actually five years ago this week I was
doing iPod Touch app reviews and
jailbreaking stuff
and while it was flat at the time it was
working but you know my tastes changed
friends were changing so I decided to
change it up and I've done actually
several kind of focuses of the channel
over the last few years so these days I
do a lot of gaming con
but I also do just general tech stuff so
this channel is always going to be about
whatever is interesting to me so if I
say hey look this is an awesome new
modular phone I do a video on it and I
hope that you guys enjoy so yeah
absolutely I mean it's not like a this
is a gaming PC channel or this is a
phone channel or anything like that this
is a tech channel for cool tech period
if you had to choose your favorite video
that you have uploaded what would it be
I'd probably have to say the future of
gaming video I did last year so AMD is
having a developer event out in San Jose
so I went and spent a couple days doing
interviews recording panels trying to
create almost like a mini documentary of
what exactly is the future of gaming so
it didn't turn out perfect so I know a
lot of things I wish I could tweak now
like I was completely by myself so I
pretty much just had a camera a tripod
and have lights my microphone broke
halfway through but overall I'm really
happy with how it turned out and if you
guys want check it out it's on my
channel I'll have it linked in the
description but definitely wanna do more
of those kind of mini documentary kind
of style videos there's just a lot of
fun to make if you guys want to ask me
any more questions feel free to hit me
up on Twitter Facebook and Google+ and
of course all those links will be in the
description of this video anyway guys
thank you so much for watching and I
will catch you in the next one
and the fact that it's going to be
getting straight updates from Android
what am I seeing
and but importantly though it actually
has fools
however it's going to be getting good
dirt Bubba the biggest problem is that
Nexus 5 gets full of complete updates of
stripe stock google straight stock
Google I want that straight stock Google
yo however for that $50 we get
guaranteed updates of completely stock
completely awesome straight-up Android
goodness I'm running out of words to use
for oneplus one it looks interesting
that the Nexus 5 is definitely the way
that I would go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
