edition of d3 live so instead of during
the normal format we're gonna do
something a little different today we're
gonna be playing some minecraft 1.8 so
of course this was leaked yesterday and
it's kind of a long story but it's late
it's out there you guys can definitely
download it if you want and I can give
you guys a quick tour around what all is
new so the first thing you guys can see
here is the new intro login screen it's
very nice it's not just brown bricks and
stuff anymore looks pretty cool I will
go over some of the options really quick
because there are some new things in
here you can do you know the normal kind
of stuff and in fact I'll I'm gonna turn
to Pete now we've got hard kickers you
can do some field of view things some
lighting not kind of stuff I'll show you
guys what that looks like there are is
also a new multiplayer so instead of
just having to always punch in the
servers and all that kind of stuff which
is kind of annoying you can just go
ahead and you know add servers and
always have them in a list absolutely
awesome for gonna be playing multiplayer
but since that's not working at her
person right now which can play some
single-player so you can go through your
worlds here but there are two modes so
of course before you could play survival
mode your very simple but now there's a
new mode called creative which is very
similar to the old minecraft classic
where you know you're not to worry about
health you can just you know dig and
destroy icon stuff so we're gonna go
ahead and create a creative world mode
I'll show you guys some of the new
features it's pretty cool so go ahead
and a lot of load here and here we go
alright so what the way this works as
you guys can see here is it actually
allows you to go ahead and you know
really build all kinds of stuff so you
see here this I'm just immediately fill
whatever I want but if I double tap
it'll tap the spacebar I can fly it
works really nicely I mean it's not
laggy or anything at all and you're able
to go ahead and get into the game and
fly the controls are like I said you
double tap to jump and you can start
flying and if you hold the shift key
I'll let you go down so I can go down I
can go up and you just use the normal
WASD keys so Justin see this is have an
overview of some of the new biomes in
Minecraft 1.8 it's really it's really
pretty nice so factos let's go ahead and
take a look over here especially the
oceans been redone I'll I'll actually
hop into the ocean here in a minute but
this looks like just kind of a standard
biome so we'll just go ahead and head
over here and jump down here so you can
see here it looks really quite nice and
in fact let's go ahead and give you guys
a quick tour of the how the lighting
works so let's drop a torch here as you
can see here the lighting has been added
they've done some tweaks there and it
looks pretty nice I'm actually while I'm
here you can see here in creative mode
you also have the option to no select
your bricks so say you know just you
know just you know using hacks or
whatever you can go ahead and pick
anything you want so if I want to block
a gold I can do that oops
I can also there are also some new
bricks which I'm gonna go over
everything but I'll go down here to the
bottom so for example we have now
watermelon and that's cool
and you have raw chicken and you know a
couple things of course all the old
items are still there and also something
else I want to show you guys if I can
find where it is is that are now new
glass as well as yeah here we go so we
have glass panes so let me they build
something real quick with glass so us
let's come over here
I really do have to say that flying is
it really is really nicely implemented
so let's go ahead and we actually build
out grat brass build out some glass here
and it works very similarly to how here
so it works very similarly to how like
fences and stuff works so there we go so
you can see here it's very thin for
pretty well now while we're here let's
go ahead to show you some of the animal
things so we can punch them and if we
there's kind of a new combat knife
actually let's let's head of this let's
go ahead and go into the adventure mode
where I can show you that so we can
create a new world we're gonna go ahead
and do survival and I'll show you guys
some of the new things of course they're
so vile mode is not harm percent done
there will be some NPCs and some other
things that they will add a little bit
later but this is what we have for now
so as you guys can see here on the
bottom of the screen you'll find that
there are some new things so as of
course you still have your health bars
it's very similar but you also have
experience which is that thing right
below that you know step on the right of
that is your foods you of course need to
eat so let's go ahead and just get
started here so one of the new things is
the animals now run away from you so if
I jump punch it you'll see here instead
of just sitting around like being stupid
actually starts running away
there's also a new combat so you can of
course you do damage just by punching
but if you jump and punch on the way
down and I found well you guys can see
that but you get assault like a critical
hit
little X's or F come out so let's jump
see if you can do this you do this right
it's kind of a little hard to get used
to
I'm the timing I don't know if they're
gonna change that or whatever but I
guess maybe I just really bad
well hey didn't work but yeah you can
you guys mice on there and there we go
so if you saw the old green or been is
kind of like the experience that you get
now of course since I just started the
game and I actually really have anything
the days are a lot longer so takes a
little while but I'm not only gonna get
a lot of experience but of course
fighting mobs and that kind of stuff
will definitely get it very quick so
sweating there you go you guys install
that right there get it one more time
I'm get him on the way down I believe
it's like double damage so that's about
it for like the very simple things I do
want to go ahead and find some water and
show you guys some of that I'm just
gonna hop up here I should watch where I
was but I'm a lot of this the core of
the game is of course gonna be the same
first I think the game looks a little
bit better I'm not really sure if it's
you know the lighting or you know
performance or whatever but it does a
little bit better a little bit different
of course you know just like all
survival mode you know you have to go
cut down trees when he's first started
by for the sake of not making this an
hour-long video I'm gonna go ahead and
skip that so let's find our way out here
and see what if we can find some water
there's one really cool thing about the
water and that it is much deeper and
it's much more expensive I guess yeah
here we go so so we can get down here
without killing ourselves just always
danger so we got some pork here so not
too bad but Justin see here the well
just the biomes themselves are very nice
like sample there here's a little Inlet
and if we want to go swim we can swim
through here really easily you got a pig
if I go underwater and I'll show so sure
how is it but it's a little bit
different guessin see here there are
bubbles and it's pretty nice one thing I
did notice though is if you get for
example you see here there's the Sun if
you go underwater that the clouds
disappear which it's not a big deal but
uh there's something I didn't notice but
I'm hopeful you guys can tell here the
the water is now extremely deep which is
I know it's kind of cool and if I come
up back to around I'll go ahead and show
you guys some of the new options
available in my
one-point-eight I do want to mention
that this is the privilege pre-release
version so they may add some more things
between now and then but it's pretty
much the main thing so you also have
filled abusive cousin see here I stretch
it all the way out so for example if I
want to be running around and seeing
everything like through a fisheye lens
almost you can definitely do that which
I actually kind of like something in the
middle but I'll just leave it normal and
there also is the brightness you can
change the brightness it's not so much a
big deal during daytime because it
seemed maybe a little the details better
of where it really does help is it
nighttime you know when it's kinda hard
to see or you know if you're filming
like I know not just talking about life
from it you know filming mission isn't
that kind of stuff it makes it a little
bit easier to see anyway guys it's gonna
be about it there are some other things
but of course wanted to keep this video
fairly brief but anyway guys it's gonna
be a special edition of d3 live you guys
a quick hands on of Minecraft 1.8 guys
interested you can go ahead and check it
out launch has already said that it's
totally cool to you know download
they've even got on their service if you
guys want to try this out for yourself
definitely hit link in the description
of the video all you need to do is you
take the jar that you download and
replace it with the current
minecraft.jar and your bin folder so
very simple and yeah go ahead and try it
out but anyway guys I will get you next
