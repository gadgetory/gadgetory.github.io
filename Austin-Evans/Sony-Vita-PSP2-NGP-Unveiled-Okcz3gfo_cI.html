of the Sony Playstation update so they
just got finished announcing it and they
pretty much just blonde the door wide
open on the brand new PSP too so there
are a lot of things on what I can try to
go over them as quickly as i can because
the new PSP is going to be absolute
phenomenal i love it as the first thing
is is the name now they didn't actually
announce the name it's technically
technically it's called the NGP but
that's just the code name I'm expecting
will probably called the PSP two or
something like that but again there is
no official name now as far as a
hardware goes it is really quite
impressive now some of the specs
including does have a 5-inch display and
it's going to be a 5-inch touchscreen an
0 l 0 LED display and now the resolution
is going to be 960 x 540 for which is
really really quite impressive it also
doesn't have a quad-core arm or takes a
9 processor which is really really
amazing in a mobile device dual analog
sticks 3g Wi-Fi gps along with a
rear-mounted touchpad and the same
accelerometer and gyroscope as on the
current PlayStation Move now this
feckless blue just reads it's just it's
just really amazing I mean quad-core
processor but one of the really cool
things i like is that screen a 5-inch
display is really really quite large if
you guys have ever seen perhaps the dell
streak you'll know that it's a really
pretty substantial-size and a good bit
bigger than the current PSP but of
course it is going to be an o LED
display so really really should be a
super high quality display and of course
that is going to be a touch screen I
don't want the cool things about it is
it's actually the rear of the PSP or
whatever they decide call I'll just be
calling of a PSP too I was actually a
full touch screen as well we're not a
touchscreen but a touch pad so the
entire back of it is touch sensitive so
really as far as control goes you're
absolutely going to be have everything
covered you can tilt it and use the
gyroscope to the motion control you have
your buttons you have dual analog sticks
you have touchscreen you have pretty
much anything you could hope for you
definitely will have it in this handheld
now some of the things to shoot some of
the games off lot of them look really
cool far as the batteries go I would
definitely say it is very close to ps3
in fact a lot of the games they show
we're just ports of ps3 games
brought over now it's not that me quite
as good you know it's going to take a
little bit of tweaking everything but I
would absolutely you know say it's going
to be very close to ps3 graphics pretty
similar to how the PSP was similar to
the ps2 now some of the other things are
that they didn't announce the price or
anything like that however it should be
available this holiday season so
sometime by the end of the year I would
guess October's when we will be seeing
the next PSP iso know you guys that's
about it for the wrap-up do stay tuned i
have a lot more content about the next
PSP so so go ahead subscribe to the
channel if you haven't already and I
will keep your entirely up to date so
before I go I do want to ask one
question what are your thoughts on this
device personally I'm absolutely loving
it you know is look it just looks so so
good you have agreed yes I still like
that but the PSP to seems to be a whole
other League so definitely let me know
your thoughts and comments in the
comment section below anyway guys thanks
