finished up there are a few minor
surprises such as the appearance of
steep jobs then general everything went
according to the rumors with one major
exception the main rumor for the iPod
Touch was certainly the addition of a
camera and did the surprise of many
including myself that was actually none
during the past couple days there have
been a couple rumors saying this this
still came as quite a surprise they
didn't linger too long on it but it
seems like it's a very minor refresh the
difference is in the new iPod Touch or
that now comes an 8 gigabyte 32 gigabyte
and 64 gigabyte for one and two hundred
ninety nine and $399 respectively this
is similar although less than the
rumours have stated being that there
would be no weight Kika by model just a
16 gigabyte for $199 the new iPod Touch
also carries the same faster processor
and presumably the rest of the upgrade
internals and the iPhone 3GS the new
iPod touch fit is available immediately
while the extra storage and upgraded
internals are nice definitely let down
here next toe is a good surprise iPod
Nano as expected it did get a camera in
microphone this is capable of shooting
640 by 480 video there is roughly 16
video effects you can put on the video
in real time but there's no zooming or
editing along with the camera and
microphone is an FM radio which should
come quite in handy
besides these features a pedometer and a
voice recorder are also available
the prices are 149 for an 8 gigabyte
model 179 for 16 gigabyte model and it
is also available today I met the
pleasant surprise was that the iPod
Classic is getting the boot contrary to
what a lot of people thought nothing
really has been changed on it except
that it solely comes with 160 gigabytes
of storage the same price of $249 lastly
as far as iPods go there's the iPod
shuffle nothing much was changed except
the addition of a few colors and a price
reduction to $59 for the 2 gigabyte
model $79 of the 4 gigabyte model
there's also a new special edition which
is made out of polished stainless steel
and it looks very nice iTunes 9 was
released today as well it is already
available for download
it features Windows 7 integration the
support for the new iTunes LP format a
somewhat streamlined user interface and
a redesigned iTunes store it also allows
for sharing music and ass between
computers and devices as well as
allowing you to organize your apps night
tunes and on your iPhone and iPod touch
from iTunes itself also available for
download today is iPhone OS 3.1 it
brings some new features but definitely
steer clear of it if your jailbroken
same goes for iTunes 9 while they may be
nice test them out if you have another
computer or something but don't do it on
your primary computer because they have
not been tested and you don't know what
it will do to jailbreak so that was it
guys to be honest the lack of a camera
for the iPod Touch was a big
disappointment but the fact they are
keeping the iPod Classic as well as
revamping iTunes giving that nanos to
abstain show up grades slightly make up
for it all-in-all a decent if a bit
disappointing keynote</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
