VR headsets launching this year which
one should you go for to kick things off
let's take a look at one of the biggest
products at the show the oculus rift
only a couple weeks away from release I
got to try a couple games on Kronos by
gunfire games and the climb by Crytek
especially when you compare how far
things have come since the original dev
kit oculus is impressive it's now using
a pair of OLED displays for your eyes
with the positional sensor to track your
movement in 3d space the experience is
good playing the climb at a solid 90
frames per second feels great and while
you can absolutely see pixels it's an
immersive enough experience for you to
look past the tec Chronos was an
interesting example of a third-person
RPG that gives you a lot of incentive to
look around to spot enemies before they
drop down on you for $600 headset though
the oculus doesn't feel too premium it's
adjusted with velcro straps and while it
works if you wear glasses like me it's
not the easiest to get on and off the
Xbox one controller that's included with
the rift works fine for most games but
when the touch controller ship to give
you full hand control in the game that
should help a lot and that's exactly
what you'll find with the HTC 5 there's
no getting around it
the 5 is the best VR experience I've
ever tried technically it's very similar
to oculus the displays are good but not
perfect and the headset is comfortable
but lacking a little polish but what
really separates it is the full room
tracking with the help of a pair of
lighthouse sensors and a decent sized
room the vibe lets you walk around and
really immerse yourself in the VR world
this is helped by the controllers which
give you basically perfect dragon and
Virtual Reality I could easily reach
down and pick them up purely based on
what I was seeing in the headset the
tracking is uncanny I kept touching the
controllers in real life just to see how
accurate my view and the game world was
and well I look like a crazy person but
you know I got to try a pair of demos
Everest VR and Star Wars trials of
Tatooine thanks to the beastly dual
Titan regen video was using to run demos
this was a clear step up graphically
over some of the other games I tried and
being able to use the controllers paired
with walking through the room is a
massive advantage and immersing yourself
in VR we couldn't record the actual
gameplay but when you get too close to
the real-life wall a transparent grid
shows up in the game world to keep you
from running into things it works pretty
well my favorite demo with Star Wars
I will spoil it too much but you get to
fix the Millennium Falcon and use a
lightsaber to fend off a wave of
stormtroopers the thing that really blew
me away was the detail I kept putting my
face right up against things just to
appreciate how incredible everything
looked as amazing as the vive is
though the need to have a dedicated
space makes it really impractical
compared to the others that doesn't keep
it from being absolutely badass I also
got the chance to spend some time with
PlayStation VR the first thing that
jumps out of me is that this seems like
the most polished headset yet where
oculus and vive feel vaguely like
prototypes psvr feels ready for the big
time unlike the others that run off an
expensive gaming PC PlayStation VR is
powered by ps4 the basic ingredients are
similar a fast refreshing oled display
and lights on the headset that are
tracked by the playstation camera for
positional tracking but everything is
just a notch less intense the screen is
lower res and the games aren't quite as
graphically polished as on oculus and
vibe which should be no surprise the ps4
and PS VR are combined cost less than
the gaming PC you need to run the others
not even counting the price of the
headsets I say the experience is 80% as
good - it feels very similar to rift as
it's meant to be played seated and while
the lower resolution means you're losing
some much-needed detail this is by far
the most practical VR setup for most
people
each headset is solid and they each have
a unique selling point the oculus is
right there with the vive as far as
quality goes while being far easier to
set up with HTC vive you're getting the
closest thing to a holodeck I've ever
tried but it's expensive and impractical
PlayStation VR might be the best middle
ground it's far cheaper while delivering
a solid experience without needing an
entire room to enjoy so which VR headset
