doing something pretty cool a lot of
should help a lot basically I'm going to
show you guys how to hook up an external
monitor to your laptops you have a dual
screen setup for now I'm using this just
old CRT monitor but that's really matter
it can be flat screen or it could be one
of these old ones all it matters that
you can get the correct setup another
cool thing is it this lot of time does
and you need to cost any money it
depends if you I mean if you have an old
monitor most of you guys will I have an
old monitor I mean it can be from your
desktop or whatever but basically all
you need is an old monitor and usually
not a little time it's usually your set
so man let's go I can get started
okay
so it's really really simple I'm going
to show you guys how to do it hardware
wise I'm going to show you guys how to
do it
software wise setting up on the computer
for this example I'm using my gateway
laptop I'm going to be using this old
eMachines mod now it doesn't matter like
I said you can do a lot of different
ways on one general rule of thumb is
just take a look at the connection that
you unplug from your desktop this is a
VGA in my case which is probably going
to be the most common there are also a
couple others though like HDMI and
DisplayPort there's a couple different
ones one general rule of thumb because I
can't show you guys everything is it
take a look at the connection so take a
good look at it and go look at your
computer if it looks like it matches
plug it in and see what happens I mean
it kind of sounds kind of stupid but you
know I mean there's no harm in trying it
I mean don't be afraid now something's
going to explode so I'm using VGA which
is like I said probably the most common
so if you take a look this is a VGA the
tells VGA it's going to be blue and I'll
show you it's going to be blue on the
computer - then you're going to say it's
going to be taller on top compared to on
bottom and it's going to have quite a
few pins inside okay so this just was
plucked this is just take this and you
just plug this plugs right into the back
this was normally just plugged into the
back of the desktop but you can plug
into to your laptop
so now you need to just take a look on
your computer down and from in my case
we have VGA which is right there so you
see there it's blue and it has the
connectors so it's really simple so all
you got to do and make sure that it's
plugged in obviously then take the VGA
just around
do you guys make sure because it is like
I said TomTom so I could take a minute
but like to see it right just plug it in
now they've scrambled the black and now
in a minute once this one's up like is
that it's an old mug it will go ahead
and show you guys there we go and you
can see here there's my wallpaper here
and here so now that's it that's the
hardware connection is done your
computer will be able to automatically
handle a lot of the general stuff and as
you can see here I'm moving my mouse is
over here on the right and that's here
over here on the left so I've got it set
up but now you should go ahead and show
you guys how to get it set up physically
on the computer okay so now this is my
main screen now it's going to be very
simple to hook it up now all you have to
do is just this is on Vista but it works
pretty much the same on any kind of
Windows it's basically just right-click
and on your desktop and come down to
personalize okay now you can see all the
things go down to the very bottom you'll
see display settings go and hit that
okay so now you take a look at this now
automatically it will have it set up but
it might not quite be right so sometimes
like usually it will be mirrored now
when I say mirrored basically it's this
desktop and it's identical so it's
basically mirrored on the other monitor
sometimes that might be helpful for
let's say you're doing a presentation
and you have you know your laptop and
you have your other monitor turn to face
the face people but usually you're going
to want it to basically be a second
screen so you know you can come across
and drag Windows in between etc
basically just give you more screen
space so basically you'll see that the
number one display the primary is going
to be your laptop screen did you click
the second one that's going to come to
the second now you want to make sure
that extend the desktop on to this
monitor make sure that's checked okay so
once that's checked you could take a
look at the resolution um most of the
time it will automatically recognize and
set the resolution
so in my monitors case it's 1024 by 768
if it looks odd you go ahead and drag it
up and down and customize it and if you
want you can go ahead try that if it
looks a little odd but besides that
that's just about it
go ahead once you finish doing all
everything go ahead and hit apply then
go ahead and Excel and then now let me
show you guys a little bit about what
the benefits of having a second monitor
is okay so once you have your second
monitor set up we have the proper
settings and do know that that line is
just because it's no monitors not is it
yes you can't see that but anyway so now
you got to go ahead and set some stuff
up so let me just show you a couple of
things so if you see up on the top right
you see that I have my CPU monitor and I
have a little launcher so it's real
simple save space let's go ahead and
move it over here so let's go ahead and
you know put on the top right again
let's go grab my launcher and you see
here show you guys had right across if I
can grab it and just drag it right
across and just kind of get most out of
there so that's one thing so you can
have like widgets and stuff but another
thing is like let's say you know you
want listen to music and you want to you
know surf the web to fly that so let's
go ahead I've got a couple windows up
already so have iTunes so let's say I'm
listening to iTunes but I don't I don't
want to do that because I'm doing
something important on the other so just
going to kind of take it down and just
drag across then we can go ahead and
maximize it right so we can be looking
at music and you know watching a movie
water on this screen and come over here
and then I open up like a web browser so
let's say I'm you know reading you know
just reading some random post or
whatever and now I look over on the
right now I actually want to switch
songs I mean there's all kinds I mean
you're not limited whatsoever it's
pretty much anything that you want take
it from this put it on this and as you
saw it's very simple to drag it this is
especially useful when let's say you're
researching and you're doing a report or
you're typing something so let's say you
know on this one
you could have like you know Wikipedia
up reading about something and over here
you can be typing and especially with
Windows 7 because the windows will you
can touch the windows and make them like
half sized and stuff which is really
quite handy anyway guys that was just a
pretty simple deal on how to set up a
second monitor for your laptop you know
you'd be surprised there's a lot of like
older style monitors like this that you
know just sitting around you know they
might be collecting dust in your closet
or maybe still hooked up to your desktop
just unplug them take a look if you have
one I mean it's really simple plug it
into your laptop and you're good to go
anyway thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
