mystery Tech something from the telly
awards yo ok ok ok this whoa
the tele war 2018 is the iPhone 10 worth
it
4k HDR what did you do I sent an email
and I said hey we made a thing and then
they're basically like good job so we
won an actual award for the iPhone 10
video yeah we got we got a Bronze Award
which means we did pretty ok so for
those of you guys who did not watch the
iPhone 10 is it worth it that is a giant
production we did last year when the
iPhone came out where we rented an
Airbnb we shot the entire thing on
amazing glass it's all mastered in HDR
wesen can put a lot of work into making
that look nice and now there's a super
shiny award to show it off the we foam
power fire whoa thirteen thousand
milliamp hour battery 13,000
what wait what's this movie did gz2 oh
we got a double cheap smartphones well I
guess I do think that is OK for
reference this is an iPhone and this is
the power 5 it actually I'm not gonna
lie how it doesn't look terrible there's
gonna be the heaviest phone I've ever
tried I'm you got a USB C port although
no headphone jack on a phone that's this
thick okay I mean we've got a 21
megapixel sensor and honestly it's
actually not that bad it's a touch soft
but I mean that's not bad at all okay
torn with this one because on one hand
you're getting a phone's is legitimately
different it's so heavy it's so thick
it's got such a giant battery but on the
other does anyone want a phone that's
this big on the other end of the
spectrum we have the you me digi Z - yo
whoa okay well that's definitely a look
on the back hold on a second
Wow that's that's actually super cool
enough you can see that on camera but it
totally changes color based on how you
sort of adjust it I can't even imagine
two phones being more different this is
super small sleek it's got that cool
color changing back this is like the
giant brick that you used to ask people
for money threatened people for money
you threaten people from any ministry so
wait they're both about $200
all men okay you know what executive
decision I'm gonna spend some time with
these stay tuned next item please
letters oh wow these are actual I don't
wanna show them because they have
people's addresses on them but these are
actual real letters oh this one's from
Hong Kong building the ultimate Xbox one
X whoa a letter straight from Hong Kong
giving me instructions on my next video
all right I like this there's no name
who's Eating it's just an Amazon parts
list for all the things they need to
build the ultimate Xbox one X you
actually should legitimately see if we
can do the Xbox one X based on this
digital projector the apeman hmm not
sure I like that name sorry your
projector goes it's hard to imagine
something being that much smaller than
this oh yeah so it looks like it's going
to be fully portable at least based on
first glance it does look kind of bright
I mean that's uh that's not bad although
if we move it out here maybe not quite
so much let's not project on my hand
let's put a little bit I mean for a
video it's not too bad as I watch a
slack add alright you're gonna want to
use this in a very dim environment and
probably the small of the screen the
better but especially cancer yeah it's
going to be fully portable it's not that
bad it's just kind of well small as you
expect all right this looks very
suspicious the growls buster
the drums buster what draws Buster is a
gadget that can easily be attached to
your earlobes
and provide a comfortable massaging
effect through a combination of
traditional Chinese medicine and modern
smart technology to eliminate your
drowsiness and prevent you from falling
asleep wait wait wait wait wait wait
it attaches to your earlobes and keeps
you from falling asleep I feel like this
is gonna be in the thumbnail my friends
so we just pull it out like this oh wow
that's it this is what attaches to your
ear this is me shot me wait wait has a
squirt hold on hold on hold on I'm
reading some more instructions I've been
burned by this one through many times
whoa whoa it's like a little like
electrical like shocks to my ear oh it's
like it feels almost like a vibration
but it's like shocking me I can tell cuz
like the hair I'm like the tough my ear
is standing up cool it's it's not like
okay actually hurts a little bit man
why does everything always have to be
shocking me I mean you're not gonna fall
asleep with that in your ear you were
Jeff not gonna fall asleep kind of try
