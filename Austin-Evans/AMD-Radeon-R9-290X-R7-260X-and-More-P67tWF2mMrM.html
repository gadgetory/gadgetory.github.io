back from the AMD GPU 14 tech day which
was an awesome event and while I was
there I was able to get a lot of
information on their entirely new series
of graphics cards so let's take a look
to see what all was new and what might
be best for you to start with AMD has
changed the branding of all of their
graphics cards so as opposed to having
the Radeon HD 7000 series or the 8000
series instead they have now split up
into two different lines so the r7
series is more of the mainstream kind of
budget cards so you can kind of consider
this to be the Radeon 7700 series and
below this is going to be the more
cheaper more budget oriented cards
whereas the r9 series is going to be
more of the high-end stuff so you can
think like the Radeon 7800 and the 7 900
series so this is kind of the more
expensive cards and give you a lot of
power but also gonna cost you well
obviously a little bit more as far as
the new cards go we have the Radeon r7
250 now this is one of the new
entry-level Radeon cards so it should
fit somewhere around the current Radeon
7 750 and the NVIDIA GTX 650 somewhere
around there and it does come standard
with one gigabyte of gddr5 memory and a
price tag of $89 making it a pretty
impressive looking entry-level card
moving along there's the Radeon r7 260x
now this is one of the more interesting
new cards this does come with two
gigabytes of memory standard as well as
a price tag of 139 dollars putting it
somewhere around the current Radeon 77
90 and the GTX 650 Ti so to key the
bytes on our card this chip is actually
really nice it definitely can come in
handy for some games which really do use
quite a bit of memory for their textures
and on top of that this card also does
come with true audio one of the very few
new AMD cards that actually does until
at least you get on into the high-end
stuff next we have the first hour 9
Series card the Radeon r9 270x so this
is a $200 card this needs to be aimed
more at 1080p gaming so it does come
with 2 gigabytes of memory and it should
be competing with other cards such as
the Radeon 78 70 and the NVIDIA GTX 660
one step above that is the Radeon r9
280x so this actually might be the sweet
spot as far as the new Radeon lineup
goes as this is a lot of GPU for $300
so it does come with three gigabytes of
gddr5 memory which means it does meet
the recommended system requirements for
games like Battlefield 4 as far as the
price goes it should be somewhere around
the current Radeon 7950 the 7970 as well
as the nvidia gtx 760 lastly we have the
new Radeon r9 290x so this is definitely
the most exciting GPU that they
announced in the event as this is a very
very powerful card so as far as the
performance goes some of it was leaked
before the event so I can talk about
that and as far as the performance goes
we should see somewhere around the GTX
780 gtx titan level of performance maybe
even a little bit above that so very
very impressive stuff speaking of I was
actually able to take a look at the card
in person in first of all I really like
the reference design which is something
I rarely rarely say about cards that she
looks very nice in person and I was also
able to try the cards out in fact I was
able to try two of them running in
crossfire gaming with dirt 3 on a
three-panel Eyefinity setup with three
4k displays which was an absolutely
insane level of resolution something
that 12k it was all running on a pair of
r9 290 X's so very very impressive card
and look forward to more videos on this
one before too long what do you think
about the new AMD cards for me I think
the r7 260x is going to be a very good
budget card and the r9 290x is going to
be an absolute beast of a GPU but
definitely be sure to let me know what
you think in the comments below anyway
guys thank you so much for watching if
you enjoyed and you want to catch lots
more videos on all of the new AMD
announcements including lots of videos
and build guides with the new GPUs
definitely be sure to subscribe to the
channel so you don't miss anything
anyway guys I will catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
