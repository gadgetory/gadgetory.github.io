camera curved screen and a total useable
build of Android the new Samsung Galaxy
s6 edge looks awesome on paper but is it
worth it
the s6 is the biggest departure for
Samsung since the original galaxy s
plastic and fake chrome are nowhere to
be found instead we've got glass and
real metal the back is a single sheet of
Gorilla Glass 4 with a matching curved
front fascia and while you do lose the
waterproofing from the s5 I'll take the
nicer design any day my review unit is
gold which is actually pretty attractive
however hands-down my favorite color is
emerald green which sadly isn't
available in the u.s. side-by-side with
the normal SX the Edge has a much
thinner
well edge which helps to give you a bit
more grip on what is otherwise a pretty
slippery foam the curved display also
helps make the phone feel a bit smaller
which is nice for one-handed use their
heads and curved phones before like the
LG G flex the edge is much more subtle
swiping gestures just feel cool and
being able to scroll on the side without
covering the screen is a nice little
feature while the 1440p resolution might
be slight overkill there's no doubt that
the SX has a crazy sharp screen and with
this latest M OLED display from Samsung
color accuracy is dead-on it even gets
impressively bright making it totally
usable in sunlight which isn't something
I can say about most phones there's
really no competition the galaxy s6 and
s6 edge have the best screens on any
phone period right now inside it's no
slouch either it's rocking an 8 core
Exynos processor 3 gigabytes of RAM and
storage options up to 128 gigabytes you
do lose the micro SD card slot but at
least Samsung is up the base model to 32
gigs performance is solid for the most
part things like multitasking or no
problem at all with Samsung's neat multi
window feature I did notice that the
phone tends to run out of memory pretty
quickly apps are forced to relaunch way
too often for a phone with three gigs of
RAM however they should be faced soon in
a software update
speaking of software after years of
shipping builds of Android saddled with
more and more TouchWiz Samsung has
finally taken the ax to a lot of the
duplicate apps and dubiously useful
features what crap wear that is left is
easily disabled giving the s6 a totally
usable build of Android 5.0 lollipop
apps like s-health are downright useful
tracking things like steps along with
taking advantage of the heart rate
sensor on the back of the phone
the fingerprint readers also seen a big
upgrade it's now a touch sensor on the
home button like the iPhone and it's
fast of a little inaccurate sometimes
even small things like the keyboard are
among the best options I've tried on
Android and the quick settings are
customizable and nicely laid out I'd
still prefer something a bit closer to
stock Android but I've lived with
TouchWiz on the s6 with no real
complaints the good stuff keeps coming
when we take a look at the camera it's a
16 megapixel sensor with optical
stabilization and this is about as good
as it gets for a smartphone samsung
added a new shortcut to open the camera
by double tapping the home button and it
launches quickly no matter where you are
snapping pictures is well snappy and the
images themselves are impressive
there's tons of detail and the white
balance is impressively accurate the app
is nicely laid out with options like pro
mode which gives you a little manual
control with options like focus exposure
but honestly I just left it in Auto mode
for the most part on the other hand pro
mode can be really useful for video so
I'm recording on the Galaxy s6 edge
right now
and using pro mode I was able to make a
custom picture profile that with a
little bit of color correction will make
the Galaxy s6 edge look like a much more
expensive camera the only downside is
that this only works at 1080p if you
want to record 4k video on the galaxy s6
you're going to have to do it in auto
mode but still this is a really
impressive video camera of course no
phone is perfect and battery light is
where the s6 stumbles a bit it will get
you through a moderate day abuse but
push it hard and it just can't keep up
overnight it lost 25% of the battery
with the phone asleep which seems to
show a serious lack of optimization the
s6 does sport wireless charging and
quick charging so it's easy enough to
work with if you can drop it on a
charger here and there but some people
are definitely going to miss the
removable battery hopefully a software
update can keep the battery from
draining so much and sleep but right now
this is the biggest issue with the
galaxy s6 Samsung has delivered a pair
of seriously impressive phones but which
one should you go for there's really no
downside to the edge besides the price
and the curved screen is worth in my
opinion but you're getting essentially
the same experience no matter which way
you go it's not perfect but the Galaxy
s6 edge is hands-down one of the best
phones you can buy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
