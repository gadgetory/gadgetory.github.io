here at the review of Mass Effect
infiltrator for iOS while this is a
tie-in with Mass Effect 3 it follows an
entirely different styling and has a
different developer so is it worth
picking up the first thing that grabbed
me were the graphics on an iPhone 4s the
game looks absolutely fantastic but the
only real slowdowns happening when you
use your cloak ability infiltrator looks
especially good in a firefight with lots
of enemies and effects on screen at one
time the audio design is also good for
mobile game with full voice acting and
good sound effects forward moving
forward I haven't finished the main Mass
Effect series so I won't say much into
the overall story but some things did
jump out at me
he basically launches me right into the
game without pulling you in on much and
on top of that enemies just seemed to
appear out of nowhere at random time
without so much as an explanation I've
got some issues with the presentation as
well for example unlike the main mass
effect games the dialogue and RPG
elements are kept to a minimum here and
are largely held to a few choking
choices cutscenes would also have helped
it sometimes as major plot points seem
to be happening without me really
understanding what was going on gameplay
itself is fairly unique Fornaio s game
like the main series through requires
you to think things out as opposed to
rushing headlong into a fight get a few
weapons as well as a cloak ability which
temporarily makes you invisible or less
biotics which allow you to do things
like drag enemies out of cover for a
quick takedown once you get into the
game though you'll find it has a heavy
emphasis on using cover and racking up
style points which requires you to
change together attacks swapping weapons
and using your powers to achieve the
best score at the end of each level
infiltrator also ties in with Mass
Effect 3 by allowing you to use Intel
gathered in the game to either buy more
weapons and upgrades or send it to your
Mass Effect 3 game definitely the most
controversial part of the game are the
controls on one hand they're fairly good
with easy access to switching weapons
and the ability to tap on an enemy and
just line the shot up as opposed to
having to fire each shot individually on
the other hand the controls are much
more likely to get you killed than
anything else it's easy to get yourself
out of cover or since your character
flying right into a group of enemies by
accident the third-person camera can
also sometimes get stuck behind you
giving you
absolutely no visibility of what you're
shooting at there's a lot of potential
in the quick swipe and core of the
controls but I can't help but wish they
had implemented motion as well as a less
touchy cover system overall
Mass Effect infiltrator is a decent game
for fans of the series graphics are
nothing short of fantastic and the
controls have a lot of potential for
fast-paced gameplay on a touchscreen
probably the worst of it is the lack of
any meaningful story or choices which
makes this more of a decent shooter than
true Mass Effect game it's fun for a few
hours of gameplay but there are
definitely better games out there if you
enjoyed definitely be sure to leave this
video a thumbs up if you're interested
