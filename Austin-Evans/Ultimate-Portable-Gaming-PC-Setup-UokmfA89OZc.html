ultimate portable gaming PC setup so you
may have noticed this giant 38 inch
ultrawide monitor from LG we're awesome
enough to sponsor this video and make
this whole setup happen however all
those pixels aren't going to push
themselves which is where this comes in
the razor blade stealth might be one of
my favorite new laptops this year while
razor has been making solid computers
for years the stealth PAC saw it
Hardware with a totally reasonable price
with a 12.5 inch touchscreen display
that comes in either 2560 by 1440 or
full 4k resolutions you're getting a
rock-solid screen no matter which config
you pick up and that makes a difference
while a thin and light laptop is hardly
something to get excited about these
days what really jumps out to me is the
build quality it's all aluminum with a
matte black coating which feels premium
there's essentially no flex anywhere
besides the glowing green Razer logo the
branding is super minimal you've got a
solid keyboard with full RGB lighting
that you can customize a good trackpad
along the front firing speakers on
either side of the keyboard that get
surprisingly loud inside you've got a
brand new core i7 7500 you making the
blade stealth one of the first laptops
with the new Intel cable eight
processors it's still a dual core part
but it's absolutely enough to keep up
with even fairly intense views which is
helped by the addition of 16 gigs of RAM
being standard on everything but the
base model when it comes time to get
some work done all you need is a single
USB type-c cable to plug the blade
stealth directly into our LG ultra wide
display the LG 38 you c99 might be one
of the craziest displays I've ever seen
ultra wide monitors are always cool but
this takes it to another level with an
enormous 38 inch 38 40 by 1600 screen
it's hard to get across just how
immersive it feels on video the curved
panel really does wrap around your setup
with a 99% sRGB color accurate display
it makes a lot of sense and professional
uses like photo and video editing where
that extra horizontal screen real estate
can come in handy but it's also good for
gaming not only does it have AMD's free
sync to keep the refresh rate smooth and
game but the actual panel itself is
terrific as you'd expect something I
wasn't expecting is just how good the
built-in speakers are while getting a
headset is still a good idea I had no
problems gaming with monitor audio
around back you'll find the standard
variety of ports but the coolest part is
USBC plug the blade stealth in and
you've got a pair of USB 3 ports on the
monitor you can use and if you have a
less powerful laptop like a macbook
it'll even charge over the same cave
if you want to get your hands on this
hotness LG actually has a contest going
on right now where they're giving away
15 of these for the ultra-wide festival
2016 you can enter by creating a 21 by 9
ultra wide shot for the monitor and
submitting it using the link in the
description while the blade stealth is a
surprisingly killer little laptop if you
want to get the most out of it
especially when it comes to gaming
you're going to want the Razer core this
takes advantage of the Thunderbolt 3
port on the stealth to let you install a
full desktop graphics card it's dead
simple just open up the core install a
modern GPU and plug the laptop in and
you're good to go
while performance is definitely going to
vary depending on which graphics card
you use it makes a massive difference
hooked into the ultra wide display
you're getting a rock-solid experience
you can also leave USB accessories and
Ethernet plugged into the core and while
it does have a fan it's still quieter
than a lot of gaming PC's the core will
also power the stealth while it's
connected which makes it even cooler you
can literally just pull this tiny laptop
out of your bag and with a single cable
get a full gaming set up it feels like
the future and I love it if you want
some real portable gaming action you can
get the Razer turret which is a mouse on
keyboards it's perfect for couch gaming
the stealth is totally powerful enough
to handle less intense gaming on its own
but there's always going to be a limit
on how much you want to do with the
trackpad the turret pairs are wireless
keyboard with a mouse and slightly
magnetic mousepad it sounds weird but it
works surprisingly well there are plenty
of times where I want to game with a
mouse and keyboard on a couch and this
is the best solution I found yet it all
folds up to a nice portable package and
hiding inside the mouse is a USB dongle
if you want to connect it to a system
that doesn't have bluetooth it comes
with a magnetic dock that not only
charges things but also keeps it nice
and tidy on your desk it might not be
crazy but I'm really happy with how the
setup turned out it's such a killer
blend of Portability and power as always
links to everything I talked about will
be in the description hope you guys
enjoyed and I will catch you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
