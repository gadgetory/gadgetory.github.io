the tutorial on how to create a
hackintosh with Mac OS 10 mountain lion
there are several things to keep in mind
before doing this so please listen
carefully first of all this will not
work on all computers you must have
compatible hardware I will have the info
for my build in the description of this
video if you want to know more a great
place to check out is Tony Mac x86 comm
it's a great resource for finding what
hardware is best suited for OS 10 one
thing to keep in mind is that this isn't
for everyone
lots of things can go wrong so if you're
not prepared to do a little tinkering
and research hack and toshing probably
isn't for you once you're sure your
computer is compatible you'll need a
couple more things first of all is the
computer running OS 10 with the App
Store installed you'll also need an a
gigabyte or larger USB Drive to install
mountain lion and I'll have the one I'm
using listed in the description I also
highly recommend having a hard drive or
SSD that's totally free of data that can
be used just for mountain lion first
step is to grab your Mac and download
mountain lion from the App Store if
you've already bought it you can
navigate to the purchase tab and grab it
from here if you don't have mountain
lion I'll be giving away a promo code
for it on Twitter in the next couple
days once it's downloaded the Installer
will pop up but instead of running it
just close it now open Disk Utility and
plug your USB Drive in select it and
then hit the partition tab select one
partition click options and choose
master boot record name it USB and
finally under format choose Mac OS
extended journaled then click apply now
you need to download uni beast for
mountain lion I'll have a link in the
description but you will need to create
a forum account to download once you've
done that open uni beast and click
through the installer it will ask you
where you want to install so choose your
USB Drive we just made you'll find a
couple options for legacy support as
well as preparing uni beast for laptops
so choose either of these if you need
them now just give the Installer a few
minutes to load mountain lineup time to
move over to your soon-to-be hackintosh
at this point you'll need to plug the
USB Drive into your computer and enter
the BIOS this step is going to be
different depending on what motherboard
you have but it's fairly straightforward
first find boot options and select USB
hard drive is your first boot device
then double check that your motherboard
is set to a HCI mode save the changes
and it should boot from your uni beast
Drive select USB and try to boot if you
have issues like I did try again but
this time type graphics enable or equals
no in the prompt if you're still
having problems try booting with the - V
flag and noting what error you get once
it boots you should see the OS 10
installer where most of the way there
however there's one more thing to do
before installing come up to the top
menu and select Disk Utility here you
should see all hard drives connected to
your computer pick the one you want to
install mount line on and select the
partition tab an option select GUI D
partition table then choose Mac OS
extended journaled as the format and
name it mountain-lion then click apply
close Disk Utility and go through the
installer like normal when it comes to
the install screen just pick the
mountain lion disk and then click
install this will take quite a while so
be patient and let it do its thing
once it's done you should reboot back
into the uni peace drive this time
select mountain line and then complete
the installation nicely done you now
have OS 10 installed on your new
hackintosh now is the time to start
experimenting around and checking to see
if everything works my bill works nearly
perfectly out of the box with the
exception of the onboard audio which I
don't use anyway more than likely you'll
have a few issues but no worries just
take note of everything that isn't
working at this point you can just be
done however you are still booting from
the Uni beast USB Drive there's one more
optional step to finalize your
installation and fix any problems you
might have head over to the download
section on Tony Mac x86 comm and
download multi base for mountain lion
again go through the installer until you
reach the options here you need to
choose easy beast or user dsdt for me I
can use user dsdt by itself but
depending on your build you may need to
use easy beast or user dsdt with a
pre-built dsdt file beyond that just
select the drivers that you need for
whatever isn't working on your computer
and you're good to go
congratulations you now have a 100%
working hackintosh if you found this
