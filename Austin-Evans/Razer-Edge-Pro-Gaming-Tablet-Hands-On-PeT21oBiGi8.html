from CES 2013 with a brand new razor
edge and razor edge Pro now these are
really interesting is they are gaming
tablets so you have pretty much
everything you expect in a full gaming
laptop inside a tablet there are lots of
cool accessories and all kinds of cool
stuff so let's take a look so the edge
is powered by a Core i5 and the edge pro
is powered by a core i7 these are full
laptop chips not that's not but
obviously but they're full laptop chips
gave you plenty of power to play all the
games you want you play steam games you
play origin games from anything you can
do on your normal gaming computer it
will work on the edge of the edge probes
as far as the rest of the specs there's
anywhere between six and eight gigabytes
of RAM on board and also the power by
the GT 640 am graphics these are
dedicated graphics not going to be like
anything integrated or anything like
that any dedicated graphics to give you
some decent power of course it's not
gonna be rivaling your full gaming
computer but gonna be plenty for
on-the-go gaming especially considering
that it's only at 768 or 1366 by 768
display it's basically 720 and you can
also output that via HDMI that also has
quite a few very cool accessories so for
starters there's a gamepad so what you
can do with the gamepad is clip it
around and it gives you some physical
controls so of course tablets are great
but touch screen gaming is not quite
great especially when you go play some
battlefield 3 do you have full dedicated
controls so you have all put basically
it kind of mirrors what you would find
on an Xbox or Playstation controller on
the edges and then when you're not using
it and of course a little bit bulky take
it off and your no button you have no
problem beyond that there also a couple
of dots so there's a keyboard dock so
again just like you could use as a
normal laptop so it's just a keyboard
now there is no there's no dedicated
like try pad but it is a touchscreen so
that's not a big deal the Razer edge and
edge pro will be shipping in the next
few weeks
so the edge starts at $999 and the edge
Pro is $12.99 and of course all the
accessories or extra are they range
anywhere between $99 and $200 so
definitely bit pricey but considering
what you get based a full gaming laptop
that happens to be in a tablet form
patrons very cool stuff every guys if
you enjoyed this video definitely sure
leave it a thumbs up and subscribe for
more CES 2013 content anyway guys I will
get you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
