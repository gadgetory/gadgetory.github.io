year Andy has some surprisingly cool
stuff so first of all we have Radeon 7
no this is the first high end GPU from
AMD in quite a while
it is aiming directly at the r-tx 2080
the reason it's called Radeon 7 is it
basically brings the Vega GPU
architecture down to a seven nanometer
process now there are a ton of technical
reasons why this is cool but the main
thing is is that this really gets them
much more into the competitive landscape
especially considering that RT X is kind
of far and away the fastest graphics
that you can get right now you should be
able to expect about 30% more
performance than Vega 64 which does put
this very much in the ballpark of RT X
2080
and importantly it should be able to
play games at a full 4k 60 in a lot of
cases it's also backed out by a pretty
impressive 16 gigabytes of HBM to memory
double what you're finding on the RT x
2080 and on top of that because this is
the very first graphics card that's
built on seven nanometer they're really
able to push the clocks it goes on sale
on February 7th and I gotta say even if
it's not quite as good as the Arctic's
2080 I am so excited to see AMD really
playing in this space and bring some
proper graphics performance even though
700 hours is still a lot what's even
more exciting this year is third
generation Rison now rice has been
really impressive to me because they
keep iterating and keep making it better
it's such a quick rate and rise and
third gen might just be the biggest jump
yet like Radeon 7 this is the first
seven nanometer AMD CPU and what's cool
about it is it actually is a hybrid
design so the actual CPU itself is
modular kind of like how thread rippers
for example so in theory even though
eight cores is the limit right now we
could see go even higher what's most
impressive about this is that it seems
to have a similar level of performance
to the quarry 9 all you have to take
that with a massive grain of salt but if
it's able to do that in what they're
showing is that a significantly lower
level of power
Rison 3 could be super super impressive
now will not be out until the middle of
this year but from what they've shown so
far it is incredibly impressive if
that's not enough Verizon for you
there's also these second generation
rise in mobile now this is a very
similar level of performance than what
we're seeing to the first generation it
does come down to a 12 nanometers
process and it is a little bit faster
what's cool is is that they're now a lot
more options available what we're seeing
is rising coming into proper gaming
laptops so there's the asou stuff FX 505
behind me which is a fully AMD 7
as a freesync display that goes up to
120 Hertz it does have the new
second-generation rise in mobile and it
even has a Radeon 560 X GPU okay so I'm
just gonna get close to the camera
because I can't step backward
what's cool about rising 2nd gen on the
mobile side is that you do have that 35
watt TDP option so essentially normal
rising Mobile is mostly meant for
ultrabooks but if you want to put it in
a thicker chassis which has better
cooling you can get much higher boost
clocks which is especially important for
gaming going way down the stack that are
also now AMD powered Chromebooks with
their a 6 &amp;amp; a 4 processors now these
aren't exactly super high tech it's
actually from the pre rise in actual
architecture so it means it's not going
to be blazing fast because something
that usually Chromebooks are in the to
$300 category this should give you more
performance and importantly better
graphics than which you will find an are
more Intel but that I'm very curious to
see later because a lot these
Chromebooks are actually shipping very
very soon
look what's impressive about CES for me
this year is how AMD is continuing to
step it up right the stronger AMD is it
means the harder Intel has to work to
make better chips you know that push
they're like more cores higher clock
speeds just to push things and push the
envelope same thing on the graphic side
right nvidia obviously has had their
stumbles with the art CX side of things
and well yes Radeon is maybe not quite
up to that same level of performance in
a lot of aspects but the fact that AMD
is still trying with stuff like the
Radeon 7 is a really really good sign
the more that there's competition the PC
space the better everyone is I can't
stress that enough it's so easy to think
that oh cool there's this new GPU its
fibrous a pastor it's a new CPU its 7%
faster
oh it's 200 ollars more what that's just
not good right that's not good for
anybody so the fact that AMD is out here
and doing such a good job specifically
with Rison and even with Radeon is good
for absolutely everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
