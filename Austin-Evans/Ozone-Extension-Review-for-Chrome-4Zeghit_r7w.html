a google chrome extension so this is
actually something I've never done
before but I've just kind of started
testing out this extension I've got to
say it actually has a ton of potential I
actually really really like it so I
figured I'd go ahead and share with you
guys so before we begin I'm just going
to go ahead and start out by saying that
this will work on any browser however it
only supports five sources and you know
maybe on Firefox or whatever whereas if
you go ahead and do it in chrome and you
download the ozone extension which I
will course have the link to in the
description it will do 15 i definitely
recommend to go ahead and do that
although of course you can go ahead and
just go to the link and try it out and a
normal browser but definitely has a
block it works a lot better when you do
ahead and install the extension so
anyway I adorage come over here and hit
the install button with on google chrome
then you get up here in the top right
corner a little icon so you open it up
it comes up with a very very basic sort
of search so it kind of looks basic but
let me just go ahead and show you how it
works okay so as you can see here it
basically works very very simply so I
know just just randomly searching my
name here as you can see here it gives
you results from all sorts of things so
not only is it like Google Instant
Search where as you type it actually
starts to load up the in addition it
searches from a lot of places so as you
can see here it searches google amazon
netflix wikipedia youtube that also
searches your bookmarks as well as your
history gmail Facebook Apple and guys
the list goes on and on it really is
very very impressive as far as it works
now you also can go ahead and start
scrolling down here and actually picking
it out manually it also does work as you
can see here if you want you can log
into Facebook and they'll even search
your friends will search everything it's
a very very cool thing and especially
what I found what works best for is
searching for something like a you know
a camera or something so just what you
do that right now let's just go ahead
actually the camera i'm planning on
buying here soon so as you can see here
is the coolpix p100 you search that and
as you can see here won't show up for
everything obviously it depends on what
you're looking for as you can see here
we got all kinds of Google search
results we have all sorts of stuff from
Amazon
we have YouTube we have my history have
all kinds of stuff so guys that's pretty
much it that is ozone for google chrome
actually I'm really impressed with how
much I've actually been using it you
know I love Google Instant Search I
think it's a great idea a niche guys
kind of takes it up one more notch by
adding a lot of different options so
again guys I will have the link to
download in the description if you're on
google chrome you can now if you are on
another browser you can go ahead and go
to Chrome ozone XCOM and only google
amazon netflix wikipedia and youtube
will work all the rest will not work you
do have to download the extension for
those two poor lift you interested you
can't go ahead and just try it out but
personally i'm really impressed with our
definitely plan on using it quite a bit
is very very helpful anyway guys thanks
