headed to the future if somehow you've
never heard of the oculus rift I've done
a few videos on the original version and
a couple prototypes but the Developer
Kit 2 is actually on sale right now if
you want to give VR a shot
pop open the box and you'll find
everything you need to get started
including the new positional tracking
camera which reads the IR lights built
into the headset from the outside it's
similar to the original rift but oculus
has changed quite a bit in just a year
up front you can now pop off the cover
to get at the USB and HDMI ports if you
need to replace the cables and instead
of having a big breakout box like before
everything connects to this little
dongle there's also a USB port built
into the headset which allows for future
accessories to be plugged in the biggest
upgrade though is inside there's now a
1080p OLED display that runs it up to 75
frames per second which is a huge
improvement over the original developer
kit interestingly when I fix it tore
down the dk2 they found the screen is
pulled right from the samsung galaxy
note 3 put the rift on though and it's a
seriously impressive piece of tech if
you've never tried VR there are a few
demos that really do a great job of
showing off what the oculus is all about
the Unreal Engine coaster takes you on a
ride around a nicely detailed room and
is one of my favorite demos as it's nice
and comfortable while still giving you a
definite feeling of riding an actual
rollercoaster between the accelerometer
built into the headset and the new
positional tracker it does a much better
job of tracking your head allowing you
to do things like lean in and out
another great game is couch nights most
of the best oculus demos take advantage
of you sitting down by putting an actual
body into the game which does a lot for
immersion being able to look around to
follow the action as if you're sitting
in an actual room is easily one of the
coolest VR experiences I've tried so far
games like impossible or a lot faster
and can be a bit disorienting but even
here the dk2 is much more usable than
the original the extra resolution helps
although you can still clearly see
pixels but the faster refresh rate and
quicker pixel switching time means that
the entire experience is a lot more
realistic with almost no smearing or
blurring not everything is as intense
though
Oshin rift is a straightforward diving
demo that let
explore the ocean which really shows off
the huge scale the VR can give and the
jump scares when you get eaten by a
shark - there's a surprising amount of
content that's already available for the
rift including full games with VR
support as well as lots of mods to make
other games work with the rift most of
these work just fine but rarely will you
just be able to launch a demo this is
aimed at developers and enthusiasts who
don't mind being on the bleeding edge
and finding workarounds when things
don't work there is early support for
Linux and Mac however you basically have
to use a Windows box right now
I used a PC with a core i7 and GTX 780
which ran everything smoothly slightly
overkill but you'll need hardware that
can essentially run a pair of 1080p
screens at a lot 75 frames per second to
get the full experience while the
hardware itself should theoretically
work on anything with an HDMI port don't
expect to be using the oculus rift on a
console any time soon there is sony
project Morpheus for the ps4 which I got
to spend some time with at e3 which is
similar in a lot of ways although the
screen is quite a bit better on the dk2
at the moment the difference is that you
can order the latest oculus rift right
now where the Morpheus is at least a
year away the dk2 is a great way to get
into virtual reality but it's not for
everyone
if you don't mind spending a little time
getting things to work and understand
that there isn't a massive library of VR
content just yet and for three and $50
the oculus rift Developer Kit 2 is
totally worth it however unless you're a
major nerd it's probably best to wait
for next year for the consumer version
to be released alongside major titles
like a Valkyrie either way I think VR is
here to stay so what do you guys think
definitely be sure to let me know in the
comments below anyway I've got to give a
big shout out to Squarespace for making
this video possible Squarespace is the
all-in-one platform that makes it fast
and easy to create your own professional
website or online store I've recommended
Squarespace to my friends for a while
because it really is dead simple there's
no need to spend all day learning how to
code it just works there are tons of
great-looking templates to choose from
that lets you drag and drop content
right in and they all work great on a
phone tablet and computer automatically
it starts at just $8 a month however for
a free trial head over to
squarespace.com slash Austin we decide
to sign up just use the offer code
Austin and check out to get yourself 10%
off and let them know I sent you
