the second my holiday gift guide series
today taking a look at tablets as far as
the tablets themselves go I have no
problem recommending the Amazon Kindle
Fire shirts not going to be the best tab
of the world stuff i'm not going to
replace your ipad but for two hundred
dollars you do get a lot for your money
does have a dual core processor a 7-inch
display and of course it does all kind
of tablet things that you would expect
including apps web browsing video and
also reads books which as it's a kendall
kind of needs to read books well i'm not
the biggest fan of the software on it i
think it's a little bit clunky it's not
quite as elegant or as responsive as it
could be for 200 bucks i have no
problems recommending the amazon kindle
fire if you want to get somebody of
tablet it's a great starter you know it
fits in your pocket well if you have big
pockets it's a great little tablet and
it's but like i said you want to spend
about two hundred bucks or so or
especially to wise get someone started
with the first tablet it's a good way to
go and of course i can't even mention
tablets without talking about the ipad 2
last year Apple released the ipad 1
which is really pretty much what kick or
the whole tablet deal off and the ipad 2
in my opinion remains to be one of the
best tablets you can buy right now now
if you're not interested in buying
someone a full tablet or they already
have what there are also lots of
accessories and different things that
you can do it will still make a great
gift one of my personal favorites is the
wow we won don't let the small size fool
you this is actually an awesome little
speaker and it will work for tablets as
well as pretty much anything with a 3.5
millimeter headset jack including phones
computers mp3 players you name it what
really sets the wow you want apart from
other small portable speakers like this
is the bass the bass is absolutely just
ridiculous for something that's this
small that will fit in your pocket and
the way it works is pretty cool you've
ever tried any kind of speakers that are
roughly this size you'll know that
they're okay especially as you spend
more and more they'll actually start to
sound decent but this is not like that
at all this will allow you to actually
get some massive bass by using gel audio
so if you touch the bottom of its kind
of like a gel kind of a tacky thing and
what you do is you sat down at a table a
wall you name it can put all kinds of
different surfaces you know whatever
it's sitting on that will become
basically a gigantic subwoofer it sounds
kind of crazy but as you guys can see
here it's actually awesome like it will
kick out some serious sound some serious
volume and for about 50 bucks or so this
is a great accessory for anybody but
especially if you want something kind of
replace those kind of crap
be tablet speakers this is a great way
to go one of the most important things
on the tablet is to keep it protected
after you go spend five hundred dollars
on an iPad or something and then it all
next thing you know you drop it in the
screen shatters that guy's sucks so one
really nice thing is to get some kind of
wrap some kind of protector some kind of
case something to keep your device from
immediately exploding in the dust
because that's not cool well this will
give you a ton of protection if you
really want to customize the look of
your device slick wraps make some
awesome skins for a wide variety of
tablets including the kindle fire and
the ipad to becoming a wide variety of
colors and shapes and they even had some
really cool textures so for example i do
have a woman right here looks very nice
and you also do have some carbon fiber
and many more like I says these aren't
really going to be too much for
protection I mean it may help from some
minor scratches and that kind of thing
but if you want to kind of change the
look of your device this is a great way
to go of course there's a wide variety
of other cases and other ways to protect
a tablet of course I can't go over every
single case for every single tab will
ever made but I do recommend get
something there are lots of different
kinds of cases some will have special
features like being able to fold clothes
some will be able to just be
continuously held on the device so i
definitely recommend go take a look see
what you like see what kind of tablet
the person you're buying a gift for has
and get something to protect it last but
not least we have books and while i get
than that everybody is really big on
reading and i understand that but if you
have a tablet every reading is really
not too bad at all and one of the best
ways to do that is through the amazon
kindle app using the kindle book stores
personally my favorite way of getting
books it's not only will it work on
horse all Kendall's there's an app for
all kinds of devices you can read on
your computer on iphone ipod touch ipad
you can rate it on android phones
tablets you name it they're probably
going to be an app for it and if you
want to get somebody a book it's really
simple all we need to do is load up
amazon and find the book that you want
to gift then simply click give as gift
then you can simply email it to whoever
you want they will be able to activate
it on like i said their iphone their
kindle whatever and it's really easy and
some way to do it anyway guys it's gonna
be about it for my holiday gift guide
