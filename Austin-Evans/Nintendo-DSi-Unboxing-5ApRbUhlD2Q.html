today I'm here with an unboxing of the
Nintendo DSi yeah you guys might be
wondering why I got a DSi when there's
the DSi XL as well as the upcoming 3ds
well I just have a DS Lite I liked a lot
and so I decided hey you know what I
might as well go ahead and get another
one
especially because I got this one really
cheap today you guys I'm gonna go ahead
and unbox it now I also show you guys
some accessories and some other stuff I
got for okay guys let's go and jump
right down into it so I flipped over the
box so you guys can see my dress I'm too
lazy to do like sharpie or tape or
something okay so I'm not excited about
getting a DSi guys IFAs I used to have a
DS Lite and I sold it I kind of read it
so I guess I'll be nice so and here we
go so this is the first thing in the box
get this in frame it's a 91 gamer pack
it's just got a bunch of accessories
it's got like a carrying case a car
charger screen pictures that kind of
stuff I've got basically this for free I
bought the DSi and I got this for free
so I figured hey so I'm beach bad but of
course the main thing in the box while I
then put a hole in here Wow heavy is the
DSi Wow guys just toss this off the side
this DSi box is heavy that is crazy
Wow I mean that is really heavy
it doesn't let's not that big of a box
you see here I've kept my old DS Lite
box and it's about the same size but
guys that is heavy I'm really surprised
that's that's not really so I got the
white one kind of thought that was cool
I didn't want to get a black one just
because no black stuff with always its
fingerprints everything so I'm flip it
over here Nintendo DSi I
our blah blah blah so uh let's go ahead
and just open it up here is it thank for
your head opens here we go
so just cut these two little tabs here
Oh a bit guy be careful you guys can
kind of probably tell I like to collect
your video game boxes so I've got all
kinds of boxes some add this to my
collection plus if anything goes wrong
effect now it's in the back too
let's go ahead and pull the time mm-hmm
look at it so we have a Quick Start
Guide mots oh no one really box so heavy
that is a lot of paper go ahead see what
kind of move quickly here so we've got
here a Nintendo Power pre-issued no
thanks Quick Start Guide personalize
your DSi and you fill order take some
photos yeah we'll do that in a minute
another language the language and whoa
the operation manual pages is this 330
pages although this is probably a night
three languages okay I'm never gonna
test it out thank you um new feature DSi
browser and if I remember correctly this
DSi it doesn't cover I pre-installed but
you can go ahead and download it from
the DSi where you download a web browser
shut up my name of course with I'll do
it forwards you on the DSi I might do a
couple extra videos on it too
during the club Mario okay now I cares
Health and Safety okay nobody cares so
let's go ahead and take a look and bucks
the DSi so but it's always you gotta
take the the best part of the the
unboxing inside set off to the side so
you go to all accessories know why
everybody does that but I guess it just
makes sense
stylus
actually physically different than the
original styles it's definitely longer I
haven't used a stylus in a while but it
definitely does feel longer hmm
I remember quickly though the D s
already has ones in it so okay so we
have a charger
let me see here what kind of charger it
is if I remember right and then tendo
always like to make their own chargers
their proprietary ones let's see here
yep that's proprietary so whatever just
pops out kind of like you know the all
the Nintendo Chargers usually dude just
flips out you just pull it up and
somebody'll so guys I think that's all
in the box go ahead and put this in here
and touch the side so now let's go ahead
and get to the main package mine is in
the camera and all of it so yeah guys
let's take a look down ooh wow that is
nice okay that is very nice guys see
that only hit this out of the way using
the camera just little bit more that is
very nice Nintendo DSi oh yeah that is
cool
I really did not expect the last time I
use one was a DS Lite his parents felt
very uh it was very smooth finish but
this one is very very mad I like it a
lot so look why didn't she give you guys
a quick rundown on the horse this right
here is the camera it has a camera on
the inside as well right here we have a
slot for an SD card I don't think it
comes with one I've got one over here
somewhere
yeah it does not come upon that's no big
deal comes with another stylist of
course I'm here now I don't know my
dears light you're used to being Gameboy
slot here but this one doesn't have it
not a big deal you have headphone and
you also have can hook up a microphone
have a volume that's kind of cool of
course my camera's not wantin focus um
so it's not like a like a switch where
it's like it feels like like what you
find like a rocker I'm like okay normal
cell phone or something I'm pretty good
I'm on the back here you just plug in
your games charge it and then the
shoulder buds actually time there kind
of got a little clicky feeling to them
that's pretty good let's go ahead and
open it up nice I'm sure you got that
all quite zoom in what's more um so it
guys really looking at it it looks
almost identical to my DS Lite just a
way that's opened up a few of the
features and this view the differences
are you can see here the power buttons
here you can see they're all the buttons
seems saying right here there's another
camera but uh that's enough that's let's
just go ahead shirt on so that's gonna
want us to set up so guys will do that
some other time but Jay guys so that's
my unboxing of the Nintendo DSi also got
like I said earlier the accessories and
also got a game and everything but yeah
guys so definitely stay tuned I'll be
doing some videos on it I will do a
review on it I might even do you know
some comparisons with it you know
between like it you know like the iPod
touch and stuff so yeah guys definitely
stay tuned anyway guys thanks for
