here with a review of the fastest
graphics card you can buy the new AMD
Radeon r9 295x2 are you ready for 4k
take one look at the new r9 295 and
you'll see this thing is no joke
measuring in at a full 12 inches or 30
centimeters it's a very big and very
heavy dual slot card
unlike previous AMD reference cards this
has a new metal cooler that sets it
apart from the more standard designs in
the center you'll find a single fan that
handles keeping the vrm cool which is
important as the 295 requires a whopping
500 watts to keep all that power under
control AMD opted for a 120 millimeter
closed-loop water cooling setup from Ace
tech at first for a reference graphics
card not only does it keep the 295 from
dumping an enormous amount of heat in
your case but as you'll see a bit later
on it also keeps things fairly cool and
quiet for the GPUs take a look around
back and you'll see four mini display
ports each of which are 4k capable as
well as a dual link DVI for power you'll
need a pair of 8 pin PCIe connectors and
this is one place where you're going to
make sure you have plenty of wattage
available AMD recommends at least 28
amps per 12 volt rail min you'll need a
power supply and the roughly 800 watt
range to keep it fed inside the 295
you'll find two fully enabled Hawaii
GPUs essentially giving you a pair of r9
290 X's inside a single card
unlike most dual GPU cards you're really
not losing anything versus going with a
crossfire setup as both GPUs are
actually running slightly faster than a
typical Hawaii card thanks to the water
cooling loop you don't run into the same
throttling either keeping those beefy
GPUs fed is a massive eight gigabytes of
gddr5 memory for a graphics card that's
an almost absurd number to put things in
perspective my entire test bench has 8
gigabytes of system memory you can see
the full specs of the 295 for yourself
here compared to the 290 X and 290 but
the big thing to take away from it is
that for all intents and purposes you're
looking at two complete r9 290x GPUs
built into a single card while working
on this review Andy told me straight up
that the 295x2 is really aimed at 4k
gaming so they let me borrow a 32 inch
sharp 4 K mod
to test with gaming at 4k is really
something as with four times as much
resolution compared to HD you can get
right up and close and still see lots
and lots of detail to see how well the
295 stacks up I benchmarked it alongside
the msi r9 290x lightning a seriously
impressive card on its own that I'll be
taking a closer look at a bit later so
enough of me going on and on about tech
specs how does the 295 actually handle
gaming in 3d Mart fire strike both cards
are seriously impressive with a 290x
lightning pulling in just over 10,000
points and the 295x2 delivering 15,000
644 jump over to battlefield 4 which is
running on ultra at 4k and you'll see
nearly perfect scaling as the 290x isn't
able to hit 30fps whereas the 295 is
approaching 60 Metro last light is
another good example as on very high
settings you're looking at 29 frames per
second on the 290 X and 48 on the 295x2
Crysis 3 is an incredibly punishing game
even at lower resolutions but crank it
up to 4k and you'll still get a
perfectly playable 37 fps thanks to the
dual Hawaii GPUs while it might not
quite match up for pure graphics grid 2
can still be demanding with all the
knobs cranked up and here we're looking
at a very impressive 95 fps on the 295
vs. 53 on the 290x lightning as you guys
can see the performance of the 295 is
beastly however one of the big issues
with the 290 X was it was a very hot in
a very loud card so you take two of
those GPUs and you put on the same card
you're just asking for trouble right in
the noise Department I think the 295x2
is pretty decent but I'll let you guys
listen for yourselves
considering just how much power these
cards consume the temperatures are very
reasonable with a 295 topping out around
60 degrees Celsius and the 290x
lightning at 68 degrees however unlike
the 290x which taught that at 95 degrees
the 295 limits to 275 degrees so while
there is some overclocking Headroom it's
not a ton overall while the titan black
might come close for now the AMD radeon
r9 295x2 is hands down the fastest
single graphics card you can buy the
downside though is that you're going to
have to pay for that performance
so the 295 comes out on April 21st for
$1,500 considering a pair of 290x
lightnings runs about $1400 right now I
don't think it's an absurd price to pay
for getting it in a water cool package
but there's no way of getting around
that this is one expensive card so what
do you guys think is the 295 worth it
let me know in the comments below also
in case this is just a little outside
your price range I recently posted a new
budget gaming PC bill which you guys can
find in the link in the description of
this video anyway guys thank you so much
for watching and I will catch you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
