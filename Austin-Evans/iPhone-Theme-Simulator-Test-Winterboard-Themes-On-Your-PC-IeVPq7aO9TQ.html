today I'm here with a screencast of a
pretty cool thing I think you guys got
really like this is basically an iphone
theme simulator now if you guys have
ever made winterboard themes you know
that it can kind of get a little tedious
and annoying to have to you know keep
sinking back each little bit of icon or
each small little thing back and forth
have an SSH just to try to get it
perfect well now there's a built-in
iphone theme simulated you can write on
your computer you don't even have to
have an ipod or iphone it looked it
totally runs contained on your computer
so it really works well now of course
it's not gonna be fully perfect but it
really does work you can drag the icons
you can drag the different bits and
pieces of your fame into it and take a
look at what it's going to look like
it's pretty helpful if you'd like to
make winterboard themes and stuff like
that so yeah let's go ahead and get this
one started okay so the first thing
obviously we're going to need to do is
download the iphone theme simulator so
to do that just open up your web browser
of choice mine's chrome so okay so now
i'm going to want you to go to a link i
will have this link in the description
but okay I got it right here but yeah
you just follow into the description
okay so now what you'll do is you'll see
iphone theme simulator just click here
to start download it's really simple
okay so once you have the download it's
really simple from here okay so once you
have the iphone theme simulator download
it come into the zip file may just put
mine on my desktop just show you just go
ahead and open it up and extract it and
inside you'll find these three things
you'll find the theme simulator itself
you'll find a folder called test theme
and then you'll find one called
resources okay and by the way it doesn't
matter where you put it as long as its
new or not we're somewhere it can get
deleted I just put it on my desktop just
so it'll be easier to tell anyway so go
ahead and you can ignore the resources
theme but go ahead and open up the test
name folder okay now all should be in
there is library go and open that up go
ahead themes okay now you see I've added
this one originally it will just come
with test dot theme now if you don't
want to test any of your themes just yet
if you're just you know I wanted to mess
around with it you can go ahead and use
this but as for me I brought in my own
custom theme you know you guys can go
ahead and do whatever you want but in
general if you want to go ahead and
start testing your themes go ahead and
just drag a copy over whatever folder
that contains your theme go ahead bring
it into the theme folder okay now don't
quite close this yet just go ahead and
just kind of get it out of the way and
now let's go ahead an open at the same
simulator okay now first it looks kind
of a little link because it pretty much
all looks like is to blank screens and
you almost can see a little bit of gray
okay so now this is where it comes in
nicely kind of get them out of the way
and come up to your themes now i'm gonna
go ahead and be using my themes so i'll
go ahead and open this up now i'm less
first before I begin let me go ahead and
just show you a quick
you can't tell you might not be able to
tell in the screencast but right here
this is the lock screen 1 and this is
your springboard so if you want
basically what you'll do is you'll drag
different graphics over to wherever it
needs to be so like let's say you want
to put your slider you'll you'll put it
over here you know I put your icons you
put it over here pretty simple okay so
go ahead and look through so first let's
grab my wallpaper so I'll just drag it
bring it over here and drop it okay oops
and quite work let's go ahead and bring
it over here as you can see here is a
little glitchy there we go now if you
now I have this over here you can kind
of see how it glitched out a little bit
basically it kind of thought that they
were icons so if you drag when you drag
it over it kind of doesn't quite work as
you can tell but as long as you kind of
try to get it I guess up there up top or
on bottom or something where icons
wouldn't be it should work anyway so I'm
go ahead I could grab my dog but it's
transparent so let's grab some icons so
let's just grab now obviously you can
see here it says messages and calendar
everything but it doesn't really matter
you can put whatever you want so let's
just grab this one and put it in stocks
and we'll just keep dragging and just
keep just putting them wherever we want
doesn't really matter and just grab a
couple more just kind of give you guys a
sense of what looks like you can see
your the full transparency because I do
use the glass Clark icons in my theme
means to the transparency works through
just perfect so let's go ahead and come
out here to something else let's see
springboard so let's come down here too
oh I don't know and i'll show you got
the speaker for example if we try to put
this in the middle and you see a glitch
out because basically the way it works
is that it really doesn't support all of
your graphics so to fix this you can
only do a few different things but to
fix this just grab your wallpaper you
should i get where what does it think
it's going to be it whoops doesn't think
it's gonna be a theme if i can get it
back and figure out where it is i think
this is a dog you see it's pretty
glitchy just even put in the middle
there we go and let's just come over
here and drag the dock over
and maybe works no oh well as you guys
can definitely hopefully see that it's
pretty glitchy right now on they also do
much the same thing for the lock screen
you can come over here and pull over
different things I think I bet I could
ya see do wallpapers and and things like
that as you can really hope you guys can
tell it's pretty glitchy and it doesn't
work perfect but you can definitely tell
that it can work I mean you know if I
want grab icons whatever you'll be
reading it like I look for maps and just
pull this over here and drag it over
them do whatever you want and you know
it does kind of work and it definitely
is if you just want to test something
real quick it does work fairly well I
mean you know I'm still probably going
to go ahead and just SSH everything over
but when I just want to check one small
thing and I don't want to spend a ton of
time moving a folder over or something
like that this is definitely a good way
to go anyway guys that is a little
review i guess not really but it'll take
a little first look at the iphone theme
simulator it's pretty cool i hope they
get some updates out for it because you
know it's a really good idea and i like
it but it just doesn't quite work
perfect um but that said still a lot of
fun to you know use and mess with I've
only been using it for a short time now
so i'm sure i'll probably learn more and
get better at it as i as i figure out
what everything does ok guys so yeah
that's it thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
