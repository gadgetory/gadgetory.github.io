today I'm here with a screencast of a
pretty cool thing I think you guys got
really liked this is basically an iPhone
theme simulator now if you guys have
ever made
winter board themes you know that it can
kind of get a little tedious and
annoying to have to you know keep
sinking back each little bit of icon or
each small little thing back and forth
have an SSH just to try to get it
perfect well now there's a built in
iPhone theme simulated you're gonna
write on your computer you don't even
have to have an iPod or iPhone it looked
it totally runs contained on your
computer so it really works well now of
course it's not going to be fully
perfect but it really does work you can
drag the icons you can drag the
different bits and pieces of your theme
into it and take a look at what its
gonna look like it's pretty helpful if
you'd like to make one or more themes
and stuff like that so yeah let's go
ahead and get this one started okay so
the first thing obviously we're going to
need to do is download the iPhone theme
simulator so to do that just open up
your web browser of choice
mine's Chrome so okay so now I'm gonna
want you to go to a link I will have
this link in the description but okay
right here but you just follow into the
description okay so now what you'll do
is you'll see iPhone theme simulator
just click here to start download it's
really simple okay so once you have the
download it's really simple from here
okay so once you have the iPhone theme
simulator downloaded it should come into
the zip file they should put mine on my
desktop just to show you just go ahead
and open it up and extract it and inside
you'll find these three things you'll
find the the theme simulator itself
you'll find a folder called test theme
in the new find one called resources
okay and by the way it doesn't matter
where you put it as long as it's new or
not where somewhere it can get deleted I
just put it on my desktop just so it'll
be easier to tell anyway so go ahead and
you can ignore the resources theme go
ahead and open up the test
named folder okay now all should be in
there is library pull it open that up
we're at themes okay now you see I've
added this one originally it will just
come with test the dot theme now if you
don't want to test any of your themes
just yet if you're just you know I
wanting to mess around with it you can
go ahead and use this but as for me I've
brought in my own custom theme you know
you guys can go ahead and do whatever
you want
but in general if you want to go ahead
and start testing your themes go ahead
and just drag a copy over whatever
folder that contains your theme go ahead
and bring it into the themes folder okay
now don't quite close this yet just go
ahead and just kind of get out of the
way and now let's go ahead and open up
the theme simulator okay now first it
looks kind of a little blank because
pretty much all looks like is two blank
screens and you almost can see a little
bit of gray okay so now this is where it
comes in nicely kind of get them out of
the way and come up to your themes now
I'm gonna go ahead and be using my
themes so I'll go ahead and open this up
now I must first before I begin let me
go ahead and just show you a quick if
you can't tell you might not be able to
tell in the screencast but right here
this is the lockscreen 1 and this is
your springboard so if you want
eventually what you'll do is you'll drag
different graphics over to wherever it
needs to be so like let's say you want
to put your slider you'll you'll put it
over here and you want to put your icons
you put over here for example okay so go
ahead and look through so first let's
grab my wallpaper so I'll just drag it
bring it over here and drop it okay
let's go ahead and bring it over here as
you can see here it's a little glitchy
there we go now if now that I have this
over here you can kind of see how it
glitched out a little bit basically it
kind of thought that they were icons so
if you drag when you drag it over it
kind of doesn't quite work as you can
tell but as long as you kind of try to
get it I guess up there up top or on
bottom or something where icons wouldn't
be it should work anyway so I'm go ahead
I could grab my dog but it's transparent
so let's grab some icons let's just grab
now obviously you can see here so the
messages and calendar everything but it
doesn't really matter you can put
whatever you want so let's just grab
this one and
it stocks and we just keep dragging and
just keep just putting them wherever we
want doesn't really matter and just grab
a couple more just kind of give you guys
a sense of what it looks like you can
see your the full transparency because I
do use the glass Clark icons in my theme
means to the transparency works through
just perfect so let's go ahead and come
out here to something else let's see
springboard so come down here to I don't
know
I'll show you got the speaker for
example if we try to put this in the
middle and you see a glitch out because
basically the way it works is that it
really doesn't support all of your
graphics so to fix this you can only do
a few different things but to fix this
just grab your wallpaper
you should I get where it doesn't think
it's gonna be it oops doesn't think it's
gonna be a theme if I can get it I can
figure out where it is I think this is a
dog you see it's pretty glitchy just
even put in the middle there we go and
let's just come over here and drag the
dock over and maybe works Wow
as you guys can definitely hopefully see
that it's pretty glitchy right now um
you also do much the same thing for the
lockscreen you can come over here and
and pull over different things I think I
bet I can yes II do wallpapers and and
things like that
as you can really hope you guys can tell
it's it's pretty glitchy and it doesn't
work perfect but you can definitely tell
that it can work I mean you know if I
wanna grab icons whatever you know be
reading it like I look for maps just
pull this over here and drag it over
them do whatever you want and you know
it does kind of work and it definitely
is if you just want to test something
real quick it does work fairly well I
mean you know I'm still probably going
to go ahead and just SSH everything over
but when I just want to check one small
thing and I don't want to spend a ton of
time moving a folder over or something
like that this is definitely a good way
to go anyway guys that is a little
review I guess not really but it'll take
a little first look at the iPhone theme
simulator it's pretty cool I hope that
gets
updates out for it because you know it's
a really good idea and I like it but it
just doesn't quite work perfect
but that said still a lot of fun to you
know use and mess with I've only been
using it for a short time now so I'm
sure I'll probably learn more and get
better at it as I as I figure out what
everything does hey guys so yeah that's
it thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
