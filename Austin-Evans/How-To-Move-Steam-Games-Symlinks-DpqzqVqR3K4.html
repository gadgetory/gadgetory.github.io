showing you how to move a steam game
from one hard drive to another now there
are quite a few reasons why you may want
to do this for example if you have a
setup like mine where you have a
solid-state drive as well as a normal
spinning hard drive and your solid-state
drive is getting full like me you also
may want to go ahead and install this on
an external hard drive so for example if
you wanna you know go between different
computers wherever keep your games with
you you can just install them on that so
I'm going to do for you guys is give you
a quick tutorial showing you how to do
this and now it's going to be a little
bit more complicated than just dragging
and dropping
now steam only allows you to install
your games on your C Drive or whatever
Drive you have windows installed on so
let's get a little bit complicated
however it's not that bad so let me go
ahead give you guys a quick tutorial so
the first step is is that you need to
download and install whatever gaming
going to do whatever you going to move
rather so I'm going to be moving
Bioshock today it's a great game but I
think it'll be just fine on a normal
hard drive so once you have installed we
can go ahead and pull steam down you're
going to need a couple of things now the
first thing is you need to find the disk
so what I'm going to do is just go in
here you're going to go on go into your
local disk C or again whatever drive you
have windows on you come down to Program
Files arrive at Program Files x86
you kind of scroll all the way down till
you find steam you need to go into steam
apps and you need to come into common
now at this point you will see all the
games that you have installed on your
computer so for example I have Bioshock
right here ok so once you have found the
file you need to go ahead and open up
another window and for example this
needs to be a window on your other hard
drive so for example this is my 2
terabyte drive so what I'm going to do
is just simply drag-and-drop Bioshock
onto my second hard drive so it's going
to go ahead and copy for a little bit so
I'll be right back as soon as it's done
ok so it's all done so if we want to
make sure we can just go over here make
sure that all the files look to be in
order so we just open on both sides you
can see here everything looks a bad
identical so the next step is to rename
this folders now the course we're going
to delete it but just to make sure we
don't need to redownload and install
everything what we're going to do is
just rename it anything so this isn't
Bioshock just it doesn't really matter
just as long as it's not the same folder
name so if there's any problem if
something didn't copyright instead of
having to redownload and reinstall
everything we could just
back to Bioshock Network just fine all
right so our next step is is we need to
open up the command prompt so just hit
the Windows key then type in CMD then
we're going to right click and open as
administrator okay so once you have the
command prompt open it's going to be
really simple we just need to enter a
simple command so what we do is type in
MK Li NK
backslash capital J now we need to go
ahead and put a quotation mark and now
what we need to do is come over to your
I just like to open up the foot the
files here and then click on the top
little address bar so it will change it
into the actual address so just ctrl C
to copy it and then right click and
click paste so then that will go ahead
and put in well the entire file name so
we can get straight to it then what you
need to do is just add another backslash
and then add whether the name of the
game was so for example this is bioshock
whatever the name of the folder was so
for example as you can see here it was
called just bioshock all lowercase so
add that and then add another quotation
mark ok so now on the second part we
need to go ahead and point steam towards
it we can actually open that back up now
we need to appoint steam towards where a
rather to point windows towards where
the steam file actually is so this is
going to be really simple in my case
it's just eistein and Bioshock so if
there's no spaces you don't have to add
the quotation mark so I'm just going to
paste that in here so as you guys can
see here you should see something very
similar should be m'kay link backslash J
and then if in quotation marks and then
wherever your steam file is so for
example we want to create something in
common where Bioshock was before and
then the second part just needs to be
pointing windows to where the files
actually are so once you know you got
done click enter and there we go it says
junction created ok so as you guys can
see here we go ahead and click on the
Bioshock folder we actually open it up
it looks like as far as windows can tell
it is just in Program Files exactly
where it was however if we come over to
the steam file of course it is still on
our external hard drive anyway guys that
was a quick tutorial showing you how to
move a steam game from one hard drive to
another and of course there are other
ways to do this there are programs allow
you to do it but personally I just like
doing it in the command line and it's
just one line of text not all that
difficult and now we've straight up
about 5 6 gigs off of our solid-state
drive and we've moved it over and now we
can still play steam games
but we've freed up a lot more space in
