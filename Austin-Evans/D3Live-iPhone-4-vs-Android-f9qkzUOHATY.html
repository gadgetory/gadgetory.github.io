episode of d3 live today we're going to
touch a pretty big topic it's going to
be the iPhone 4 versus Android now
before we did let me just clear up a few
questions I get Android is not a phone
guys I know that there is the Droid but
that's a different thing from Android
Android is a full software platform that
is runs on a ton of phones guys I mean
literally they're probably you know a
couple angelicque phones come out every
week okay
Andrew basically is made by Google it's
an operating system for phones sometimes
for like tablets even for like small
computers very rarely but and basically
lots of folks built off of it and it's a
really tall platform and there have been
some really really good phones that have
been built up Android so guys I'm gonna
go ahead and compare just a few phones
today to help you kind of understand
what what all this means so obviously
we're going to take a look at the iPhone
4 ok iPhone 4 is really looking solid
guys I mean it's the thinnest smartphone
on the planet right now which sounds
like something SD job let's say but you
know it's a really cool thing it's very
very cool as far as the screen on the
screen is really high resolution and
called the retina display because the
screen so high resolution your eyes
can't even you know if it was any better
your icecream city I don't 100% agree
with that guys it might it depends on
how far you cold it but any rate guys
the iPhone 4 has probably the best rate
you can get on a phone right now
obviously it has the iPhone OS verse now
called iOS and now has multitasking ads
the App Store with you know like over
230,000 apps you know hey guys the
iPhone 4 is going to be a huge phone and
it's they're gonna sell millions of them
and probably every single one of those
people are going to be happy with it
but that's not to say that it is the
only phone that you might want to get
there are also several Android phones so
there are three of them I'm going to
talk about today but of course guys
there are many many more and I mean most
of these phones are really good go ahead
and focus on three today the first one
is going to be the Motorola Droid 2 of
course guys the arguably arguably the
phone that really kicked off Android
the original Droid which came out late
last year um guys it is a really cell
phone you know it's got the slide-out
keyboard but it's got a really nice
screen it's fast and you know it's a
really solid phone but there are a lot
better phones nowadays and so of course
it's about time for the Motorola Droid 2
so guys they might actually named it the
Droid 2 they might name it a couple
other names there's a bunch of different
young people talking about it but anyway
it will be the successor to the drawing
a little very similar it will have maybe
just like a little bit of chrome around
it it would probably a little bit of a
faster processor but it will be mostly
the same guys will run Android which
means you can run over I believe over
50,000 apps on Android so I mean might
not be 230,000 the guys you're not gonna
download you know 10,000 20,000 apps so
it's not that huge of a deal it should
be able to find pretty much anything um
so guys the Droid 2 is probably going to
be the best phone if you really want a
hardware keyboard you know a lot of
smart phones these days are going to the
software keyboard where you know just
need to the touch screen but the droid
has always had a pretty decent maybe not
an amazing but a pretty easy keyboard
and the droid she looks to improve on
this so guys if the keyboard and maybe
even coming from a blackberry or a
windows mobile phone which obviously you
know has a standard keyboard you might
want to go ahead and take a look at the
droid 2 which should be out within the
next month or so month and a half maybe
um guys now the next two phones are
already out on the the next one is going
to be on right it will be the droid
incredible guys this is a pretty solid
phone I'm said 3.7 inch display which is
very very slightly larger than the
iPhone display it's got a very high
resolution but the cool thing but it is
it has a Snapdragon processor guys you
know that means basically it is just
it's going to be very very fast you know
your wheel so you know browse websites
fast open apps fast your Play even some
pretty decent games it's just going to
be a very fast phone it also has the HTC
Sense interface on top of Android this
means that you'll have a little bit more
functionality like a cool clock you'll
be able to you know have more home
screens you have some various little
features that will be pretty helpful
guys the HTC Droid Incredible
if you're behind a phone on Verizon
right now guys that will probably be the
one to go
or the Droid 2 will be coming soon but
it will probably not be you know better
than HTC Droid Incredible just because
there are two different phones you know
one has a keyboard and one doesn't
so guys if you're interested in the
front phone number is right now the HTC
Droid criticals probably one to get now
that is for probably the best Android
phone right now which is the HTC EVO 4G
guys this is a monster of a phone it is
had a 4.2 4.3 action that I'm not sure
but it's a over 4-inch display which is
much much larger than you know anything
else really on the market right now it
runs Android but the game with HTC sits
in her face just like on the incredible
I'm but guys it's got a lot of really
cool features it's got a stack driving
processor so it's going to be very fast
it's got a full eight megapixel camera
on the back that shoots high-definition
video guys that's pretty impressive you
actually take your phone shoot
high-definition video so you know you
can you can quit carrying you know like
a flat minnow or whatever you know
camcorder you might carry on a
day-to-day basis um some other things
are it has HDMI out so you can actually
just play right into the bottom of the
phone and output to your your
high-definition TV so you can watch all
the videos you have in addition it has a
front-facing camera yeah this is going
to be really cool because you can
actually you know hold the phone there
and actually you know stare at the
screen or stabbed a little camera right
above the screen you actually talk to
people and we'll work on 3G as well but
guys the main thing that makes this
phone go from really really good to just
fantastic is that it has four G so
Sprint has built out a network in the
United States called 4G which is
basically going to be the next kind of
wireless network that everyone we're
going to start using basically with this
you can go ahead and get much much
faster downloads and that's going to be
super fast
you know they've said upwards of 10
megabits per second which guys is faster
than on the implied 80 to 90 percent of
people's internet connections of the
house so guys you can be out in the
middle of nowhere and get internet it's
much faster than at your house now force
4G isn't everywhere yet but it's great
that you can go ahead and get on that
plus it will work on pretty much
anywhere as is 4G which it'll just bump
ups that when you're
so guys HTC EVO 4G looks great Matt guys
turned a little bit bigger question
which is what should I get
well guys if I mean I'm gonna say this
once I'm gonna say anytime anybody asked
me the iPhone 4 looks great and if you
buy it you will not be disappointed I
mean it looks great it's got a great
design in my opinion you know there's a
lot like but iPhone but you know there's
some things that you know there's not
going to like I mean you know the App
Store is a little bit closed you know
you can't it's real big trouble to go
ahead and no jailbreak or modify it you
know to do what you want to do on it so
it's a really close platform so that's
why I like to come to Android for a lot
of people is open so it's not difficult
to know you can pretty much put any app
on there you want you know nobody's
really gonna say no you can't use bad
whatever it's really nice and open and
plus through a ton of your phone can get
fungal keyboards phones lift out
keyboards you can get phone with you
know front-facing cameras this that does
that I mean there's a new awesome
Android phone that seems to come out
every couple weeks so guys really down
to you but guys will not tell you this
believe me you can't go wrong with
either of them Android is a really solid
thing and I constantly saw it as well ok
guys so for the second segment of d3
live I will be taking live Skype calls
all this is done in front of blogtv got
a bunch of people in here so go ahead
and take a few slots Skype calls
so go ahead take the first one hello
Jonathan are you there I know I'm see
I'm night shift be expert in this I know
that they were working on it but the
main problem with that is that they the
DSi can actually update and so just like
you know jailbreaking your iPod or
iPhone you can go ahead and you know
they can update it and keep you from
doing anything they're not wanting to so
I guess you can I'm not really big X
product but it's a little bit more
difficult so hope that answer your
question
ok thanks man let's go ahead and get
another call here Danny are you there
yeah hey which question thing you like
about Windows
I'm not attorney volume down you ask me
what's my main thing I like about
Windows I don't like about Mac yeah um
well the main thing I like about Windows
is they it's it's something up I mean
it's just something I've used for a long
time I mean there are a lot of different
things such as you know more application
support windows you know I'm not saying
there's not like against magnet you know
Maggie doesn't have a lot but there are
a lot of applications that have been
made from Windows you know since like
the 98 days 2000 all something will
still work on Windows right today you
know a lot of my games so I mean there's
nothing really that bad about Mac in my
opinion I mean I like it I've had a Mac
before but I've just used Windows for so
long and then you know I know it's oh
well that's just kind of the way I like
to do it I mean this is more of a
personal preference thing you know yeah
hey thanks is a question okay it's go
ahead and take another call here
hello either
I'm sorry your mics a little bit bad
makes a little bit too bad sorry okay
it's good another one
hello Kyle are you there yeah hey what's
your question it's about the HTC EVO
Ford
I think that's what it's called so my
question is outside the 720p video
recording Hey Oh what's the difference
between got features I mean what is that
one features of the HTC EVO 4G have that
other Android phones like the Droid or
the joy Harris and all the other ones
don't have okay well there are several
things probably the biggest one in my
opinion is it's got 4G so I just of
course just talk to this about this a
little bit but basically the difference
is I mean between 3G and 4G it's almost
like going from your like dial-up to
know like broadband it's much faster you
know 4G is not at everywhere yet but
they're starting to roll out and it's
going to be much faster
like I said internet browsing going to
be almost fast it's not even just as
fast as on your normal computer at home
um there are a couple of things it's got
a very very nice large screen much
larger than most brains around it's got
a front-facing camera also doesn't run
Android it's got you know a Snapdragon
processor which more Android phones
getting but you know you guys you put
all that together it really does make a
pretty solid package so I hope that
answer your question thank you for
calling let's go ahead and take another
call here hi are you there well as far
as operating systems go I think androids
really good but I just kind of like the
iPhone a little bit more just because
it's really smooth it's really polished
I mean everything is being with us
version 4 so I mean they've obviously
done a lot and it's a very smooth and
polished and I keep saying that but
that's really something that comes to
mind the principle for the iPhones are a
lot better and my next question is
surprising I have Verizon I do not like
AT&amp;amp;T I mean their service is not very
good most places whatever isin is really
good and I just don't like a lot of the
policies áthe does I mean let's not say
that I really don't like them but I
definitely ferberize in the my opinion
so okay thank you okay so I think we
quite going to go ahead just take one
more call here so you guys gonna call in
hello are you there yeah hey which
question man I was just wondering with
all the new iPhone 4 background changing
and multitasking hmm
when do you think they will just stop
Cydia because of all the painters coming
to the iPhone well I don't think that'll
ever happen I mean they're you know a
lot of the stuff that you know people
jailbreak for has been you know added in
iOS 4 I mean I can you say you know you
got background changing you got you know
backgrounding of applications you can
run more than one at a time but I don't
think Apple ever being able to be
totally open I still see that you know
there'll always be in things for such as
like 3G on restrictor so you can run
like 3G applications that normally need
Wi-Fi you know winter border for really
in-depth customization neither I think
they're always going to be a lot of
reasons to what head and jailbreak to
get more you know just to get more just
get more openness to be able to do more
of what you want but I do I I do agree
that you know with iOS well they have
taken a couple of the big things that
people jailbreak away for but hopefully
yeah gibbering will stay so hope that
ask you a question
thank you thanks for the call okay guys
so that's going to be it for this third
