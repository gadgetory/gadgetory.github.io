here is a review of what might be the
best pocket camera ever the Sony rx100
Mark 3 with smartphone cameras getting
better and better
buying a point-and-shoot has become a
much harder sell but the rx100 does a
great job of showing what's possible
with such a small camera put it beside
the original rx 100 and you'll see it's
gotten a bit thicker but it's still much
smaller and way more profitable than a
typical DSLR one of the big new features
is the pop-out viewfinder this is a very
big deal for a camera this small as it
allows you to shoot pictures and video
on a nice and sharp 1.4 million TV f
which gives you basically all the
information from the LCD including the
menus it pops up with a switch on the
slide which powers up the camera pull
the eyepiece out and you're ready to
shoot all the one minor downside is that
if you want to put the finder away the
camera turns itself off around back is a
nice and bright 3-inch LCD that you can
angle downward or flip all the way up to
get that perfect vlogging angle for a
one-man operation like me being able to
see myself when I'm filming is a huge
help so I'm actually using the Sony
rx100 Mark 3 to record myself right now
and Sony has really pulled out all the
stops on the video side several of my
recent videos were shot on the rx100 and
thanks to that reasonably large one-inch
sensor you can get almost DSLR like
depth of field and dynamic range a big
improvement on the mark 3 is Sony's new
X AVC HD 50 megabit codec giving you
much more room to push your footage in
color grading the standard 24 P and 30p
footage is nice but you also get 60 P
and 120 P modes as well the 60 FPS video
looks fantastic with almost no loss in
quality but bump things up to 120 frames
per second and it crops in quite a bit
and drops to 720p giving you very soft
footage it can be usable if you just
have to have that super slow-motion look
but I can't imagine myself ever using it
over the fantastic 60 P mode however if
you're serious about video you're going
to be limited to using the built-in mic
on the rx100 now it's definitely not bad
however unlike a DSLR there's no mic in
Jack so you're pretty much limited to
either using the rx100 audio or getting
some kind of external solution going
around and telling people that they're
idiots
wearing these in my opinion is a little
bit much
you also get pro video features like
zebras and peeking which make it easier
to get exposure and focus right and one
hugely helpful feature is a built-in
three stop indie filter this is an
awesome thing to have as Indies are
usually only found on very expensive pro
camcorders that combined with the
brighter lens allows you to shoot it
much wider apertures than before
allowing you to get those nice blurred
backgrounds even in bright daylight
speaking of the lens is nothing short of
fantastic it's the equivalent of a 24 to
70 millimeter F 1 point 8 to 2.8 lens on
a DSLR to put that in perspective the
Canon 24 to 70 lens is well over $2,000
making it even more impressive that Sony
managed to fit something even remotely
close in such a small package all of
this helps to make the rx100 mark three
solid for pictures as well with 20
megapixels on a one inch sensor you're
getting a lot more detail than on a
smartphone which allows you to crop way
in and still get a usable shot for
sharing to sites like Instagram the lens
is long enough to get nice portraits and
it can also pull off a nice macro shot
too
the bokeh is also absolutely fantastic
nice and creamy thanks to that new Zeiss
lens and it's nicely controlled with
minimal flaring even when shooting
directly into the Sun low-light
performance might not be able to touch a
high-end DSLR but it's still impressive
since the lens is fairly bright and has
good stabilization you can get some nice
shots at night but its no low light
monster like its bigger brother the a7 s
autofocus has always been good on the
rx100 and the mark 3 is no exception it
grabs focus quickly and accurately it
also has a 5 frame per second burst
which is better than some DSLRs in this
price range the Sony rx100 Mark 3 might
be the ultimate youtuber camera it's
small enough to fit in a pocket and yet
has good enough image and video quality
to replace a DSLR for me so what do you
guys think would you ever pick up an Rx
100 definitely be sure to let me know in
the comments below anyway guys thank you
so much for watching and I'll catch you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
