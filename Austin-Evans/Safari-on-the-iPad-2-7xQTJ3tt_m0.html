of safari performance in Iowa's 4.3 on
the iPad 2 so of course the iPad 2 has
just come out and of course there are a
lot of different questions but one of
the biggest ones for me is how does it
do in web browsing obviously tablets are
really really do great for web browsing
let me give you guys just a quick tour
so as you can see here if you've never
used an iPad before it's a very very
neat experience so that a couple ways of
doing it you can do pinch to zoom I'm
just really quite nicely you can you
scroll along here we can pull out we can
also if you would jump over to the iPad
you'll see that this is of course this
is the Apple website but you know really
nice and smoothly just flip through you
know the various things you know it is
really really quite fast and a lot of
that is due to the one gigahertz
dual-core Apple a5 chip but let's not
just view Apple's websites let's go take
a look at a couple other things so this
is stave jailbreak again this is a full
desktop site and as you see here I mean
no time at all super super quick loading
you know that's a really good thing and
that's just you guys another example
opening of the various features so once
we open this up here you'll see that you
know very very similar to how the
previous iPad work you can double tap to
zoom in you know the nine point seven
inch display is plenty big for reading
most websites but obviously you have
that option if we want we can also zoom
in really really far in here so if you
really have bad eyesight but that was
really quite nicely we also do have a
YouTube video
typically these actually play however
this one for some reason is not not
cooperating with me but I trust me guys
that works just fine in fact I was just
watching that video earlier actually
plus refresh and see I bet that work
there we go just a little glitch there
and I have noticed a couple of small
things I've noticed uh just right off
the bat there were a couple of like text
formatting issues but super super minor
not a big deal so let's just show you
guys a YouTube video of course it does
play inside the browser just like on a
desktop so so of course you can you
should play the videos we can also make
them fullscreen
you know what's just fun you get your
standard controls so you know YouTube
videos work now of course since it's the
iPad this is an Apple product this does
not support flash so if you're looking
for you know for example you know lots
and lots of videos
gains that sort of thing that are
flash-based it's not going to work for
you however otherwise it doesn't look
really quite well now of course you do
can pull up the nice size keyboard and
if you want you can just rotate it and
what it's just the same but I prefer to
keep it in landscape mode seems to work
a little so let's just punch out an
address here that we've never gone to ah
well it's not let's do it properly of
course the keyboard I'll get into the
keyboard a little bit later in another
video but suffice to say it's fine for
you know entering text not something I
would want to write anything of any
major length but here's we'll see here
this is actually gonna pull up a mobile
site and I believe we can you know there
let's just pull the desktop site just to
show you guys what this is gonna look
like
um so go you see your loads not super
super fast you know if you have like a
MacBook or something at home the iPad is
still gonna be slower but not it's not
bad at all so you can see here we're
gonna scroll through and again I'll show
you guys that tap DoubleTap and all that
kind of good stuff so anyway guys
that'll be it for my overview of Safari
on the iPad 2 overall very very
impressive super super quick you know if
there's a couple of things like I wish
that have flash support and they're the
slightest little glitches that you know
that you might find here and there but
overall very very solid browser</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
