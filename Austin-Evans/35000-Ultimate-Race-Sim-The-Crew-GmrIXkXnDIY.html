here with a video going over one of the
coolest things I saw at e3 this year
a $35,000 racing simulator while there
were a few race Sims at e3 including a
triple minder set up running four to
five
if the ubisoft booth they were showing
off the crew their new open-world racing
game to demo it they brought in a sim
craft apex 3 racing simulator this is a
full 3d motion sim that is a
surprisingly good job of emulating
driving an actual car while they turn
sensitivity up for the demo the addition
of motion really helps to sell the
experience when you start losing control
of the car you feel it starts sliding
before you see anything on screen which
makes it way easier to make corrections
without smashing your virtual car into a
wall it takes a bit of getting used to
especially with the force feedback wheel
but when you get into it it's an
absolute blast the apex 3 does a good
job of selling the small things too like
the bump when you shift or the jolt when
you stomp on the brakes combine that
with the big monitor surrounding you and
it's easy to get into the experience
alright so here with Sean from sim craft
what do you guys have here at e3 our
hardware that we brought here again is
the apex three pitch rolling y'all is
what we have there we've got the 340
inch monitors they're all 1080p monitors
how do I get my hands on one of these
apex because these are so cool like if I
want to go grab them right now what do I
do besides ask you really nicely for one
you start by asking me really nicely for
one there's no doubt about that you can
get @ww sim craft comm a professional
level solution is the apex product that
you see here at the show what would i
right now uh the system that's over
there they start for the $3.00 at about
35,000 well I don't exactly have an
extra $30,000 hanging around to buy
erase em there's no doubt that the apex
3 is an awesome setup best of all it
runs all of a gaming PC Ubisoft had an
HP workstation running the demo at the
show but you don't need anything all
that special to run the crew on a rig
like this running the apex itself isn't
all that demanding as it hooks straight
into the game to detect motion so as
long as you have a gaming PC that can
handle a few 1080p displays you're good
while I had a ton of fun with the
simulator I also got the chance to try
the crew within
monitor and controller there's a huge
open world in the game that lets you
drive from coast to coast in the United
States albeit with a slightly smaller
than real-life map cities like Las Vegas
are nicely detailed and accurate and the
fast travel makes getting around easy
and seamless the entire idea of the game
is to get together with your friends as
a crew to do missions and races like
taking down another car there's also an
absolutely massive amount of
customization you can do for your cars
I've always been a sucker for this kind
of stuff in racing games and the crew
has probably my favorite customization
tools I've ever used you can modify your
cars for racing on street rally or go
all-out for cross-country demolition the
driving itself is a bit arcade like but
it hits a decent balance in my opinion
with good controls using an Xbox 360
gamepad on the PC you also get things
like an N cockpit view which is a huge
plus for me before e3 I really wasn't
all that excited about the crew but I've
got to say I'm really looking forward to
it now so what do you guys think about
the apex 3 and the crew let me know in
