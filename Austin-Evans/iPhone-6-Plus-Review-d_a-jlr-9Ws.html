here with my review of the iPhone 6 plus
put it side-by-side with the 5s and the
difference in size is almost ridiculous
you're getting a much thinner foam with
a 6 however you do lose the chamfered
edges in favor of a seamless design
between the glass and frame while it's
nice in the hand I actually prefer the
champers on the 5 and 5s it gives you
something to grip it looked and felt
premium instead of having the antenna
built into the frame of the phone
instead there are now plastic antenna
lines which I should look very similar
to what you'll find on the HTC One m8
now personally I don't think this is a
terrible idea
however it definitely looks much better
in my opinion on the space grey version
as opposed to silver or gold the
sleep/wake button has been moved over to
the side of the foam which is definitely
a welcome change considering just how
much bigger the 6 plus is and while I
guess there is a protruding camera lens
it ended up not being as big a deal as I
was afraid of so yes when you set it
down on a table it will wobble just a
little bit if you touch the top however
for the most part it's really not a big
issue and the camera lens seems to be at
least a little bit protected by that
metal ring around it so I wouldn't
really worry too much about it getting
scratched up now don't get me wrong the
6 plus is still a very nice slab of
aluminum and glass however it has lost a
little bit of the specialness of the
previous design just a little bit of a
step backward in my opinion in return
though you have a much much larger
screen measuring in at 5.5 inches big
enough to nearly fit the entire iPhone
5s in it because of this there's no way
of getting around it the 6 plus is a
huge phone
Apple has included a new reachability
mode which brings the top of the screen
down by double tapping the home button
and while I can see it might be useful
for some people it's definitely not the
most elegant solution put it
side-by-side with the samsung galaxy
note 3 and you'll see it's a bit taller
while being both narrower and thinner
and really use it feels about the same
its pocketable and usable on a daily
basis but this is definitely not a phone
you want to use with one hand my friend
gender from your average consumer did a
great video getting people's reactions
to the 6 plus which you guys can check
out in the description but it does
border on too big for a lot of people in
return though you're getting one of the
nicest screens on any phone period the
1080p resolution is just right for a
screen of this size in my opinion and
you're getting great viewing angles and
excellent color reproduction
paired with the iPhone 6 you're getting
a bigger higher resolution screen that
while it's not an enormous difference is
definitely noticeable when you're doing
things like browsing desktop sites just
like when the Retina display first came
out well basically all apps will work on
the 6 plus those that haven't been
updated yet or just being upscale which
definitely looks a little fuzzy compared
to an app that's actually meant to be
running on this 1080p screen system apps
like Safari are fully up and running
with the new screen and they do give you
a split landscape view kind of like an
iPad in a few places however most of the
apps that I use everyday Da'Ville use an
update to support the new screen
speaking of the iPad there's actually a
new landscape mode for the home screen
which while it's a nice option it can be
a bit weird to pull your phone out of
your pocket and have the screen upside
down or sideways inside both the 6 and 6
plus you're looking at an Apple a8 which
sports a 1.4 gigahertz dual-core
processor 1 gigabyte of RAM and a quad
core power VR GPU now this might not
sound like much compared to quad-core
Android phones clocked twice as high
however don't let the specs fool you in
Geekbench the 6 plus beats the note 3
significantly and single-threaded
performance which is key for day-to-day
use and even matches the multi-threaded
score with only half as many cores it's
no slouch in the graphics department
either as it clears a solid lead over
the new Moto X and the Manhattan GFX
bench test put the 6 + &amp;amp; 6 side-by-side
though and it's essentially a tie as
both have identical internals when
benchmarking your gaming after a while
all phones will start to warm up now
usually the phone will start to throttle
back clock speeds slowing things down to
keep the phone from being scalding hot
and burning your fingers the Apple a8 is
supposedly able to avoid throttling so I
decided to put it to the test with the 6
and 6-plus
alongside the 5s and the One m8 the
iPhone 5s measured an it just under 37
degrees Celsius after 10 minutes very
warm to the touch but not uncomfortably
so the One m8 opt out just a bit higher
still not unusable put definitely on the
warmer side the iPhone 6 was a slight
improvement however the 6 plus was
basically cool to the touch except for a
single warm spot on the side it's not a
big deal but it's nice to see the 6 plus
can stay nice and cool without having to
give up any performance
good job Apple and normal use the 6 plus
is incredibly snappy well it's clear
that iOS 8 still has some bugs to be
worked out the you I almost always stays
smooth and respond
it's not noticeably faster than the
already solid iPhone 5s in real-world
use but it easily matches up to phones
like the HTC One m8 one very
disappointing part of the six plus
however is the memory with a powerful
64-bit processor Apple bizarrely chose
to go with just one gigabyte of RAM for
the 5s and they've kept it the same this
year on both the 6 and 6-plus
now if you're just browsing Twitter or
watching a few YouTube videos this isn't
a big deal however all it takes is a
couple tabs in Safari or a few apps open
and multitasking you'll find yourself
constantly having to refresh things now
this is just silly I mean even the
galaxy s3 back in 2012 had 2 gigs of RAM
so why wouldn't the most powerful phones
here 2014 only has one key it's just
completely and totally beyond me like
seriously this is just not cool now
something that is cool is being able to
unlock your phone with your fingerprint
and while touch ID was a great feature
on the 5s it's been improved here it's a
bit faster and most importantly accurate
where I would have to retry my print at
least a couple times a week with the 5s
the 6 plus is only missed my print once
in the hundreds of times I've unlocked
my phone in the last couple weeks while
it's not out yet you'll also be able to
use touch ID with Apple pay soon which
looks seriously impressive another big
upgrade on the iPhone 6 plus is the
camera well it still delivers 8
megapixels like the last three
generations the megapixel count
devleague is the entire story
side-by-side with the already excellent
iPhone 5s there's less noise even in
brightly lit shots which allows the 6 to
hold on to more detail especially in
extremely contrasting situations dynamic
range is slightly improved and Apple's
implementation of HDR still strikes a
good balance between getting more out of
the shadows and highlights without going
completely overboard like on some other
phones One m8 get a nice macro shot and
you can pull off some decent depth of
field one of my favorite ways to get
nice looking images out of a smartphone
there's also a temporary per second
burst mode like on the 5s which you can
get to by holding down the shutter
button for essentially as long as you
want in practice it can be helpful to
make sure that you catch the exact
moment when the action happens now
phone 6 and 6-plus have identical
cameras with one exception the 6 plus
gets optical image stabilization other
phones like the HTC One m7 have used
this to great effect and so does the 6
plus by stabilizing the lens you can get
longer exposures in low-light without
making things too blurry or grainy it is
a very solid job here allowing exposure
to as long as a quarter of a second
while still not losing detail even when
you're shooting handheld an extremely
low light even the stabilization can't
solve everything but the camera does do
a good job of holding on to detail even
when pushed to ISO mm usually one of the
biggest maker break features for me on a
phone is the camera one of my favorite
things is to go out and spend an
afternoon instagramming now this is
actually a big reason why I use the 5s
for as long as I did just because that
camera was so awesome and the 6 plus
takes that up a notch on top of that the
video is not too bad either
as you guys can see the video is also
impressive it's hard to tell how much
the optical stabilization helps here as
the preview window usually doesn't look
too impressive but when you play the
clip back there's definitely some very
serious software stabilization going on
it's hard to argue with for most video
though even walking gets almost entirely
smoothed out which is seriously
impressive for a smartphone there's also
now continuous autofocus and video it's
a big step forward compared to before
where you just didn't have any autofocus
and video and while it does do a good
job of tracking subjects it isn't quite
as smooth at transitioning as I'd like
noise also sometimes creeps into the
video especially in extreme situations
easily one of my favorite features is
the new slow motion the 6 and 6-plus now
shoot in either 120 or 240 frames per
second and really allow you to capture
some awesome stuff take something like
stomping the ground boring at normal
speed right
slow it down though well the six bus
won't be replacing my video gear anytime
soon it actually is the best slow motion
camera that I own and it's more than
good enough for grab me a quick shot
when I'm on the go one new feature on
the 6 and 6-plus are new speakers
interestingly it seems to be slightly
different between devices the 6 gets
louder but lacks bass where the 6 plus
doesn't quite match the loudness but it
does sound a bit more balanced
the six-plus is a step up from the last
gen but it's still no match for the
excellent front-facing speakers on the
HTC One m8 one of my favorite features
of the 6 plus is the battery life our
previous iPhones did pretty decent
considering just how small the batteries
were however with the 6 plus we're
looking at at 2900 milliamp power
battery giving it's a pretty impressive
longevity for me this is absolutely a
killer feature no matter how hard I use
the phone I could never kill it a single
day this alone is enough to make me go
with the 6 plus over the 6 not having to
stress about finding a charger at the
end of a long day is such a big deal
of course one major issue with the 6
plus is bendgate if somehow you missed
it my friend Lou from unbox therapy was
able to completely Bend the iPhone 6
plus by applying pressure behind the
volume buttons several other people have
found slight bends and normal daily use
including Matt Honan from Wired in his
review and while Apple is replacing
these phones it's a bit worrying that
your expensive new phone is so fragile I
recently tested the 6 plus with a case
over on TVs channel and while it wasn't
able to completely protect the phone it
should be more than good enough for
daily use the Apple leather in silicone
cases probably won't add too much
rigidity although the silicone is
surprisingly nice but investing in a
spigen or Otterbox case probably isn't a
bad idea
while bendgate absolutely is a real
issue it's also not severe enough for me
to not want to recommend the iPhone 6
plus sure it won't be the most durable
phone in the world but especially if you
put a case on it it should be just fine
if all things were equal
I think the 4.7 inch iPhone 6 is a much
more manageable phone for everyday use
but there's more to it than that the 6
plus can absolutely replace a small
tablet and the excellent battery life
makes it the easy choice if you need a
phone to last you all day and then some
so what do you guys think is the iPhone
6 plus for you definitely be sure to let
me know in the comments below also if
