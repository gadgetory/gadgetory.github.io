with a water-cooled Intel processor
graphics card that's ready to handle 4k
wrapped up in a dope case from fractal
the Hadron is ready for some serious
gaming the star of the show is intel's
new core i7 6700 k as one of the new
quad-core skylake processors not only is
this one of the fastest CPUs out there
but it also now supports ddr4 memory as
the k-series chip it's also
overclockable which is where the liquid
cooling comes in with a 120 millimeter
radiator the Corsair h-60 is more than
enough to keep things running nice and
cool it's easy to install and fairly
compact the fan just drops right into
the rear vent in the case powering up
graphics is an nvidia gtx 980ti when it
comes to a single GPU card it's hard to
argue with the 980ti
it's rocking six gigabytes of gddr5
memory and a beastly GM 200 GPU not only
does the card look great but it can
handle gaming even at 4k for a
motherboard we've got the ax suits z170a
this is a great looking board that's
packed with features including USB 3.1
and USB C which goes a long way toward
future proofing the PC it's also got a
great vrm for overclocking solid onboard
audio and not only SATA 3 but also SATA
Express and m2 support on the memory
side we've got 16 gigabytes of Corsair
Vengeance ddr4 memory clocked at 26 66
megahertz this is more than fast enough
to handle anything you throw at it
and with 16 gigs it's ready for things
like photo and video editing in addition
to gaming
storage wise we've got the awesome Intel
750 series SSD with 400 go bytes of
capacity it's a big drive but the real
draw are the ridiculous speeds this is
one of the fastest consumer drives you
can get for extra storage we've got a
Western Digital black hard drive with
one terabyte of capacity this is nice to
keep extra files and games that you
don't need ludicrous speed to open
powering the Hadron is a corsair RM 750
with 750 watts of capacity this is more
than enough to handle the build as is
along with future upgrades it's an
efficient 80 plus gold supply that's
modular to keep cable management a bit
neater
housing all of this awesomeness is a
fractal design define s I really like
this case it's space isn't easy to work
in and looks great with a window to show
off the build its impressively quiet and
has great cable management options like
letting you mount hard drives behind
them
bored to keep things nice and clean the
hardware is definitely here but has the
high drama perform when it comes to
grand theft auto 5 we're able to play at
4k on high settings at fifty point nine
frames per second move over to shadow of
Mordor and again at 4k on high we've got
53 FPS and Metro last light Redux things
are still totally playable at 4k with
high settings at 49 frames per second
with enough power to be both a gaming PC
and a streaming and editing rig the
Hadron is a rock-solid build as always
links to everything me will be in the
description of this video also I've got
to give a big shout out to the Intel a
new airgun large site it's one stop for
all kinds of cool content like
interviews with totally random YouTube
people you've probably never heard of
first looks at new products and cool
deals on Intel gear go give up a lot to
try and big thanks to Intel a new egg
for making this video possible anyway
guys thank you so much for watching and
I will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
