on the Xperia Play now this really one
of the biggest parts of the about this
phone is just the fact that does have
the physical controls which is really
nice I mean of course some games like
you know tiny wings Angry Birds that
kind of stuff they were just fine on a
touchscreen however lots and lots of
other games you know that really really
do benefit from having the physical
controls are available on the Xperia
Play so I'm going to do for you guys is
give you a quick demo of some of the
games that you can pick up first one is
going to be Minecraft Pocket Edition now
I'm sure most you guys will know what
minecraft is and this is a kind of a
unique version of Minecraft so it is
kind of like classical you guys have
played Minecraft you'll know what I'm
talking about it's kind of like a
mixture between classic and beta so if I
open up the menu here you can go ahead
and pick through pretty much any the
bricks that are available there's a fair
few not all of them but there are fair
few bricks that you can pick and what
it's all about is just you know kind of
like a condensed version of it so you
can use the virtual d-pad with a little
touch d-pad on the bottom of the screen
to move around use the d-pad to walk you
also have your L&amp;amp;R buttons so l is too
kind of like your like Danzig or
whatever and right it is if I want to
place stuff so I'm gonna place a bunch
of ladders and grief up my world here so
they gave you guys a quick demo now this
was all made by myself you know kind of
just testing out the controls are a
little bit odd they're certainly not
perfect but for a phone I actually found
that I got used to them rather quickly
so you guys can see here it does have a
lot of the features from the standard
minecraft so if for example there's
lighting so if I go ahead and go ahead
and kill that off and you'll see it will
get darker here but there are some
problems for one it runs a little bit
laggy from time to time you know
actually right now it's running pretty
much perfectly however everyone's small
just like on the standard minecraft it
will get a little bit laggy as it's you
know redrawing and a lot kind of stuff
and on top of that the controls well I
do think that they're pretty good
they're not quite perfect it definitely
will take you a little bit to get used
to them but overall I think it's a
pretty solid port of minecraft the next
game I will be showing you is asphalt 6
now unlike minecraft which I believe is
seven or eight dollars this section does
come free with the phone and it's
actually a decent racing game so if you
guys have ever played on other platforms
it is a very similar game but it does
benefit from having the physical
controls so what we'll do is we'll
to the silver league here and just pick
out a race and give you guys a quick
demo of it I it's it's not my favorite
racing game ever but it of course does
come free and it's not too bad to kind
of show off some of the controls on the
Xperia Play so go ahead and get the race
started here the controls are very
similar to pretty much you know any
racing game on you know the PSP or
anything you know you have your Ellen I
mean your d-pad you got your virtual
joysticks if you want to use those it's
pretty simple so skip all this and let's
get into a race the framerate does get a
little bit choppy from time to time but
that's not too bad alright let's widen
now this is a very arcade-style racing
game so you know the power-ups so if I
use the nitrous or whatever they call it
here and you also pick up like money and
some different power-ups that are along
the road so it's not quite a real racing
game which is with my favorite material
so here's some nitrous power-ups some
reason the frame works a little bit low
right now but not a big deal alright so
actually it's kind of funny usually
minecraft runs a little bit choppy and
this runs nice and smooth but it's the
opposite as soon as I start recording
anyway so whoa I right so that was
pretty quick but anyway guys that's a
really quick demo of asphalt 6 on the
Xperia Play another reason why the
Xperia Play is great for gaming is it
allows you to play PlayStation 1 games
now won't let you play all PlayStation 1
games it does come with crash bandicoot
for free and there are just a few just a
small handful that are available that
you can actually purchase however it is
nice to go ahead and be able to play
these so let's go ahead started on crash
bandicoot bandicoot here can you say
that name right so it is pretty much the
exact same as you know you would expect
on the PlayStation 1 and it's a pretty
faithful port of course running on a
phone so again all your buttons are
basically the exact same as you would
expect on PlayStation 1 or a Playstation
2 or whatever so let's go ahead and get
some comment I will just give you guys a
brief bit of warning I'm awful at this
game
I've always been awful at this game
let's say we can jump on these crates
here you guys never play Crash Bandicoot
it's a very interesting game I like I
always kind of liked I thought was
pretty interesting almost like a 3d
version of Mario almost it's not really
but that's that's again it's an awful
way of explaining it but uh I have to
jump and avoid dying in
so see if we can go kill this one fall
in there this is actually probably my
favorite game that's available on the
Xperia Play which makes sense because
this was a pretty awesome game you know
I was always bad at it so it's up here
and again you guys will find that the
performance on this is absolutely just
excellent Ian there's no framerate lag
or anything like this which is I mean as
you would expect this is a 1 gigahertz
phone so to be able to play a
PlayStation 1 game is not gonna be
particularly bad whoo oops hey guys it's
gonna be about it overall there's a lot
to like about the Xperia Play for gaming
it's got some really solid stereo
speakers the screen is nice bright it is
16 by 9 which is my favorite aspect
ratio it really allows you to get a lot
of the game anything that you're really
doing on the screen the controls are
good I wouldn't say they're you know as
good as you know like a playstation
control anything but considering it's on
a phone it is definitely very good and
far away better than you know most
pretty much any kind of touchscreen
controls and on top of that you do have
the touch screen so if you're interested
you can of course swipe through and you
know do whatever you want with that so
guys that's gonna be about it if you
guys are interested in seeing more about
you know some other features of about
the phone other than gaming definitely
be sure to stay tuned to the channel
they'll be doing my full review on the
Xperia Play 4G very soon anyway guys if
you enjoy the video definitely be sure
to leave it a thumbs up and if you're
interested in seeing the review be sure
