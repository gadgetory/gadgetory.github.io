on the updated multiflow so of course in
iOS four there is obviously the Apple
built-in by grounding however why my
favorite background is from before iOS
four on iOS three was multiflow so the
very cool thing it was very similar to
the palm pre the deck of cards we can
just flip through your open apps well
actually the developer is read totally
redid it for iOS for both of I phone
ipod touch as well as the ipad and so
i'm gonna go ahead and give you guys a
full review so before you do me anything
about multiple i do want to give you
guys a quick little tutorial because it
is a little bit confusing you have to
set up properly so once you do have it
go ahead and go into the settings and
there are actually quite a few different
options um you can leave pretty much all
of these alone but activation methods
and that actually brings me to one of
the really cool things about multiflow
is that there are almost unlimited ways
to go ahead and activate it I'm so here
you go you can see you can do it with a
headset button do it by the home button
I have it would do just two short hold
you can shake and shake your device you
can double press the sleep button
another one of my favorites is just kind
of just swipe in like that and open it
up swipe it close I think that's pretty
cool I mean you can icon pinch you can
go ahead and double tap the status bar
literally there are so many different
ways that you can go ahead and activate
multiflow it's really really cool so
let's go ahead and show you so I'm go
ahead and hold a home button and there
we go so you can see your I do have two
tabs up and so let's go ahead and jump
over to here so I'm snooze button check
that forward here there we go and then
you're going to just hold it again and
just go ahead and just back this one out
and just go ahead and bring this right
over here so that's about it there's not
a whole lot to show it's a really simple
application but it works really quite
well I'm i will mention there are a few
random bugs and glitches sometimes the
apps don't want to properly background
but it's not a huge deal generally over
again I'm sure that there will be an
update soon to fixing these quarter
minor issues now this app will cost you
4 99 in cydia or rock so it is a little
bit pricey but it really comes down to
whether or not you like the Apple
backgrounding personally I thought it
was pretty decent till I tried multiflow
and now I'm really really like me and
I've already shut off the standard
multitasking and favorite multiflow on
so it's kind of a personal preference if
you like what you see here go ahead
download it from the I guess that you
can either download from the cydia store
or rock and it is 49 either way anyway
guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
