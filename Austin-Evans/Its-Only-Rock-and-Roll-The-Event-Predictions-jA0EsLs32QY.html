today and here is my final predictions
on what we're about to see if the apple
event next Wednesday there is no
shortage of rumors about what is it to
come but there is also some very solid
evidence back up a lot of the
speculation so I'm going to outline what
I'm thinking is on the way first of all
I'm thinking with my original prediction
from several months ago the ipod touch
will get a camera it's backed up by
polar the most solid rumors you can get
between the possible prototype that was
shown a few weeks ago to the huge number
of cases they're already on the market
for it to just simple fact that it makes
sense it'll be a great addition to an
already potent package basically turning
the itouch into an all-around powerhouse
gadget you'll be able to listen to music
take photos and hopefully video use apps
browse the web and preps if you make
skype calls what's one two hundred
dollar device you replace your
point-and-shoot camera your flip cam
order your mp3 player and your PSP or DS
one thing I'm not intelligible is the
placement of the microphone assuming
that there is going to be I doubt that
it will be placed like the microphone on
the iphone is simply because it would
really start to encroach on the iPhones
turf then that aside though I'm betting
on the itouch staying mostly the same
with the addition of the camera
microphone and upgraded internals such
as processor name from the iphone 3gs
i'll bet on all the flash memory of the
ipod touches to be doubled to 16 32 and
64 gigabytes lastly the prices will
likely go down to 199 299 and 319
dollars for each mile respectively next
is the ipod nano this one is nearly as
easy just as the design of the itouch
was added a couple of months ago so was
the Nana it will also gain a king there
will likely be a low resolution in the
ipod touch camera he'll probably not
record video the screen will get
stretched slightly the by and large it
will remain the same physically it's
possible that it could also gain a 64
gigabyte flash option but it wouldn't be
entirely sure of it
lastly is the ipod classic a lot of
people are quite sure that it's going to
be discontinued but I'm on the fence
rumors have mentioned that it may also
gain a camera but there hasn't been much
of but speculation about that I'll say
that if the classic remains in the
lineup it wouldn't be a stretch to say
they would gain camera I doubt that it
would switch to flash memory myself as
then it's just going to be a less
capable version of the ipod touch but it
is somewhat of a celebrity the apple
tablet which has been driving people mad
with MV forever it seems doesn't look
like it's going to be announced of the
event but I'm somewhat suspicious about
this one it's not wise to just assume
that Apple is going to follow everyone's
idea of this event to a tee so while
it's probably unlikely I wouldn't count
anything out as just I can't believe the
Apple would rather wait a couple of
months missing the holiday season and
release later who knows on the software
side both a new version of itunes and a
new digital album former called cocktail
is expecting and i'm not all that
excited about either these the supposed
screenshots of the next pay tunes show
it keeping the same terrible interface
tad forever it seems in cocktail doesn't
seem to bring anything new except
digital booklets and package deals solo
I'm reserving judgment on these two
until I actually see them so guys those
are my predictions for the new rock and
roll event next Wednesday what do you
guys think any other ideas feel free to
let me know anyway thanks for watching
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
