today I'm here with a review of the
Gameboy pocket the Gameboy pocket was
the second in Nintendo's Game Boy line
so I'm going to go ahead and give you
guys a four of you on it some history as
well as I'm going to compare it to the
Game Boy as well as the Game Boy Color
can give you guys a sense of how far it
came anyway guys let's get this one
started this the latest technology
covering everything
okay guys so let's go ahead just jump
right on into this so the Gameboy pocket
was a pretty cool Gameboy I gotta admit
so the first thing you guys know about
the Gameboy pocket is that it's less of
a new Gameboy like a mountain is more of
like a Game Boy light or a gameboy slam
or whatever so I actually do have two of
these I'll show you the black one again
a minute but this was the green one and
I liked it a lot so as you can see here
it has a nice sized screen it's almost a
two point six inch screen nowadays it's
not that huge but it's pretty big
especially taking into consideration the
other two but of course I'll show you
guys all that later as with all game
boys or at least the original ones have
a and B button start and select and your
d-pad all more fine you know no problems
um the sound actually was not too
amazing on these Gameboy pockets um it
was a little bit quieter but you know
that's not a big deal because it of
course did have a headphone jack as well
as it also had you could plug it in and
run off of AC power instead of you know
your batteries so we turn over outside
there's not a whole lot here except your
volume which you know of course your
volume and then your normal Gameboy link
port so you know you could hook up to
another Gameboy exchange high scores etc
on the front you just have the power
switch and something I thought it's kind
of streaming to note when you flip that
switch it used to be on the old game
boys a little arm would come over and
hold on that little notch but they cut
it took that out for the Gameboy pocket
I guess they realize that people aren't
pulling the games out while they're
playing them now on this side is the
contrast I will show you guys the
contrast in screen a minute safe to say
the Gameboy pocket is much much better
to play with than the original Gameboy
just about in all categories and we flip
it over on the back this is for these
games you know no big deal just you know
slide your games in and then this unlike
the original one it uses two triple iton
now the original Gameboy uses four
double-a so using just a couple triple-a
batteries is pretty good now it's kind
of hard of course you know battery life
is never an exact thing but generally
with the Gameboy pocket you could get
our
around ten hours of battery life which
is pretty good okay guys so as you can
see here we have all three of them we
have the original Gameboy the game with
pocket and then the gameboy color so as
you can see the Gameboy pocket and
gameboy color very very similar I'll
show you guys that in just a second but
I mean as you can see the game would
pocket was much smaller than both of
these including the gameboy color I pick
it up for you guys here you can see that
it lacked that big bulge and of course
this big boulder is because it uses two
doublea's instead of two triple a's as
you can see I mean it's quite a bit
smaller than just about everywhere and
the interesting thing is even though it
still has that sort of black and white
screen as opposed to a nice color screen
on the Game Boy Color this screen right
here was almost 2.6 inches whereas this
one was only about 2.3 you kind of
seated like that
where you really see is when you're
playing it I mean guys it's a big
difference in its really nice I mean if
this only had you know like the nice
coloring of this I mean this would be
perfect but unfortunately it's kind of a
black springs but I'll show you guys
that in a minute
so what we're doing size comparisons
I've just figure might as well show you
guys something here's an iPod Touch
mature you guys know about the size of
this so we pick it up and you guys can
see the screen is much larger it's
actually pretty similar in size it's
it's quite a bit thicker but it's
actually about the right size footprint
maybe just a little bit bigger but still
guys I've got to say the Gameboy pocket
wasn't is not a problem at all put in
your pocket as the name suggests it's
really comfortable I mean even this can
kind of be a little bit bulky to put in
your pocket but like I said guys that
doesn't look like a huge difference but
it is and it's it's pretty good
ok guys let's just show you a little bit
of gameplay on each so go ahead and fire
all them up now they are all playing
mostly the exact same game it's pokemon
red blue and yellow version so they're
all firing up and you won't be able to
see so much from this angle you ball in
a minute once they're loaded and
everything but these three screens are
very very different you can see a little
bit this one is very very green it's
it's just green and black of the colors
so and
it's not very good guys I mean this
screen is literally the only reason I
don't wouldn't like ever wanna play with
this no offense but yeah this one is a
lot better it's bigger than both of
these screens and it's black and white
um but this one I like this one the most
even though it's a little bit smaller it
has color and it also it has color
because it's a gameboy color it also
brings color to some of the older games
such as you know the original Gameboy
it's also a lot clearer let's go ahead
and pull them all in for you guys and
show you what I mean
okay guys so this gives you a really
good representation of what the screen
looks like so as you can see I mean it's
not perfect of course it is black and
white but you can see I might take for
example just look at anything on screen
as soon as you move a guy gets a little
blurry it's not all that bad really guys
I mean I can understand how it can you
know annoy some people but to be honest
it's really not bad especially to play
the original Gameboy like I said guys as
you can see the Gameboy pocket screen is
much better it this screen is extremely
green it's really guys not fun to play
on I mean your course you're gonna just
contrast but really guys it's not good
to play with it all huh while pop one
fight now guys as you can see obviously
you probably would guess but the game
would call it has a much better screen
it's not anywhere near as large and you
can definitely tell that when you're
playing it but those colors are much
better I should want to get in a fight
right now but I see the colors are much
better now of course guys these are
three separate games but they all have
almost identical graphics and they do
look almost just identical on all three
so guys that should really give you a
good sense of what the screens will look
like so guys that's about it for my
Gameboy pocket review as you can see
guys it's a pretty cool system I'm not
gonna lie
it's lightweight it definitely does live
up to its name it fits in your pocket
perfectly it's not a big deal at all
even in today's world where you know an
iPhone's thick the screen is actually
pretty good I got it make as I mean the
screen is really good considering
compared to the original Gameboy two
point six inches might not sound like
very large but it's plenty big enough if
you've ever played gameboy it's a nice
size um and I really like it guys I mean
you know I don't like Triple A that much
it a little bit harder to find but still
guys it's not a big deal um you know
guys there's not a whole lot to not like
about the original Gameboy pocket you
know it's thinner than the gameboy color
I mean it's you know much much thinner
in the original Gameboy
there are nicely sized there's lots of
them around guys I mean if you want one
of these you can find them all over the
place and for really quite cheap so guys
I really don't see a whole lot of reason
why you wouldn't want to go ahead and
get a Gameboy pocket if you're
interested in playing game boy games I
mean they're they're great systems I
really like them a lot and of course
like I said guys they're very very cheap
nowadays I mean that's this goes for
most game boys but especially the
Gameboy pocket and to some extent the
original Gameboy but I think the Gameboy
pockets are probably about the cheapest
ones you can find and in my opinion
they're some of the best now if you're
interested in getting one of these I
will do have a little bit of advice for
you
so as you can see here guys these two
look pretty much identical right well
there's one big difference you see here
it says power and this one does not okay
well guys the difference is this one on
the right is one of the original models
when they first shipped they did not
have any sort of power indicator or
battery indicator that's bad guys I mean
I only bought this one really just to
collect it's not anytime fallen play
Gameboy pocket I play this one I mean
this was just a just have just because I
like collecting this kind of stuff and I
got cheap but guys if you see look
definitely if you're looking for them
obviously look for the standard sort of
abuse and everything of course this one
is a little bit you know it's a little
bit old but it's not too bad but look
for the standard store reviews make sure
it works
make sure the contrast works and there's
no dead scanlines but the one of the
major things you definitely look for is
to see if it has that power if it
doesn't it's one of the original models
and it's not going to be fun to play
with for the main reason that of course
you know you don't really need a light
to show you this on but if the battery
gets low basically it will just cut out
the end it's not fun at all but anyway
guys that's enough for about the Gameboy
pocket I really really liked it you know
it's one of the best game boards around
in my opinion so if you see one guys
don't hesitate to pick them up I mean
usually that are very cheap and they're
a lot of fun I mean hey
who does it look any cooler than playing
in 1990s gameboy I mean come on
anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
