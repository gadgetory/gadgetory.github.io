here with a gaming PC bill for $400 so
this is really aimed at getting you
enough performance for about as cheap as
possible so no you're not gonna be able
to max out Crysis 3 with this however it
should be able to play pretty much any
game you throw ad on lease medium to
high settings to show off the
performance first we have battlefield 3
now this is hardly a brand new game
however it is fairly good-looking and
still very popular and for this we're
going to be able to run it on high
settings at 1080p now we have Crysis 3
which is in my opinion still the
best-looking PC game out right now and
even the most powerful systems how it's
still very very demanding and here we're
going to be able to play it on medium
settings and it actually runs pretty
well BioShock Infinite is another new
game that's come out this year that I
absolutely love not only does it have
great graphics but it also has some
fantastic art style and direction in the
game and for here we are going to be
able to run on medium settings last but
not least we have Metro last light now
this is another very graphically intense
game that some graphics cards which cost
more than this entire computer can't
even max out so here we're going to be
able to run it on normal settings at
1080p without any problems to kick the
build off we're going to be using an AMD
athlon x4 750 K now this is an awesome
budget CPU as is basically an AMD 810
5800 K when you get rid of the
integrated graphics and chop a bunch off
the price so for what we're doing with
this bill we don't need any of that
stuff so it just allows us to save some
money and we're still getting a very
very powerful processor with a quad core
design clocked it up to 4 gigahertz
which is kind of awesome and on top of
that you can also go ahead and feel free
to overclock it even more if you want to
get just a little bit more performance
out of it regardless though that's gonna
run you about $75 for a motherboard
we're going to be using an MSI FM to a
75 M ae-35 so a very long name aside
this is a great choice for this build as
for starters it has pretty much all the
features that we need without having to
pay a lot extra for stuff that we really
aren't going to use so for example it
does support overclocking with our
processor it's not necessary but the
option is there if you want to try to
get a little bit more performance out of
your CPU in addition it also does
support both USB 3 as well as SATA 3 so
that means that you can connect very
fast USB hard drives in addition to
connecting an SSD if you ever decide to
upgrade it's all no problem just slap it
in you're going to be
to go so all that's for about sixty
dollars was gonna make it a fantastic
choice for this build for a graphics
card we're going to be using an XFX
Radeon HD 7770 gigahertz Edition now for
budget bills like this I really do like
this card as it's fairly affordable but
still gonna give you enough performance
to play most games on medium or high
settings like I showed you guys earlier
as well as if you have a little bit of
an older game it should be able to play
a maxed out with no problems so it is
equipped with one gigabyte of gddr5
memory as well as a core clock of one
gigahertz that's the name the gigahertz
Edition and all of this for a hundred
dollars is gonna make it a great fit for
the build for memory we're going to be
using four gigabytes of Corsair
Vengeance ddr3 RAM now this is the same
stuff that are recommending to pretty
much all of my builds it's fast it's
reliable and there's not a whole lot to
complain about now it is only four
gigabytes so it's not gonna be a ton of
memory however for pretty much any games
like normal use and that kind of stuff
it is going to be enough however you can
go ahead and upgrade this to eight
gigabytes of RAM I will have a link to
that in the description as well however
if you just want to stick with the four
byte version you are still going to be
able to get 1600 megahertz rated Ram
plenty fast all for about $40 for a hard
drive we're going to be using a 500 go
by Western Digital caviar blue now
Western Digital makes great hard drives
and the blue series is no exception as
they're going to be fairly reliable and
decently quick definitely not as fast as
an SSD but for normal gaming and that
kind of stuff it's gonna be plenty fast
so it is a 500 gigabyte hard drive so
you do have plenty of capacity for games
and media and all that kind of stuff
however there is also a one terabyte
version if you need a little bit more
storage and of course I will have that
linked in the description as well
however if you do want to go with the
fabric you'll bite version it's gonna
run you about 55 dollars for a case
we're going to be using the NZXT source
210 now a lot of times when you get a
budget case they can be a little bit
iffy the build quality might not be all
that great you might have rough edges
around it might just simply be difficult
to work in
however the source 210 is a fairly
affordable case that actually just
doesn't suck
so I've done several built in this I
liked it quite a bit it is a full sized
ATX enclosure which means you're gonna
have plumbing room for everything that's
going to be putting in the system as
well as additional upgrades in the
future and on top of that it's also
gonna be very nice and easy to work in
all for about $40 for the power supply
we're going to be using a 431 Corsair CX
430 again this is another
one of those parts that I love to go
back to in my budget builds because it's
cheap without actually being bad so
there's definitely a big difference
there and a power supply is basically
the heart of your build so if you get
really kind of cheap out on this you can
definitely have some major issues with
your system so a corsair CX 430 is gonna
be solid for the system plenty of power
to supply to all the components but it's
also an 80 plus bronze certified power
supply which means that's going to be
fairly high quality and i have to worry
about any kind of random explosions in
your computer which are typically not
the best thing and how this is gonna run
you about $40 so there you go
an awesome 400 allah gaming pc build of
course prices are always changing so i
will have links to everything i
mentioned in the description of this
video as well as though there are some
additional upgrades in there so for
example if you want to add a DVD Drive
at Wi-Fi maybe a bigger hard drive or
some more ram i will have all those
links in the description of this video
if you're interested in more be sure to
subscribe to me here on youtube as i do
a new pc build video every single month
anyway guys I will catch you next time
unless you didn't subscribe but you know
otherwise I'll catch you next time
on top of that if you get a game this
may be just a little bit older more than
likely that you can just straight-out
flat-out my a one terabyte version
they've got that as well as I don't
think there's anything higher than that
so she probably stopped talking so it is
equipped with one good bite of gddr5
memory as well it does have a cork core
words words words and you can also if
you got a game this may be just a little
bit older probably just max it out but
it's also fairly affordable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
