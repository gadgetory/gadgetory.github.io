for Duncan 33 303 this is a video on
icon harvester a few things to know
about icon harvester one of them is that
this is paid it is five dollars but five
dollars this is definitely worth the
money so first of all icon harvester is
for winterboard it is a great way to
install themes on to your iPhone or iPod
touch so as you can see you have tons
and tons of themes I mean these are
enough themes to make anybody happy
let's go ahead and check one of them out
and basically the great thing about this
is that is a cydia for themes so here
you go you can check out clear white but
the great thing about this you can
easily just swipe and look at the next
one instead of going back into the menu
so you can look at a few of these icons
here and are very nice the only problems
I've had really for this app is my
connection not working I don't think
this is actually my iphone but I believe
just some of these are a little bit old
on their server so I mean look at this
one it's got tons of icons so i think
i'm going to go ahead and check out this
one so i'm just going to click the
install button and we come up with this
screen and just click install again just
to confirm this is going to save you a
lot of time just in case you actually do
press install okay and bam I mean you
just got that theme and it only took a
few seconds so now the really cool thing
about icon harvester is customization so
here you go you've got to cydia icons
and you can pick which one you like I
like this one a little bit better it has
lines on it so more theme some themes
have a lot more than others this one
seems to not have that many except for
Cydia but once you do customize your
theme all you have to do is go back no
saving or anything so just remember aqua
less and less
head and exit out of the application now
we're going to go ahead and navigate to
winterboard and for those of you
wondering I got the same i'm using is
called suave and I did customize it and
you can just find that in icon harvester
so here you go you've got aqua lost or
this is actually the regular and this
would be the customized version so you
just select both these make sure
customized is on top and just click the
spring button all right now let's just
slide to unlock okay so now you've got a
fully customized theme here we go you
got mail so far i phone messages ipod
and you can always go ahead and open up
an application once you're Board weather
so icon harvester is just a great way to
customize your winterboard theme your
iPhone iPod Touch or iPad even further
than it is so as thank you so much for
