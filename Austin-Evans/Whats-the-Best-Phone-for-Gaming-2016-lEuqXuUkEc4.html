phone for gaming to find out I gathered
a few the latest flagships the Samsung
Galaxy s7 LG g5 iPhone 6s plus and the
Nexus 6p they each have their strengths
the s7 has a beautiful glass and metal
build that's packed with features the g5
has a modular design and dual cameras
the iPhone has a big display with
incredibly well optimized hardware and
the Nexus 6p is running pure stock
Android marshmallow that being said the
6p and the iPhone are a few months older
than the g5 and s7 which means they're
at a slight disadvantage but don't come
the magis yet the three Android devices
do an advantage when it comes to screens
with high resolutions though compared to
the iPhones still sell out 1080p they
all take different approaches to specs -
with the iPhone sporting a dual-core
processor the g5 and s7 sharing a
quad-core chip and the Nexus rocking an
octa-core CPU things aren't quite so
simple when you actually benchmark
things though Geekbench 3 shows the
Apple a9 inside the iPhone is pretty
solid
but the Snapdragon 820 in the g5 and s7
is right up there move over to the
graphics side with GFX bench and the g5
and s7 are the clear winners where the
Nexus falls a fair bit behind one
important thing a benchmark might not
capture is temperature since there are
no fans inside to keep things cool
performance and a phone really relies on
the rest of the chassis for passive
cooling heat is almost always a limiting
factor with a smart phone as it might
technically be possible to run hotter
but companies aren't exactly going to
let you burn your hand on a phone to
test I'm using a thermal camera to not
only see the temps but which parts get
hottest being a big foam made out of
aluminum the Nexus 6p gets only slightly
warm where the plastic coated metal
finish of the g5 performs very similarly
the glass back of the s7 does get fairly
warm while gaming but it's concentrated
by the processor where surprisingly the
iPhone temperatures rise to the point
where it's almost uncomfortably hot all
this is important but the real test is
how these things work in real use The
Walking Dead Michonne is a great example
of a game it's essentially the same
across everything from a phone to a PC
while Telltale's engine is getting a bit
old it still works well Lara Croft go
was a much more laid-back puzzle game
that's fun for a quick blast when you've
got a few minutes where modern combat 5
does its best to be a Call of Duty style
FPS which while it looks great the
touchscreen controls let things down
Minecraft Pocket Edition has been around
for years and it steadily become one of
the most solid versions of the game
where geometry wars 3 is a great mix of
solid controls with bite-sized gameplay
and impressive graphics while most games
are shared across iOS and Android the
iPhone has quite a few exclusives like
badland 2
the Infinity Blade series might be a few
years old at this point but it still
looks fantastic
where Warhammer freeblade takes
advantage of 3d touch to let you zoom in
on enemies depending on how firmly you
press down the big advantage on Android
or emulators older systems like the
Super Nintendo are no problem at all
it's the same story for the PlayStation
1 right out of the box the emulation is
rock-solid
and while the n64 isn't quite as smooth
you can absolutely still get playable
games out of it
so put it all together and what is the
best film for gaming the iPhone has the
best selection of titles but having
emulators is a big advantage for Android
the Nexus is able to run most games but
you're losing out on performance
compared to the g5 it's a solid foam but
the nicer design and compatibility with
gear VR give the edge to the galaxy s7
this time around speaking of I recently
rounded up a list of the 5 best
smartphone light packs so definitely go
check out that video and I will catch
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
