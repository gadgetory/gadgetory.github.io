and green were released in Japan the
original Nintendo Gameboy something to
keep in mind is that in 1996 the game we
were getting old fast indeed it had been
available for nearly seven years at that
point however no one especially the
developer game freaking Nintendo
themselves could have imagined the
impact that these deceptively simple
games would have Pokemon Red and Blue
took the world by storm in late 90s and
it's not hard to see why while certainly
not the best looking games ever even by
gameboy standards the gameplay with so
rock-solid that it didn't even matter in
true RPG fashion you start out on a long
quest to be the best the Pokemon master
to do so you must catch your team of
Pokemon train them up by fighting other
Pokemon trainers take on the eight gem
leaders of the region of Kanto and
finally take on the Elite Four to become
the best trainer in the world the real
strength of these games with the sheer
amount of play and replayability
there are 151 Pokemon available spread
across the two games for you to catch a
fairly deep and engaging story the
ability to battle as well as trade your
Pokemon with friends internet areas to
explore an opportunities to level your
Pokemon up that will allow you to sync
hundreds of hours into the games while
graphically the game certainly isn't
anything impressive for something
released in the late 90s what was
remains to be a high point of the games
is the excellent music the four channels
of sound available on the game would
kick into overdrive while playing red
and blue a true testament to the
excellent job they did who can forget
the music that played when you finally
reach the end of your journey only to be
beaten to the punch by a certain rival
something that really gave the games
added life was the addition of the
trading and battle functionalities while
the link cable port on the Gameboy had
been used in the past red and blue
really stepped it up a notch
by allowing you to not only battle your
friends and cheat I mean fight fairly
with your hacks from YouTube but also
trade this was very unique for the time
and it allowed you to swap Pokemon with
a friend allowing you to not only
bolster your team but also complete your
pokedex in a tradition that started with
red and blue and continues to this very
day erry generation of Pokemon games
consists of not one but two games that
are identical in most ways except for
the variety of Pokemon available in each
that way you had incentive to buy what
basically amounted to the same game
twice to be able to get all the Pokemon
you could or at least find a friend who
had the other version of the game to
trade with the battle system in red and
blue is easy to grasp the basics of yet
very deep and fulfilling if you really
want to get into it when you encounter a
wild pokemon or another trainer the game
launches into a turn-based battle mode
your pokemon is able to use one of the
four available moves that it can learn
as you level up allowing you to entirely
customize what it knows for offensive
defensive or support roles all Pokemon
have weaknesses as well I mean it's
probably not a good idea to take on that
fire type Charizard with your grass type
Venusaur
however that's certainly not the whole
story as you're probably not going to
have much look against that Charizard
with a water type Magikarp either no
matter the type Vantage as a phase
generation of games pokemon black and
white Early's today I found it fitting
to take a look back at the games that
started it all red and blue launched off
a massive franchise of games movies a TV
show
toys probably one of the largest
collection of merchandise I've ever seen
if you've never played the original you
definitely owe it to yourself to take a
look at some of the best games of all
time
