today I'm here with a winterboard theme
review of modern warfare two complete
theme now as you guys probably know I
don't do winterboard theme reviews
pretty much ever this is my very first
one but this one's a pretty cool thing
and it was actually sent to me by one of
my subscribers and by the way you guys
can check him out in the description but
he sent this the the he sent me the
theme so make sure i'll review it so
here i am so yeah guys I'm gonna go
ahead give you guys a full theme review
and take as what I think anyway let's
get this one started
hey guys let's get this one started so
let's begin with the bread and butter
pretty much anything and that is going
to be the icons so well in this theme
you will see that actually has a lot of
icons to see here pretty much almost all
my icons not all of them but a good
amount see here got all I mean cydia
echofon even I droid minis in here which
is pretty cool I'm real racing I mean
engadget obviously all the main ones
like Safari and all that kind of stuff
you scroll through here doesn't have all
of them and you can see there's a couple
of them around here you know such as you
know not even guys have bug god I'm
sorry but it so it does have a really
really good amount of icons um my
problem with it though is that I the
icons don't really kind of have any kind
of style to them as far as I can tell
they're pretty much all pulled off
modern warfare 2 but if you look at them
that quite uh make lieutenant sense so
take for example the weather channel app
there's a pistoleer which I mean don't
get me wrong I'm not bagging or anything
that just kind of seems a bit of an odd
choice same goes for gold icons in
general pretty much all icons they kind
of have this a little bit of a thing I
can see here you know some of the
matchup if you look through here but a
lot of them don't they kind of seem a
little odd you know so I like the icon I
like how many icons it has and some of
them are pretty cool but I would really
like it if that actually kind of they
had a theme so you know they kind of
made just a little bit more sense and
actually kind of came a theme that was
that was to happen I would like to steam
a lot more than but still not bad as is
okay so let's go take a look a little
bit more of a broader look on the theme
so if we scroll over here you can see
here it's got a really nice background
I'm get my finger by the way it's got a
really nice modern warfare 2 background
and also I have five icon dock sup
pretty much cover the whole top as you
see here it's got modern warfare 2 on
the bottom as a doc so if I didn't have
squat some of the icons down there
probably quite a bit better I'll on the
top you guys can see well here
there you guys you guys can see it's
actually a pretty cool it's got it's
kind of like a dark green with a light
line line as light lime line that's good
one but it looks pretty cool although in
some apps like classics for example you
can see that it looks just a little bit
hot there's no big deal and I think it
adds to the look of the theme so
continuing on with that let's take a
look at the UI and well I'm gonna be
frank with you guys there's not a ton of
you I if you're looking for a really
in-depth thing that changes everything
this might not be the one for you that
says it does have a few cool things and
almost all these you can find in the
music application so looking through
here you know it doesn't look too
exciting but let's say we want to play
it song now for example this I don't
have any kind of cover art so you can
see here that the generic default cover
art is replaced with this very cool
modern warfare 2 picture I think that's
great if you look up here it's got a
custom slider and it also has a custom
volume slider as well as some custom
buttons which looked very cool I look
like a little kind of like they were
done in paint but that's not big deal at
all actually looked very very cool I
think and obviously the status bar looks
very nice along with all this so spit
the music application looks very very
cool but unfortunately but back out you
can see that the rest of its pretty
unchanged and you'll find that this is
pretty much the same for practically the
entire application you know none of
these bars are changed now I mean
there's just a couple things you might
find here and there but it's really not
a full you I over to overhaul so you
know that's just constant thing you got
taking consideration now one thing is
that has custom keyboard sounds pretty
cool sound I think and then it also has
custom log sound which is probably one
my favorite sounds ever I think that
that I want that to be an all mine it
also has a custom unlock sound so the
was pretty solid just not quite I'm a
hundred percent you know add a few more
little bits and pieces here and there
but you know that's just not for
everyone i know so no big deal ok
so let's take a look at the lock screen
well okay now let's to close the lock
screen so as you see here it's not
exactly a totally overhauled but still
quite nice you've got the custom slider
you have a nice backdrop looks pretty
cool and then let's go ahead and do it
so I know it will and so if we got to
plug it in you guys will see that it has
a custom battery icon it's a pretty
unique custom battery icon so now let's
go ahead and walk it and come back here
and basically it kind of shows the
prestige so depending on how charge your
battery is will say you know third
prestige for prestige fifth prestige
which on the face of it you know you
first look at go what I don't know what
that means I got it except you know you
might not even exactly know what means
at first but it's pretty cool actually
and I think it adds a nice really
coolness factor thing it just makes it
that cool just trust me on that ok so
now if you guys were still interested in
the theme and go ahead and show you guys
how to get so just come to cydia and
open up search come to the top now
actually not only you know it would have
show you guys this but it's actually
well there's a lot of modern warfare two
teams so let me show you so you just
need to start to type in modern warfare
and of course city lights delight like
this but give it just a second and we're
looking for a modern warfare 2
completing and I should be close enough
so let's scroll through here and it's
going to be yeah right about here modern
warfare 2 complete thing so we'll go
ahead and open it up and then obviously
you can scroll read anything about it or
whatever or you just come up here and
hit install and yeah real simple that's
so that is modern warfare two complete
theme it's pretty cool theme especially
if you like modern warfare 2 it's got a
lot of icons
a pretty decent lookin on a lot of
things um it's just not quite a hundred
percent perfect it's not like an amazing
thing but that said it's not a knock
against whatsoever it's not trying to be
you know a glass Clark or you know a
perfect huge massive thing just trying
to be a really really cool modern
warfare two thing in that case it does a
really good job so yeah guys if you like
modern warfare 2 and you want to make
your iPod or iPhone look pretty cool I'd
say definitely go take a look at it
anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
