iOS 4.3 first of all it increases Safari
performance with the brand new nitro
JavaScript engine which would be great
especially paired with a dual-core
processor in the ipad 2 you also can now
stream media from itunes using home sure
which has definitely been a long time
coming and then the nice improvement is
the addition of an option for iPad users
to choose what you want the ipad
rotation lock to function as either for
muting or locking the orientation which
is certainly something that a lot of
people have been asking for in addition
if you're an iphone 4 owner you'll now
be pleased to know that you will get an
option for the personal hotspot that
launched on the verizon iphone 4 photo
booth for ipad was also shown off of the
event it's largely the same as on the
mac with a variety of filters like to
make real works of art well something
like that anyway you can also manipulate
the video with touch as well making it a
solid addition for the new iPad FaceTime
is of course included as well with the
ipad 2 it works just as you would expect
allowing you to video chat with other
ipad tues iphone 4s ipod touch 4th
generations or max a lot of people
myself absolutely included have been
hoping for imovie on the ipad 2 and
Apple has absolutely delivered I'm movie
is now a universal app and with it you
get a precision editor multitrack audio
editing as well as a very nice view ID
that is reminiscent of an old theater
there are many new themes and sound
effects included as well making the new
version of iMovie look absolutely great
on the new dual core ipad 2 it will be
available March 11 another big app
people have been hoping for is Garage
Band which is now going to be available
on the iPad this version could very well
be better than on the Mac with options
to use the touchscreen to plug the
various instruments including the piano
organ guitar drums and more you can get
all the effects you would expect out of
garage band as well as up to 8 track
recording and mixing just like iMovie
this looks robust enough to use for real
work and she proved very popular only
499 iOS 4.3 will be available March 11th
for the ipad iphone and ipod touch 3rd
and 4th generation overall I'm very
impressed with all the new software
announced today
but what do you think be sure to leave
me your thoughts in the comments below</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
