hardware overview of the iPod Touch 4th
generation um and on the whole of it I
wouldn't spoil right now it's a very
slick very well-built piece of hardware
I mean literally the build quality as
you expect from an Apple device is next
perfect I mean the the scenes here are
just unbelievably small I mean there's
there's no seam here really the home
button it clicks pretty well as I should
a little bit different from previous
home button so it doesn't have a whole
lot of give but again not a big deal and
of course you do have that VGA
front-facing webcam for FaceTime which
does work pretty well do that quality on
that I'm so flipping it over here it is
extremely thin which is something that I
really do like you know obviously
thinner is usually better in devices
like this and iPod Touch 4th generation
is no exception although I will get into
that in a minute there are they did make
a couple sacrifices I'm so on the left
side you have your volume button so
there are actually two separate buttons
as opposed to the single button and the
previous ipod touch so you can go ahead
and click up-and-down pretty you know
pretty standard stuff I'm now looking at
the top of the device actually is a
pretty decent change instead of having a
home but I mean the sleep/wake button
here is now over on the right and as you
can see here well I'm actually not a big
fan of the new home buttons let me just
zoom in a little bit so you guys show
you um looking from the side did you see
here it doesn't really pop out and
especially looking from the front you
can't see at all so before you actually
go ahead and see it there's a lot of
room but really if you're trying to do
like this you can't do it from the front
you really have to put your hand behind
it to click it and I mean it's it's
pretty decent you know I'm go ahead and
click it pretty easily but I just do not
like the positioning of it and it's
really I mean you see the hardly you
know raises at all so not a huge deal
but you know something that I guess they
kind of did have sex by sit for the
thinness so on the right side there is
just nothing and on the back there's
actually a couple of things here and you
had the headphone which goes in no
problem I'm you have the 30-pin
connector and again actually it's
another thing I think that they kind of
as they did have to sacrifice for the to
get it so thin the 30-pin dock connector
does not go in that well that's not the
kind of something I really can't show
you it's just kind of something that
you'll learn but it just doesn't seem to
go in very well as with like the
previous
I pause brinch any other iPod or iPhone
I've ever used 30-pin dock connector in
and out and no problem
hello with this one you do have to put
some pressure behind it and it almost
feels like you know you're gonna break
it so yeah again
not a deal breaker but just these little
tiny tiny things do kind of annoy me a
little bit I guess but yeah not a big
deal over here we do have the speaker uh
it's okay it's easily you know it's easy
to go ahead and cover up which totally
ruins the sound but you're obviously not
going to be using the speaker that much
most time you will go ahead and plug in
a pair of headphones so not a huge deal
so go ahead and flip it over to the back
it still does has this very shiny metal
as you can see here I've had this for
next to no time at all and there are
quite a few really tiny scratches so I
definitely do recommend go ahead and buy
yourself a case when you get your iPod
preferably buy them before or at the
same time so you just you just go ahead
pull it out of the box and drop it
straight into a case so go ahead and
just take a look here there is of course
the 720p camera so it does it does do
decent stills and of course you go ahead
and take a look at the camera and the
still camera as well as the video
quality and the main video but um it's
pretty decent camera and it's actually
very very small which I'm surprised they
actually can pick up any light at all
with that tiny little lens and of course
you do have the microphone so there you
go guys that is pretty much it for the
hardware overview of the iPod Touch 4th
generation I'm very impressed with it I
like the thinness it's very very nice to
hold my hand on there just a couple of
issues namely defected the power button
not a big fan of that whatsoever and
30-pin dock connector is it's a little
tighter than I would like it's just you
know it I just don't like the feeling of
you know it feels like I'm gonna break
you want to try to insert the connector
so and overall though my impressions of
the iPod Touch 4th generation the
hardware wise very very positive
definitely do love the look the feel all
that kind of stuff so I'd have to give
it a thumbs up
