smartphone worth it but are actually
quite a few choices at this price point
and to kick things off we've got the
Alcatel Pixy 3 get into the unboxing you
know find the phone itself the power
adapter a pair of headphones which while
cheaper a nice inclusion the micro USB
cable and the 1780 milliamp hour battery
pop the back off the Pixy 3 and you can
easily install the battery this is also
where you'll find the slots for the some
along with the micro SD card up to 32
gigs next up we've got the blue advance
5.0 get into the box and you'll see the
phone up front along with the power
adapter USB cable and the 18 hundred
million power battery the advance
immediately looks and feels nicer than
the price tag would suggest especially
in this white finish pop the back off
and you'll see the dual SIM slots which
is a nice plus on top of the micro SD
which can handle up to a 64 gig card
last but not least we've got the ZTE
Maven which first glance looks almost
identical to the pixi like the others it
comes with a micro USB cable power
adapter and the removable rear cover the
battery isn't replaceable but you can
install a 32 gig microSD and the SEM
here the real question is what's it like
to use a $60 phone actually not bad all
three have fairly similar specs with a
quad core fairly low powered CPU in
android 5.1 you'll notice the occasional
bit of slowness compared to a flagship
but they're totally usable run a couple
benchmarks such as Geekbench and you'll
see the pixie and maven pull out a small
lead on the CPU side or when you move
over to graphics with 3d mark the Maven
pulled out a fairly substantial lead one
of the most important things to make a
phone feel quick as the stores
performance and inside the PC Mark
storage bench things are close enough to
put all three phones right up there with
$600 flagships just a few years ago even
though the Blu advance is the weakest on
paper you'd be hard-pressed to notice
the difference in real use most games
like bad land run no problem a big part
of that has to do with the screens both
the pixie and maven are sporting 4.5
inch displays with a resolution of 854
by 480 they're about exactly what you
would expect at this price point
neither get very bright and the contrast
is poor as IPS displays color and
viewing angles are passable but neither
are any better than tolerable the blue
advance is a surprising step up here it
has the same fairly low resolution but
on a larger 5-inch display that might
not look impressive on paper but it's
really not bad the color and especially
contrast is a massive improvement over
the others
stand-up - a new high-end display but at
this price point there's absolutely
nothing to complain about that same
praise also carries over to the design
of the phone while the advance is a fair
bit larger than the others you're
getting a phone that could easily pass
as something that's far more expensive
unlike the hard cheap plastic on the
pixi and mavin you get a soft touch fake
leather finish on the blue it's also
quite a bit thinner than the others
which pair with the nicely tapered edges
gives that a much nicer feel in the hand
all three do have fairly unimpressive
rear firing speakers and pretty large
bezels which you'll find on screen
Android keys on the advanced compared to
capacitive keys on the others with all
three running android 5.1 the software
side is pretty even the blue and Pixies
both have very lightly skin build with
minimal additions where the Maven has
seen larger changes including quite a
lot of bloatware the bigger issue is
storage where you'll find eight gigs on
the Maven the pixie in advance only come
with four gigabytes out of the box a
microSD card is a good idea for all of
these but it's basically a necessity
when you've only got four gigabytes to
work with it's a similar story when it
comes to RAM where the Maven and picks
you have a full gigabyte the blue skips
a bit here with 768 Meg's of memory this
complicates things a bit while the Maven
is a better SPECT phone the advanced
Bolton feels like a much more expensive
device get to the cameras and it gets
even more difficult to choose you're
looking at five megapixel cameras with
an LED flash across the board but here
the Maven easily pulls out the wind it's
far sharper than the others it does a
better job with colour and to top it off
it comes with a better camera app that
reminds me a bit of the iOS app it even
gives you a promo to tweak the settings
it's the same story on the video side
the advanced has an advantage on paper
with 1080p video but again I prefer the
look of the 720p video on the Maven
one area where the blue scores an easy
win is with the front-facing camera as a
two megapixel shooter compared to VGA on
the others it looks a lot better and
that advantage is even more noticeable
in video for some reason the pixi Maven
record at a basically unusable 7 frames
per second on the front-facing camera
where the advanced at least keeps up a
decent frame rate in a vacuum the pixie
is a totally usable phone for 60 dollars
but in this company it's simply
outclassed the Maven consistently
delivers a small performance advantage
with more storage and a better rear
camera but the advance looks and feels
massively better has a screen that's
totally respectable and a better selfie
camera that makes it absolutely worth it
cheap phones have come a long way so
which one would you go for let me know
in the comments below and I will catch
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
