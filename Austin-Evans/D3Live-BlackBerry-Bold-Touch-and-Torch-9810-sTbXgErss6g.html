talking about the two brand new leaked
blackberries the blackberry bold touch
in the blackberry torch to now both of
these devices are going to be a pretty
incremental upgrade from the previous
generation blackberries is they both
sport touchscreen displays of course
there's nothing new for the torch that
was going to be the big next new
blackberry I didn't really quite turn
out too well however both of these
devices have pretty big upgrades so I'm
go ahead and talk a little bit about
what we know about them so far so the
first one is going to be the bold touch
which in my opinion is probably going to
be the flagship of the blackberry line
so of course everyone knows and loves
blackberry bold probably you know just
just got a great keyboard pretty much
great across the board however as the
name implies the new bold is going to
have a touchscreen display I now don't
figure it still going to have the same
well it might be a little bit tweaked
but it's going to have still a very very
good this school keyboard but in
addition it's going to have a 2.8 inch
multi-touch display now while 2.8 inches
is definitely on the smaller side
generally touchscreen displays need to
be a little bit bigger for you no room
to do all your multi-touch gestures and
all that kind of good stuff the
blackberry is it's going to be pretty
good I think overall now the screen like
I said it's going to be 2.8 inches so we
have a resolution is 640 by 480 very
high resolution for like I said a pretty
small display but where the real things
are really going to start happening it's
going to have a 1.2 gigahertz Snapdragon
processor in 768 megabytes of RAM so
this means is that Oh at blackberry OS
six point one is going to absolutely
scream on this as well as on the torch
so of course you know blackberry
obviously blackberry tends to be a
little bit of a lightweight operating
system you know not really needing them
the dual core tegra processors not that
kind of stuff so I think well 1.2 kicker
process will be more than not to make
this thing absolutely fly so the ball
touch that looks really quite good and
also let's go ahead and talk loaded
about the torch to so just like the bold
it's going to be a fairly similar small
upgrade it's not going to be anything
major and we'll have a 3.7 inch display
with a resolution of 480 x 800 which is
a nice upgrade but where the most of the
big things that happen with the torch is
that's what these specs I'm a lot of
people kind of complained about the
blackberry torch the original one was
because it just didn't have a whole lot
of powers you know I had a pretty weak
process or matinee
however they definitely did remedy this
with the the torch to with a the same
one point two gigahertz Snapdragon
processor instead hundred 16 megabytes
of RAM so overall I'm really looking
forward to these two I mean I still
think the library really needs the brand
new Q Nick's operating system which of
course they're working on with the
playbook I'll Vinci to come to the
phones but think they definitely really
do need to get that sooner or later
however this you know this update with
The much faster processor speeds and all
that kinda stuff she definitely do a
really good job of keeping everyone
who's fan of blackberries happy ok so if
with the second segment of d3 live I'm
going to be taking live questions from
everyone in the chat as always every
episode d3 live is filmed in front of a
live audience but quite a few people in
here right now and my dog so for there
so we're gonna take a couple of
questions and I just got answered a few
things on how much is a blackberry bold
touch going to be well the thing is with
that is that this is a late rumor um I
would assume two hundred dollars on
contract saying is you know nine option
of all major new phones but we'll have
to wait and see probably next month or
so when they officially now exactly what
the price will be on the blackberry bold
touch do I think it is a little too late
that is a perfect question uh-huh if you
guys have watched my videos before you
know that I'm not a huge fan of
blackberry in general I think that it's
I think basically iOS I know android all
the cut so I think all these operating
systems are really just just just just
hurting blackberry a lot so I think
library I think these these phones are
going to be nice they're going to help
but I really think that blackberry is
not going to really take back off and
really try to to make any positive head
ground headroom whatever the phrase is
but I don't think library is really
going to start growing Deanna and people
are really going to start coming back to
library until they get the nuke UNIX
operating system which of course is what
they're putting on the playbook once
they get that all worked out hopefully
fairly soon i would price expect maybe
next year so that they can get that
worked out anyway guys that's it for
