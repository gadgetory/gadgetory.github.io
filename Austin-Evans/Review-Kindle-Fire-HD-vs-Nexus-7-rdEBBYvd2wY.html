beautiful review of the Amazon Kindle
Fire HD as a major update to the
original fire it looks good on paper but
how is it compared to the Google Nexus 7
taking a look at the hardware of the
Fire HD you'll see it's quite nicely
designed up front you'll find a 7 inch
display with a resolution of 1280 by 800
this is among the best 7 inch screens
I've ever used with great viewing angles
and solid clarity and brightness you'll
also see a 1.3 megapixel camera up front
which is just fine for video calling one
thing a lot of people pointed out my
unboxing is the larger bezel on the
Kindle compared to the Nexus even though
they have identical size screens in real
use I actually appreciate this as it
gives you a comfortable grip no matter
how you hold the tablet flip the Fire HD
around back and you'll see it's coated
in a soft touch rubber with a pair of
stereo speakers it's perfectly
comfortable however I found myself
liking the field the Nexus 7 more with
its golf ball-like texture speaking of
speakers good speaking of speakers
you'll find the Kindle Fires absolutely
no joke for a tablet there's plenty of
volume and when holding in landscape
it's actually enough to give you a bit
of a surround sound fuel these head and
shoulders above the Nexus 7 where the
audio is definitely one of the weaker
points media is where the fire shines if
you have an Amazon Prime membership and
really if you own the Kindle you're
going to want one the sheer amount of
stuff to watch listen and read is
incredible for video you have almost
Netflix levels of shows and movies
available for free with Prime and
there's even more available to buy and
rent the Nexus has the Google Play Store
where you can also buy and rent video
but it's nothing on the Kindle
sango's for books the Kindle ecosystem
is excellent with a huge selection of
books available and if you have Prime
many are free to borrow such as Harry
Potter something new is immersion
reading which for around four dollars
will allow you to buy the audiobook
version of a Kindle book and let you
read along with the narration wandered
through the Midwest picking up work as a
mechanic until at age 19 he joined the
Coast Guard it's not available for all
books but is actually a really cool
feature the Nexus has the Google Play
book store but honestly I just use the
Kindle app for Android which works just
fine - the immersion reading giving away
from media let's talk a bit about the
software the Kindle Fire HD runs Android
4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich but with such an
in-depth skin I don't think it's a
stretch to call it a new OS it's a big
step up from the last Kindle Fire as the
carousel is much smoother and there's
less lag to be found that said it still
strikes me as poorly designed there are
no physical home
back buttons instead they pop up on the
side of the screen the apps themselves
are also oddly laid out most of the time
and the entire experience just feels
unnatural and complicated there are also
the ads it's clear why Amazon sells the
Kindle for so cheap it's nothing short
of a giant advertisement to get you to
buy more stuff lock screen ads home
screen lady content aka ads all the main
apps ways to buy stuff there's even an
offers app which just houses ads to be
fair some of these can be helpful to
find new content but taken as a whole
it's almost too much you can't pay
fifteen dollars to remove the ads but
the design is baked deep into the core
take one look at the Nexus 7 and you'll
be greeted with stock Android 4.1 jelly
bean which is leaps and bounds better
and smoother with the promise of feature
updates as the Kindle Fire really isn't
aimed at the geek crowd like me I won't
go too in depth on the specs but inside
you'll find a dual core processor and
one gigabyte of RAM which is just fine
for even more demanding games where you
will find a big difference between the
Kindle and Nexus is storage space as the
kennel comes with 16 gigabytes for the
same price as the Nexus with 8 gigabytes
the comparison here complicated though a
might scene is actually fairly
straightforward if you're not
particularly tech inclined and want to
tablet this laser focused on delivering
media the Kindle Fire HD just does it
better on the other hand the Nexus gives
you much more freedom and a vastly
better experience in using it if you can
get around the slightly weaker screen
and much more speaker for me the Nexus 7
is flirting with excellence while the
Kindle Fire HD is solid but flawed I
feel it's best for a lot of people but
definitely not for me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
