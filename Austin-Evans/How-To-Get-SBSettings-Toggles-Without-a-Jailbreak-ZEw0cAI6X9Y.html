to enable SB settings like toggles on
your iPhone iPod Touch or iPad now the
real kicker here isn't that you can do
this rather that you can do this with a
non jailbroken device so I have a couple
of them installed here let's go ahead
and just give you as an example go ahead
and open up the network no bring me over
here and now I can turn on and off data
Wi-Fi etc etc it's pretty handy so it's
going to show you guys exactly how you
do this so you need to open up Safari
and I'll have a link in the description
is there's a website here where you
enable them you can all have it all in
the description it's kind of long but
yeah so to do this it's gonna be really
simple once you load up the site you're
gonna see a lot of different toggles
everything from about airplane mode auto
lock FaceTime general there's all kinds
of them here and you can feel free to
pick any of them that you like so I'm
going to go ahead and pick out software
update so go ahead and open it up and
then it will bring us over to the
software update page so that looks great
however what we want to do is come back
over to Safari once we've tried that out
hit this button right here and click Add
to Home screen then give it just a
moment it will say software update we
can name it whatever we want so I'll
just you name it update and click on add
and now you will see that we had that
update on our home screen so all you
need to do is click on it and it will
just bring us right over to the software
update page and of course you can do
this with all kinds of toggles and not
just updates but of course airplane mode
brightness etc etc if you want you can
put them into folder all kinds of stuff
so if you're like me you have an iPhone
4s
you can't jailbreak yet this is a great
way to go you can enable lots of really
simple toggles inside up and over you
know dig through the settings menu and
find exactly what you're looking for hey
