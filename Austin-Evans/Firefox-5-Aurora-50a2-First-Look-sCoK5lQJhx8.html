at Firefox five know what Mozilla aims
to do was Firefox five and indeed all
future versions of Firefox is getting on
a much speedier release cycle so stead
of waiting six months a year for a major
update to Firefox it's going to be very
similar to Google Chrome where you get a
somewhat moderate update every month two
months something like that and the first
thing that you will see with this is the
new version called Aurora
now Aurora is for all intents and
purposes like the dev channel on Google
Chrome you know it's going to be you're
going to get features before everyone
else does but on the other hand it's
certainly going to be bug year and
glitcher so what I do of course this is
version 5.0 this is currently the alpha
- I want to give you guys a little
overview and kind of tell you guys a
little bit about what it what it's all
about the first thing of course there
will be a download I will have a link in
the description you can download the
Aurora version and they'll also have a
beta once they kind of start getting
everything in the pipeline of course
this is just really starting to come out
so this there's no beta just yet but
eventually there will be the Aurora
which will be like the Deb and you'll be
able to do the beta and of course just
download the standard Firefox the
releases that you always do so what I
want to do is give you guys a little
overview about the browser now as you
probably knows from here it's very
similar to Firefox 4 this is the this is
the dev build they're not done by any
means but there are some key
improvements especially in performance I
noticed so I was able to run a few tests
now keep in mind this is not my full
range of tests I didn't have that much
time to do everything but I mean my
quick testing I didn't notice that
Firefox 5 had some pretty significant
performance improvements I was when the
SunSpider benchmark it actually was a
pretty nice jump from Firefox 4 it
actually bested Google Chrome the
current version 10 they non beta or
non-deaf or anything like that so just
the standard version of Chrome is
actually able to be down the SunSpider
benchmark that's pretty impressive and
if you take a look at the difference
between firefox 4 and 5 and keeping in
mind Firefox 5 is not done by any means
it will most likely be even faster once
it finally comes out it's pretty
impressive then moving on to the
Peacekeeper benchmark Google Chrome
pretty much still stomps firefox but
again Firefox 5 does show some pretty
nice improvements over Firefox 4 so
that's most of the I know there are a
couple of smaller things like I'd like
to show you guys let me take a look a
one little P that I always get annoyed
with other browser
since I always use Chrome is that when
you have like a lot of tabs open and you
start to close them well they always
resize so like let's say I want to close
all these while I just start smashing
the close button it just closes but well
as soon as I pull my mouse off they will
resize so that's just a really small
things I noticed with this new and
Firefox 5 certainly not a big deal but
as you can see they're working on little
improvements little you know speed bug
fixes all that kind of good stuff so
anyway guys that's about it for my first
look at Firefox 5 I definitely stay
tuned in to the channel once it gets a
little bit farther along I will do a new
browser test compare it to all the major
browsers and all that kind of stuff and
if you guys are interested you can go
ahead hit the link in the description
and download it for yourself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
