decent smartphone for $50 for this one I
picked up the Microsoft Lumia 635 along
with the second generation Moto e at
this price you shouldn't expect too
crazy unboxing but you do get what you
need out of the box the Lumia has a
micro USB power adapter some paperwork
and the battery move over to the Moto e
and this the same story you have a power
adapter and plenty of manuals for you to
never read the Lumia has a removable
back but it's a little tricky to take
off it's essentially the entire shell
inside you'll find the SIM slot and your
microSD expansion on top of being able
to install the removable battery the
Moto e uses a swappable bezel which is a
lot easier to remove there's no
swappable battery but you do have slots
for a sim and microSD for $50 you
shouldn't expect crazy build quality but
there's not a lot to complain about the
Lumia 635 actually looks a lot like the
iPhone 5c which isn't a bad thing it's
rocking a glossy plastic shell which
might be a fingerprint magnet but it
feels pretty decent there's a surprising
sense of quality everything is nice and
tight and it's noticeably thinner than
the Moto e the E is no slouch though
with a curved bag that fits nicely in
the hand it's a little pudgy but the
ridged bezel gives you a solid grip
personally I prefer the brighter colors
and thinner build of the Lumia but
neither phone really feels its price get
to the screens and it's a slightly
different story
both have 4.5 inch screens and here the
Moto e has the edge with a higher res
960p display compared to 854 on the
Lumia the e edges of the Lumia and
brightness and color as well but in real
use they're totally fine compared to a
flagship things look a little rough but
I've seen far worse screens on budget
devices the Moto e has a front speaker
where the Lumia has a rear speaker and
they're not bad at all the 635 gets
surprisingly loud although with such a
tiny opening for the speaker it's a
little too easy to accidentally block
your music one of the biggest
differences is in software
the Lumia runs Windows Phone where the
Moto e uses Android while a Windows
Phone hasn't progressed as quickly as
iOS and Android it still has a lot going
for it even on fairly low-end hardware
it's downright snappy things like live
tiles are unique and features like
multitasking and notifications have come
a long way
the biggest downside are apps you'll
find the basics like Twitter Instagram
and Spotify but generally the quality
can't match Android most apps aren't
updated as often and a lot just aren't
here at all the biggest of which being
Google Apps
there are workarounds but unless you're
deep in microsoft's ecosystem the app
selection is going to be a problem on
the flip side the Moto e runs android
5.1 where app support is definitely not
an issue motorola takes a light touch to
android giving you an ear stock build
with a few useful additions like active
display to show notifications if you've
ever used an android phone you should be
right at home something simple like
having an official youtube app makes a
big difference the Moto e also has
slightly better specs with a newer
quad-core Snapdragon 410 versus 400 and
double the memory but to be fair Windows
Phone seems to be perfectly happy to run
on the lower specs each phone has a
gigabytes of storage but once everything
is set up you're looking at roughly
three gigs left for anything besides the
most basic use you'll definitely want to
pick up a microSD card both phones are
rocking five megapixel cameras and this
is one of the biggest places where the
budget is noticeable you can pull off a
decent shot with each camera but you'll
want to have plenty of light with such
tiny sensors color and dynamic range
just can't hold up to higher end
smartphones video is the same story they
both max out at 720p which is fine for a
quick clip to share but won't be useful
for much else there are some cool
features like a double twist to open the
camera on the Moto e and the
surprisingly solid Lumia camera app
which is so much better than the
Motorola camera one thing the Moto G
does have going for it though is a
front-facing camera it might not be a
great one but it at least exists as much
as I like the Lumia the biggest issue is
app support if you can live with Windows
Phone it's hard to argue with the 635
but for most people the Moto e is a
safer bet regardless of which way you go
though it's incredibly impressive at
just how good $50 smartphones can be
