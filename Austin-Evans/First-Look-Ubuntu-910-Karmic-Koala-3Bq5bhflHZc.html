I'm here with my first look at some of
the new features in ubuntu 9.10 it as
karmic koala this latest release of
ubuntu gives a lot of new features but
it's really mostly a polishing release
it includes faster boot times new themes
some smaller things they'll make your
life a little just a little bit easier
if you just use ubuntu everyday anyway
let's go ahead get this one started okay
it's definitely the probably biggest
thing in new and chronic wall is
definitely got to be the bun to software
center before there was something
similar but the problem was it was not
it was kind of a little janky it wasn't
really easy to use sometimes it could be
a little difficult and be honest it once
you found something it was difficult to
really know what you were looking at
besides just a small little bit of
saying this does this and that was it
but now with ubuntu software center it
looks much nicer you stood at all
everything that you had before but now
you can see the easier install it easier
actually get a little bit of info let me
show you guys a little bit what I'm
talking about so let's just go anywhere
we can go in to see games then you can
go and you have this nice menu and just
scroll through any of the games and as
before almost all of these are free and
open source it's it's it's a great place
and you know you can actually see them
so let's look around here look at this
one so you look at it and once it loads
you'll see here that you have the little
icon you have a little uh basically
explains about it and it's very simple
you see the it says open sores and
basically says it's free and you can
install it or go to the website and so
let's go back and just pick a random i
won pick another one and you see here
they'll do the same thing now if you see
here on the right you see this little
spinning wheel almost always there's a
screenshot but for sure Marie
it's not working right now I don't know
it might just be glitch because it did
come out yesterday I don't know what but
that's not loading right now but it
usually does show you a screenshot over
there so you know it should be probably
working by the time you see this and of
course there's tons of different things
just like before I mean go into like
internet and I mean you know you can see
mean different browsers you can see
different mean like BitTorrent clients I
mean they all kinds of different stuff
and likewise any new city system tools
graphics I mean all kinds of stuff also
now you have installed software as well
so that all the software that you have
already installed you really easily just
look through so let's just take a look
here and see what we want fine let's
just grab a movie player so if to just
open it up and it will basically show
you what you have liked it said you see
the whole description anything and then
you can scroll down and you can go ahead
and remove it or go to the website so
it's simple to go ahead and remove
software as well so yeah that's sooo
bunting Software Center I've only been
using it for just a little while now but
so far it looks much better it's really
nicely polished very simple to get
around and it's a really nice addition
to bunt too so let's go ahead and go to
the next new thing that new bun to
karmic koala another new feature and
karmic koala has got to be themes now of
course there's always been themes you
could always add them everything there
are a couple new themes and they do look
quite nice you see here what i'm using
now is dust and it's very very sleek
looking themes like if you see and open
up something random like this see it
runs really nicely and smooth but it
also looks good a lot of people kind of
bomb on ubuntu for you know because it
usually has the human theme it's very
brown and not very exciting her as just
looks kind of bland but there are some
already nice pre-built themes and of
course you can customize the themes very
simply and you can also install your own
themes or download them so you know it
really it seems like a small thing to
just include a couple more but some of
these are really nice looking and it
does really kind of Linux is kind of
fallen and you know Mac OS 10 and
windows 7 they've all really stepped up
the eye candy game so it's nice to see
that you bunt to is also trying to keep
up with it and doing a pretty decent job
21 I met the new feature in Ubuntu is
got to be firefox 3.5 now it might seem
a little odd considering that obviously
firefox 3.5 has been out for quite a
while now but for Ubuntu it has actually
not you've basically been stuck with
either three point 0 or you could
manually install 3.5 it was a little
difficult and definitely was not
automatic at all but now firefox 3.5 is
currently installed automatically you
don't have to do anything and it is 3.5
point 3 I will note which is one off
from the latest but I'm sure this has
just come out today or rather yesterday
I'm sure it will be updated that makes a
couple days but of course it's firefox
3.5 it's much faster than original three
runs really nicely and smoothly and of
course it's totally feature complete
compared to the mac and the Windows
version so no worries there now ubuntu
9.10 release it brings some definitely
some new features such as the software
center and some and some smaller
behind-the-scenes things that definitely
do seem to speed it up a bit one of the
larger add-ons has definitely been the
speed up in boot times and shut down
times in my informal testing I've saved
between five and ten seconds on the boot
up time and at least five seconds in the
shutdown time now that's not saying much
in the realm of you know the latest OS
is saying oh yeah we'll turn on in 10
seconds and this and that but it's nice
to see that I really working towards
really getting it to boot up and shut
down very quickly and you can definitely
notice that you know there are a lot of
different smaller tweaks like i said but
to be honest this latest release is not
huge improvement isn't that there's
nothing revolutionary it's mostly just a
smaller just features here a little bit
here a little bit there really just to
keep it moving and if you consider it
that way they did a really good job you
know if you're using ubuntu 9.04 you
won't really notice a massive difference
she'll those small things here and there
but it's us a really polished looking
release it really works well and of
course the next release is probably
going to be much larger with a more
substantial update and this is kind of
just a bridge between then and now so of
course is you have never tried ubuntu or
linux in general obviously you know i
recommend it it's free it doesn't take a
really it doesn't take hardly anything
at all to install it you can use
virtualbox or you can dual boot or you
can just install it straight up on any
computer you like it is free and open
source so you can you're totally free to
edit and do whatever you want with it
and it's really just a good release and
I definitely recommend you know guys go
check this out anyway thanks for
