comparing three of the top android
smartphones so i'm going to be taking a
look at the motorola droid to the
mytouch 3g slide 14 mobile as well as
the samsung epic 4g for sprint now the
main thing that all these phones have in
common is they all have a full slide out
keyboard of course though if you're not
interested in keyboard and you just fine
with just a normal touchscreen there are
several other great options such as the
droid x first verizon as well as the HTC
evo 4g for sprint and i'm just going to
be focusing on these three phones today
the original motorola droid was arguably
the phone the kicked off android and so
finally they have gotten around to
releasing a successor the motorola droid
2 so those little is just released this
morning or rather announced this morning
and it will be available tomorrow the
11th for presale and i should be
available in stores on the 12th so guys
i am going to be totally honest this is
the most licked bone I've ever seen in
my entire life they linked in every way
we know more the press release that you
have all the information that was late
to me it was ridiculous and those
questions roll you guys through all the
specs so it has a 3.7 inch screen just
like on the original droid it comes
pre-loaded with android 2.2 froyo it has
a 5 megapixel camera with just DVD
quality videos let's not have definition
but it's pretty decent it also has eight
gigabytes of internal storage as well as
an included a gigabyte microSD card I've
got to admit guys the original droid was
one of my favorite phones and the droid
two looks to just improve upon that now
the problem is though is it really
doesn't push the envelope sure it's got
a better keyboard it's got Wi-Fi hotspot
support and a couple of smallest things
like that including a faster processor
however it is still off for all intents
and purposes very similar to the
original droid there was no front-facing
camera there's no high-definition camera
on the back I'm you know there's no 4g
support anything like that basically it
is just they've improved quite these
things on the original droid that's it
look guys if you're interested like I
said the release date will be tomorrow
in the next day and it will be available
for two hundred dollars on verizon okay
so let's play move on to Sprint's entry
which is the samsung epic 4g as the epic
name suggests is actually a really quite
powerful phone with the one gigahertz
bird processor actually this processor
is very very similar to what you would
find in the iphone 4 as well as the ipad
it was really going to be one of the
fastest available in any phone or even
tablets now some of the specs include it
has a 4 inch Super AMOLED display and
this 4 inch display is really fantastic
the colors are really vibrant it is one
of the best displays on any fun
available it also comes with a custom
build of android 2.1 which is pretty
nice it has a 5-megapixel rear-facing
camera with 720p high-definition video
which looks really great in addition it
also has a vga front-facing web camera
now unfortunately we don't have any sort
of information about this price or the
when we will actually be able to get
those epic 4g okay so let's go ahead and
move on to the mytouch 3g slide from
tmobile so this photo we actually is not
really in the same categories of
previous two it's more of a mid-range
phone where those are very very high
range however if you're on t-mobile it's
definitely the best thing you can get
with Android the keyboards so some of
the specs included is a three point four
inch touchscreen it runs android 2.1
with a very custom t mobile interface it
has it's somewhat similar to HTC sense
but has some extra things onto it in
addition it has a 5 megapixel camera
like I said guys this phone is not going
to be you know the slightest specs
doesn't have the highest power process
or anything like that it over if you're
looking for an Android phone with a
keyboard on tmobile this is definitely
your best bet if you're interested is
already available today for one hundred
eighty dollars on to your contract okay
so let's just sum up all the phones we
just talked about so the motorola droid
2 is a really pretty competent device is
not going to be a huge upgrade if you
already have an original droid there's
probably not a huge region reason to
upgrade you know it's got almost the
exact same everything I mean the screens
the same size the camera is pretty much
the same the keyboard somewhat improved
but basically you mean it's very very
similar phone however if you are looking
for a phone with keyboard on especially
on verizon it's going to be hard to pass
up on the other hand with t-mobile you
can go ahead and get that mytouch 3g
slide which is a pretty decent phone if
you don't have to have the book most
cutting-edge phone never it's not going
to be the fastest but still only get the
job that no problem hello Burt if it was
my pick I would definitely go with the
set
epic 4g it's pretty much got the best of
all worlds it's got the same really nice
slide out keyboard is on the drawing on
the mytouch 3g slide it also has that
fantastic 4 inch Super AMOLED display
the really fast 1 gigahertz humming
board hummingbird core as well as a
front facing camera high-definition
video and a quarter support for Sprint's
4G network so really of course while we
haven't seen is actually not fully out
they probably will be announcing in the
next couple weeks maybe a month or so as
long as it's not really all that much
expensive and generally sprint actually
tends to be cheaper than most other
carriers I think it's definitely going
to be a win anyway guys thanks for
