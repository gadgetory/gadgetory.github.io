here with the new 2014
Booya as this little guy aren't
despondent on your TV take a look around
and you'll see not much has changed on
the surface the Ouya is still small
enough to fit in the palm of your hand
and it's got a simple nice-looking
design it's entirely made of plastic
which might not quite match the feel of
an Xbox or Playstation but then again
it's not trying to match the prices
either this refresh model is sporting an
all new black color scheme with a
light-up Booya logo on top to serve as
the power button around back or all the
ports you might need including power n
Ethernet micro USB HDMI for connecting
your TV and a full size USB 2.0 port for
connecting an external drive inside the
new UI is sporting 16 gigs of storage a
nice improvement over the eight gigs in
the last model the specs themselves are
still decent if nothing spectacular
powering the console is a quad-core
NVIDIA Tegra 3 clocked at 1.6 gigahertz
one gigabyte of RAM along with the
standard stuff like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
if that sounds familiar that's probably
because the Lea has similar specs to
devices like the HTC One X as well as
the original Nexus 7 now since it's
based on Android that's not really an
issue however typically don't expect any
kind of insane graphics added this
little guy it does have a fan which
occasionally spins up but it's not bad
it's still quieter than a typical
console what feels very similar to a
console is the controller which got a
lot of criticism when the Ouya first
came out this latest version tweaks a
lot of subtle things that add up to be a
pretty decent game pad at first the
shape of the controller feels bizarre
and not all that comfortable but it's
something I got used to quickly the
stakes are nice and tight as well not
quite perfect but they're weighted
nicely and have good motion the d-pad is
also solid
however the triggers and shoulder
buttons still feel a bit cheap it's
powered by a pair of double-a batteries
that are hidden inside the grips which
while it works it's a bit of a pain to
deal with
fire up the Ouya and you'll see the UI
has evolved in the last year or so since
the first console started shipping play
is where your games are housed and it
works fine however once you start
getting a few things installed it can
get cluttered quickly there's a decent
selection of games but a huge chunk are
directly from the Play Store which is
hardly the best play
the world for triple-a gaming there are
a few legitimately fun games like bomb
squad which has you fighting off waves
of enemies on a platform along with dub
Wars which is a twin stick shooter that
syncs your weapons up with the music
these are great ways of showing off with
the Ouya is capable of but they're few
and far between there still aren't any
killer apps for the micro console just
yet on the flipside a lot of games like
shooters that I can never quite get
behind with touch controls work really
nicely once you have a physical
controller Shadowgun is probably the
best example of the graphical horsepower
inside the Ouya it looks and sounds
great the biggest draw for a lot of
people though are going to be the
emulators just like an Android phone you
can load up classic games from both
systems including the Nintendo 64 game
boy bands NES and more performance isn't
a major issue with most of the games I
tried and the good d-pad on the
controller was a huge helping games like
pokemon emerald occasionally I ran into
a couple minor issues but for the most
part I can see using the Ouya purely as
an emulator something they've really
tried to hype with the Ouya is that all
games are free to try if not outright
free and while that definitely sounds
good on paper it's not quite that simple
when you first register your account you
have to give them either a credit card
or a prepaid Lea card that's not too
uncommon but when you're playing a free
game sometimes you'll run into a nagging
you to buy the full version since it has
your card it's as simple as clicking the
wrong button and you've just bought the
full game for the most part the
interface is pretty polished but every
once in a while you'll see a standard
Android menu pop up which just looks out
of place or if you need to jump into the
settings you'll see it's entirely
unchanged from what you would find on
your phone at $129 the new Lea has seen
important upgrades on both the software
and hardware side for emulators and a
few Android games it's nice same thing
if you want an XBMC box but for the most
part the Ouya just isn't quite a
full-fledged console just yet what do
you guys think though would you pick up
a new Lea let me know in the comments
below anyway thank you guys so much for
watching and I will catch you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
