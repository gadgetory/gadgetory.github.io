episode of v3 live so today we're going
to be talking about the playstation
phone
now if you've read either tech blogs or
news or anything like that you'll know
that a lot has been said recently about
the new upcoming PlayStation phone and
of course it's like a little back
however recently we've actually had some
video of it some actual hands-on of it
and it does look pretty good
however there are a few things that I
think I'd like to talk about that I
think that it could be pretty
interesting to you guys because a lot of
people was thinking it's gonna be a
Playstation phone one I think that's
stretching it just a little bit but
we'll get into that in just a second I'm
so over it of course
Sony Ericsson the mobile division of
Sony who makes cell phones and smart
phones and a lot kind of stuff will be
making this PlayStation phone now they
generally aren't well they make pretty
decent phones a lot of the times the
phones aren't you know the best you know
a lot of times you they're a little
outdated the firmware updates like
examples some of them are just now I'm
getting the old 2.1 version of Android
so it kind of tells you that they're a
little bit behind the curve but it's not
really to say anything about this
upcoming phone so the code name is the
Sony Ericsson z1 also nominee a
Playstation phone but some of the really
interesting things about it is that it
seems like a normal Android phone on the
surface you know you have a nice screen
about four inches or so Gio is pretty
nice however it does have slide-out do
not ski board rather but an actual
button so it's somewhat similar to an
over large PSP go now the really the
cool thing about this that I like is
that it's actually going to have all the
physical buttons that you would need now
if anyone has ever played a game on an
iPhone or an Android phone or even a
Windows Windows Phone could attest to
the fact that touchscreen controls for
some games such as you know Angry Birds
and stuff like that it works fine
however a lot of more in-depth games
such as first-person shooters anything
that you wouldn't need to touch the
screen use and maybe I can log sticks
it's just not fun it's just it's just
it's just not any good at all so that
fact they're actually going to add
physical buttons shoulder buttons a
d-pad all the kind of good stuff that
you expect although maybe the analog
sticks but we'll get
minute it's going to be a huge huge help
I think it would be so much nicer
because that's one of the major things
in my opinion that's really helping you
know people why people still buying PSPs
and DSS I'm buying staying alone game
consoles it's just because they actually
have physical buttons and actually have
games that are while they're obviously
going to be more expensive you know if
you buy a mad nor something for the PSP
it's gonna be more expensive than mad
for the iPhone whoever you're generally
going to get a better quality experience
with physical buttons and your better
controls and sometimes better gameplay
that that's not always the case however
that is a major part of it so I think
that Sony Ericsson has a really really
great opportunity with this phone I
think with the physical control and with
a standalone marketplace so a lot of
people have said that you know that
there's going to be maybe like a
PlayStation Network sort of interface
maybe they might be an add-on to the
standard Android Market now personally I
don't know how they're going to do it
but it doesn't matter so much as long as
it's actually being done so obviously
they're going to have a lot of games
simply for these PlayStation phone I
would expect a lot of the ports from you
know other consoles such as Brett's the
DES and the PSP but more than likely
mostly from Android and especially from
the iPhone now this also should run
because it's obvious got a touchscreen
and should have accelerometer all the
things you expect it should run standard
Android games as well however the really
meat and potatoes of this is going to be
these specific PlayStation games that
are made for it so because the
developers cash to go ahead and make
their games for the physical controls
and know that they're gonna run very
nicely on this single piece of hardware
not you know 50 different Android phones
that were developing for one piece of
hardware then the game should be a lot
higher quality perhaps bit more
expensive however I do think it will be
worth it but in addition to that they
also hopefully we'll also have
PlayStation 1 games and this is not
confirmed this is just what a lot of
people are speculating about that
whatever it would definitely make sense
in my opinion if they went ahead and
poured it over sub PlayStation 1 games
now they obviously you already do this
on the PlayStation 3 over I think will
be great to go ahead and be able to play
you know grinch for this mo and you know
all the great great PlayStation 1 games
on your phone with actual
real controls so that's one really cool
thing I think the between the standard
Android games should be able to play
hopefully PlayStation 1
perhaps PSP although I don't 100% know
if they're actually going to go ahead
and allow you to download some PSP games
even if they do I think they'll under
the lesson from the PSP go as far as new
making me charge you know the full price
for a download game that takes forever
there's a lot of problems with PSP go
and that I'm sure that you I should be
able to play PSP games on it however I
do think that you will be able to play
some decent games and of course all the
standard Android ones as well now that's
of course not even to mention the major
part of it which is it is going to be a
foam so everything if you've ever had an
Android phone everything you do with
that you're still going to be able to do
make phone calls browse the web check
your email play apps that are other than
games so it really should be a fantastic
overall device now one of my major
problems with it is going to be the
price and they of course the
availability but most of the privacy now
some people have been kind of
speculating there might be a little bit
more expensive there you know because if
especially if they put PlayStation
branding on it so instead is calling it
you know the Sony Ericsson's the one
actually called the Sony PlayStation
phone like they put the PlayStation
branding on there then I would expect
that they would rise the price because
obviously you look at it and go well why
would I buy this phone I can buy out
PlayStation phone and you don't get
gains and all that kind of stuff so if
they really need to be careful in my
opinion of not over pricing the phone if
they you know they do they put it way
above what you might find another
Android or an iPhone 4 I think they
could run into some trouble whatever as
long as they pay attention they're not
going to go crazy they keep it at a
reasonable price and they do release you
know my fair few carriers you know I'm
someone I'm one carry whatever that also
could hurt but as long as I do it right
and you know keep a decent price and
keep it on a fair few carriers I think
you could do very well okay so for the
second segment of d3 live we I'll be
taking live questions from everyone so
of course as always with every episode
of d3 live it's all filmed in front
blogtv
and we have a lot of people in here
today someone just answer some questions
do I think the CPU will be higher than 1
gigahertz that's a good question um
we've heard I've heard some conflicting
reports some people say they're just
going to be a standard Snapdragon
processor which is what you would find
in several other phones
the HTC EVO however some other people
will say that suggested that there might
be a more powerful processor they'll be
able to crunch faster and better-looking
games personally I don't know I'm kind
of in the middle I wouldn't be surprised
if it goes either way I definitely could
see them you know cheeping out a little
bit and the Snapdragon processor is
still pretty good it is a 1 gigahertz
processor really quite fast and what for
a would be surprised as I said it's been
a little bit more money and get
something that's actually capable of
even better graphics with it the PSB 2
will have Android that is such a great
question um I really have been back and
forth about this for a while ever since
we've started hearing about it and
especially with the PlayStation phone I
think it would definitely make sense
well the PSP the standard interface in
the operating system on the original PSP
there's nothing wrong with that I
definitely do like the look of it and
everything however if they were able to
just make that like a skin on top of
Android I think there'll be the best of
both worlds
I think juvie I have actually able on
your PSP go ahead and download apps
although some stuff would be fantastic
whether they're going to do that or
maybe they might just do something
different and just add app support to
the standard operating system I don't
know but if it does write Android I
would be very very happy how much will
the playstation phone be and when will
it come out as far as the price I talked
about this a little bit earlier I don't
know hopefully about what you would buy
a standard smartphone so in the u.s. on
contract most of them are about $200 and
whatever it might go a little over so
it's kind of hard to say that I would
expect it to be you know outrageously
expensive or anything like that I'm as
far as Wentz coming out a lot of people
have been pointing towards February of
next year
seems to make sense because we've been
seeing it a lot lately you know all
kinds of leaks and screenshots on so it
definitely doesn't make sense that an
announcement an early state would be
fairly soon do they think that will make
two different versions one for the US
and one of the rest of the world um
possibly
generally I would think not obviously
every country has a slightly tweaked
modeling out with this different
language with the little small little
differences and everything but overall I
wouldn't be surprised that you just go
ahead and just put out one standard one
um though they might make one for GSM
networks and one for sea
ma I don't know about that but on the
most part I would think it would be
mostly the same no matter where you are
PlayStation phone or iPhone 4 you know
that's a that's a tough question um
however by the time the playstation
phone comes out I think it will be more
of PlayStation 4 vs. iPhone 5
however while they're both smartphones
while I both will be you know competing
I think they're going to have slightly
different focuses I think the iPhone 4
is a great general phone I think it's
one of the best available right now and
you know it does great for a lot of
people and while obviously there are a
lot of great games in the App Store
I think the playstation phone will
absolutely really capitalize on the
gaming aspect you're going to not going
to buy the playstation phone because it
runs Android I'm gonna buy it because it
looks nice you can buy it to play games
and so if you're going to be that person
who really wants to play games that
PlayStation phone is absolutely the way
you want to go want to go
games are that important to you I really
don't see any reason why you want buy
that but the thumb belong to a single
carrier I hope not it's absolutely
possible we've seen all the time
iPhone 4 actually is a great example all
the iPhones have been loved to AT&amp;amp;T in
the United States however I hope that
HMG Volvo's Drive HTT but something
Garrick someone go ahead and get for at
least a couple of carriers maybe not
every character everywhere that would be
a little bit difficult to pull off but I
would hope that they would at least get
more than one carrier and of course I
would really hope that they actually
allow you to go ahead and buy an
unlocked version which would be more
expensive but if it especially because
just a standard GSM or stand of CDMA if
you collected by unlocked on that would
be great as well well I by the PS phone
possibly a little bit on the fence I'm
really going to wait and see exactly
what all it's about you know what a lot
of what we've been hearing is true I
think I probably will
you know if actually has PlayStation 1
games you know the controls were all the
kind of stuff that you might expect I
probably will get it however there are a
few questions that I'm still waiting for
so it's kind of a little bit too early
to say yeah I'm gonna go spend all kinds
of money on this are the videos of it
legit yeah I do think so we've seen
pictures of it before we've seen leads
people have talked about it now of
course if you
seen any of that on the internet you've
seen that there are several videos of it
available yeah I do believe that's legit
it looks exactly what we've seen before
everything matches up and it's pretty
good-looking in its own right so yeah I
definitely would believe that it is
going to be legit
how much would games cost that is a huge
huge huge factor into it now of course
they are going to be gem loadable gang
sure it doesn't appear to have any sort
of slot for a UMD or anything like that
perhaps a memory card but if you will be
downloadable games and I really think
after PS that PlayStation with a and
that's the PSP go it hasn't done that
well because people like to actually
know you have physical disks I think
that it's good that somebody's really
learned that they can't price the games
too high you know it's one thing to go
ahead and go download Angry Birds for a
dollar or you spend a little bit of
money to go ahead get in a game however
for full feature titles and you know
when they try to charge the same price
as you would expect on you know anything
else I just don't think that would fly I
think that they've got actually prices
low competitive with what you would find
in the App Store or the Android Market I
think that's going to be the real key to
success probably $10 will be this cat on
most gang that they go be the standard
thing is that's not too expensive you
know it's not going to be totally break
the bank but it's also not going to be
charging you full price for a game that
you may or might not want who games be
downloadable yeah like I just said I
absolutely would expect that they would
be downloadable I wouldn't be surprised
if it doesn't have a micro SD card slot
for expansion however I would definitely
expect that it just you know you just
download it same way you would through
the App Store or through the game Gordon
market okay so that's it for this week's
