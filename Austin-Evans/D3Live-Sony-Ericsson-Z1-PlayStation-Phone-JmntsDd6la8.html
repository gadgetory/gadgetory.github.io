episode of bee three live so today we're
going to be talking about the
playstation phone now if you've read
either tech blogs or news or anything
like that you'll know a lot has been
said recently about the new upcoming
playstation phone and of course it's
looked a little back however recently
we've actually had some video of its
mental hands-on of it and it does look
pretty good however the roof these
things that i think i'd like to talk
about that thing that it could be pretty
interesting to you guys because a lot of
people was thinking it's going to be a
playstation phone one I think that's
stretching it just a little bit but
we'll get into that just a second so to
go over it of course sony ericsson the
mobile division of sony who makes cell
phones and smartphones and a lot kind of
stuff will be making this playstation
phone now they generally aren't well
they make pretty decent phones a lot of
times the phones aren't you know the
best you know a lot of times you there a
loud day especially with you know the
firmware updates like example some of
them are just now getting the old 2.1
version of android so it kind of tells
you that they're a little bit behind the
curve but it's not really to say
anything about this upcoming phone so
the code name is the sony ericsson z1
also nominee a playstation phone but
some of the really interesting things
about it is that it seems like a normal
android phone on the surface you know
you have a nice screen about four inches
or so Luxio is pretty nice however it
does have slide out in annex keyboard
rather but actual button so it's
somewhat similar to an overlarge PSP go
now that's really the cool thing about
this that i like is that it's actually
going to have all the physical buttons
that you would need now if anyone has
ever played a game on an iPhone or an
Android phone or even a Windows Windows
Phone could attest to the fact that
touchscreen controls for some games such
as you know angry birds and stuff like
that it works fine however a lot of more
in-depth games such as first-person
shooters anything that you wouldn't need
to touch the screen use maybe I can't
log sticks it's just not fun it's just
it's just it's just not any good at all
so that fact they're actually going to
add physical buttons shoulder buttons a
d-pad all the kind of good stuff that
you would expect although maybe not
analog sticks but we'll get
minute it's going to be a huge huge help
I think it would be so much nicer
because that's one of the major things
in my opinion that's really helping you
know people why people still buying psps
and dss i'm buying staying alone game
consoles it's just because they actually
have physical buttons and actually have
games that are while they're obviously
going to be more expensive you know if
you buy a mad nor something for the PSP
it's going to be more expensive than mad
for the iphone however your general
going to give a better quality
experience with physical buttons and
your better controls and sometimes
better gameplay that that's not always
the case however that is a major part of
it so I think that Sony Ericsson has a
really really great opportunity with
this phone I think with the physical
control and with a state alone
marketplace so a lot of people have said
that you know that there's going to be
maybe like a PlayStation Network sort of
interface maybe they might be an add-on
to the standard android market now
personally I don't know how they're
going to do it but it doesn't matter so
much as long as it's actually being done
so obviously they're going to have a lot
of games simply for these playstation
phone i would expect a lot of the ports
from you know other consoles such as
Brett's the DS and the PSP but more than
likely mostly from Android and
especially from the iphone now this also
should run because it's August got a
touch screen should have accelerometer
all the things you expect it should run
standard android games as well however
the really meat and potatoes of this is
going to be the specific PlayStation
games that are made for it so because
the developers guys should go ahead and
make their games for the physical
controls and know that they're going to
run very nicely on the single piece of
hardware not you know 50 different
android phones are developing for one
piece of hardware then the game should
be a lot higher quality pratts bit more
expensive however I do think it will be
worth it in addition to that they also
hopefully we'll also have playstation 1
games I know this is not confirmed this
is just what a lot of people are
speculating about it over it would
definitely make sense in my opinion if
they went ahead and pour it over sub
PlayStation 1 games now they obviously
you already do this on the PlayStation 3
remember I think will be great to go
ahead and be able to play you know Gran
Turismo and you're all the great great
PlayStation 1 games on your phone with
actual
real controls so that's one really cool
thing I think that between the standard
android games should be able to play
hopefully playstation 1 perhaps PSP
although i don't one hundred percent
know if they're actually going to go
ahead and allow you to download some PSP
games even if they do i think they'll
under the lesson from the PSP go as far
as you make me charge you know the full
price for a download game that takes
forever there's there's a lot of
problems with PSP go and that i'm sure
that you i should be able to play PSP
games on it however I do think that you
will be able to play some decent games
and of course all the standard Android
ones as well now that's of course not
even to mention the major part of it
which is it is going to be a phone so
everything if you've ever had an android
phone everything you do with that you're
still going to be able to do make phone
calls browse the web check your email
play apps that are other than games so
it really should be a fantastic overall
device now one of my major problems with
it is going to be the price and they of
course the availability but most of the
price now some people have been kind of
speculating there might be a little bit
more expensive they know because if
especially if they put PlayStation
branding on it so instead is calling out
you know the sony ericsson's the one
actually called the sony playstation
phone they put the PlayStation branding
on there then I would expect that they
would rise the price because obviously
you look at it and go well why would I
buy this phone i can buy out playstation
phone and you don't get gains and all
that kind of stuff so if they really
need to be careful in my opinion of not
over pricing the phone if they you know
they do they put it way above what you
might find another Android or an iPhone
4 I think they could run into some
trouble whatever as long as they pay
attention they're not going to go crazy
they keep it at a reasonable price and
they do release it on a fair few
carriers you know it's only on one carry
whatever that also could hurt but as
long as I do it right and you know keep
a decent price and keep it on a fair few
carries I think it could do very well ok
so for the second segment of d3 live we
are we taking live questions from
everyone so of course as always with
every episode of e3 live all filmed in
front blog TV and we have a lot of
people in here today so I'm going to
just answer some questions do I think
the CPU will be higher than 1 gigahertz
that's a good question um we've heard it
offered some conflicting reports some
people say they're just going to be a
standard snapdragon processor which is
what you would find in several other
phone
the HTC evo however some other people
said that suggested that there might be
a more powerful processor they'll be
able to crunch faster and better looking
games personally I don't know I'm kind
of in the middle I wouldn't be surprised
if it goes either way I definitely can
see them you know cheaping out a little
bit and the Snapdragon processor is
still pretty good it is a 1 gigahertz
processor really quite fast however
would be surprised they said it's been a
little bit more money and get something
that's actually capable of even better
graphics doing that the PSP two will
have android that is such a great
question i really have been back and
forth about this for a while ever since
we started hearing bad especially with
the playstation phone i think it would
definitely make sense while the PSP the
standard interface in the operating
system on the original PSP there's
nothing wrong that I definitely do like
the look of it and everything however if
they were able to just make that like a
skin on top of Android I think there
will be the best of both worlds I think
to be actually able on your PSP go ahead
and download apps all the tough stuff
would be fantastic whether they're going
to do that or maybe they might just do
something different and just add app
support to the standard operating system
I don't know but if it does right
Android I would be very very happy how
much will the playstation phone be and
when will it come out as far as the
price i talked about this a little bit
earlier I don't know hopefully about
what you would buy a state or smartphone
so in the US on contract most of them
are about two hundred dollars however it
might go a little over so it's kinda
hard to say that I would expect it to be
you know outrageously expensive or
anything like that as far as when's
coming out a lot of people have been
pointing towards februari up next year
seems to make sense because we've been
seeing it a lot lately you know all
kinds of leaks and screenshots on so it
definitely doesn't make sense that an an
announcement an early state would be
fairly soon they think that would make
two different versions one for the US
and one of the rest of the world
possibly generally I would think not
obviously every country has a slightly
tweaked modeling out with this different
language with the little small
differences everything but overall I
wouldn't be surprised that you should go
ahead just put out one standard one on
though they might make one for gsm
networks and one for cdma i don't know
about that but on the most part i would
think would be
mostly the same no matter where you are
playstation phone or iphone 4 um you
know that's a that's a tough question um
however by the time the playstation
phone comes out i think it will be more
of playstation from vs iphone 5 however
while they're both smartphones and while
i both will be you know competing i
think they're going to have slightly
different focuses I think the iphone 4
is a great general phone I think it's
one of the best available right now and
you know it does great for a lot of
people and while obviously there are a
lot of great games in the app store I
think the playstation phone will
absolutely really capitalize on the
gaming aspect you're going to not going
to buy the playstation phone because it
runs android goodbye because it looks
nice you can buy it to play games and so
if you're going to be that person who
really wants to play games the
playstation phone is absolutely the way
or what I'm going to want to go games
are that important to you I really don't
see any reason why you want by that well
the thumb be logged to a single carrier
I hope not it's absolutely possible
we've seen all the time iphone 4
actually is a great example all the
iphones have been love to AT&amp;amp;T in the
united states however i hope that HEA
will both rather HTT but sunday ericsson
will go ahead and get it for at least a
couple of carriers maybe not every
character everywhere that would be a
little bit difficult to pull off but i
would hope that they would least get
more than one carrier and of course i
would really hope that they actually
allow you to go ahead and buy an
unlocked version which would be more
expensive but if it especially was just
a standard gsm or cdma if you collected
by unlocked on that would be great as
well well I by the PS phone possibly i'm
a little bit on the fence i'm really
going to wait and see exactly what all
it's about you know what a lot of what
we've been hearing is true i think i
probably will you know if actually has
playstation 1 games you know the
controls work all the kind of stuff that
you know i expect i probably will get it
however there are a few questions that
still waiting for so it's kind of a
little bit too early to say yeah I'm
gonna go spin up all kinds of money on
this are the videos of it legit yeah I
do think so we've seen pictures of it
before we've seen leagues people have
talked about it now of course we've seen
any of that on the internet
saying that there are several videos of
it available yeah I do believe that's
legit it looks exactly what we've seen
before everything matches up and it's
pretty good looking at its own right so
yeah I definitely would believe that it
is going to be legit how much would
games cost that is a huge huge huge
factor into it now of course they are
going to be downloadable gang sure it
doesn't appear to have any sort of slot
for a UMD or anything like that perhaps
memory card but if you will be
downloadable games I really think after
psf PlayStation with a and that's the
PSP go it hasn't done that well because
people like to actually know you have
physical disks I think that it's good
that somebody's really learned that they
can't price the games too high you know
it's one thing to go ahead and go
download angry birds for a dollar or you
spend a little bit of money go ahead get
in a game however for full feature
titles and you know when they try to
charge the same price as you would
expect on you know anything else I just
don't think that would fly I think that
they've gotta keep prices low
competitive with what you would bind in
the App Store the android market I think
that's going to be the real key to
success probably ten dollars with a cat
on most games i think there will be the
standard thing is that's not too
expensive you know it's not going to be
totally break the bank but it's also not
going to be charging you full price for
a game that you may or might not want
will games be downloadable yeah like I
just said I absolutely would expect they
will be downloadable I wouldn't be
surprised if it does have a micro SD
card slot for expansion however I would
definitely expect that it just you know
you just download it same way you have
through the app store or through the
game Gordon market okay so that's it for
