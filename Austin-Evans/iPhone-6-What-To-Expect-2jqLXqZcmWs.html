here the video going over everything you
need to know about the iPhone 6
I recently spent some time out in LA
taking a look at mock-ups of the iPhone
6
along with the new sapphire display if
these leaks are true then come September
we're going to be looking at the biggest
iPhone ever take a look at the current
iPhone 5s and we've got a squared off
build that hasn't changed that much
since the iPhone 4 all the way back in
2010 for the new design Apple has taken
a lot of inspiration from the iPod Touch
with a smooth tapered edge that has a
very nice feel in the hand something
that's really impressive
is just how thin the phone is I hardly
thought the 5s felt chunky but the six
is even better this first mock-up is
also sporting a much larger display at
4.7 inches bringing it right in line
with other phones like the Moto X and
Nexus 5 not only will it get bigger but
Apple will also likely bump the
resolution to 1704 by 960 just short of
1080p but still more than detailed
enough to be a big improvement over the
current iPhone however that's not the
only thing that's going to be new with
the iPhone 6 screen right now Apple uses
sapphire glass for the home button and
camera lens on the 5s however my friend
marques Brownlee got his hands on the
full sapphire crystal display for the
iPhone 6 first thing I did was look
through it and look how clear it was
which was pretty cool I'm not sure if
the real glass is that clear too
but I took a knife to it I took some
keys to it and and then I bent it under
my own foot under my own power I tried
as hard as I could to shatter it which
was probably a bad idea if I actually
shattered it and probably hurt a lot but
yeah I tried to bend it quite a bit
and that is where the first video ended
so of course we had to find out how much
abuse the screen could actually take so
with the help of Joe Rogan we put it to
the test and you guys can find that
video in the link in the description
it's safe to say though the screen is
going to be a lot tougher than on your
current phone there are also a lot of
rumors that there will be an even bigger
5.5 inch iPhone 6
based on the mock-up it's very similar
to the 4.7 inch model however we might
not be seeing it quite as soon as you
would expect they milked it 3.5 for
longer than they should have they milk
the four for longer than they should
have why are they not going to put a 4.7
out milk that this year and all of a
sudden 2015 comes here's the latest and
greatest 5.5 I think there's a sweet
spot to be had I've talked about this in
previous videos
and the 4.7 for me is really that's not
that's the the sweet spot as far as I'm
concerned I still like a smaller display
the Moto X has a 4.7 inch display love
the way that that size is in the hand
right now it seems like the 5.5 inch
iPhone 6 will be at least a few months
behind the 4.7 inch version but besides
the screen size what's the difference
one of the advantages the bigger display
is more space for a larger battery many
of the rumors are suggesting that the
4.7 inch iPhone 6 will have an eighteen
hundred and ten million power battery a
bit bigger than the current 5s but a lot
smaller than which you might be able to
find in the 5.5 inch version the bigger
battery for the 4.7 inch model is a nice
improvement but since it's powering a
bigger display the difference isn't that
big of a deal what could help battery
life a lot though is the new Apple a8
the a7 system-on-a-chip from the current
iPhone is seriously impressive so for
the next generation Apple likely will
focus on improving battery life with a
new 20 nanometer process while pushing
more on the graphics side for
performance unfortunately one thing that
could be a problem is the iPhone 6
camera odds are we'll see some minor
improvements but if the mock-ups are
correct the lens will also protrude from
the back of the phone Apple did the same
thing with the iPod Touch and while
throwing a case on it should fix the
problem having a lens poking out at the
back of the phone all the time is a
pretty major problem to me so what do
you guys think about the iPhone 6 are
you excited for the 4.7 inch the 5.5
inch version you just cut a cure at all
definitely be sure to let me know in the
comments below
also don't forget to check out all the
other videos that we did on the iPhone 6
so we shot the display with a freaking
arrow so if you guys want to check that
out and see the behind the scenes all
the fun stuff that we did this weekend
the link will be in the description of
this video so check out all the videos
and enjoy the extreme consumer
durability testing because you know
scratch tests drop tests yeah but
shooting with an arrow something I do
with my phones all the time anyway guys
thank you so much for watching and I
will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
