the video showing off windows late
running on a macbook air this setup is a
2011 MacBook Air 11 inch running Windows
8 inside VirtualBox windows 8 is the
first real version of Windows that's
meant to be run on everything from a
tablet to a desktop and the Metro UI is
a great example of this the large high
contrast tiles are made to be touched
just as easily as you could open them
with a mouse or trackpad gestures also
play a large part in the US including
swiping the lockscreen up or swiping
with two fingers to scroll through the
Metro UI and both of these work great
with the air in fact windows 8 really
seems to be made for if not a
touchscreen then at least a nicely sized
multi-touch trackpad a lot of what seems
perfect for swipe is slow and clunky for
a mouse to click and drag the air also
works well with the multitasking in
Windows 8 by meeting the minimum 1366 by
768 resolution necessary to have
multiple metro and classic elements on
screen at once focusing a bit more on
the OS there's a lot to talk about
for starters even inside VirtualBox the
responsiveness really is impressive with
very little of the occasional lag you'll
find in earlier versions of Windows the
SSD in the air no doubt helps here but
windows 8 has the same hardware
specifications from windows 7 and
actually uses less resources not bad
considering that's running both the
classic and Metro UIs at the same time
even with an ultra low voltage core i5
processor and 4 gigabytes of RAM the air
does a good job of flying through both
windows 8 as well as Lion with only
minimal amounts of lag they're to be
expected when you're using a virtualized
OS while it definitely takes some mental
exercise to remember which gestures work
with which OS everything works
surprisingly well overall if you're
curious about Windows 8 I absolutely
recommend giving it a shot
