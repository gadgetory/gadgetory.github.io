worth it the unboxing experience is just
like any other iPhone pop open the box
and you'll find the SE itself along with
the Apple earpods lightning cable for
charging and syncing along with the five
watt power adapter first things first
this looks just like the nearly four
year old iPhone 5 this isn't necessarily
a bad thing the metal and glass build
has held up well over the last few years
well I can't exactly congratulate Apple
on recycling an old design there's not
what I would change today the chamfered
I just feel good in the hand I feel like
I've got a solid grip unlike the 6 and
6s which have always felt a little
slippery the same goes for the glass of
metal back it's just a nicer look than
the plastic antenna lines on the newer
iPhone yes he also lacks a camera hump
which not only looks cleaner but keeps
it from rocking when laid flat on a
table
it's a classic design that fits in just
fine in 2016 one thing that does feel
out of place these days though is a four
inch screen this is absolutely a
preference thing but as someone who's
been using bigger phones for the last
few years it takes some getting used to
to go back to a smaller phone there are
advantages like being able to easily use
the su with one hand and if you're
coming from a 5s or 5c this will be an
easy upgrade but I feel like you've got
to be committed to wanting a small phone
the keyboard is downright tiny though
and you end up doing a lot more
scrolling there's just less on screen
compared to most phones out there it's
especially noticeable when it comes to
video paired with the mediocre speaker
it can't touch the experience of using a
higher-end phone the display itself is
fine but nothing special these days it's
unchanged from the 5s making it sharp
enough but it's not in the same league
is samsung's latest AMOLED displays
don't get me wrong having a solid option
for a 4-inch phone is nice but I think
for most people something closer to a
five-inch screen is the ideal home size
well it might look like an iPhone 5 on
the outside it's all to date on the
inside it's rocking the same Apple a9 as
the iPhone 6s hit with 2 gigabytes of
memory on paper it's nothing crazy
compared to newer phones or even the
iPhone 5s but in real world use it's one
of the fastest phones out there the a9
is no slouch and when paired with the
small screen it absolutely flies this
might be a small phone but there's
nothing small about the performance zing
it works well for gaming too although
the display size does mean you've got
less room to work with when it comes to
benchmarks it's basically identical to
the iPhone 6s the biggest difference is
in the graphics side where the low
resolution screen gives it a slight edge
while iOS 9.3 is essentially the same as
it is on the iPhone 5 and 5s there are
some new features for the SE one of the
biggest upgrade
is the addition of a poppy well it's
still in everywhere it's become a
legitimately useful feature from you
over the last year so it's also locking
the upgrade LTE and Wi-Fi which is a
small but appreciated change you're not
getting a perfect replacement for the
success however while you'll find the
touch ID fingerprint sensor onboard it's
the older version which is a bit slower
than what you'll find on the newest
phones there's also no 3d touch on the
SE this is a somewhat useful feature on
the 6s that gives you a
pressure-sensitive display to let you
pull up shortcuts and apps preview
content before opening it and most
useful for me turn the keyboard into a
small try pad with a cursor only some
have to take advantage of this though so
it's not a huge loss and others like
live photos just replace the 3d touch
with a long press what is share with the
latest iPhones is the 12 megapixel
camera you're working with a slightly
smaller aperture but you'd be
hard-pressed to tell the difference it's
a rock-solid performer that you can
trust to get good results in most
conditions it does like the optical
image stabilization of the 6s plus but
it's not a huge problem while the galaxy
s7 camera is a step up over the iPhone
right now there's really not much to
complain about with the SE the same
holds true for video you're going to
record up to 4k and not only does it
look nice but Apple does a good job of
tuning the digital stabilization
something that's lacking in most other
smart phones that shoot 4k it also has
solid slow motion options with AP video
at 120 frames and 720 240 FPS I prefer
the cleaner look of the 1080p video but
it's all usable one thing that
definitely wasn't upgraded is the
front-facing camera 720p video from the
SE is not too impressive with 1.2
megapixels it's fine but it really can't
hold up with newer iPhones much less the
best Android phones you will find the
retina flash that measures the light and
flashes the screen which actually does
work reasonably well but this is one of
the clearest downsides to the lower
price of the SE and that price is a big
selling point if $400 it's significantly
cheaper than the $650 success when you
consider that that works out to about
$13 a month it's a pretty strong sell
you're only going to find 16 gigabytes
of storage on the base model however to
upgrade it'll run you an extra $100 to
make the jump to 64 gigs which is
probably a smart move unless you heavily
rely on cloud services battery life is
also surprisingly solid thanks to that
smaller screen it's actually a bit
better than the success and should last
you through a full day of use if you
prefer a smaller phone the iPhone se is
one of the best options out there and as
a budget iPhone you're not giving up
much although you do need to be
committed to a smaller size so what do
you guys think about the iPhone se let
