something just a little bit different so
last week I took a day off I left
everyone the office with one simple
mission to get a back to school PC so
I'm curious what did you guys actually
do Austin wants us to build a
back-to-school PC for around $750 which
he gave us way more of a budget than
Halloween what do students want in a
computer in general I mean obviously
productivity so it needs to run Google
Docs right also it has to run for at
night okay
yeah so it has to it has the game do you
want a game on it yeah oh yeah you have
to
yeah ideally you have this all-in-one
thing where it has the power of a
desktop but in the portability of a
laptop so we're here Micra Center let's
go find some PC parts with a world of
potential components ahead of us things
were looking up that is until we were
met with our first set back of the video
okay so we just came back from Micro
Center we couldn't film in the store but
that doesn't matter because we're here
now look at this smorgasbord of computer
parts we got a core i3 the one of the
kitchen ones yeah we have a really cheap
MSI motherboard but most importantly the
power supply we made sure that we got
one that was much better buy much better
I mean much cheaper at not $14.99 this
is this is not the real price we
actually paid $13.99 look if you're a
student you're not really in a position
to be picky right $14 power supply
that's what you get we got other
computer parts obviously to make this
but we decided we wanted to make this a
portable setup so instead we got this
really awesome Mickey Mouse backpack
yeah so I'd use it
the blessing disguise about us using a
bag is not only saving money on a case
we won't have to deal with things like
you know lining up io or you know
screwing in the power supply or or the
motherboard to the standoff you just
ready to go so also as I found out you
have never built a PC ring before I have
not well if you're working here you
better learn how to make one so go for
of zero on the PC simulator and so began
Matt's initiation process and I gotta
hand it to him he did a pretty good job
so for an SSD we went with the
professional the young professional
assisting solid state a whopping $24.99
for 120 gig storage really can't beat it
if you're a student next step was to see
how the motherboard would even fit into
our backpack so much room for activity
with that out of the way the next step
was to see if our build would even turn
on but we may have had a slight
oversight in our plan our LED hard drive
power switch there is one big benefit to
a case is it has a power button the
funny thing is we don't that wrench in
our plan didn't stop Wes and his actual
wrench from jumping the board to boot
now that our pc powered on it was time
to assemble the rest of the kit
including some of the on-the-fly
modifications to our soft shell yeah so
we can actually screw it right in - at
least there oh and down there - yeah no
that'll work with a bit more cardboard
zip ties and velcro to hold the
remaining bits in place it was finally
done we're in the set don't worry it's
fine it's fine I don't think we're good
we're good okay
Oh can why is there power supply sting
outs at the side of a backpack not only
is it a power supply but it is in fact
an 80 plus no it's not that is a lie
that looks like a $12 Diablo tech power
supply yeah it's actually detect yes
okay that's cardboard um I think you
mean our chassis what's with all the
cables and stuff so you're meant to like
it so this is an all-in-one kit if you
want the power of a desktop you have it
is this more powerful than a laptop
what's inside here so it looks like an
MIT X in my case ITEX board it is
powered by a Gen core I I promise you
this is this is better than you probably
would ever imagined it's the word batter
is not coming them up okay okay look we
bought this way through it's literally
an all-in-one PC setup so this piece of
velcro right here is to hold our okay
that's clever
that's what yeah wait what's this that
is our power button so fun fact about
this something that a backpack doesn't
have that a case does is appalling it's
a power button so you wait this actually
wired to the motherboard it is you is
this looks like something you shouldn't
take to school right
like if a teacher saw this you're
getting like straight to detention or
expelled this looks very suspicious I
think that you can you look at the
cabling you look at that this is the
cooling solution
yeah it's hose it velcroed it's velcroed
in yeah so so it the bag drops up and
together with the velcro leaning a
little bit so it's leaning a little bit
it's it might not be the most stable
thing so my next question yeah this is a
gaming PC yes so you know how laptops
these days have Thunderbolt ports
there's no thunder bolt on this yeah no
I know that we may or may not have
gotten
yes wait hold on so what do you how are
you plugging in though you just you plug
the graphics card it it is in fact a gtx
1050 TI and it is bus powered with a
cable that you can plug into you know I
mean look can I ask how much this whole
setup costs we are under budget
okay how much was that seven hundred and
fifty dollars and so how much under
budget are you seven hundred and forty
dollars oh look at that so you should
put like a $10 bill in here know you've
got a core i3 yes its 8th gen so you're
just gonna have a reasonable amount of
power you've got a 1050 GI which is not
a bad graphics card wait where's the
drive you have an SSD oh it's it's it's
very unburied in there don't worry it's
it may or may not be store-brand but
it's fine you know you could have gone
to four gigs of ram and got a better
power supply right no no no no the best
part about this - right you can actually
just put it on the bag ah yes so you
always can game on the go there you go
you guys did some really cool stuff here
like for real like this is actually
pretty impressive I mean no one should
ever do this but it's cool things you
could say about like half of our videos
don't do this
but it's cool right right oh Italy oh
hey we're spinning yeah look it's led to
its red hey so much louder that's gonna
be so far everything is actually working
pretty well yeah but the real test is
gonna be you can't play for tonight I
just realized I have to play on this
this you know shoulder buttons and and
it's I've got two shoulder buttons then
wait wait wait this isn't even this it
has wh I'm not doing this why not look
at how tiny these keyboard is one finger
covers up half of it I just hear whining
and whoa look at that world I'm going to
buy an epic settings at 1080p alright
computer has more faith alright well
it's running as
the graphics card is not on fire yet
wait hang on
yep no it's fine it's fine make sure
it's fine the game is totally playable
if we actually had like a mouse and
keyboard or even a controller this is
not actually included in the budget we
did add this hyper column next boxing
dance actually I really really I got all
excited first it's like oh sweet I'd
have to use a stupid little keypad but
now I'm like it's also the cheapest ice
walk to throw we can find which i think
is like a requirement for a fortnight
right and we're getting a salad sixty
frames per second for the most part I go
it dips a little bit here and there but
this is a very playable PC you get to
know the settings and get it consistency
Oh what was that why what's going on
it's okay it's it's a it's a quirk I
think this guy's just dying
look at that look like that did not look
like a graphics issue it'll look like a
screen catch is good I'd make me feel a
little bit better just just keep an eye
on this okay no pcs fault your PC U is
on that's pathetic that's really well
anyway hopefully you guys enjoyed this
wonderful Ken bolito production thanks
to everyone who contributed to this
video for all the work that you guys did
on this amazing fortnight setup don't
ever do this actually do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
