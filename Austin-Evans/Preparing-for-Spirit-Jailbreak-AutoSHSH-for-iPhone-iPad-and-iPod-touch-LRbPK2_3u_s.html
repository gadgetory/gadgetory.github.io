today I'm here with a video to help you
guys understand a little bit about the
upcoming spirit jailbreak as well as how
to prepare for it
now I'll explain it to you guys and just
mint but really basically there is one
thing you need to do before the
jailbreak even comes out that you can go
ahead and take care of right now well we
can do it later but I the way you
probably need to do it so I'll go ahead
and show you guys how to get your sh sh
blob saved cat sounds funny but hey guys
I'll take care of for you
anyway let's get this one started
this technology covering everything
okay guys so on this is gonna be a video
it's gonna become like a two-part video
I'm gonna show you guys how to go ahead
and back up your sh sh blobs i'll just
one of those what that is in just a
second but I'm also going to talk a
little bit about the spirit jailbreak so
you know bear with me here
real basically if you guys do not know
there's a new jailbreak called spirit
that's going to be coming out there's we
don't have a date yet but I mean
literally guys could be any day actually
the main reason that it's not out right
now because not everybody has done this
sh-sh Bob's so spirit is a really cool
looking jailbreak um kind of think it's
gonna be probably similar to Black Rain
the way it works but the main thing is
is that it's going to be an untethered
jailbreak for everything
iPods iPhones even the iPad it's going
to work on literally every single device
out there which is fantastic so it's
really basically the simple this is not
a video about spirit but the reason that
I'm making this video telling you about
the sh-sh blog is because this is what's
called a user land jailbreak it's very
simple to patch Apple can in fact Apple
might you know sin that put up an out
date with any o a day or two of it
coming out and in this case if even
though you might not uh of course you
know you'll probably know that hopefully
that you know that updates are bad when
your drill broker but the problem is our
iTunes and Apple have kind of blocked
off older updates but let's say for
example this is my iPod Touch I'm
running 3.1.3 right now well let's say
Spirit comes out tomorrow and it then
two days later after that you know our
jailbroken everything but two days later
after that Apple comes out with three
point one point four okay which fixes
the jailbreak so I'm still jailbroken
it's not a big deal as long as I don't
update but for whatever reason let's say
I have a problem or any reason really
that need to restore my iPod well guess
what I can't restore to 3.1.3 because
apples locked it out and I only can do
three point one point four so basically
I'm out of luck with the jailbreak
that's basically the sum
I did say it now this mostly applies if
you have one of three members of Isis
the iphone 3gs the iPod Touch 3rd
generation and iPad doesn't matter what
kind of iPad
I'm fifth one those devices you
absolutely need to follow this okay so
now that you guys know kind of what I'm
talking about let me just go ahead and
show you what you need to do okay guys
so now that you know everything that you
need to know that's quite just do it now
to do this you're going to need to put
your iPod iPhone or iPad and to recovery
mode so this was simple if you guys
don't know how to do it I'll show you
before I do this though I will know one
thing guys when you do this it will go
ahead and price Li kill your iPod iPhone
or iPad now it's not a big deal because
you can restore it back and bring all
the all your data your apps that kind of
stuff off of iTunes but before this I
highly recommend that you go ahead and
sync all your data and all that kind of
good stuff over to the iTunes okay so to
do this go ahead and you're just going
to need to hold the home and power
button actually I'm going to go ahead
and take my ipod out of the case I
suggest you guys do the same just
because you have to hold you have to
hold the home and power button for a
little while and like especially if you
have like a case like this which is
silicon it's kind of a little bit hard
to do so you know that's just a
suggestion that's nothing not that hard
to do but yeah so now all you do is just
hold both the buttons and you just start
holding now it at total ignore it
continue to hold and it will take a bit
kind of depends usually um not too long
okay guys
sorry about that clips um I accidentally
drop the button so let's go ahead and
get back but as you see guys I get the
recovery mode I just had to hold it a
while so yeah guys now once you have
recovery mode you're ready to go ahead
and plug it into iTunes just like I said
okay guys so once you have all done with
the putting your ipod / iphone / ipad
and that's hard to say soon as you're
done putting them in recovery mode
whatever you have go ahead and plug it
into your computer itunes may or may not
pop up it doesn't matter if it
just can't slow down okay so what you're
going to need is there's actually two
different ways to do this I'm going to
show you guys auto sh-sh it's a tool
made by I hate snow really cool
jailbreaker and he makes a lot of cool
stuff he made a snow breeze for example
this is the program we'll be using now
we'll know guys this is Windows only if
you have a Mac computer you will need to
go ahead I'll have in the description go
ahead check it out I'll have a link to a
tutorial on how to do this with a
different program I don't have a Mac so
I can't show you guys but it should do
the exact same thing but assume you have
Windows when going get started so with
your device and let's say on them all
all the names with your device plugged
in to your computer go ahead and open up
Auto sh-sh which of course the link will
be in the description to download it
might ask you just say yes I have a
couple pop-ups here the first one is you
have to have a connection running
obviously you know make sure it's your
Wi-Fi is on for your computer or
whatever make sure it's hooked up to the
Internet and also make sure that says
that one one device needs to be
connected but if you're you know if you
have more than one device just do them
at it one one at a time so and okay and
you have to ask that you have Java
hooked it on to your computer if you do
go ahead and hit yes if you don't you do
need to go ahead and download it I won't
get into all that that should be pretty
simple just google it so I already had
this so yeah now of course you can hit
the button say and how do I enter
recovery mode but I just showed you guys
that's no big deal
so beyond this really simple just click
grab my sh-sh blobs automatically it'll
search for recovery mode find your AC ID
and then it will give you the choice to
go ahead and save your sh sh blob
locally so let me just go put on my
desktop just say blob doesn't really
matter do put this guys on do put that
in a place that is really simple to find
so you know make sure that doesn't get
lost because it as you can see actually
as you saw hopefully there it also
uploads it to cydia so you can go ahead
and do this in the future but it's nice
to go ahead and have that for future
reference if for whatever reason that
that server is not working so as you
guys saw it took like two seconds it
says done if it's still being time
Appl then your blog should be located
and plus saved on Cydia so now no matter
what no matter if they come out with
three point one point four three point
two 4.0 whatever the firmware it is you
should always be able to restore back to
three point one point three so it's
perfectly done so yeah guys that's it
now you're all set up if you're watching
this one Spirit has already released
then I will go ahead and jailbreak it
and if not you can go ahead and do it at
any time but as long as you do it fairly
soon you know as soon as they come out
with three point one point four this
total thing is all gonna be busted and
you won't be able to do this but yeah
guys if you have any questions be sure
to leave them in the comments I'll do my
best to help anyway thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
