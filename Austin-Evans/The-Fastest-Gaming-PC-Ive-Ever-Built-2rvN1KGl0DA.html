gaming pcs that we built just a few
weeks ago which is since seeing some
slight upgrades since the last time
you've seen it so as a little bit of a
refresher before we had a core i7 8086 k
inside a gtx 980ti we had 16 gigs of
memory 512k a SSD obtain memory a
fortune terabyte hard drive this is a
pretty well spec system but in the last
few weeks there have been a few new
hardware announcements if you missed
them including not only the art CX 2080
eye which we have installed but also the
brand new Intel Core i $9.99 hundred K
we're going from six cores on the
previous high end up to eight cores with
hyper-threading if you go to the i7 you
got eight courses out hyper-threading
and go to the i-5 that's going to have
six cores with no hyper threading no
more hyper threading it's a sad day
except well it's not really because it
doesn't make a big difference but yeah
so where our 8086 processor from before
was a very overclockable six core chip
with a 5k hertz boost out of the box
what we're getting with the i9 is
actually similar performance so the base
clock is 3.6 gigahertz but right out of
the box like having to touch anything we
can hit 5 gigahertz and believe me when
I say a little bit of overclocking this
thing should be impressive but unlike
most videos where we spend lots of time
benchmarking and testing today we're
doing something a little different I'm
going to do all this live and see
exactly just how powerful this core I 9
is paired with the RT X xx atti I hope
this all goes well and not like on
alliances videos where he spends three
days troubleshooting some obscure
technical issue it all looks like it
works though so so this is the first
time that we've had a full eight core
processor on the consumer side for Intel
now Rison has been around for a few
years and that does actually support a
full eight core chip but this is a
little more expensive and hopefully a
little bit more powerful so the first
thing I do is run a quick Center bench
the 8086 ran something like a 212 on
single core so let's see how close we
can get with this so while we're running
the test is looking like around 4.4 to
4.5 gigahertz actually I don't know why
this is not boosting higher I mean it's
a perfect single threaded workload it
should be at a 5 gigahertz or at least
somewhere around that
we're pretty much topped out at four
point four to four point five I wonder
the technical problems are already
beginning one ninety yeah that's that's
lower so we got like two ten or so on
the 8086 and that's 100 cent because
this is not boosting up higher I came to
get one benchmark done I'm all happy
like yeah cool we got you know no
technical problems cuz it all works I've
been doing this for five seconds and
we're already not going well I don't
know the internet didn't it kept you
getting that right look at that no
internet great this is like the lamest
version of the video I had in mind
possible one quick BIOS update later we
have something that should boost a lot
quicker so they start the single core
ideally we see oh yeah four point nine
four point nine five gears there we go
that's what I'm talking about now again
this is not overclocked running on a
single core this chip should easily hit
five gigahertz and especially if we were
able to actually put a little bit more
overclock through it oh man I'm so happy
it's always great when it's not a huge
issue and something really simple like I
forgot to get the most recent BIOS
instead of the one right before that
okay so our first run was 190 before the
update and there we go to 13 so it's
almost exactly what we got at the 8086
which does make sense as far as single
thread performance goes they're both
skylake cores and they both can boost to
5 gigahertz the real test is literally
switched over to the multi-core and
that's so much better man I've just done
sentiment so many times it's nice to see
that many threads just chewing it up so
for reference the last time we got about
just under 1,400 on the 8086 but with
two more cores and we're still boosting
it look at 4.7 gigahertz on all eight
cores look at it's just it's done whoa
2078 that is actually that's actually
wait why is it that's really high hey
now again what's the difference there
dude that's almost 40% faster so I guess
there's a couple reasons behind that one
of which would be of course we do have
two more cores that's naturally going to
kick in some performance and we were
able to stay at 4.7 gigahertz the entire
time I think a big part of that is that
unlike the older series chips which were
did have a little bit of thermal paste
in between the heats
and chip instead we actually have solder
now which does dissipate that heat a
little bit better
and allows it to boost really hide out
of the box that's cool
not actually hey I see what you did
there before we get too far into it
though let's actually get a little bit
of 3d mark going did the internet drop
again no it didn't did it that's great
when it turns on for five minutes and
then drops back out makes this video
super easy to do after a little bit of
internet TLC it's back up and it's time
to run time spy so this is a benchmark
which is primarily going to test our RT
X 2080 eye but with that core eye nine
onboard it should help out a little bit
but I'm mostly curious to see how it
actually stacks up compared to our
previous set up with the 1080i pro
reference our previous score completely
stock mind you was nine thousand four
hundred and eighty seven in time spy so
that's what we've got a beat and I think
we've got a pretty good shot so this is
a Founders edition of the RT X xx atti
and just like with the CPU when I doing
any kind of overclocking right now I
want to get a pure apples-to-apples
benchmark then we can get a little bit
more of the fun stuff going all right
not bad so we went from ninety four
hundred all the way up to twelve
thousand six hundred and forty one and
one of the big things I think helped us
there as the CPU scorer's 11,000 that's
not bad
alright and you don't you have great my
time spy yeah it's a total different
score it's a different test it unlocks a
4k version of the test oh yeah yeah
that's gonna take a little while $10
later I have now upgraded my time spy
for the full 4k version now actually
don't have the numbers on what this is
like on the tane ATI and the previous
set up but I'm curious to see how it
performs against well I guess everyone
else's 2080 I numbers wait why are we
doing this everyone else is like
overclocking this is like totally stock
there's no point of running it in 4k
canned I just waste 10 dollars for
nothing
it's for for science interesting this is
totally different than the normal
version 6100 wow that's a she really
fast Wow
so I've not tested any other 2080 eye
setups but that's actually a bit quicker
and I think that's mostly because of the
i9 all that you to be fair we are
running the the founders Edition so
benchmarks cool but left I should play
some real games smash cut to me playing
fortnight so a little bit of Dave's
favorite gameplay from the bus full of
exciting 's for K fortnight is a pretty
smooth
85 90 frames per second as we drop or
getting a little bit closer to the high
70s maybe yeah it's a you can play
fortnight in case you were curious you
know it's kinda nice about this setup
it's surprisingly quiet even though
we've got the founders Edition which
definitely does not have the best kind
of cooling there's definitely some
aftermarket cards which have much much
beef your coolers they'll get a lot more
airflow going but this is actually a
fairly quiet system and keep in mind
that this is with the side panel off oh
you know I fight jump on here I can
parachute can't a this is about this is
playground okay maybe it came to that
guy okay that's great
a little bit of pub G action again 4k
ultra settings and here running around
in this completely empty area with no
other people to test it with we've got
78 frames per second this is the way to
do it right you walk around all the
people who are just sitting in the lobby
not doing anything there's actually is
it reasonable stress test though pub G
does definitely scale based on how many
characters you have on screen at once
it's funny even at 4k Ultra settings pub
G still not the Nexus looking camera how
is it you late to test call duty black
out all right we're in the game and
we've got a pretty impressive 80 frames
per second this is actually it's kind of
impressive that with a single GPU and
with a consumer all as bad as bad as bad
as that okay so that is just a little
taste of what you can expect at the core
I $9.99 hundred K as well as the RT X
2080 I definitely stay tuned this is not
the last time you're going to see this
