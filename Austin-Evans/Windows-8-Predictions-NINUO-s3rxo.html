about Windows 8 yeah guys I know when
the sevens been out for less than a year
but it's already about time to start
thinking ahead to the future what
Windows is going to be about I'm some
guys we've got some information on
there's some sleep slides from Microsoft
talking about some different features
that they're playing on including and
then I'm guys go I'm going to go ahead
and give you my thoughts my opinions
what I think that my microsoft needs go
ahead and add with Windows 8 ok guys so
the first thing is it looks like they're
going to be integrating a new sort of
login system so instead of just sitting
down turning on the computer and you
know waiting for to boot and then type
in your password they seem to streamline
and they want to be very very fast boot
times and then they want to go ahead and
let you log in just with your webcam via
face recognition software
wait what ok guys so the next thing is
that Windows looks like it is going to
be getting an app store some guys of
course their app stores on most phones
this is the iphone android etc etc and
there also is on google chrome as well
as Google Chrome OS a web store so it
seems like it's a pretty good bet that
when is going to go ahead and drag this
into Windows 8 so because we don't have
a whole lot of specifics you guys can
see in these slides here they have a few
rough mock-ups but I mean it's still a
probably a good way out of portion too
until when this eight comes out but this
is a really cool feature guys it will be
nice to go ahead and get a lot of
software just from one source so you're
not going to be you know need to go you
know buy CDs of you know stuff and deal
with activation codes everything you can
go ahead and just download whatever you
need I'll write off the windows App
Store I'm so guys this looks really cool
and definitely looking forward to seeing
you implemented in windows 8 something
else will be expecting Windows 8 is that
they will be cleaning up some stuff I'm
so you should add some better support
for solid-state drives an addition that
you have full support for USB 3.0 which
is really good on the other hand looks
like they will probably be removing
support for firewire which isn't that
big a deal that many computers use
firewire of these days this USB 2.0 faz
is and USB 3-pointers should be just
fine ok guys so now onto my predictions
about what I expect to see in windows 8
on so the first thing is definitely I
touched on this a little bit earlier is
that improved boot times so of course
when does seven was quite a
faster-moving in windows vista an
expectation is trend continuing Windows
8 especially considering that Google
Chrome OS is going to be booting in less
than 10 seconds that's going to be you
know a pretty pretty stiff competition
so guys but probably the one of the
number one thing that I'm looking
forward to is to see a real redesign of
windows so of course windows 7 was very
very similar to vista I mean you know
there wasn't a huge difference of course
there's a lot of really really nice
improvements in Windows 7 but for all
intents and purposes it was a very
similar operating system but I hope to
see a major overhaul of Windows so guys
here if you you know a little bit about
windows and computers and how it all
orbs you know the windows is based off
of a pretty old kind of design you know
there's it's just kind of like
old-school you know you know quite a few
years ago I really Microsoft wants to go
ahead and redo windows you know really
spend a lot of time and just you know
kind of almost start from scratch I
think that it will become a very very
good operating system I mean don't get
me wrong I love windows 7 it's probably
my favorite operating system ever but I
mean it could be quite it fast or it
could work a lot better you know the
security could be a lot better if they
decide to you know just restart from the
ground up an addition obviously an
improved interface I'm not to say
anything against windows 7 it's a pretty
good interface you know the taskbar like
that there's a lot of really good
improvements but I hope to see windows 8
improve upon that so you know I like
arrow glass I think that's really cool
look I hope they implement that farther
you know they continue to really make it
just a really nice-looking OS they also
need to really focus on the
functionality I'm just take for example
folders you know of course they did make
a step forward with libraries in Windows
7 but still can be just a little bit
clunky it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't
really work as well as you might hope
sometimes you might take you a minute to
go click through a few menus to find
your files well that they can integrate
a really really central search so you
can find any file you know if maybe just
a keystroke or two that will be
fantastic and even though when the
seventh source is not that bad by any
stretch of the imagination it does take
a couple of seconds they could really
have it you know Google best you know
when you type something in its up you
know a tenth of a second they can really
integrate that and then have it you know
not where you have to open up the search
menu then you can have it centrally
located then that would be a huge
improvement ok guys so that's it for
this very early wrap up of Windows 8 i'm
so i have a question for you guys so if
you're using windows right now what do
you looking forward to and if you guys
are using mac or linux what features
does windows need to add to go ahead and
get you to change back over 10 they let
me know in the comments of curious to
know anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
