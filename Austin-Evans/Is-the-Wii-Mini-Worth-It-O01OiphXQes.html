here with the most anticipated new
console launch of the year no not the
ps4 and no not the Xbox one the wii mini
yeah we're going there judging from how
many people had no idea this even exists
when I showed it over on Twitter and
Instagram let's crack open the box and
see what we've got here in the US the
wii mini comes bundled with a full copy
of mario kart which is a great starter
game it also comes with the standard
don't sue us if you throw your Wii
Remote through your TV paperwork take a
little deeper into the box and you'll
find the slightly more fun stuff
including the awesomely power cable also
included is the Wii sensor bar which is
the same as you'll find on the standard
Wii and Wii U and the RCA composite
cable for hooking up your ultra-high
definition TVs because come on
who doesn't want to play Mario Kart in
4k even though the Wii is more like 0.6
K I mean it's close enough right you
also get the Wii Remote Plus and
nunchuck and a sweet red that matches
the console now I've been making a
little bit of fun of the wii mini
however if you want to buy the
controller and Mario Kart by themselves
that's actually the same price as this
entire bundle including the console look
at it that way and the Wii mini isn't a
bad deal who needs an Ouya when you can
get a console for the same price that
actually plays decent games oh snap
unwrap the console itself and you'll see
it looks very different from the
original Wii thankfully there's no
glossy plastic to attract every particle
of dust in your house ps4 pop it open
though and you'll see the first major
change a top-loading disc drive I'm
probably in the minority but I actually
prefer this as opposed to a slot-loading
Drive it means you don't have to go find
a power cable to plug in the console
just to eject a disc and you have to
worry about anything breaking you just
flip it open drop your disc in and
you're done take a look around back and
you'll find connections for the power
cable sensor bar AV out along with the
single USB port along the left side is
the sync button for your wiimotes and
the power and disk open buttons are up
top however to make a new console that
cost about as much as a new Xbox game
Nintendo had to make some cuts gone is
backwards compatibility with GameCube
games from the original Wii which sets a
little but most new Wiis don't have this
either you also won't find an SD card
slot which means everything has to be on
the internal storage that actually isn't
a problem as it doesn't have
Internet connectivity yeah it's 2013 in
Nintendo was shipping a console that is
permanently offline fire up the console
and the menu is it's pretty empty
you've got your dis channel we maker and
instruction manual that means no virtual
console no Hulu YouTube Netflix and in
fact no way to play a game at all unless
you have a disc games that have online
multiplayer work but they just give an
error when you try to connect online
however if you go back a few years
before everything had Wi-Fi including
your watch and just use it as a normal
game console it's a Wii even though
there's a lot of shovelware
there are also some excellent Nintendo
games for the Wii Super Smash Brothers
Brawl is still one of my all-time
favorite games and it plays perfectly on
the wii mini I'm still really rusty at
it but this game alone is the reason I
still own a Wii Mario Cart is also a lot
of fun especially with local multiplayer
which of course does still work there's
no wheel for the Wii Remote included but
it still plays just fine with the
standard controls and in typical
Nintendo fashion it makes the lack of HD
graphics no big deal at all
the Wii mini definitely isn't perfect
however for $100 I'm willing to overlook
a lot however even at that price the
removal of Wi-Fi still feels like one
step too far however what do you guys
think is the Wii mini the console for
you would you rather go visit the
Hawking oh yeah or a standard we let me
know in the comments below also this
video is brought to you by hotspot
