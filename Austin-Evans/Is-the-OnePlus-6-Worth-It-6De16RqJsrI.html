through 2018 which means that flagship
phones are coming and to start out this
new wave we have the brand new one plus
six so in a world of thousand-dollar
flagships the idea that you can pick up
a phone like the one plus six for
starting at five hundred thirty dollars
means that you're really getting a lot
of the same specs a lot of the same
features but at a much lower price but
as always the question is is it worth
it's so what we have here is the mid
spec model so now is this going to have
a gigabytes of RAM that's also going to
have 128 gigs of storage this is in the
midnight black color and if we remove a
little sticker here you can see that is
well
Meli incredibly shiny but the last times
this will ever be completely perfect
until I get my grimy fingerprints on it
so if you put the one plus six side by
side with the five T one of the main
things you'll notice is that instead of
the metal bag that they've had for quite
a few years instead we do have that all
Gorilla Glass 5 look now it is going to
be slightly tapered on the back and
honestly it kind of feels nice sort of
similar to what you would find on
something like the Galaxy s8 or Galaxy S
9 before we get too far into it though I
want to take a look inside the box and
what we're going to find is not only our
USB C to USB a cable but also view
rather large - charger something that
oneplus has been known for for quite a
few years now is the idea that they have
some of the fastest charging phones out
there alright the one plus sakes and the
first thing you'll see is the notch yes
my friends like basically all
smartphones in 2018 the oneplus has
gotten on to the notch train but I will
say they've actually done a little bit
differently here so the first thing
you'll notice is that the notch is
actually one of these smallest that
you'll see most of that is because it's
really not a whole lot here besides the
front-facing camera the light sensor as
well as your earpiece but something else
to pay attention to is how small the
rest of the bezels are so there's
basically nothing on these sides of the
display and even the chin is going to be
really really minimal where this is
really noticeable is when you put it
side-by-side with the 1 + 5 t even
though the overall footprint of the
phones are almost identical what you're
getting here is going to be a little bit
of a larger display because you don't
have that sort of forehead and the chin
is going to be smaller and because of
that you're going from a 6 inch display
to a 6.3 in that same size body this guy
is rocking a 6.3 inch 20 to 80 by 1080
AMOLED display now
going to be a slightly unusual 19 by 9
aspect ratio but what it does mean is
it's not going to be the most high-risk
screen in the world you are going to be
getting something that again covers
pretty much the entire front of the
phone now generally speaking I feel like
a 1080p resolution it's pretty solid on
a phone this size however because it is
M OLED if you do look up close you're
going to see some slight jaggies it's
not gonna be quite as sharp as something
like a galaxy s 9 screen but as soon as
you get it more than a few inches away
from your face I think it's going to be
totally solid and importantly the screen
quality itself is actually super high
with this guy so not only is the one
plus six color calibrated straight from
the factory but you also do have extra
modes inside the settings so you can set
to the default mode which to my eye is a
little bit oversaturated you also have
srgb you have DCI p3 as well as the
adaptive mode but I like going to the
custom color and just tweaking it to be
a little bit more natural so you will
see that the screen even when you do the
custom profile is going to be slightly
oversaturated that's almost more of an
OLED thing now speaking of OLED things
if you do look at it slightly off axis
you're going to see the viewing angles
are good but not amazing however that's
going to be pretty much any AMOLED panel
what isn't going to be quite so great is
the HDR playback this does what HDR
video however it actually does it a
little bit of a choppy rate at least on
YouTube don't get me wrong though this
is an incredibly nice display and a lot
of ways it's right up there with stuff
like the galaxy s 9 as well as the
iPhone the only thing that really holds
it back is going to be the slightly
lower resolution but long as you're sort
of at a normal viewing distance it's
really not going to be an issue the
oneplus 6 does still have dual SIM card
slots which is definitely appreciated
but you do not have any kind of microsd
expandable 'ti if you want any more
storage you're going to have to buy it
ahead of time what thankful it's
actually not going to be that pricey so
the base model at $530 does have 64 gigs
of storage but another $50 will bump you
up to 128 and if you want to spend
another $100 you're going to be getting
256 gigs of storage pretty reasonable in
my opinion take a look at the bottom of
the phone in addition to the USB C port
you're also going to find the headphone
jack yes my friends a high-end phone in
2018 that does come standard with a
headphone jack
one thing the oneplus six does not have
is a great speaker so like the previous
models there's only going to be a single
mono speaker that fires down it's going
to be reasonably loud it would be really
nice to join the rest of the high-end
flagships by adding a front firing
speakers up top that doubles as your
speaker grille thing whatever they call
it what I always forgive us call the
stupid uh earpiece earpiece now because
we do have a glass back the phone is
fairly slippery but there's actually
going to be a fairly hard chamfer on the
side which does kind of give you a
little bit of grip and something else
that want flow is really nailed are the
buttons this is not something I talk
about very often because well for the
most part of button is a button but not
only are they going to be pretty raised
up but they're not going to be flush at
all
but they're nicely spaced and they
actually feel really good there's this
nice tactile click and especially with
the volume rockers and as well as the
little one plus slider that will turn on
and off the mute or the vibrates which I
think feels really solid baby good job
here the fingerprint sensor around back
works just as you would expect so it is
going to be right below the camera bump
which is a little bit large on the phone
but just kind of helps you find the
fingerprint sensor and on top of that
this does also have an upgraded version
of face on lock now it's not going to be
as secure as something like the iPhone
10 but it does work pretty well so I
kind of hold it up here and hit the
button pretty much immediately unlocks
as if I didn't even have a passcode
maybe not the most secure thing in the
world it is definitely fast this is the
first time that oneplus has gone with an
all glass construction for one of their
phones it does look pretty nice and
allow them to do multiple colors the
midnight black is interesting looking
even though it is going to be super
super fingerprint tea however there are
going to be some interesting trade-offs
so yes it feels nice in the hand
especially because it is going to be
curved on back but it's not really going
to be all that unique it's very very
common for a flagship phones and even
some budget options to go with a glass
construction in 2018
now the trade-off when you go with glass
even with something high-end like this
gorilla glass five is that you're going
to be losing some durability and of
course you can get sort of micro
scratches and stuff but that can kind of
happen on any phone but the real worry
is if you drop it you could totally
shatter not only the front but also the
back of the phone the worst part is
you're really not going to be getting
anything besides the aesthetics so while
a metal phone generally will not allow
you to wireless charge because the metal
will interfere most of the time a glass
phone will however for some odd reason
oneplus decide to opt out of adding
any kind of wireless charging capability
to the one plus six sure it's got the
superfast - charging and honestly I end
up using sort of normal wired charging a
lot more than Wireless anyway well it
would be really nice to have that option
especially considering that it's not
even that expensive it's kind of weird
that they didn't include it now there is
going to be some waterproofing inside
the phone
however oneplus did not opt to do any
kind of ip67 or ip68 rating basically
what that means is that it actually
might not be that far off from something
like an iPhone or galaxy as far as being
waterproof but if you actually get it
wet and kill it it's not going to be
warranty supported so you're on your own
on that one there are some other nice
features including a full RGB
notification light as well as an ambient
display mode so like something like the
pixel or the galaxy s 9 you can see at a
quick glance your notifications and the
time and date however unlike those
phones it's not going to be always on
you're going to either have to tap the
display or actually raise it up for it
to trigger inside you're going to find
full flagship level specs so it's going
to be rocking a snapdragon 845 processor
with 8 cores as well as either 6 or 8
gigabytes of RAM depending on which
model you pick up now in the Android
space that's about as good as it gets
it's right on par with something like
the galaxy s 9 and if you look at it
side-by-side with other phones like the
iPhone as well as the 1 + 5 T it does do
a pretty solid job the performance
generally speaking is very good exactly
like you would expect with this level of
specs so the UI is going to be nice and
smooth one of the nice things is is that
with that kind of level of performance
you are going to be future-proof to some
degree especially with these kind of
graphics a lot of games in the future
should run pretty well on the oneplus 6
the 1 plus 6 is running Android 8.1 Oreo
with oxygen OS on top now it's going to
be a fairly light skin so generally
speaking one plus doesn't have a lot of
bloat and they had actually legitimately
useful features and one of which has to
do with the knotch now for some reason
you hate the look of a notch you can't
actually turn it off in the settings so
you need to do is go into the notch
display option and hit hide the notch
area what that will mean is that any
kind of app cannot actually take
advantage of that top area although
thankfully you are still going to be
able to use stuff like your status bar
and everything that's going to be tucked
up in the corner there's also going to
be a built-in reading mode so you can
turn this on for the entire OS or just
for specific apps but once you turn it
on it turns everything full grayscale
and it warms up the display just a
little bit kind of looks like you're
reading off of a newspaper this is going
to be a little bit of a niche option but
especially you're sitting in bed late at
night you don't want to sort of sear
your eyes with super bright colors it
actually is pretty calming although you
probably wanna use this for text in that
video there's not a lot to complain
about with the software on this guy sure
you're not going to be getting Android
updates quite as fast as on a pixel but
oneplus does have a good track record
for keeping things up to date and a
reasonable sort of time frame and on top
of that you're also going to be getting
a pretty bloke free experience as far as
the cameras go while on paper looks very
similar the oneplus six has seen some
major upgrades so around back you're
still going to be getting a 16 megapixel
main sensor as well as a 20 megapixel
telephoto option but that main sensors
been upgraded with not only optical
image stabilization but it also is now
going to be a little bit larger than it
was before so if we line up a shot here
of Ken we're gonna see that not only
does the HDR immediately pop up but
something's really impressive is it it
takes pictures fast they're gonna be
using a lot of budget Android phones
that take a while this one's pretty much
instant the shots actually pretty nice
too there's a really good job of keeping
in all those highlights with HDR there's
really not anything that we're missing
so with a telephoto camera we're going
to be losing a little bit of sharpness
but I'm actually not that disappointed a
lot of times with smart phones that do
have dual cameras while the main camera
might look great a lot of times when you
switch over to the 2x zoom it doesn't
look so great but this is not that at
all so something else is the oneplus 6
has now is going to be a portrait mode
so if we switch over to it it's going to
turn the depth effect although
interesting that's actually using it on
the wide-angle camera okay let's give
this a try Oh perfect there you go
a wonderful shot of lots of Hearts
behind you Ken that's man that's a
that's a special one right there we look
at the standard portrait mode though
what we're getting here is something
that looks okay but you know it's not
really that great first of all I like it
when a portrait mode will use the
telephoto camera it's a little bit more
of a compressed focal length I guess
would be the correct phrase but this man
the edges are all just blurry no it's
not great get some good light and you
can actually get a ton of detail out of
these photos if you look up close to the
little fibers on the leaf they're super
clear and super crispy something else
I'm really appreciating with shooting
with this camera is that there's very
little latency when it comes to taking a
shot or especially when it comes to
viewing your images everything's pretty
much instance if you want to take a
couple shots quickly make sure you got
the thing and then move on right back
into the camera there's really no lag
well
going to be getting some pretty decent
slow-motion options so the oneplus six
will shoot up to 4k at 60 frames per
second and when you slow that down it
looks pretty nice but if you really want
some proper slow motion you're going to
be getting either 720p at 480 or my
personal favorite is 1080p at 240 frames
per second you're still getting decent
quality but it's going to slow down and
still give you that cool look I mean
this is cool right swishing up cameras
for a second this is what 4k video looks
like on the oneplus 6
now importantly we do have that optical
image stabilization which especially
when you're shooting 4k is super helpful
but it's pretty much useful for any kind
of smartphone video you guys can see as
we move around a little bit it should be
reasonably smooth so is the 1 plus 6
worth it's a little bit over $500 you're
getting the entire flagship experience
now yes they're going to be a couple
things missing such as the lack of
wireless charging but you consider that
this is going to cost a lot less than a
lot of other flagships that perform very
very similarly it's kind of hard to
argue that this is not the definition of
being worth it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
