playlist live here at the Corel
VideoStudio booth would you introduce
yourself sure my name is Amy Schmidt our
and from the Sh'ma tastic channel
awesome and we're gonna be doing a
little demo of corel videostudio pro x5
so how long have you been using video
studio I just started using about a week
ago okay perfect so guys if you've never
used begin studio it's really simple
it's what I made all my videos with I've
died a couple videos on video studio
before we come over here there's a
couple of really simple things I can
talk for a long time about this I've
been doing it all weekend long but some
of them make my favorite features you
can do screen capture which is actually
what we're doing right now with a bunch
of camera angles an electronical stuff
so once you grab your Clips you can
bribe from SD cards cameras whatever you
can bring in from all kinds of sources
you come over to the Edit tab so this is
one of my videos which I can get it
playing here so there's all kinds of
timeline you got your effects but let me
show you one of my favorite effects
which actually you've done this a lot of
videos and I've got a lot of people
asking how do you do that so I'm pull us
up here it's called autosketch so if I
just drop it in here and we started back
over here so you see here that's one of
my favorite features because you can
just add and everything works really
quickly and you know snappily so you can
see there maybe have quite the best
example of the effect but you can do
everything really quickly there unless
of course we have to share so we can go
upload straight to youtube we can go
create a video file save it to our hard
drive and all I got stuff so what do you
think oh i love i love the program so
far there's just a couple technical
things that like I've been playing with
that home and one of those things was
they have some amazing titles that you
can just drop in there really great
effects but sometimes I just need
something really basic
and just like nothing behind the behind
the text or change the color or change
the font like can you show me a little
bit about playing with those options
sure so if you come over back to the
Edit tab and you can open up the text so
there's a bunch of different ones that
video studio comes with you can try them
yourself so let's just grab something
random it doesn't really matter and so
what should we make sure we drop it in
here properly stuff we open it up and so
she couldn't be kind of hard i can't
really a two-out like I keep my hand on
the microphone but you can do all kinds
stuff you can change the font so we want
to go I don't know just pick something
generic here so Ariel we can change it
bold and you can do all kinds of stuff
and ate it properly so what I like to do
is just get something generic just like
some simple text if you want to like
animate or whatever you come over to the
app tribute over here to open it up here
you go and make it drop you can do make
it fell comb all over the place and all
that kind of stuff and of course you can
Oh at undies things so if we open up
track manager you can open up up to 20
overlaid tracks so you can have text
graphics video all that kind of stuff so
yeah so what else what else one demos or
anything like that no that was my only
question that's really question that's
good it out hey all right well I want to
thank you hopefully guys are enjoying
the playlist live coverage have done a
couple of blogs at opal you seen I don't
know when we're going to be posting this
but yeah thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
