China to tell you that it's going to be
a good video hey guys Zhou stain and
this is a $160 iPhone 10 clone the
description of goods here listed as a
phone with a total value of 150 $9.99
the idea here is that this is one of the
very first which I'm sure it's going to
be Android phones it actually does have
not only face ID but it also does have
the knotch
the good news though is that we get
support for a gravity sensor which of
course is very important in your
smartphone well from the front if we
remove the little screen protector that
actually does kind of look like an
iPhone 10 you've got the knotch
and it actually is not that far off so
take off the rubber case that comes with
it and you'll see that the back is
actually a little different even though
we do have the dual cameras we get
something that even the iPhone 10
doesn't have a fingerprint sensor also
like the iPhone 10 we do have USB C port
which is close enough to lightning what
we don't get is a headphone jack even
though this phone is clearly thick
enough to easily fit one I'm surprised
with just how heavy this is
now I think part of it is because it is
so thick and it does have such a large
battery but especially when you put it
side-by-side with something like the
iPhone 10 it really does not feel
anywhere near the same sort of level of
Polish now part of that is of course the
fact that this guy's rocking at glass
back versus I assume is metal oh you
know what that's plastic
ooh we have Google assistant built-in
all right I actually will say that
that's not what I was expecting on a
kind of low-end device I think we're
actually running Android 7 here so with
the u18 setup it actually looks like
fairly stock looking Android so there's
a couple of weird apps on here but for
the most part it actually looks fairly
straightforward
now the notch the notch is a little bit
interesting put this side-by-side with
the actual iPhone 10 and you'll see they
actually looked fairly close so
especially with the notch was a little
bit bigger it's not you that far off
although it does have a big chain
compared to the iPhone 10 one of the
nice things is Android actually does
have native support for the knotch so an
app like Google Maps here you actually
can see that we do get pre much to the
full screen even though it is going to
be a little bit greyed out on top now
this is also shared with something like
the essential phone so even though this
is a much smaller notch that's just for
the front-facing camera it actually does
also take advantage of it in interesting
ways so it's not like that space is
always going to be wasted so you
pretty much the same sort of setup with
your icons up on the top right as well
as your time on the top left now the
only thing I will say is a little bit
weird is the fact that even though it is
going to be curved it's not going to
quite that same level as the iPhone but
at first glance it is very very close
well weird things with the iPhone 10 is
if you pull down from the normal part
you're going to be getting all of your
information all your notifications if
you pull down from the right you're
actually going to be getting Control
Center now here if you pull down from
either side you're going to be getting
some different notifications if you're
fully on from the middle nothing happens
so you know don't do that considering
that it only cost $160 and site actually
has pretty decent specs so we're going
to be getting a four thousand milliamp
hour battery which is going to be
powering an octa-core processor with
four gigs of RAM and 64 gigs of storage
when it comes to the screen
you're getting a 5.8 inch display with a
resolution of 1512 by 720 definitely on
the lower side but it is a pretty okay
panel I mean it's not really exactly
going to blow you away but it's fairly
bright the COS of decent the viewing
angles though just aren't that great
again though $160 now in addition to the
knotch
you're also going to be getting face ID
or while face unlock please note
appearance shaped similar to people or
items you may unlock success oh boy
check the face keep this position and
wait for the countdown to finish oh it
it added it wait my face wasn't even
totally in the frame hello saying it
does actually work done okay it worked
the real test though is it'll be fooled
by a picture of me
so with this awesome selfie can we
actually unlock the phone alright so put
like this and face are you sure fields
failed failed failed I don't necessarily
know it's the most accurate thing in the
world but at least based on first
impressions it kind of works alright so
something like this okay yep alright
nevermind they take all that stuff back
it is easily fooled with just a single
photo of you well I mean you know let's
try it
160 bucks thankfully you don't have to
roll on face ID as you do have that
fingerprint sensor so we turn on drop
your finger on it
it sort of works it's like a time at
least oh okay
well I mean you've got a decent sized
screen but because the way that the
phone is treating the knotch unlike the
iPhone we can actually punch in
especially when you're watching
widescreen video here it's just like you
always have that much of the screen that
doesn't exist
the only time you really get it is if
you have an app that specifically
supports it or you've got something like
the home screen which does allow you to
get a little bit of your information up
top who these two side-by-side
and around back they look absolutely
nothing alike however this guy is
rocking the same at least in theory rear
facing camera or wall cameras oh wow
they straight rip the iPhone interface
like it's totally identical
you've even hit a little button to go to
2x let's do a little side-by-side so
first of all let's take a photo on the
u18 and now let's take that same photo
on the iPhone 10 at first glance it's
actually not that bad if you take a
closer look you'll see that there's just
not a lot of detail there so this is
what video looks like only $160 iPhone
10 clone it's um not exactly what I
would call crispy the blur mode is
literally just like a blurred edge
around the photo hold on wait I'm try
this are you serious
that might be the worst portrait mode
photo I have ever seen literally nothing
isn't focused it's just like this circle
of vague focus around the middle part we
have face beauty mode all right I could
use some beauty on my face I don't think
I would call that beautiful it's just a
little blurry okay so the camera not
exactly so great but you are getting the
notch and I mean if you want to fool
someone into thinking that you're using
an iPhone with like a really thick case
I guess so for $160 should you pick up
the oukitel u18 well some parts of it
they did a really good job of copying
I think the notch is actually done
better than I was expecting and
especially over the next year or so I
think we're going to be seeing a lot of
Android phones with the knotch however
the face unlock as well as the cameras
are certified garbage town so what do
you guys think let me know in the
comments below and I will catch you on
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
