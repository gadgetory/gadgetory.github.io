voice today what I do have is the Lenovo
Mirage solo a daydream you see I did
there this is a very different way of
doing VR this is a very different way
for me to talk in my videos cuz I'm sick
of course you shoutout to Lenovo for
sponsoring this video what makes the
Mirage solo a little bit different is
this is a properly powerful untethered
VR headset inside you'll find a 2560 by
1440 piece 75 Hertz display now that
high resolution especially paired with
the high frame rate is really key to
making the VR experience feel natural
one of the main advantages of using the
Mirage Solo is that this is a fully
standalone headset I don't need to worry
about my smartphone being plugged in and
draining battery and it's also a much
smoother experience a largely dude
actually to the fact that it does have
not only that high refresh rate display
but importantly it also does support
world sense so unlike most daydream
headsets which do rely on a little bit
more of a limited bit of luck gyroscope
to be able to kind of place you in the
world we do have a full 6 degrees of
freedom what's really cool about this is
that you can use it literally anywhere I
mean I'm in the middle of the park and I
can easily be playing a game watching a
movie it really does give you a lot of
possibilities Niraj solo runs on
daydream Google's VR ecosystem
surprisingly it actually works really
well you have most of these different
apps and features that you have on full
Android just available in a headset form
that means that we've got apps such as
YouTube VR now this will give you a ton
of different options so if I jump in
here now I do we have full 360 and
180-degree video which looks great on
the headset but you can also watch the
standard 2d video like this the way that
works is it literally looks like I've
just got a huge display in front of me
like a movie theater or something so
thanks to dead trigger and a few zombie
friends I can show a little more of the
performance of what you can actually
expect out of the Mirage Solo inside we
have pretty decent specs Snapdragon 835
as well as 4 gigabytes of RAM that's not
bad that's bad no no no no you should
get 3 hours of battery life if you can
survive the zombies that long but there
are a ton of games and apps that do work
on the headset it's not all about the
Mirage solo though there's also this
little guy the Lenovo Mirage camera with
daydream this is not a 360 degree camera
uses a pair of fisheye lenses upfront to
give you a 180 degree field of view or
as Google calls the format VR 180 this
is a demo of what video looks like on
the Mirage camera one of the cool
advantages of this format is that what
you still get all the advanced
of ER you still do get a very wide
field-of-view - this is a full 180
degrees what I like about this is it
gives you a lot of flexibility when it
comes to framing so we can still have
Ken you know behind the camera doing Ken
things but I can also pick it up and
very easily do a little bit of vlogging
so with a really cool part about this is
that because it is so wide I know that I
can always get the shot and specifically
if you do have a smartphone you can
actually scroll on the video if you
watch the raw stuff link in the
description but it's a really really
cool aspect or a really cool way of
shooting you generally don't get with
any kind of standard camera you can
control the camera as well as playback
the photos and videos using the VR 180
app so this is a little demo that we
took in the car a couple days ago so as
you can see what's really cool about the
180 format is it specifically on a
smartphone you can pinch in you can zoom
around but you do get that sort of full
180 degree field of view so the video is
a lot more immersive when you're
watching it in the headset so it's kind
of hard to sort of give you a real demo
without actually having one of your own
but it makes a huge difference and
because the camera will shoot at a full
4k resolution we get those pixels all
the way blown up makes a really big
difference I mean I can see the detail
on the gauges I can see the terrified
look on Ken's face I can see Jay as he
makes this tight corner and up hello
yeah oh dude look she feels really good
if I like spin the chair as I see myself
turning the car it actually feels like
I'm really there if you've never
properly experienced VR or maybe you've
been turned off by cheap mobile VR the
Lenovo mirages solo and camera are
definitely worth a look and of course
I'll have a link to check out both these
guys in the description as well so if
you want more information I'll have a
bunch of other videos linked as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
