here with a review of the HTC One x+ for
AT&amp;amp;T
with a more powerful processor 64
gigabytes of storage and a bigger
battery let's see how it stacks up first
the bad news this is only a slightly
tweaked upgrade from the standard One X
the good news is that the original One X
was and still is an excellent phone and
this brings some nice improvements on
top of that build quality is still very
good as the phone is made out of a
single piece of polycarbonate code and a
soft touch finish up front you'll find
the 1.6 megapixel front facing camera
along with the speaker grille and hidden
notification LED below or your
capacitive back home and multitasking
buttons and finally there's the 4.7 inch
display this is unchanged from the One X
and it's still among the best screens
out there only passed up by the HTC
Droid DNA viewing angles are excellent
saturation is right on and it gets
reasonably bright from the side you can
see the phone is slightly tapered which
gives it a nice look and feel in the
hand I'm not a big fan of the placement
of the microUSB port however as it's a
bit awkward but not a big deal around
back you'll see the 8 megapixel camera
with LED flash along with Beats Audio
branding and the speaker he's reasonably
loud but it's very easy to cover up with
a single misplace finger when you're
using the phone overall besides a couple
small nitpicks the hardware gets a
thumbs-up for me it's still leather
nicest Android phones out there to use
the HTC One x+ is running Android 4.1
jelly bean with the HTC Sense 4 plus
skin there are several improvements
including the addition of Google now
which continues to get better and better
it's a step up from the One X and a
general quite fast but it does tend to
drop frames occasionally making it not
quite as smooth as some of the latest
Android phones since itself isn't bad
but it still strikes me as being a lot
heavier than it needs to be the UI tends
to be a bit bigger and display a lot
more chrome than as necessary and then
some changes like the app switcher are
just flat-out slower and less intuitive
to use it in stock Android or even
TouchWiz on the galaxy s3 or Note 2 it's
certainly not all bad but I really do
think senses in need of a redesign the
camera is unchanged and remains a solid
performer
let me just often look like they're over
sharp with jagged edges visible in areas
of fine detail but it does pull in a
very nicely saturated and contrast the
image it's got a decent macro mode and
it's also quite quick at taking a shot
which I really appreciate as it allows
me to get interesting shots I might miss
otherwise powering the HTC One x+ is an
NVIDIA Tegra 3 quad-core processor
clocked at
seven gigahertz along with one gigabyte
of RAM and 64 gigabytes of storage this
is a moderate bump in speed from the 1x
and it does deliver solid performance
but it is starting to fall off compared
to the latest crop of Android devices
call quality is quite good on the AT&amp;amp;T
network and it does have 4G LTE onboard
although it hasn't rolled out in my area
yet so I did all of my testing on this
still relatively fast HSPA+ network
unfortunately the slightly larger
battery doesn't deliver great battery
life like the original 1x it will be
enough to get you through a day of
moderate use but don't expect much more
than that the HTC One x+ has a lot of
things going for it it's got a fantastic
screen good build quality Android 4.1
and a relatively powerful quad-core
processor with solid options like the
galaxy s3 and even the original 1x to
compete with the 1x plus is definitely
worth a look but it really isn't able to
stand out if you enjoyed feel free to
check out more reviews of great high-end
smartphones here and don't forget a hit
at that like button and subscribe anyway
I will catch you guys in the next one
with the screen approaching the size of
7 inch tablets this really feels as big
as a phone can get while still being
pocketable I never thought I would say
this but after using the note 2 the
galaxy s3 seems tiny</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
