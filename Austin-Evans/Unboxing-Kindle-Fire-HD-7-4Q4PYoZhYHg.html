here with an unboxing of the Amazon
Kindle Fire HD 7 inch we've made you
competitors like the Nexus 7 the Fire HD
has a lot to live up to but is it good
enough by the last fire it comes in a
small cardboard box but with a quick
pull of the tab you're in business pop
open the lid and inside you'll see the
Fire HD in its foam packaging a microUSB
cable for charging and syncing along
with the tiny getting started guide what
you won't find is a wall charger
although it should work with any USB
charger you have fire it up and you'll
see the seven inch IPS display with a
resolution of 1280 by 800 it's now based
on Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich but
Amazon is so thoroughly scanned it it's
not a stretch to call it a new OS around
back you'll see it's covered in a soft
touch rubber with a metal band which
conceals the stereo speakers on the
right side you'll see your headphone
jack along with the volume rockers and
power button as you can probably tell
they're nearly flush and blend in a
little too well on the bottom you'll see
micro HDMI out along with micro USB and
around front is your 1.3 megapixel
front-facing camera which is the only
camera on the Fire HD taking a quick
look at it next to the Nexus 7 you'll
see they're identical and screen size
and all of the dimensions except for the
fire HD has a wider bezel at first
glance the Kindle Fire HD looks pretty
solid but definitely stay tuned to the
channel as I'll be doing a thorough
review and comparison with the Nexus 7
once I spend some more time with it if
you enjoyed be sure to leave this video
a thumbs up and if you're interested in
