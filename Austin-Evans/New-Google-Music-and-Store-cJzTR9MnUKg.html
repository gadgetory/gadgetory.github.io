music as well as a brand new google
music store so they just finished
announcing all of this and there's some
good and there's some kind of myth but
how will go ahead and take a look at all
of it right now so the first thing is is
that google music is now official and
added beta so previously was available
if you had an invite it is still us only
however anyone in the united states go
ahead and get yourself on google music
basically what it is is it's a cloud
music service so go ahead and just open
up some songs here just gave you guys a
little example basically what you can do
if you click on the upload music you can
download a music manager I don't have it
on this computer but basically all it
does is it will search your computer
will pull playlists and music Adam
iTunes Windows Media Player or just
folders or whatever it will upload it to
google music now one really nice thing
about this is that it does not have like
three gigabytes or five gigabytes but it
has a 20,000 song limit which is a lot i
have about 530 on here that's pretty
much my entire music library that I
listened to so of course it's going to
have plenty of room for pre much all of
your music now beyond that it's really
simple it's just as you would expect
kind of itunes in the cloud and it is
available both it music google com as
well as of course on the android phones
and it's going to be an app for that and
you can also look it up on you know just
the browser itself on mobile browsers so
beyond that it's really simple you do
get quite a bit of free music if you're
interested yeah so here is all kinds of
music that i got for free when i first
got google music a few months ago some
of it's not great but a lot of it
actually is really pretty decent so it's
kind of nice you can get a good variety
of free music when you first sign up but
this is not the new part in the new part
is that you can now buy music from
google so previously of course you would
have to buy it through itunes or do some
other way besides this but of course now
through the android market you can go
ahead and download it so this is if you
have an android phone you can just
download straight on your device or if
you have a computer like i do of course
we can just take a look at it here so
there's quite a bit on here and try to
go over as much of it as i can so it's
kind of like iTunes I mean there's
nothing spectacular about this so we can
go ahead just pick out something here
you go to all top songs and find
something random as far as the pricing
and all that kind of stuff goes expect
it to be basically the same iTunes most
of these are doll 29 some
69 cents most are 99 cents so we can
just scroll down here and just pick out
something random so we just pick out war
and what we can do if I can actually
just pick out the song here and what you
could do is you get a little bit of
information about it you can take a look
at the songs that are included as well
as if I can fund the clinker here we go
you actually take a look at artist pages
themselves so you wanna learn more about
someone or some artist that's totally
fine now overall I like this I mean it's
nice to be able to have another way to
go ahead and get all your music and if
you're already into the Google ecosystem
it's going to be very simple however
there is one major problem so let's just
go ahead and search someone that I like
deadmau5 what search that happened you
guys will see that there's not much here
we can take a look at his artist page
and believe there's yeah there's like
two songs here maybe a couple more but
there's not much here and that's because
there is not fantastic support for other
music they don't exactly have on here so
you definitely have a much better
selection on itunes on amazon and of
course on all your streaming websites
and all that kind of stuff so if you're
looking for you know just something that
totally can just fight with itunes and
all that kind of stuff get all the music
you want not really undefined it here
but it is a good start and i am looking
forward to seeing exactly what Google
does with us in the future hey guys it's
going to be about it for my video you
guys have any questions feel free to
leave them in the comments section below
there's not that much new so hopefully I
went over at all but if I didn't feel
free to drop me a line and I will get
back to you as soon as I can anyway guys
