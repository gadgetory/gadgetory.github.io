new 2016 15 inch MacBook Pro so I've
been using the previous model to edit
almost all of my videos for the last
year and I've been pretty happy with it
however this new MacBook is smaller and
basically always while these MacBook
look pretty similar at first glance
apples actually made some pretty big
updates to the pro some of the most
noticeable things right off the bat is
the keyboard so if you guys caught my
video on the third change version of
this laptop you'll know that I actually
like the keyboard a fair bit sure it's
fairly low travel however with that
butterfly mechanism it actually feels
pretty nice it's not even as good as
something like a mechanical keyboard but
it's actually really not bad for a
laptop one big thing on the new MacBook
is the trackpad it's seriously enormous
like it's basically the size of my whole
hand now my folks have had some of the
best try pads on any laptop and this is
no exception however one of my big
issues is the fact that because that
trackpad is so big it kind of gets in
the way sometimes so to be fair there is
pretty decent palm rejection so if you
kind of leave your hand a little bit
near it it will usually ignore it
however a lot of times I find myself
accidentally touching stuff on the
trackpad just because it's pretty much
the entire bottom of the laptop the
speakers are a welcome improvement so
while they're a little bit lacking in
bass the highs are surprisingly clear
and the volume is more than good enough
the screen is also nice so we're getting
that same size and resolution at 2880 by
1800
however it's now sporting the new Apple
p3 color gamut it gets much brighter and
honestly this is one of the better
laptop screens out there it could be a
little bit high resolution but there's
not a lot to complain about if you
hadn't guessed Apple kinda has the
fundamentals of the whole building a
laptop thing down by now however that's
not all it takes to build a good lap top
and that's where Apple is kind of taken
a step away from what they've been doing
in the past so the first and one of the
most noticeable things right off the bat
is the brand new touch bar so instead of
having a standard row of function keys
instead you have what's essentially a
very small OLED screen built into the
keyboard now this can be used for a lot
of things so for example if you hold the
function key you can bring up all your
standard function keys so you're not
really losing anything it's a cool
addition but it doesn't really
fundamentally change the way I use a
macbook however what does are the lack
of ports the new MacBook Pros have four
Thunderbolt three ports and a headphone
jack and that's it no USB a no HDMI no
card reader you pretty much get what you
get here this
this is a bit of a nightmare however if
you want to get a ton of pork so you
don't really replicate all the stuff
that you might be able to get without a
laptops this is not that crazy to set up
so of course with four Thunderbolt three
ports that are all based on USBC well
it's a great port you can do a lot of
adapters off of it you kind of have to
do a lot of adapters off of it to do
much of anything so say that you want to
connect your new MacBook to Ethernet
well if you want to do it the Apple way
you're going to pick up a Thunderbolt
three defendable to adapter and then a
thunderbolt to two gigabit ethernet
adapter that's running about $60 for the
pair want to say connect an optical
drive no big deal just get the USB c2a
adapter and of course a good old Apple
super drive another 90 bucks but oh no
that's not enough ports how dare you
only need an Ethernet and an optical
drive so we have a wide variety of
different dongles to choose from on the
other side of the macbook you want to
connect something like maybe an HDMI
monitor no big deal just get the multi
port adapter which is going to run you a
cool $50 now on sale not only can we
actually charge our macbook through the
adapter which is helpful since we're
using all the other ports for dongles
but this also gives us another USB port
which of course we're using for card
reader because you know the MacBook
doesn't have a card reader anymore but
one USB port who do you think we are non
USB port but of course one USB port is
nowhere near enough that's where this
adapter comes in so not only are we
going to get four USB 3.0 ports off the
adapter but all you need to do is just
plug it into the wall to give enough
power to supply to all of our devices as
well as pick up a USB see two USB
micro-b cable to actually connect via
data because this is complicated - oh no
this is clearly the most functional
package that you could possibly hope for
with your macbook pro or not okay
I'll be the first to admit this is more
than a little bit ridiculous however all
of these kind of taken by themselves are
actually not that crazy sure if you
didn't want to have to go the Apple
approach you can get a USB see two
Ethernet adapter for example some of the
t1 and t3 s you can swap the cable out
to be native USB C but the bottom line
is for a lot of the pro things that you
want to do and even some more the
standard things you're going to need a
lot of adapters with this new MacBook
however with the help of the new LG 5k
ultra fine monitor you can see our cable
situation is just a little bit cleaner
so an LG hit me up and wanted a
sponsored video with their new five
display a bigot this would be the
perfect opportunity to show it off now
there's actually a lot that is cool
about Thunderbolt 3 most notably this
entire setup is running off of a single
Thunderbolt 3 cable so with the single
cable the MacBook is able to drive the
5k display and the monitor is able to
send power back to the MacBook so I
don't need to plug it in and on top of
that we have three additional USB sea
ports on the back of the display mean we
can plug in all of our peripherals in a
much cleaner way there is a smaller 4k
ultra fine option out there however if
you have the 15-inch MacBook Pro you can
actually power two of these 5k displays
with the single laptop when you pair the
ultra fine with the new MacBooks you
actually get a lot of cool extra
features so not only can you control
things like brightness from inside the
settings here but you're also getting
that same p3 color gamut which is
exactly what you're going to get on a
15-inch MacBook and with that crispy
crispy 5k resolution you're getting some
seriously beautiful pixels believe me I
try I looked at every single one of the
pixels and they're all how 2 percent
beautiful you're also getting some
surprisingly decent built-in speakers
especially when you consider that
they're from a monitor and on top you're
getting a webcam it's a really solid
package I gotta say if you're getting
one of the new MacBook Pros you should
definitely look into the ultra fine
displays it should be no surprise that
the new MacBook Pros are expensive so
while it starts at 2400 dollars for the
15-inch model you can spec it up to over
$4,000 so the model I had here has the
2.9 Hertz core i7 16 gigabytes of memory
the Radeon pro 460 graphics and a one
terabyte SSD these are pretty suspects
for a laptop however there are a couple
of key things missing one of the biggest
is that there is only one option for RAM
on the MacBook and that is 16 gigabytes
so while that's not a huge deal for me a
lot of pro workloads can absolutely
benefit from 32 gigabytes of RAM the new
MacBooks are also rocking skylake
processors instead of the latest 7th
generation Intel KB Lake chips now this
isn't a huge deal for performance while
KB Lake is a small improvement it isn't
a massive difference over skylake
however what is a little bit of an odd
choice is that this actually has lower
end integrated graphics unlike the last
generation model which had Irish
graphics standard by default and an
option to go to dedicated graphics the
new iPad pros have the less powerful HD
graphics 5:30 on the integrated side
however it makes up for that with
dedicated graphics across the board
compared to both the base model as well
as the upgraded dedicated model of last
year
you'll see
the Radeon Pro 460 graphics in the new
MacBook are a big step forward however
if you look at the geek pinch for scores
you'll see that while on the single
thread side the new MacBooks are
slightly faster I'm a multi threaded
they're actually a little bit slower in
the real world you really shouldn't
notice any difference on the processor
side where those improved dedicated
graphics should make a pretty big
difference battery life on the 58 book
has never really been the strong suit
it's about the same on the 2016 model so
with fairly light use you're getting
anywhere between 5 and 6 hours however
if you're doing something heavier like
video editing then you should expect
more like 2 or 3 so is this the future
of laptops kind of ah I don't know on
one hand the hardware is nice there's a
lot of core things that make the MacBook
a very nice laptop to use however the
biggest hang-up for me are the ports
sure 2 3 4 years from now I think will
be pretty much entirely switched over to
us BC and Thunderbolt 3 however in the
meantime hashtag dongle like 2016 so
what do you guys think about the new
MacBook Pros let me know in the comments
below and if you missed it you can check
out my isn't worth that episode on the
13 inch version of the new MacBook
anyway guys thank you so much for
watching and I will catch you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
