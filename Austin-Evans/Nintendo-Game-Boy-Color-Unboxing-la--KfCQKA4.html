an unboxing of something just a little
different so right here I have a brand
new Nintendo Game Boy Color this is
still in the original packaging still
got the factory seal this thing is
basically as if I would have bought it
you know 15 years ago so as a lot of you
guys will probably know earlier this
year I had a pretty major fire at my
place lost a lot of my stuff including
my entire Gameboy collection so I know
it sounds silly but the game boys were
one of the things that I was most
sentimental about I guess so you know I
grew up with these things in fact I got
a Game Boy Color just like this when I
was six years old I had it in Kiwi I
can't tell you how many times you have
took this on like road trips and we were
sneaking this to school everyone went
around the back of the school after
lunch and you know traded Pokemon and
battle and all that kind of stuff so
when I saw this I was able to track this
down I could not resist this thing is
just insanely clean I mean I've seen
brand new boxes that don't look half as
nice as this so I'm gonna do something
that makes me a little it makes me
cringe with it inside I feel like I'm
like ruining some precious artifacts but
I'm going to unbox this and free this
Gameboy from 15 year old prison alright
so here goes nothing
so just see you on top and bottom and go
to the top one and like a lie I don't
think I've ever been this nervous for an
unboxing I mean usually the stuff I
unboxing I just go down you know
something goes horribly wrong worst case
scenario we know there's you know
million more the store but I don't think
I'm gonna find to me brand new gameboy
color so here we go oh oh
I'm serious I've never been this nervous
for a video
and there it is let's open this thing up
so I've gotten I got a lie I haven't
done this unboxing before but it was
like 106 so I don't really remember
what's inside I'm also curious to see
how actually held up so already make
sure seeing whoa okay so apparently 15
year-old batteries not a great thing to
keep oh okay that's not good
you're gonna okay yeah so um I don't
touch that that's yeah all right ah I
may need to get something all right so
get my table a little bit cleaner here
and I don't think there's really
anything left with these batteries but
it's kind of crazy I've never seen a
battery this old cell corroded the whole
packaging in the little shells all
falling apart you make through the
plastic so set that down before I get
some horrible chemical on my hands
actually you can see I know you might
not be able to see but the box is a
little bit chewed up actually from that
whoo now I'm even more nervous that it
like got to the Gameboy or something
all right looks like the Gameboy was
sealed in plastic and oh haha oh here we
go
the gameboy color so there's like tons
of cardboard and everything around but
oh I can't
I feel like I'm 6 years old again I
really do this is it's perfect
this is completely brand new it doesn't
look like oh look the labels wow that's
crazy I remember mine I mean I try to
take good care of it you know if the
labels were all worn it was all
scratched up this is perfect that's
pretty new it's that I figure what to
say right now this is Wow set that aside
and see what else we get in the box
so we've got a little bit of paperwork
in here I'm trying to be super gentle
with this box although I'm kind of regen
it just more and more this cardboard
okay so instead of a mess here so we
have the king boy consumer information
and precautions booklet
do not leave batteries in the Game Boy
or accessory for long periods of non-use
yeah like you know 15 years in the box
let's find out a good idea so that aside
unless we have who the Game Boy Color
registration card Wow
but what systems do you or others in
your household own NES Game Boy Game Boy
pocket Super NES Nintendo 64 Atari
Jaguar Sega Genesis Wow they've got the
old school stuff here if you guys make
sense means here you know what no
postage necessary I wonder my still sin
the sin but let me Tendo know how how
satisfied I am with the Game Boy Color
let's see what else is good here we've
got the Game Boy Color instruction
booklet Wow okay first thing I'm
noticing this is tiny this is what one
piece of paper yeah this is this is one
piece paper this is all the instructions
you need for your Game Boy I feel like
wow I feel like this is not something we
see anymore let's see here I'll even
have wow I didn't remember this changing
the screen color on original Gameboy
game packs so actually have all the
codes you need to make the older Game
Boy games because the Game Boy Color
would run not only Game Boy Color games
but also the original games you could
actually load in different color
palettes so some games for example the
original Pokemon games would actually
have some color on the Game Boy Color so
wow I just got a I just gotta take a
minute just just take this in this is
buttons oh that clicking if you hear
that ah wow this is I don't even know to
say right now this is perfect like just
it's weird to see something that's old
not I mean obviously this is maybe what
fifteen years old something like that
it's not really that old but it's weird
to see something like this that's brand
new I mean even things have been nice to
taken care of you see things like you
know the labels wearing little scuff
scratches that kind of stuff but I mean
this is perfect in every sense of the
word not something I usually do that's
the thing I probably will be doing
anytime soon but there you go guys the
unboxing of the Game Boy Color from 1998</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
