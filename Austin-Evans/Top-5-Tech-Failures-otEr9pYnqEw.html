here with the top 5 tech failures so
there are a lot of really great gadgets
and there are a lot of not-so-great
gadgets so let's take a look at some of
those made number 5 we have Windows
Vista this launched in 2007 as one of
the biggest overhauls to windows ever
and took a whopping five years to
complete what finally shipped was a
version of Windows which had more than a
few issues so one of the biggest
problems with Vista was the fact that a
lot of things just flat-out didn't work
anymore so printers were a big thing a
lot of printers which worked fine on a
Windows XP computer unless they were
lucky enough to be updated to work with
Vista were flat-out paperweights another
was it it was big and bloated so Windows
Vista need a much more powerful PC to
run on than say XP and just for the
record Windows 8 is 6 year old newer
operating system actually runs better on
older pcs than Vista so yeah it was
definitely a step backward to be fair it
wasn't all bad after about a year or so
Microsoft had a lot of the early issues
figured out however that didn't stop
them from rushing out Windows 7 which is
basically just what Vista should have
been at number 4 we have the Google
Nexus Q so this was a weird one Google
announced the Nexus Q last year as a
media player some amount of a competitor
to the Apple TV in the Roku and that
sort of thing however they already had a
competitor in the Google TV so what
exactly was the Nexus Q basically it was
a bowling ball shaped media streamer
that allowed you to watch youtube videos
as well as listen to music and watch
videos from Google Play and that's about
it
you had no Netflix no whoo no way to
watch your own files
nothing just YouTube and Google Play and
did I mention it cost $300 so I don't
think it takes a genius to realize that
the Nexus Q never really got off the
ground in fact Google ended up canceling
it before it even came out and those few
people who had pre-ordered the Nexus Q
ended up getting them for free and
Google quietly let the whole thing just
disappear and number three we have Apple
Maps so to understand this one put
yourself in Apple shoes ever since the
iPhone came out they have been relying
on Google to supply Google Maps for the
phone however as their new arch enemy
they decided that hey we should totally
be able to make a new Maps app we can
stick it to Google and make something
way better
at first it looks really cool so they
showed up a mode called flyover which
basically allows you to fly around
cities and a full 3d view pinch zoom all
that stuff and then it came out and
people realized it was a massive
downgrade compared to the old Google
Maps there was just a lot of stuff that
was flat-out missing and to make things
even worse there was no way to downgrade
back to using Google Maps as opposed to
the new Apple maps to make things even
worse some things were just flat-out
wrong so one entire town was marked as a
hospital and some landmarks just
disappeared straight off the map the
first time I used it I was meeting a
friend for dinner so I punch in the
address into Apple maps and it proceeded
to send me 20 minutes the wrong way
before I realized that it had no idea
where I was going
oops and number two we had the HTC first
after years of rumors the Facebook will
be making their own phone earlier this
year they finally did it
cool right except it kind of wasn't what
they actually released was two different
things one was Facebook home now this is
something that you could download on
your Android phone and basically it
would fully Facebook a fight and then
there was the HTC first which had
Facebook home pre-loaded however that
was pretty much all it had going for it
basically you had the choice of either
downloading a free app from the Google
Play Store or buying a phone which did
the exact same thing clearly a recipe
for success after a month on sale they'd
sold a mere 15,000 HTC firsts now to
give you some context to that during
that same time the Samsung Galaxy s4
sold 15,000 phones every hour AT&amp;amp;T
wasted no time in slashing the price of
the first down to basically free other
carriers around the world decided not to
carry it and after only a couple months
the HTC first was pretty much dead at
number one we have the Microsoft Xbox
one guys what were you thinking I mean I
give it the Xbox one was definitely made
to be a very forward-thinking console
where the discs really weren't as
important is everyone doing
download-only kind of like hell
Steamworks today however the way they
actually executed it the way they talked
about it the way they showed it off the
way they just launched in general was
just a absolute disaster so first they
show off the console and then
immediately spent
the entire rest of the time talking
about how it works with TV television
television TV television television
television television TV TV TV then once
they finally showed off some cool games
get some people interested they then
announced that the price would be $500
$100 more than the PlayStation 4 and
then they started going on about how
used games work and how you could only
trade them in with certain retailers if
you want to give a game to a friend you
had to be friends with them on Xbox Live
for 30 days you always had to have
Kinect on it was a bit of a mess the
funny thing is all this would have
probably blown over after a few months
and silly not got up on stage III and
said hey guys you know all that stuff
Microsoft's doing yeah what I'm gonna be
doing that immediately now the Xbox one
looks like some horrible travesty of a
game console it's got to always be
connected that you can't use your own
games with it was a nightmare so how
does Microsoft respond basically go haha
just kidding guys all that stuff we were
talking about yeah we're totally not
gonna do that
you should be like the 360 guys just you
know forget all that stuff that we said
about me always online and the DRM and
these games that we were just joking no
big deal overall I think the Xbox one
will be a solid console now however
taking a look at that launch definitely
makes it a massive massive disaster and
it takes that in one spot for the
biggest tech failure so I'm curious to
know what's the biggest tech failure in
your opinion definitely be sure to let
me know in the comments below also I
want to mention that this video is
brought to you by audible audible.com is
a leading provider of audiobooks with
more than 100,000 downloadable titles
across all types of literature including
fiction nonfiction and periodicals I've
always loved to read and lately have
really been enjoying using audible on my
phone in the car as well as before I go
to bed I'll grab my iPad and listen to a
chapter or two lately I've been
listening to a Fault in Our Stars by
John Green a fantastic book that I read
last year they've been really listening
to if that's a word lately with audible
if you guys haven't tried audible yet
all you need to do is go to audible.com
slash Austin to download The Fault in
Our Stars or another book for free when
you try audible it's an awesome service
that I use all the time so definitely be
