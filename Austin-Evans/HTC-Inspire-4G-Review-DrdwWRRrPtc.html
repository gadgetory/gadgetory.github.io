inspire 4G and this is one of the
premier Android smartphones available on
AT&amp;amp;T so thank you guys my full review
tell you what I like what I didn't like
all that kind of good stuff
so to begin with let's talk a little
about the data so if I just pull up a
speed test and give you guys a little
demo of the data speeds and of course
this is a 4G enabled phone on the H on
the ATT HSPA+ network now do you want to
practice this by saying that AT&amp;amp;T in my
area is not stellar so I was not able to
get a lot of speeds that a lot of other
reviewers have so do take this with a
grain of salt typically people do get
better than this you see here had a lot
of really bad results where I really
didn't have any reception at all but
right here about my best result was 1500
killed that's down and 200 up now again
typically people have gotten a lot more
I've seen a lot of other people who have
better ATT servers get somewhere in the
neighborhood of four or five and six
killers four to five and six thousand
kilobits down and anywhere from five to
fifteen hundred kilobits up so certainly
not horrible speeds not still not going
to be on par with something like the
Verizon 4G but definitely something to
keep in mind if you have good 18 T
servers in your area you'll get some
pretty decent speeds as far as phone
calls go I didn't really had any major
complaints I could hear people just fine
they could say they said they could hear
me just fine as well and overall I
really didn't have any major issues with
drop calls either which is definitely
pretty good considering that like I said
I live in a pretty poor area of HTT
service so when it did find a signal it
did tend to latch on to it pretty
strongly no wait let me get in a little
bit into the specs of the phone so of
course it does have a one gigahertz
Snapdragon processor this is the
second-generation variety so I compared
to something like an Evo 4G or a Nexus
One it's going to be considerably faster
it's going to be of course the second
generation I mean also was paired up
with 768 megabytes of RAM and an 8
gigabyte microSD card which of course
Travis does come with the phone so
overall all this together I found that
it's a really quite snappy experience
with the inspire 4G
I'm not while it's not a dual-core phone
that's not going to be blisteringly fast
or whatever I really don't have any
major issues you know it's able to play
games just fine
and of course you can just do the cool
little things with sense which I get a
little bit into sentiment
but overall didn't really have any major
issues especially in the browser and I
do want to show you guys the browser
here the browser is probably my favorite
feature of the phone this is an
absolutely outstanding browser certainly
the best Android browser I've ever used
um so as you guys can see here here's
actually a embedded YouTube video which
of course runs in flash since this is an
Android 2.2 phone and does come with
Adobe Flash Player pre-installed so in
fact let me just play video for you guys
and show you so um just real brief clip
there I can show you guys that really
quickly here um you can actually open up
various tabs implement let me open up
something else here
so as you guys can see here open up
multiple tabs if I you just pinch out
you can scroll between them and I select
them nice little bit of eye candy but
anyway the browser works really quite
nicely pinch to zoom I'll show you guys
even with flash on the page and as you
guys can see it's a fairly long web not
really that bad but I'm pinch to zoom
very very clear one thing I did notice
was a little bit odd was the text reflow
in on uh this is something more general
to Android phones but the text reflow is
a bit wonky on a lot of websites it does
work fairly well I'd say for 90%
websites but every once while you go
somewhere and it kind of messes it up
but not a big deal I definitely really
did enjoy the browser then moving on
from that let me talk a little bit about
these software on this of course this
does run like I said Android 2.2 Froyo
with HTC Sense pre-installed so what
sense is now well I'm not gonna get into
a really in-depth that's a little bit
outside the scope of this video but
since is a general thing of course it
adds this down here and it redid most if
not all of the Browse the applications
in the phone so let's give you guys a
quick demo for this beta oops a little
widget here course Android one of the
great things about Android is that it
does support widgets so we can just open
up oh I don't know let's just grab a
music and so you guys can see here if we
had some music playing I don't want to
play it due to copyright we could just
play it right from there and we have
other widgets where if I want to search
Google I could absolutely do that and we
also do have the famous HTC Sense clock
which I really do love impact by lock
the phone unlock
you'll see it has full screen weather
animations so you can see there kind of
a cool little animation and does that
varying on what the weather is in your
location now as far as the pre-installed
apps go generally there are some pretty
decent stuff but on the other hand
there's some others kind of jump so as
you guys can see here there are quite a
few apps some of these I have
pre-installed but most of them I haven't
I'm so for example it comes with asphalt
5 so you'd like to play a game of course
it comes with that I'm one of the look
pretty cool things comes with a blocked
caller so you can block college which is
pretty cool another thing I like to not
just get into this really briefly is the
car panel what this allows you to do is
because of course the nice large display
if you want to use this is something
like a dedicated GPL may not dedicate
but if you want to use this GPS in your
car just open up the car panel and it's
a nice big UI so if you're driving
whatever you can really easily get to
what you're doing without you know
wrecking you know your navigation and
your voice search all that good stuff
right from inside the app moving on in a
while it will go through all of these
pretty much senses the HTC has gone
through pretty much all the apps and is
risk in tweets and whatnot and overall I
really don't have any major issues with
it it looks really quite nice so yeah
that's about it of course it does have a
Wi-Fi hotspot feature so you can support
up to five Wi-Fi devices so that is
basically the way it works really simple
it is with the phone you're connected to
3G or 4G and what you do is you open up
the Wi-Fi hotspot and let's say I'm here
with my Nintendo DS and I can play
online or a laptop or whatever using the
Wi-Fi hotspots that works really quite
nicely the camera on the inspire 4G is
really not bad at all of course it does
have an eight megapixel rear facing
camera along with dual LED flash and
what I found was it especially if you're
outside it takes some really nice
pictures so as you guys can see here
I'll show a few pictures up on screen
right now and these are all taken
totally untouched from the inspire Ford
Jean in fact what I'll do is give you
guys a brief demo of the camera app so
just open this up the camera app on HTC
Sense looks really quite nice so there's
really not a whole lot I could show you
guys here but along here we can switch
between video as well as photos so you
can support in all these resolutions all
the way up from
you know once 76 by 144 which I have no
idea I guess if you're gonna send it via
MMS but you can go ahead and shoot all
the way up to 720p and then if I switch
over to the photos here you find that
you have a few different things you can
do some image chips there I mean do some
image adjustments so if you want to
manually do the exposure and whatnot the
white balance and you also do the
resolution all the way up to of course
the full eight and make a pixel of the
camera another a couple of other things
you can do the flash and do all kinds of
stuff one cool thing I liked is the
various different things you can do as
far as the filters go again I can't
really show you because I've just got a
desk here is not anything particularly
exciting but uh you guys can see in the
pictures it really does look quite nice
so no real issues with the camera both
the video and the pictures are decent
not the best I've ever used but
certainly not half bad for a camera
phone now let me give you a overview
around the phone to show you guys some
of the cool things and some of the
things I don't like one thing I
absolutely love is the 4.3 inch display
I know what the resolution is aw VGA
which of course is 480 by 800 it's not
the highest resolution phone on the
market it's certainly not but I'm
especially if you're coming from
something like an iPhone or whatever
you'll definitely appreciate the nice
4.3 inch display really large allows you
to get a lot of the internet and whatnot
on it although on the flip side of it
the screen is not the most responsive
I've ever used so this is especially
apparent in internet browsing if you're
viewing like a full desktop site there's
a really tiny link well all the times
the phone has a little bit of an issue
trying to register exactly what you're
clicking on now I found this is not
really something unique to the inspire a
lot of phones indeed I would say the
vast majority of phones do have problems
with the really small links which of
course in normal day-to-day use you
almost never had that issue but of
course it is something I do want to
mention up top here you'll find the
speaker grill there's also an LED which
is really quite nice it lights up if you
have a notification or if you're
charging or your battery's low which is
really nice along the bottom here you'll
find your row of Android capacitive
touch buttons they worked really quite
nicely a little bit of haptic feedback
which you guys might be able to hear on
the mic
I'm a time you click on them and they do
light out depending on how bright the
situation is so very very cool no
complaints whatsoever they're up top
you'll find the sleep/wake button it's a
little bit recessed not my favourite
button in the world but certainly no
real issues getting to it same goes for
the volume rocker right here of course I
already showed you guys the camera and
the dual LED flash this is the
speakerphone the speakerphone is a bit
tinny something we definitely expect
with for much any phone I mean it else
is a little bit of an odd place of
course you know when you're holding
phone like this odds are you can really
easily cover that up
but again not the biggest deal in the
world but I do want to say is that I
really do like the hardware in general
so as you guys can see here the screen
takes up a huge amount of the real
estate of the phone which is something I
appreciate you know you've got a nice
4.3 inch display but you don't really
have to have a phone that's going to be
enormous you know there's not a whole
lot of bezel whatsoever especially up
top which is really quite impressive
so yeah the phone is it's a decent size
that Stefan would be a fairly big but
I'm not half bad at all and the whole
thing is made at I believe aluminium
don't quote me on that but a certainly
some sort of metal which gives it a
fantastic feel I mean it's not
particularly a thick phone it's not the
thinnest either but uh very very very
solid foam it's got a little bit of a
weight to it but overall I can't say
enough about the build quality in the
field of the phone I see absolutely
nailed it and as you can see here there
are a couple of other little strips of I
guess my strips but a little bit of soft
touch plastic on this is where you get
the battery out and I do want to say the
battery is and it just takes forever to
get out that's really really hard to get
it out of there there's something you
have to live with hopefully we won't
have to be changing the battery very
often I'm down here you can pull the
bottom piece off and get your micro SD
card as well as your SIM card now one
downside of the phone is certainly the
battery life now it does have a twelve
hundred and thirty million power battery
but with a 4.3 inch display 4G it
definitely does burn through it pretty
quickly so my experience I found that I
was able to get through a full day of
battery but I had to be fairly easy it's
definitely light to moderate use so if
you're a heavy user if you're always
checking your email your Twitter your
Facebook rather
we're playing games I mean if you're a
really heavy user you will probably not
be able to get through a full day of
usage with the inspire 4G which is
definitely a bit of a disappointment
I'm however considering the price point
I will let that one slide you just do
need to be a little bit cautious of the
battery life don't you know you won't be
able to run a full day of playing games
and all that kind of stuff non-stop so
guys that's about it for my review of
the htc inspire 4G there's a lot to like
about this phone and that currently does
retail for $100 on a two-year contract
with AT&amp;amp;T I'll definitely be sure to hit
up I'll have a link in the description
there are the prices are literally
always changing so you know between the
time you I make this review and you
watch it just be sure to hit that the
link it'll let you know exactly what the
price is right now but anyway overall I
really have no issues recommending this
foam well it's not perfect 18 to 14 is
not the best I'm not really a huge fan
of it but if you're buying a phone on
AT&amp;amp;T anyway the inspires is a great way
to go and especially the fact it's got a
great build and it really does work well
pretty much the only major downside in
fact the battery life is less than
stellar and it does not have a dual-core
processor which is not the biggest deal
in the world but it is something you
definitely do want to keep in mind as
you're looking forward but again for the
hundred dollar price point there's
nothing that can touch this so if you're
looking for a really really solid phone
on the AT&amp;amp;T network I have no issues
recommending the htc inspire 4G</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
