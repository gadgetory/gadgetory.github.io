a single goal to find be very coolest
tech here so this is the new razor blade
stealth so this is a laptop that's been
out for a couple years
however today they announced a new
audition with some tweaks as well as a
bigger display you still have the 12.5
inch 4k display option but here you can
also opt for a 13.3 inch display with a
3200 by 1800 resolution what's cool is
both displays are the exact same size as
far as the laptop so this room is just
the difference between the bezels
there's also a new gunmetal finish which
I think actually looks really nice so we
look at the previous generation and they
are still selling the black model you'll
see that it has the RGB keyboard it has
the glowing green Razer logo and with
the gunmetal you can opt for something
that's just a little bit more of a
subtle look inside it's still rocking a
dual core i7 KB like processor 16
gigabytes of RAM is now standard and it
also comes standard with 256 gigs of
storage something else that's been
improved is the trackpad which is now a
Windows precision try pad and honestly
that's a pretty big upgrade what's cool
about the blade stealth is in addition
to having standard USB ports an HDMI it
does have a full Thunderbolt 3 port so
that paired with the Razer core can
allow you to basically take a laptop
that's thin light has good battery life
because you can take with you all day
when you get home you plug it into the
core you have a full gaming PC this guys
going to be on sale starting today for
$12.99 for the 13-inch display and if
you want actually pick up the gunmetal
option that's going to be on sale in
July next we're at the Alienware booth
we're into a certain friend of mine from
AMD mr. Robert and yeah you got
something special yeah in fact I do
oh it's thread Ripper baby I walked up
to the booth I see them first thing he
does is pull this out and shows it to me
this is thread Ripper it's enormous
what have you guys done so when we
launched rise in there was a certain
audience of people mostly content
creators who needed more they're like
can you give us a rise in with
quad-channel can you give us more PCI
Express Lanes
the answer is yes so thread Ripper is
quad channel ddr4 64 PCI Express Lanes
every thread Ripper has the same amount
of PCI Express Lanes
no shade thrown whatsoever here at all
this is massive like I was just asking
how much it weighs this is the biggest
sleep you have ever seen in my life this
is the biggest part of chip I've held
like period
it's get some real heft to it what's
cool here is that actually is going to
be inside the new Alienware area 51 can
I give this back to you before I
accidentally run it I'm not going to
pull Linus or anything so because Robert
is a showman and likes to completely
show off his super cool awesome thread
Ripper processor right now we're playing
Sniper Elite in 4k streaming it via OBS
rendering a 3d model and playing a 4k
video all off of the single system so I
was able to actually hold the Xbox one X
the Scorpio engine with the CPU GPU the
whole APU and that was the biggest chip
I'd ever held this is like twice as big
it is enormous
it puts any other CPU have ever held
completely completely to shame do you
guys have an actual release date on
thread Ripper yet not yet I don't this
summer this summer classic coming soon
well I'm holding right now so it can't
be that far away so the Alienware area
51 is actually going to be available for
order on July 27 so you can get a bunch
of different SKUs with it with the
processors and different graphics
options but at some point you can get
this guy with red wrapper in Vega and
everything else is your heart desires
that's correct not only can you get
thread Ripper you'll be able to choose
multiple Vega graphics cards as well so
the system I believe supports three up
to three GPU simultaneously and you
could run all of them at 16 lanes of PCI
I love having Robert my videos because
we just does all my work for me it's
great so here for the Alienware fund
doesn't end here though so soon you
actually will be able to get your hands
on an area 51 system with a core i9
inside and we actually get to see what
this one looks like it looks really
clean in here I've got to say and one of
the cool things that you were talking
about earlier is actually has this GPU
sort of bracket where you can actually
sort of give some support at make sure
that it's not going to be sagging so
should you get like bigger and heavier
cards inside and happy you pointed that
out because this is actually something
that we take very seriously when we ship
these GPUs they come with additional
hardware that attach to them through
this graphics retention bracket so the
cool this year at e3 is hyper again is
bringing back the original Duke Xbox
controller so if you take a look at it
right oh hi how's it going you just got
right in my video how's it going so if
you guys remember this is the original
Xbox controller it's a little giant but
hyper can Xbox are bringing it back for
now that the Xbox one but also for pcs
and this thing is enormous so what
they're doing here is it actually has a
detachable cable on the back and they've
updated a few things like the buttons
and triggers to be a little more modern
and they've also added a screen in the
middle so this is definitely an early
prototype so they don't even have a
price or release date it's probably
going to be a little while but this
totally looks like the original Duke I
will say if you were not a fan of the
Duke original is probably not going to
be for you this is really going to be
more meant for people who have giant
hands and maybe aren't super comfortable
with a normal Xbox controller or people
like me who just want to add a little
bit of nostalgia I'm starting to show
this year though it is absolutely the
new Xbox one X so it is a much more
powerful version of the current Xbox one
if you guys want more information I
happen to have already done two videos
on it so go check that out and let me
know what is your biggest and most
exciting thing that you've seen at e3
this year let me know in the comments
below and I will catch you on the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
