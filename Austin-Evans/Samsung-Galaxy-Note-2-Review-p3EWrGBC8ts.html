here with a review of the Samsung Galaxy
Note 2 with a quad-core processor
massive 5.5 inch display and Android 4.1
jellybean hit up that like button and
let's take a look first things first the
note 2 is huge with the screen
approaching the size of 7 inch tablets
this really feels as big as a phone can
get while still being pocketable I never
thought I would say this but after using
the note 2 the galaxy s3 seems tiny it
probably is too big for some people but
after a few hours with that I was
already loving the extra screen real
estate even though it's made out of
plastic and feels solidly built even
better than the galaxy s3 it's also
clear that Samsung spent a lot of time
making sure that it feels comfortable in
the hand something I've had issues with
and some recent phones up front is the
1.9 megapixel front facing camera light
and proximity sensors and notification
LED you'll also find the 5.5 inch Super
AMOLED display which force a resolution
of 1280 by 720 the rest of the phone is
fairly standard with a micro USB port on
bottom and volume rockers and a
sleep/wake button on either side you're
able to remove the rear cover which
gives you access to a micro SD card slot
of up to 64 gigabytes SIM card on most
carriers and the battery there's also an
optional flip cover which replaces your
original back and give you some
protection for the screen with 3100
million powers of capacity the battery
takes full advantage of the large size
of the phone while the note to launch
vent recently I used the note for an
incredibly long day and it still
wouldn't quit on me if you try hard
enough you can probably drain it in a
day but it's among the best smartphones
for battery life I've ever tested along
with the bigger screen probably the
biggest differentiator between the
galaxy s3 and note 2 is the s-pen it's
been improved quite a bit from the first
note but it is first and foremost to
stylus the note uses it in several
creative ways as its pressure-sensitive
and allows you to do cool things like
hover over thumbnails to expand and
using handwriting recognition to type
but after the novelty wore off I found
most things are still easier and faster
without the s-pen the internals of the
note are justice impressive as the rest
of the hardware inside you'll find a 1.6
gigahertz quad core Exynos processor
paired with 2 gigabytes of RAM this is a
lot higher than what you'll see in the
international galaxy s3 but now comes
with LTE support in the US I received a
sprint review unit from Samsung which
does come with LTE however Sprint is
just rolling it out in a few areas so it
wasn't able to test the speed except on
their very slow 3G network speaking of
care
here's the note 2 is mostly identical no
matter where you pick it up the sprint
model features zero branding on the
device at all
however Verizon has not only two huge
logos on the back but also a logo on the
home button stay classy Verizon as good
as the hardware is after reviewing phone
after phone with Android 4.0 the note 2
is among the first new devices shipping
with Android 4.1 jelly bean I won't go
too in depth here but the gist of it is
the note 2 is incredibly smooth doing
practically everything which is a huge
plus for me TouchWiz is also back while
I prefer stock Android I do admit as far
as skins go it really is entirely usable
the nature UX is here in full effect
with lots of water and bird sound
effects which is thankful you can change
along with neat features like the water
on the lock screen changes to ink when
you use the s-pen to unlock features
like pop-up browser take great advantage
of the large display by allowing you to
view web pages and video while still
browsing Twitter for example and a full
multitasking mode allows you to run two
apps at a time is already on the
international note 2 when we come into
US variants soon the camera is identical
to the Galaxy s3 which means you can
expect very good performance the eight
megapixel stills are generally very
sharp and have good color in contrast
there are several built-in modes and
amazingly enough they're actually not
bad panorama mode is here and works well
as are several creative modes to
highlight certain colors which can look
awesome 1080p video is also quite good
although stabilization is lacking as on
most smartphones the Samsung Galaxy Note
2 is easily among the best smartphones
period $300 it's certainly a bit pricey
and I do recommend trying one as the
size isn't for everyone but I can
wholeheartedly recommend the note 2 is
one of the best phones out there if
you're interested in winning one of
these be sure to subscribe to the
channel as I'll be doing a giveaway very
soon anyway guys I will catch you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
