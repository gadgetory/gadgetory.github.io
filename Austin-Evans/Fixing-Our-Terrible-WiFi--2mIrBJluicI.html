you guys would probably remember our old
set alright now that was great it was
cool to have everything in one office
but as we started expanding we've gotten
another office that's across the hall
it's awesome because it's unlabeled us
to do a ton of cool stuff build some new
sets have a lot more space but the
problem is that the Wi-Fi is now a
straight-up disaster so that's where a
sous comes in really do they sponsor
this video but more importantly they
hooked us up with their brand new Lyra
trio hopefully the saving grace to our
terrible Wi-Fi situation so the thing is
we actually have good internet here at
the office we have a dedicated business
line with 300 megabits per second up and
down and as long as we're actually here
in the office typically we get pretty
decent speeds so over Wi-Fi a lot of
times we're actually going to be pretty
close to that full 300 megabits per
second now see there we go we're getting
190 240 260 I mean that's definitely
totally solid speed now Wi-Fi is really
important for us as not only we're
obviously going to be doing stuff like
watching videos and downloading stuff
but importantly we deal with a lot of
really giant video files for constantly
uploading to YouTube uploading and
sending files back and forth between us
and of course most importantly
downloading those sweet sweet steam
games to do the benchmarks with so in
comparison if I run a speed test and our
second office you're going to see that
the speeds are slightly less than 280
megabits per second so right now we're
getting for maybe 5 megabits up and up
down to 2 1 so the thing is Natalie
doing that great speeds but almost more
important than that it sort of drops out
pretty consistently so the way that a
mesh Wi-Fi system works is pretty
straightforward so right now we have a
single Wi-Fi router now it's going to be
a fairly high-end AC solution and it's
fine for a small space but the laws of
physics mean the Wi-Fi can only go so
far so if you take a look at the actual
lyra itself you'll see that the way of
getting around this is just to add more
stations to the mix I think it sound
really simple as if bunch of engineers
that the seuss didn't spend years and
hundreds of thousands of man-hours on
developing a product I'm like is that my
Wi-Fi it's fine don't worry about it
[Laughter]
out of the years of we've shot videos
I've never heard Ken say the words my
thumb was in the shot so the way this
works is that one of these will function
as your main base station so just like
any other Wi-Fi router you just need to
connect it via ethernet to your modem
and especially you have a smaller house
or apartment one of these is actually
going to be enough to cover it however
if you've got a little bit of a bigger
house or specifically for our situation
you have an office that has a lot of
space to cover you can connect to the
additional hubs and they will all work
together what's unique about these is
that nine do they have 3x3 mimo Wi-Fi
but you're also going to be getting this
triangular design so it's cool about
that is that now I do have full dual
band support for two point four out of
five to carats Wi-Fi but because they do
have this triangular shape you're going
to be getting some better range so you
have to think about a mesh network a
little bit differently than a standard
Wi-Fi network and that your devices are
going to be connecting and bouncing
between all of these depending on where
you are in the house but also only one
of these typically at least although
I'll talk a little bit more about that
later
is going to be connected to your router
so these also need to be able to
communicate between each other and the
3x3 plus the actual triangular design
makes all of this work a lot better than
a traditional 2x2 solution the
triangular design also helps the lie
right to project better Wi-Fi signal
into multiple story houses so this is
something that actually wouldn't mind
using in my own place
so I do use a mesh network in Google
Wi-Fi well for the most part it actually
does work really well one of my main
issues is the performance it's reliable
but a lot of times when I'm farther away
from the main base station I see
significantly reduced speeds in addition
while these will work wirelessly if you
have a newer place that has decent at
Wired around your house you actually can
use the Ethernet backhaul to connect
each one of these to the network
independently so that will give you some
better speeds because instead of them
having to talk to each other wirelessly
it can all be done via wired Ethernet
and you're going to be getting the
maximum speed so recurrent network setup
is pretty straightforward so a lot of
that surrounds this thus tornador that I
built with Linus a little over a year
ago which currently has over 150
terabytes of capacity that we use to
store all of our raw footage as well as
our completed projects so Jimmy has the
iMac Pro which is connected via 10 gig
Ethernet to this tornador so you
actually don't need the Wi-Fi that much
but for Ken and I we're actually pretty
much entirely relying on Wi-Fi
be able pull down files and that kind of
stuff so let's actually get this
that with our ups installed and our
cable modem disconnected the next step
is to install Lyra so all we do with
this guy is just plug it in with the
included power cable and plug it
directly into our cable modem so we plug
the Lyra into power as well as connect
our ethernet port into the land /when
then we just need to turn on our cable
modem and we will be up and running
hopefully the next step is to download
the Lyra app for iPhone or Android and
it should be as simple as just
connecting it like this excellent your
library mesh Wi-Fi node has been
discovered and there we go the Lyra is
set up so our next step is to take our
other base stations and spread them out
throughout the office so one of the main
things we actually need to keep in mind
is that we have to cover not only this
space but also the space across the hall
so the base stations is really
straightforward all you do is plug them
in and then inside the app they will be
added and then once everything is tied
together any firmware updates are done
you're going to be up and running inside
the app you can see that not only do we
have the main light up but we also do
have the secondary one in the office as
well as most importantly for what we
need here we have a Lyra set up in our
secondary studio so with Lyra we are
getting features like a eye protection
which is using Trend Micro to be able to
analyze any kind of threats on the
network but the most important question
is is it going to be faster in here now
let's find out please be faster please
be faster all right pings pretty quick
and oh yeah I do 120 hundred 30 Wow and
that's not serious uploads well 170 180
megabits so no it's not going to be the
full 300 megabits that's theoretically
possible but considering that we were at
2 3 and 84 megabits per second and here
before this has made a huge difference
so that my friends is how we fix the
Wi-Fi and our studios of course huge
shadow sues for sponsoring this video
and if you guys wanna go check out the
Lyra the link will be in the description</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
