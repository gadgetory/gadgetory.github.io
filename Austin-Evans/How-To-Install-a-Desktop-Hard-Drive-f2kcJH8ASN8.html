showing you how to install a desktop
hard drive now this is a very simple
procedure just to install a new hard
drive ins one of the great reasons why
you'd have a desktop now today I'm going
to be installing a 2 terabyte Western
Digital hard drive but the name and all
that kind of stuff is not important what
is is the size and this is what is known
as a three and a half inch drive that's
typically what you will install into a
desktop and there also is another
smaller variety of hard drive called a
two and a half inch typically that's
going to be a called a laptop hard drive
or perhaps a SSD now the mounting
procedure everything is basically the
same although do keep in mind that
typically desktop aren't made for
three-and-a-half inch drives like this
so if you have a two and a half inch
drive you'll probably going to need an
adapter now for my case it's really
simple all I need to do is take these
drive bays or these guides or whatever
you like to call them and then just
simply slide them into the screw holes
so there's one here and one here and
just hold it in place and do the exact
same thing on the other side alright so
now you need to find an empty three and
a half inch drive bay she doesn't see
here I have several so it doesn't really
matter which one do just kind of keep in
mind that you're going to need to run
the cabling so if you know you can put
one on down below and up top you don't
need to keep in mind that cables are
going to need to run to both so
typically I got to keep them pretty
close so we're going to go ahead and
slide into the in eBay and do keep in
mind that you're going to need to run
the cabling so for this case the cabling
needs to be on the backside which is the
easiest way to do it so you can see all
our connections are going to be on this
side so we'll just take it and insert it
and and we're gonna slide it until it
clips so alright so I've disconnected my
main hard drive just to show you guys so
you can get a little bit of a better
view now there are two things I see on
the right here is the SATA data so this
is where we get the data so it's going
to be a cable look something a little
like this and you'll connect it to your
motherboard on one end and of course the
other end goes into your hard drive and
this other larger one is going to be for
your power so that's going to be a cable
from your power supply such as something
a little bit I can pull it over here and
like this alright so we're gonna go
ahead and connect both these hard drives
back so I'm going to do the Angus I'm
going to go ahead do the bottom one
first matta
unconnected but so we just need to take
our SATA now they're all notched so you
can't like put them in the wrong way so
if we put it in here now this should
clutch so there we go now the power
connectors will not clip so you're not a
Harmsen shirts man but
you can apply a decent amount of force
and if it if it doesn't work and you can
just simply just recheck your
connections so I'll take this and try to
make sure we get it on here and you know
have a lot of room to go with but I
think this should work and then simply
just slide it into place all right so
that's going to be about it now all we
need to do is just make sure that of
course your SATA data connector is
connected both on to the hard drive as
well as to your motherboard and that the
SATA power connector is in firm so like
I said won't actually snap but it
shouldn't really have a whole lot of
give and it should be roughly even as
far as how far it is in compared to the
data cable so alright so this point we
just need to do a little bit of cable
management tie all these messy cables up
and go ahead and boot in alright so once
you have your computer panels back on
everything plugged back in go ahead and
boot back into windows now at this point
you just need to initialize the hard
drive so just hit the Windows key and
type in disk management and it will say
create and format disk hard disk
partitions alright so once we do this it
will take just a moment to load and then
we should see our new hard drive whether
it be you know 100 gigabytes or 2
terabytes or anything alright so you can
see here it says select disk we have
this new one so we'll go ahead and click
OK and now it should take just a moment
but you can see right here we want to
create a new simple volume and click
Next and which you can make the full
size of the disk we'll give it the drive
letter e or whatever you can you want to
make it drive letter Z which actually
would be kind of cool but you can do
whatever you want and we click Next and
we just format it and create a name for
it so we'll just say um Western Digital
you can of course name it whatever you
want
finish and it should only take just a
moment and then you should see the dip
will appear in your auto place so here
we go right there so now if we hit my
computer you will now see our new hard
drive will be listed so guys that's
going to be about it from here you can
go ahead and load it up you can use this
backup you can use extra files you can
do pretty much anything you want so you
guys this has been a quick tutorial
showing you how to install a desktop
hard drive now like I said many of these
things do apply equally to if you're
using a laptop or using a two and a half
inch laptop drive in a desktop but just
be sure that you get it in correctly you
don't you know screw anything up and
make sure that
everything the wiring is in properly and
you should have really no problems in it
