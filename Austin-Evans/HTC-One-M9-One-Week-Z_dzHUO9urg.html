peek at how I make my videos this is the
HTC One m9 and this is going to be my
only phone for the next week put side by
side with the ma the m9 is definitely a
smaller upgrade so on the surface it
looks very similar you'll be able to
tell that the front-facing camera looks
a little bit bigger and that the speaker
has been slightly redesigned on the
whole of it it's a very similar looking
phone around back HTC has opted to drop
therefore ultra pixel camera in favor of
a new 20 megapixel sensor now in
addition this also means that you're
going to be losing the dual camera we
should be totally honest isn't no real
loss to me it always seemed a little bit
of a gimmick more than actual feature
alright so today was day two with the
one m9 and so far so good
one thing that has been bothered me a
little bit is the placement of the power
button so it's down on the right side
below the volume rocker it's a little
bit of an awkward spot so I keep wanting
to pick up the phone and I accidentally
keep hitting the power button so it is a
slight improvement over having the power
button on the top of the phone like on
the m7 and the m8 but still we've been
nicer if it would've been a little bit
higher up alright so now let's get the
camera try so it's going to be storming
here in a few minutes so I don't have a
lot of time let's try to take a few
pictures and video and see what we can
get oh look that's overexposed No so
it's saying it's focusing but it's
actually not you hear this it just makes
that noise as soon as I touch the screen
but it actually is not even like
necessarily done focusing you can get
some decent pictures with the m9 it's
not the best camera out there I feel
like it kind of has a lot of the same
issues as the m8 even though this has
way more megapixels it's okay but I
think the big deal is is the fact that
the processing just is not that great
now there are going to be some updates
coming for the camera soon and hopefully
I'll fix it
right now a little disappointing with an
8 core processor and 3 gigabytes of RAM
the one a9 is no slouch when it comes to
performance however there is one
drawback to all this power and that is
the heat doing everyday things like
checking Twitter and watching video is
enough to make the one m9 noticeably one
to the touch now it never really
exceeded around 100 degrees as far as
the back temperature goes but it's still
a little bit on the warm side for a
phone one thing I've really been
appreciating are the boom sound speakers
having two front-facing stereo speakers
that actually sound good is such a nice
thing I will
forget about it when I switch over to
another phone and then pick up an HTC
One and go oh right this is what a phone
is supposed to sound like I've been
pretty easy on the one m9 battery this
week and it hasn't let me down now
usually the big test is if a phone can
survive a full day when I'm traveling
since that's not an option I decided to
run the one a9 as well as the One m8 and
the new Galaxy s6 edge who the pc mart
battery tests the results were a little
disappointing so the m9 was able to last
five hours and eight minutes compared to
six hours and 58 minutes for the m8 and
seven hours and twenty minutes for the
Galaxy s6 edge the m9 is still going to
be enough for most people to get through
a day however if you're a little bit of
a heavier user is a little bit worrying
that it's not only behind the galaxy s6
but it's even behind you one inmate from
last year looking at the screen on the
one m9 I think HTC absolutely made the
right decision in keeping it 1080p
however the color looks a little bit odd
it's a good screen that most people have
no problems with however I did notice
that tend to be a little bit on the blue
side especially compared to the m8 I'm
typically more of a fan of stock Android
however I've got to say that HTC has
made some nice customizations here
I appreciate things like HTC's camera
app which is a big step forward compared
to Google's stock camera app however
there are also some weird things that
sense brings along including some very
bizarre quick settings which have the
text cut off a little bit weirdly laid
out it's just a mess the HTC One m9 is a
good phone however it's not much of an
upgrade over the m8 put it side-by-side
with the galaxy s6 and it just can't
keep up so what do you guys think let me
know in the comments below I've got to
give a big shout out to video blocks for
making this video possible I use all
kinds of gear when it comes to making my
videos from cameras to computers but one
of the most useful tools I have is video
blocks video blocks is a subscription
service that gives you unlimited access
to stock footage backgrounds and After
Effects templates if you've ever looked
at buying stock footage for a video
you'll know that I can get crazy
expensive I need a few clips for a
project a few months back and then it
cost me like $300 with video blogs you
can get that same 100% royalty free
content for use on places like YouTube
which can be massively helpful for
making videos you might not be able to
do otherwise you can start a free 7 day
trial at the link in the description so
if you want to up your video game
definitely be sure to go check it out
anyway guys thank you so much for
watching and I will catch you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
