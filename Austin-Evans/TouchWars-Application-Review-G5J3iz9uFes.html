today I'm here with an application
review on a pretty interesting
application called touch Wars you know
this one really really makes good use of
the multi-touch um it kind of reminds me
of some older arcade games only you know
if we had iphones and ipods back then so
i'm just a few options and high scores
and stuff but it's real simple just
going to jump into it there are two
different modes sequence which is kind
of like you know you go through and you
take them down and you know you keep
going levels and survival which is just
your last long as you can the basic way
the touch Wars works and that there are
like little tarts I guess I have noted
with a comp little targets to basically
come up and we need to get them and the
thing is you don't just tap them you
have to get them with two fingers if you
just have one finger on the field it
doesn't do anything but you have two
fingers and basic electricity shoots
from between your two fingers and swipes
across the field it's very cool but the
key is you cannot hit the red ones so in
that we get to make you lose a life so
it's a pretty simple concept but it's
really addicting i found myself playing
quite a bit lately so let's go ahead and
jump right in now you see here you see
you get combos the more you take because
look if I got that one and one there we
go see I can't hit those red ones so
great never really take some chances
yeah you see there are different ones do
different things so you see these sites
or peel or looking ones they get to
actually hold on it and you see they
can't fade out why this is a tough one I
might have to die here okay find these
more all right as you can see Wow and
you see it really does on survival long
you gota up there I killed
monk oh man room now he's going on so
game over August evening pay a better
one but you can see here that and then
you the different way so like there's 14
waits there but easy there's my high
scores I mean I'm not that great at it
but it's it's not bad and you see my
lungs / losses two minutes 11 seconds
and once you do that far it gets really
crazy let's go ahead and show you guys a
sequence I guess so this is much easier
because so I just basically just cannot
get that guy so go ahead of me and now
like I said there's you get bonuses for
killing them instead of going tap tap to
swipe across and but there you go now
the way it works in this mode is that
easy you have like all kinds of
different notes like stages and you
don't tell the families and you get
different upgrades like such as like an
extra life a bomb which blows them all
off score multiplier shield and that
sort of thing let's go ahead and yes
yeah i can get my guess might go back
out Wow there we go hey guys this is
touch Wars um you know I and I first
started messing with this game I was you
know I thought it was really simple but
I really gotten addicted to it I mean I
kind of this is one of the really great
games are like for the ipod and iphone
you can just have in your have your ipod
in your pocket and then you know if you
got you know a couple minutes just pull
it out play quick match like I mean that
takes like survival takes like you know
a minute or whatever and it's pretty fun
you know you just gets crazy some of you
guys that's touch Wars it is currently a
dollar 99 in the app store um you know I
think it's pretty good I would like it
if it better if it was 99 cents but a
dollar ninety-nine isn't entirely crazy
for this kind of game I definitely
recommend go check it out I don't think
there's a light version but it's a
pretty cool game
you know if you think you'll like all
the town of cool stuff like this that's
a go for it anyway guys thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
