here with a gaming pc myths part 3 so
amazingly enough sometimes people are
wrong about stuff on the internet so
today I'm going to go over some of the
most popular myths and rumors about
gaming PC's the first myth is that you
have to have an expensive CPU for gaming
now I can't tell you how many times
people have sent me billed where they're
using something like a core i7 and a GTX
650 so a good general rule of thumb is
that you should be spending more on your
graphics card as opposed to the CPU
now while pretty much all of your parts
when gaming are used for example if you
have just a little bit of rain that's
going to hurt you but as a general rule
of thumb the graphics card is the most
important part as long as you've got a
fairly balanced system spending more on
the graphics card will absolutely help
you out quite a bit another myth is that
PC gaming is only for desktops now it's
easy to get caught up in a spec war so
the CPU is 10% faster than that CPU this
graphics card come in battlefield 4 on
ultra and all that stuff is important
it's all nice to know however at the end
of the day we're all gamers we all just
want to sit down and play our games sure
a gaming laptop is pretty much always
going to be more expensive than a
desktop however for a lot of people
that's going to be worth it so the most
important thing to look for when you're
buying a gaming laptop is to make sure
that it does have a dedicated GPU as
long as you've got a decent GPU under
the hood the most part you're going to
be fine to play basically any game you
want another one is that consoles are
better than gaming PC's so this is one I
hear all the time so a gaming PC
definitely does have some advantages for
one you're pretty much always going to
have the best looking experience across
any platform so even though the new Xbox
one and PlayStation 4 coming out soon
there are games that you can buy today
on a gaming PC that are going to look
better than what you're going to find on
the even the next generation of consoles
you also do have steam which is a
fantastic way to get games and it's a PC
so obviously in addition to doing the
gaming stuff you can do pretty much
anything else you want on it on the
other hand there are also reasons why
you might want to use a console so it's
pretty much always going to be a cheaper
way to get into the game so you can go
out and buy an Xbox for a couple hundred
dollars and throw out underneath your TV
and forget about it
there are lots and lots of people on
both Xbox Live and PSN so if a lot of
your friends are using Playstations it
might make sense for you to get one as
well and there are also tons and tons of
great exclusive game
for the Wii for the Xbox or Playstation
so a lot of times you might want to go
buy a Wii just so you can go play Super
Smash Brothers and Zelda and Mario so
there are lots of pros and cons for both
consoles as well as gaming pcs the end
of the day it's pretty much whatever
works best for you another common myth
is that you need six gigs of ram in your
graphics card know just know so a lot of
people get confused as far as how much
memory they actually need in a graphics
card is it worth it to pay for the RAM
upgrade so right now what you really
should be looking for is a graphics card
with two gigs of RAM so that's going to
give you enough memory to handle pretty
much any game out right now as well as
future games for a little while however
if you do want to step it up a little
bit especially if you're buying a more
expensive card then three gigs of ram
can be a good option especially you're
going to be playing on high resolution
monitors like 1440p you're planning
doing crossfire sli or you plan on just
gaming on lots of monitors very high
resolutions all that kind of stuff
another common myth is that overclocking
your computer will destroy it so a lot
of people are very anxious and very
scared to actually do any kind of
overclock and for fear that they're
going to damage their computer and while
yes it is true that you can do damage to
your computer by overclocking for the
most part that's kind of difficult and
as long as you're kind of reasonable
about it you don't just start grabbing
dials and cramming them up to 11 you
really ought to be okay so the general
idea of overclocking is to simply make
your computer run faster so the typical
things do run to overclock are going to
be your CPU as well as your graphics
card so the graphics cards in particular
are very easy to overclock and the best
way to dover clock any of your parts on
your computer is just as simply to look
up a guide so there are tons and tons of
fantastic tutorials around the internet
that will show you exactly how to grab
overclock this particular graphic card
this particular CPU with this
motherboard acceptor etc very much
there's a guide for about everything so
if you want to get a little bit more
performance out of your PC as long as
you have good cooling and a decent power
supply overclocking is a great answer so
what are some of the gaming pc myths
that you guys have heard delta be sure
to let me know in the comments below and
I might just use one of them in the next
video anyway guys thank you so much for
watching if you enjoyed definitely be
