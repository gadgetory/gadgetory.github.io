of different 201 and laptop designs but
the HP Spectre folio might just be the
most unique yet when Intel wanted to
sponsor a video on the Spectre folio I
couldn't say no I mean just look at this
thing so in addition to being a tablet
you can very easily pull out the screen
and use it in the video mode or if you
want to go full tablet mode on it it
will lie completely flat on top of
having it as a tablet you don't have to
have the keyboard around back like most
other 201 designs it's like a super cool
idea there it isn't a case on this
laptop by the way it's actually made out
of leather so what HP has done is
they've combined and magnesium chassis
with leather so now that does it smell
great but on top of that when you close
it up it looks like a nice little folio
case oh that one I call it the HP
Spectre folio I just got that it's like
a full okay they've brought the entire
thing up into what I think is a pretty
cool looking package can you tell that
really like this thing open it up and
you'll have a better idea of how this
all works so on the bottom part we have
a magnesium chassis which is where you
have your keyboard you have your battery
as well as the motherboard and the
screen itself is hinged not only on the
bottom so you can open and close it like
a laptop but it's also magnetically
attached on the bottom so if I want to
just move it over to like say another
mode it's all really straightforward
it's a much much smarter idea than
pretty much any other tool one I've ever
tried does that being mean to other to
own ones I mean I actually legitimately
feel like this is a super super clever
idea it just worked right fire it up and
the cool stuff doesn't stop there so my
model is outfitted with the eighth
generation Core i7 8500 why and that's
backed up with 16 gigs of ram as well as
a 256 gig SSD that core i7 is a Y series
processor which means that this is an
entirely fanless system as you might
have guessed considering just how thin
it is but you are still getting that
full windows performance and as a
dual-core chip
well it's clocked at only 1.5 gigahertz
at the base it can turbo all the way to
4.2 gigahertz the screen is also pretty
cool so in addition to it being a 13.3
inch display with a 1080p resolution and
it is a full touch screen but
importantly if you take a look at it it
is super super thin which is important
for a design like this did that just
flash what was that
you mean the real-life window they just
flash with lightning outside scary but
it's also got an Intel one watt panel
which is especially helpful for battery
life so traditionally with such a thin
light laptop you have to have a very
small battery and the screen is actually
one of the main things that draws power
but with this guy they claim up to 18
hours of battery life and I've easily
been able to get well over a day of use
with it a nice touch with this mode is
the touchpad positioning so a lot of
times was a two and one you don't quite
have access to well anything when you
put it up all the way forward but here
you still get that nice angle the
screens closer to you but you also have
your touchpad available what really
pushes this over the edge though is the
built-in gigabit LTE connection so if
you take a look at the screen you pop it
up what you'll find is that there's a
tiny little SIM card slot here what's
really cool about this is the
flexibility I get I don't need to deal
with sketchy public Wi-Fi I don't need
to worry about killing my phone battery
with tethering I mean it's just it's
just online it's really simple I just
open it up and I'm online you probably
know Intel for making processors but
they also make LTE modems for all kinds
of devices including the spectre folio
you might even be using a phone with an
Intel modem right now no no you probably
won't want to do hardcore video editing
or gaming on this guy but it is powered
by that full core i7 processor which
means that things like Photoshop and of
course all the staples like Chrome and
Word will all work completely fine here
and since you're always connected you
have access to cloud apps such as Google
Docs as well as of course all the local
stuff you want it really is the best of
both worlds
although I guess to be fair this is not
the only laptop in the world that does
have LTE there are other Intel options
with 7th and 8th gen processors that do
have LTE this is sort of my favorite
blend of not only the form factor but
also the portability and the access to
the power and the speed and battery life
and the leather smell there's a lot of
other great stuff with the Spector folio
starting out with we have the stylus
which is included something that other
companies might want to take note on as
a joke she has a pun we also have like
how you're all just shaking your heads
there's also Windows hello support from
facial recognition there's the excellent
backlit keyboard the HP's been using for
a while and there's a really solid
selection of ports a USB see on the left
side as well as 2 Thunderbolt threes on
the right side and all of them support
not only power but data video out all
that kind of fun stuff of course it's
not all perfect so the touchpad is good
but it does like Windows precision
drivers it does have pretty solid
speakers a little a lack a little bit of
bass
and at fifty hundred dollars for the ice
of a model with LTE it is certainly not
cheap overall though with the killer
design the portability the performance
to run proper Windows apps and that
always connected LTE really I mean
there's not a lot to complain about this
is one of the most unique devices I've
taken a look at all year long</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
