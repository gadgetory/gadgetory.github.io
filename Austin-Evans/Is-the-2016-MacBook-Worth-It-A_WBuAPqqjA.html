small but is the new MacBook worth it a
year later the mech design hasn't
changed much for good and bad on the
plus side you're getting one seriously
small laptop with a footprint that's
just barely bigger than an iPad the
aluminum build still feels incredibly
sturdy with no flex and the thinness
really does make you feel a step ahead
of most other laptops there are quite a
few colors including silver space grey
gold and new for this year rose gold
it's not hard to imagine a future where
nearly all laptops of this thin enlight
but you've got to make some sacrifices
the poor selection is about as basic as
it gets with a headphone jack and
microphone on one side and a single USBC
port on the other as ports go this is a
pretty full-featured one that handles
charging USB 3 and video out however
it's not Thunderbolt 3 and having only
one poses some problems something as
simple as plugging a normal USB device
requires an adapter and if you want to
charge the macbook while also using a
flash drive you'll also need an adapter
USB see support is becoming more common
though for example the Samsung t3 Drive
will work natively what's really cool is
the Acer h7 which not only supports a
1440p monitor over USB C but it'll also
charge the MacBook and give you a couple
USB 3 ports metal USB C cables are
created equally but for example the
included cable really only works for
charging but being able to power your
laptop get display out and a hub over
one Tanic cable is awesome
where you'll find the real upgrades
though or inside if you open up the
MacBook you'll see it's incredibly
straightforward there are a series of
slightly upgraded batteries that fill
all the empty space along with the logic
board that houses literally everything
including the processor RAM and SSD
here you'll find a skylight based Intel
Core M CPU which is passively cooled
meaning there's no fan which makes the
MacBook totally silent regardless of
which model you go for you're getting 8
gigabytes of memory which is slightly
faster than before but you will find a
big improvement in the SSD there's still
256 and 512 gig but they're
significantly faster than before
especially when you compare write speeds
unlike last year there's actually a
fairly big difference when you upgrade
the base model comes with a Core m3 and
256 gigs of storage where the upgraded
model bumps that up to a core n5 and 512
gigabyte SSD
while you're getting fairly low base
speeds the boost clocks bring it up to
normal laptop levels which you should be
seeing for everything besides heavy
tasks like gaming and editing there's a
pretty major difference in CPU
performance and Geekbench
where the mid spec model is approaching
the 13-inch MacBook Pro the new MacBooks
also have HD 515 graphics
which while not a huge change or still a
modest improvement over last year that
means you can actually do some video
editing on the MacBook well it's not
exactly meant for it
I edited this entire video on the core
m5 MacBook inside Final Cut and it works
fine it gets a bit slow at times but
considering this is 4k footage it's
really not bad it's also capable of some
light gaming as well titles like tomb
raider aren't officially supported but
if you turn the settings down you're
able to get it to be playable it's the
same story with dota 2 on low it's
actually able to keep a perfectly
respectable frame rate older titles like
portal 2 are easy to run and minecraft
as always is no problem even on a
relatively low powered system like bits
since it's passively cooled I want to
see how warm it gets under load and
surprisingly it's really not bad the top
of the keyboard does get slightly warm
but it's not enough to be uncomfortable
it might not be a gaming PC but it is
impressive how well this works is a
laptop it's got a solid 12 inch screen
with a resolution of 23:04 by 1440 and
it's a really good display with
impressive viewing angles and color your
not giving anything up with the audio
either the MacBook has some surprisingly
good front firing speakers one area
where the MacBook definitely falls short
is with the webcam it's only a 480p
camera and as you can see it definitely
leaves a lot to be desired the keyboard
is a little different to most laptops
though it has wide fairly shallow keys
that take some getting used to there's
just not a ton of key travel considering
the space constraints the keyboard
reaches all the way out to the edges
with individual LED backlighting most
people wid used to it easy enough but I
still prefer a more normal keyboard
there's absolutely nothing to complain
about with the trackpad though not only
is it huge for a laptop of this size but
attracting a spot-on and the forced
touch gestures make this by far my
favorite trackpad out there there's a
lot to like with the MacBook clearly
Apple spent a lot of time giving you a
laptop and a small and light a package
as possible without sacrificing the
essentials like the screen and battery
life the single USBC port means there's
no getting away from adapters anytime
soon though and the price means you
really are paying a premium for the tiny
science it's a surprisingly good laptop
but it's meant for a very specific
person speaking of I recently spent some
time with the new iPad pro to see if it
can actually replace a laptop definitely
go check that video out and I will catch
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
