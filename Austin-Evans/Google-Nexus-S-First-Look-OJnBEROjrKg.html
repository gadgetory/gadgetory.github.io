at the Google Nexus S so the Nexus S
looks to be the next major Android
smartphone and it's going to be bringing
a lot of new features to the table so
probably the most notable one is that it
should be running the newest version of
Android 2.3 also known as Gingerbread so
this is a version of Android that it's
not even out yet and of course it's not
available on any phones however it looks
like the Nexus S will be the first phone
to be able to use this new operating
system but what also makes the Nexus S
special is that it is a Google branded
phone I'm out obviously Google does make
Android however most of the other phones
obviously made by you know Samsung
Motorola or HTC whoever this one is
going to be branded Google although it
does look like it will be made by
Samsung so some of the reasons why this
phone was really looking special is
because since it is a Google branded
phone it's going to be more of a
developer phone where it's going to be
giving updates very quickly and it's not
going to be running any kind of you know
custom skins of Android it's just going
to be the pure stock vanilla Android
which is really probably the best
variety now from what weak tip on what
we can tell it does look like it is a
variant of the Samsung Galaxy S lineup
so if you have seen any of these
standard Galaxy S phones on most of the
carriers you'll know that it's going to
be very similar to the Nexus S however
there should be like I said a few key
improvements such as a very plain
vanilla running Android 2.3 as well as
obviously the four inch Super AMOLED
display the one gigahertz hummingbird
processor etc etc personally I'm really
looking forward to the Nexus S if the
Nexus One probably was still one of my
favorite Android phones just because it
does run stock in hell Android which I
really can't emphasize enough how useful
that is so the Nexus S definitely looks
very very interesting so you know guys
definitely stay tuned I will keep you
up-to-date on any new developments when
they announce you know release date
prize how they're gonna sell it whether
it's through carriers or again straight
through Google however that's gonna work
so yeah anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
