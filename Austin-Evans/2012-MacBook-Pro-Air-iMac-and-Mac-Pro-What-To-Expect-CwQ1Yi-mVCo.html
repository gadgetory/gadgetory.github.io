here's the video going over what you can
expect to see on Monday at WWDC so it
looks like Apple is going to be
refreshing most of the Mac lineup
including the MacBook Pro the MacBook
Air the iMac and Mac Pro so let's take a
look to start with let's go over the new
MacBook Pro and this is likely going to
be the biggest new redesign as they will
be pretty much entirely scrapping the
current MacBook Pro design and going
with a new thinner design so some of the
new things are going to be on it is it's
going to have a new Retina display most
likely somewhere around the 2560 by 1600
resolution if you guys don't know that's
basically the same kind of resolution as
you will find on an Apple Cinema Display
or 27-inch iMac not bad for a 15-inch
laptop the new MacBook Pros should be
using the new Intel Ivy Bridge
processors now these are likely going to
be Core i5 and core i7 and while there
won't be a massive difference as far as
the performance between the current
MacBook Pros and the new ones or the big
difference is going to be is in battery
life as these should be considerably
less draining on your battery an
australian part sheet is leaked and on
here you can clearly see that are only
going to be two new MacBook Pro models
these are both probably going to be
15-inch will probably have a Core i5 and
a standard hard drive the other will
most likely have a core i7 and an SSD
now as far as what's going to be going
on with the 13 and 17-inch MacBook Pros
who knows but it definitely does look
like we will be getting some new MacBook
Pro 15 inch models next up we have the
MacBook Airs
now I'm a big fan of the air I have an
11 inch and there should be some really
nice improvements here so we should also
see Intel Ivy Bridge processors coming
to the MacBook Air so again just like on
the MacBook Pro it should be a little
bit faster but the biggest difference
will be in battery life and also in
improved graphics we also should now see
a Retina display on the MacBook Air so
this is gonna be really really nice of
course the current MacBook Airs have
actually really nice screens but having
that really high-definition Retina
goodness it's gonna be really something
great something else I really hope to
see on the new MacBook Airs is an option
to at least pick up 8 gigabytes of RAM
in my opinion that's one of the bigger
problems with the air right now is that
4 gigabytes is the absolute max moving
on to the iMac we actually don't have a
ton of information now that same part
sheet that shows the MacBook Pros and
the MacBook Airs also shows two new
models of the 21 inch iMac as well as
the 27-inch iMac now we've heard some
talk about an all new redesigned iMac
however it's a little unclear whether
we're going to see that or just a simple
redesign of the current one with Ivy
Bridge processors USB 4
maybe a couple of small tweaks
personally I'm actually leaning towards
that I think the current iMac even
though it is about three years old right
now I think the current design is fine
and unless we find some 4k displays on
there I don't think that's going to be a
major deal it also looks like we're
finally going to get a refresh of the
Mac Pro and of course the current Mac
Pro not only is the design several
several years old we actually haven't
even seen any kind of update to it
whatsoever in the past couple of years
beyond a new hardware design in the Mac
Pro I also expect to see the new Intel
Xeon processors now these have already
been out for just a little while and of
course you would be able to get it in
both one as well as two CPU
configurations anyway guys that's a good
look at what we're going to be seeing on
Monday for the new Macs I definitely
curious to know what do you guys have to
say are you interested in MacBook Pros
MacBook Airs you're looking at a new
iMac Mac Pro definitely be sure to let
me know in the comments below if you
enjoyed this video definitely be sure to
leave it a thumbs up and if you're
interested in more videos on the new
Macs definitely be sure to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
