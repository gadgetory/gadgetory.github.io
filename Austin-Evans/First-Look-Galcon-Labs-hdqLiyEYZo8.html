today I'm here with a first look on a
really really great looking application
called alkaline labs now most of you
guys will probably know I am a huge fan
of the original galvan for both iPhone
and for pc mac and linux it's just such
a great game it's a unique concept and
it really is just a great great fun so
yesterday or more specifically last
night gala on labs came out and I'm
fortunate to go ahead and get it and go
ahead and give you as a first look and I
will definitely be doing a four of you
later on gallic on if you don't know
that it is it's kind of like it's kinda
hard to explain basically you have lots
of different planets and then you have
different ships and then they attack
each other it sounds very simple and it
is but it's a blast so basically what's
different if you knew gal con the normal
version what's different is gal con labs
introduces for new play modes so let me
go ahead and show you guys there's
classic which is just the classic gal
car and you know what you've always
played their stealth which is basically
classic except when you launch your
forces they disappear assassin where you
have specific targets so you have to
take down this person in order to
whatever billiards where the planets
start moving around and crash or your
ships can actually collide in midair and
everything so I'm just going to go ahead
and do a simple one and give you guys a
brief demo of each one let's go ahead no
stealth ok so what you'll see is it
watch them since i'll go ahead and take
some planets but as soon as you see them
move you see they there they disappear
so i have no idea when they're coming
but i should be able to take them
because this is a really easy difficulty
so let's just go ahead and do this and
that you know so that's that um like I
said this is very simple let's go ahead
and show you guys billiards now this is
a bit of a glitchy will not I've noticed
it well you guys will see so you see
everything is moving which makes it kind
of a little difficult because you've got
to go ahead and grab all these planets
and keep from that's not good and what
are they doing now did you see here it's
very it's very ya on that huge fan of
this mode it's kind of a little whoops
it's kind of little hard to use I mean
it's not terrible i endeavor can use it
but other thing moving around it's kind
of odd especially like I said there are
a few lags and glitches and stuff but
it's not terrible next we'll head and
show you guys crash basically this is
real simple I'll see if I can get hmm
they love it here let's see if I can get
these guys interceptive you see how the
plants are hitting each other which
that's a pretty cool thing I'll sit here
and go ahead and can't lose on the
easiest difficulty I love is good okay
so let's go ahead and finish him off and
obviously this is the easiest difficulty
there are ten difficulties in this is
easiest so obviously the gang gets much
tougher but you know that is that long
camera stays in focus and lastly let's
show you guys assassin okay so basically
that's my target so I have to kill this
guy before anybody else can so go ahead
and make sure that you can't know come
on come on no no it's Scott so should
there we go now let me show you guys one
of the best those are the new modes but
this is the best thing it's got
multiplayer just like a normal gal klein
so if you open it up and play any
multiplayer game so I'm gonna go ahead
and pick crash I'm gonna play a quick
match like I said this is online so
let's go ahead and play one quick match
and you can see here everyone's ranked
and it's a very very cool system let's
go ahead and do
it's a lot of waiting so might not play
the whole thing but see here you this is
this is a pretty cool just like I said
this is crash so like pie I might just
suicide myself just to kind of show you
guys the camera camera filters um the ad
real so now you see here he's going for
me good and yeah probably lose this one
mm-hmm there we go get some help no I'm
dead there mm-hmm that's it but uh so
yeah guys that is galcon laughs to first
look at it I definitely will show you
guys more out to a four of you on later
but um this is if you have gal con
you'll probably want this there are some
really cool gameplay modes and it's a
lot of fun um it is currently 99 cents
in the app store I believe it's an
Olympic turn price not entirely positive
but that's what I think and you know
guys this is a great game I mean gallon
is my absolute favorite gallon latches
basically everything that is your R
minus a few gameplay modes but it's tons
of fun between the online multiplayer
and everything I mean gal con labs just
a really solid game you guys stay tuned
for my full review to be coming soon and
yeah i definitely recommend checking
this application out thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
