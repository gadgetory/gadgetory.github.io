little demo of photo booth for the iPad
2 so this is one of the brand new
pre-built apps in the iPad uh and it's
you know it's that's okay it's nothing
amazing but just give you guys a quick
tour of it so of course this mostly uses
a front-facing camera you can see hi
guys
it works pretty decently you can really
not do a whole lot with the standard
version but if we back out there lots of
cool little effects so let's just pick
x-ray for example and you see that looks
like I'm being x-rated or something yeah
it's decent uh there's a couple others I
will show you guys just a couple of -
again look around the camera a
kaleidoscope everyone's pretty cool
alright guys you know it's just the same
sort of stuff that you would expect if
you've ever used you know with this on
the Mac for example yeah it's pretty
cool here's the thermal camera and if I
want to take the picture we can save it
like that also in addition to that we
want to we can flip to the rear-facing
camera which there's not a whole lot to
see but yeah guys that's pretty much it
there's not a whole lot to this well I
guess it's gonna be on the back but
anyway guys so photobooth you know it's
a nice little addition it's nothing
particularly amazing but certainly not
bad considering that it is pretty built
into the iPad 2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
