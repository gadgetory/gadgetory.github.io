to check out the $5,000 laptops of the
world but in reality this is what you
should buy it's $500 this Suze vivo book
F 510 UA which is a wonderful easy to
remember name has a lot going for it
inside there's an Intel 8th generation
Core i5
8250 you and that's kind of a big deal
of this kind of price point these new
series processors are a huge step up in
performance and its really nice to see
them trickle down to even fairly
affordable laptops like this with a full
quad core CPU onboard you're getting so
much better performance than any kind of
older budget option that core i5 can
boost up to 3.4 gigahertz which should
be more than a performance for most
people the only real downside is that
you're not going to have any kind of
dedicated graphics for gaming but if
that's something you're interested in
the Acer Aspire 5 which I've talked
about many many times is going to be a
better option remove a few screws on the
back of the laptop and you're going to
get access to all basically everything
you might want including the memory
which is going to come with eight gigs
by default but it's going to be super
easy to upgrade that to 16 gigs assuming
you didn't have to pay like ninety
dollars to pick up another stick of RAM
but I mean the options there the base
model of the laptop which is what I have
here is going to run you five hundred
and ten dollars on Amazon now that's
going to get you a standard one terabyte
mechanical hard drive but there's also
going to be an empty into slot if you
want to upgrade with an SSD now
interestingly Amazon actually does sell
another SKU of this laptop which just
has that SSD installed it's going to be
128 gigs as well as the one terabyte
hard drive it's going to cost you $600
that doesn't sound crazy except that you
can actually do it yourself for a lot
cheaper which is exactly what I did this
is a 128 gigabyte ADATA SSD that I was
able to pick up for just under $40 and
if you don't mind opening up the laptop
and reinstalling Windows it's going to
be an easy way of saving yourself like
50 bucks if you want the extra speed and
trust me if you're buying this laptop
spend the extra $40 it is going to be so
so much faster with the SSD upgrade
paired with that eight gigs of RAM as
well as quad core CPU you looking at a
very reasonably powerful computer
especially considering the price now I
know especially when it gets into
creative applications such as video
editing that's going to make this a lot
more usable I know especially if it was
me a few years ago when its first
starting out I would have absolutely
killed to have a laptop like this that
was going
so cheap well we've got the laptop open
you'll also be able to see the Wi-Fi
card which is not only easy to upgrade
if you ever want to it's a pretty solid
card in itself so we're going to be
getting a dual band AC Wi-Fi and that
sort of speaks to a lot of my sort of
thoughts on this laptop
the assist engineers did a good job of
picking a pretty solid list of
components and they didn't really cut
any major corners with the laptop design
the only real issue here is actually
going to be with the battery life with
only a 42 watt hours cell it's going to
give you decent battery life as soos
claims about eight hours and while it's
going to be a little bit ambitious it
could be better especially considering
that there's all this space up here
which could totally be used for battery
although I assume that that's probably
for some higher-end version where they
would stick the dedicated GPU at this
price the design is going to be all
plastic and that's not really
necessarily going to be a bad thing so
it's pretty well built there's going to
be a little bit of screenflex but
there's not a whole lot if you actually
go ahead and press down the keyboard it
is a fairly well-built laptop port wise
it's a good selection so we're going to
be getting three USB a ports a USB C as
well as HDMI a headphone jack and an SD
card reader you're not catching the
trend yet it's not going to be
spectacular but there's really no
corners cut it's going to be a good
selection of pretty much everything you
need like most laptops in 2018 you are
going to be getting a Windows precision
touchpad
as you expect it works well there's
solid tracking and you're also going to
be getting support for all the different
windows gestures essentially at this
point most of these windows Precision
touch pads are going to be very
equivalent there's gonna be minor
differences in the actual sort of
surface area and stuff that's going to
be totally fine and so much better than
old school track pads a really nice
touch is the addition of a fingerprint
sensor built into the trackpad now I'm
not a huge fan of the positioning it's
going to get a little bit in your way
here but the good thing is is that it's
going to have full support for Windows
hello
which makes logging in much much simpler
honestly this is something like to see
on any laptop so it's especially nice to
see it on something that's going to be
so affordable the keyboard is going to
be classic a sous so it's going to have
a fairly light touch without a lot of
feel but importantly they completely
nailed not only the layout but also the
spacing between the keys now will be
nice to see some backlighting but again
we're talking about a $500 laptop here
well it might not look impressive on
paper the display on this guy is
actually pretty nice so it is a 15.6
inch panel with a 1920 by 1080 p
resolution now that resolution might not
sound all that impressive but especially
when you put it compared to
other laptops in this price range
especially allows the Acer panels this
is going to look so much better it might
not be the brightest thing in the world
but the color and especially the
contrast are a lot better than what you
would expect at this sort of price point
and that even includes the bezel so even
though it's going to be a 15.6 inch
display the actual overall footprint of
the laptop is actually pretty small well
it's also not the best solution in the
world are going to be the speakers so
they sound okay but they especially get
tinny at higher volumes and a lot of
that is because now I are they not all
that impressive in the first place but
also going to be on the underside of the
laptop which means that you should
probably just get a pair of headphones
at around $500 this really does feel
like a cell it's a sweet spot it's Bend
even $100 less you're going to be
seriously sacrificing on performance
whereas when you start to spend more
you're going to get nicer things like
build quality and stuff
but you're not going to see any kind of
massive performance gains and so you get
into a much more expensive system and
the main thing is though is that you
should definitely upgrade with the SSD
it's going to make a huge difference
over the stock hard drive but beyond
that there's no wonder that so many
people are picking this guy up on Amazon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
