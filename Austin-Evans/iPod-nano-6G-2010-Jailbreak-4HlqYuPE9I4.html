make a video on the ipod nano six
duration jailbreak now I've gotten a
bunch of messages this morning and last
night about it you know a lot of people
have been talking about it
and you know it's it's it's legitimately
pretty good but I wonder what make this
video because a lot of people are kind
of getting it a little overblown they're
not quite understanding exactly what
this is
first of all this thing it's not a
jailbreak this is just a mod and there
is a key difference so before I go ahead
and talk about I just want back up just
a step of course the iPod Nano sixth
generation you know the square one with
the touchscreen the latest nano of
course it's not um it's not doesn't run
on iOS but doesn't run you know the
iPhone the iPod Touch but it also
doesn't run you know the previous iPod
name our operating system and this is
important it was a mash up of the two so
basically what Apple did was they took
some good parts about iOS so for example
the springboard some stuff like that and
they also took some good parts about the
previous Nano operating system kind of
mash it up and that's what we have now
the key thing is that it is not iOS so
it's not like it's gonna be simple to go
ahead and just port an app over or
what's this jailbroken anything like
that it's gonna be require a bunch of
them to work a bunch of new tools and
everything to get this done so that's
just one thing I do want to keep you
know keep in mind there we got seeing
you know Blackberry nor line rain
whoever it's gonna work on the iPhone
iPod Touch an iPod Nano it's not going
to quite work like that
I don't anyway I will go ahead and
explain what this is that is going to be
you know it's like a mod it's a hack
it's not a jailbreak basically what he
was able to do actually it's pretty cool
that he didn't like about the time I
think of other days on the plane he was
able to hack it basically to go ahead
and bypass the check that you know make
sure that you know the springboard file
that you know that runs the MV the home
screen sort of thing is legitimate so
basically he was able to bypass that and
then change it up however he wanted to
know well this is good this is great it
does not quite me in a full jailbreak
there's no root access you can't install
apps you can't do anything like that
basically you can do a few minor things
now what this does mean is that probably
in the near future you'll be able to go
ahead there's some you know tool or
whatever this reply to hook up custom up
to how you would steal breaking maybe go
ahead a naval games
there are some different things like
that however this does not mean that
you're going to be able to go ahead and
download you know like a game or and
it's not bad just yet just means that
the possibility is there sometime in the
future I'm something guys that's about
that I just want to go ahead and make
this video clear up a lot of the rumors
another thing don't expect you know to
go ahead and download city on your iPod
nano and you know tomorrow and be able
to do all this kind of stuff it might
eventually happen I think it would be
cool the screen kind of does look at a
lot of what you can do but it is
possible it is really cool but just keep
in mind that you know this is a nice
step forward is not a jailbreak by any
means it's just a little tweak you can
do a few things with my Paul might not
who knows anyway guys thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
