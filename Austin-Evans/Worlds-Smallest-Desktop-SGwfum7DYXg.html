but this little stick is a full-fledged
Windows computer put it alongside the
new crumpet and the question is what can
such a tiny PC actually do the Intel
compute stick is a very different
desktop than you're probably used to
looking more like a chromecast than a
computer
it's outfitted with everything you need
just in a smaller package it plugs right
into any HDMI TV or monitor and is
powered by a micro USB cable pair it
with a wireless keyboard and you're
basically up and running as an ultra
cheap PC it comes with the basics
including the USB power cable an HDMI
extender to fit it into tighter spots
along with the power adapter the compute
stick itself is rocking a power button
micro USB in a full-size USB port and
it's got a micro SD card slot to expand
the 32 gigs of built-in storage it's got
a small fan to keep it cool but it's
essentially silent put it behind the TV
and you'll easily forget about it in the
other corner we've got the newest ooze
chrome bit pull it out and you'll see
it's even smaller than the compute stick
with just a bit of paperwork
another HDMI extender and the power
adapter included in the box it's more
minimalistic with a cover over the HDMI
port a single usb on the back and the
port for the AC adapter with no vents or
fans it's easy to travel with and the
setup is dead simple having a computer
in such a tiny package is definitely
cool but what can you actually do with
it the compute stick is a Windows PC for
good and bad on one hand you're getting
compatibility with most programs like
Chrome and Spotify but on the flip side
you're going to deal with things like
Windows updates which can take a very
very long time inside it's got a
quad-core Intel Atom processor 2 gigs of
RAM and 32 gigabytes of storage which is
enough for basic tasks but not much
beyond that the chrome bit on the other
hand is running Google's Chrome OS and
while you're giving up on being able to
run everything Windows has to offer
you're getting a more lightweight OS
that's better suited for something like
this what you do get is a computer that
can handle basic tasks like watching
1080p video and unlike something like a
chromecast
it can also do web browsing and text
editing for those times when you just
have to write a video script on a TV
one thing that seriously can mean is
traveling take a small Bluetooth
keyboard and you've got yourself a
serious PC they can be hooked up to a
hotel TV there are definitely quirks
though the chrome bit lacks a power
button which means you'll have to unplug
and replug it in to turn it on and off
and the compute stick gets bogged down
by updates
seriously it takes forever you can't do
a few things like create music with a
drum bit app on Chrome OS and basic
games like agario or fine on the compete
stig but don't expect to do intensive
tasks having a tiny Windows PC you can
come in handy but for about $30 less the
chromebit does essentially the same
thing and a sleeker and easier to use
package so what do you guys think about
the compute stick and chrome fit let me
know in the comments below and I will
catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
