whether you need a domain online store
or website make it with Squarespace hey
guys this is Austin recently I did a
video on this guy a six hundred and
fifty dollar gaming laptop entirely
powered by AMD risin that got me
thinking how would it stack up to an
Intel an Nvidia option that's where this
comes in this is the Acer Aspire 5ml
only does it have a Core i5 processor
and MX 150 graphics but impressively it
comes in with an even cheaper $600 price
tag on paper this guy looks very similar
to the HP Envy so we're getting a 15.6
inch display and it's actually
reasonably thin considering it is a
gaming laptop I will say at first glance
the build quality does not match up to
that HP it's all plastic well it doesn't
look bad you sort of lacks that premium
feel of the NV over what it lacks and
feel it makes up for in actual
functionality not only are we getting a
full size Ethernet jack but we also get
USB see HDMI a USB 3.0 port as well as
an SD card reader and on the other side
we're also getting two more USB ports
you're getting a full size keyboard
layout in addition to the number row
even though most of the laptop is
plastic it does have this metal shell on
the inside which does feel pretty nice
as a palm press inside this guy has an
8th gen Core i5 a 250 u so it's going to
be one of the new quad-core chips eating
those Nvidia MX 150 graphics a gigabytes
of dual-channel ddr2 hundred fifty six
gigabyte SSD however all it takes is for
you to fire up the aspire 5 before you
realize that there is one major thing
missing a decent looking screen so on
paper it's not bad we're getting a 15.6
inch panel with a 1080p resolution the
issue is it is a very very unimpressive
looking TN panel color is OK but the
contrast is straight-up terrible
especially with the viewing angles the
screen just doesn't look that great I
get it Acer wanted to cut some costs to
be able to get this much performance in
such a cheap laptop but the screen is
little bit tough to deal with thankfully
though it's not all bad so the keyboard
is classic Acer it's not the most
tactile thing in the world but
especially for gaming you're gonna be
totally fine and thankfully this guy
also is using a Windows precision
touchpad I'd love to see these as
they're pretty much always now a track
more accurately but especially have
those nice multi-touch gestures when you
put the Acer side-by-side with the HP
Envy you're gonna see if this guy has a
much nicer display sure it might not be
quite as bright as I would like but
compared to the TN panel over here it is
night and day plus this guy is going to
be a touchscreen it's convertible and
built quality wise no Lee this guy going
to be thinner but also just feels a lot
more premium one thing the Acer
definitely has going for it is upgrade
ability so underneath a couple of flaps
on the bottom you'll see Nelly do you
have access to your memory if you want
to upgrade that but over here if we pop
up this little cover you're going to see
that we have a full two and a half inch
drive bay that's completely empty so if
you want you can upgrade with a bigger
hard drive or you can even throw a
second SSD in this guy when it comes to
performance the aspire is just in a
different league so sure the envy does
have that nicer screen and better build
quality but in return you're getting not
only an SSD but you're also getting just
a potent combination with the Core i5
and dedicated graphics the i5 8250 you
delivers good quad core performance it's
right up there with a lot of higher-end
gaming laptops and a fair bit above the
horizon inside the envy the graphics are
where things really take off so with an
NVIDIA MX 150 GPU well it might not be
the most powerful graphics card in the
world you're eating enough performance
to play some pretty decent 1080p games
as you guys will soon see and when you
compare it to the Rison chip inside the
HP the Vega graphics are just not going
to be able to compete however the real
test is of course what it's like to play
in real world games first off we have
csgo now as the game didn't even though
it might be a couple years old is still
incredibly popular this is one of my
favorite ways to test pcs and here on
1080p settings that high will get
anywhere between 80 to 100 frames per
second super super playable it's not
playable is my shotgun right now
oh I get it they get it ahahahaha the
game I just got my awesome goal in is
rocket League so just like csgo it's not
really difficult thing to run so we're
getting between 40 to 50 frames per
second on high settings at 1080p good
this is another great example of it oh
that's not a good another good example
of a game that is uh it's kind of
perfect for 600 on a laptop it's nice
that we're getting this kind of
performance out of something that's
relatively affordable next up for
something a little bit newer we have pub
G now obviously we're just in the
opening area but on today's low we're
getting like 35 frames per second man
this game has come a long way now they
don't have 300,000 people spawning in
one area I will say one thing even
though the screen isn't that bad on this
laptop just having to angle it down a
little bit to get a better camera angle
means that it looks a little bit washed
out right now I really wish they've
spent just a little bit more money on a
nicer panel man this thing would be
perfect so yeah 1080p low is definitely
very playable here so we are averaging
around 30 to 35 frames per second if you
want to really optimize those frames you
could probably go down to 720p but with
a game like pub G might be like on a
sixteen dollar laptop I'm not really
complaining about low settings it's
really put this to the test we have
Middle Earth shadow of war now this is
not only a much nicer looking game but
also a more technically demanding one
and here at 1080p on low settings we're
getting right around 30 frames per
second so it's gonna be me
I'm probably going to turn on the
dynamic resolution to get that frame
rate up just a little bit but again a
very playable game so as you guys can
see the game performance is not bad
especially given these $600 price point
something else I really like is the
standard SSD measure it's easy enough to
add another SSD or another hard drive if
you want some extra space but having
windows and everything fully ready on an
SSD out of the box is nice I can't tell
you how many hours of my life I've
wasted waiting for slow old laptops with
normal hard drives to update this makes
everything so much faster the Aspire 5
is a seriously killer little gaming
laptop now this is very rare for me to
say but I don't really have a lot to
complain about they made a lot of smart
decisions on the components there's a
ton of performance for $600 really the
only thing I can complain about is the
screen
no no it's that a deal breaker butwho
have been nice if they would put just a
little bit of a better display in here
however besides that this is a close to
perfect gaming laptop considering the
budgets and you know what else is close
to perfect their wonderful sponsor for
