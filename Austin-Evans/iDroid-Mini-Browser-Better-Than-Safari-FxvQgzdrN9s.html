today I'm here with an application
review of something I'm really excited
about this act really honestly I think
is the first eyebrows I've ever used it
actually replaces authority on your ipod
touch or iphone and it is I droid mini
it's got a lot of really cool things
that safar just doesn't it has a new tab
page similar to what you'd might find in
Chrome or opera it's got full tab
browsing it works you got to see in a
minute very very cool tat browsing it
also has a complete Google search so
when you start to punch in the URL in
the address bar a lot immaculate google
searching for you if you like it's got a
lot of really cool things and I'm pretty
I'm pretty excited about it anyway guys
let's kick this one started
okay let's get this one started so first
thing you'll notice and I thought it's
kind of funny is that the icon is the
little android thing Apple's been kind
of well Apple and Google been going add
a little bit lately so I'm kind of
surprised that app will let them use
that but hey whatever so let's go ahead
and open it up and the first thing you
guys will definitely see is the new tab
page and I gotta say this is very very
cool the new tab page allows you to add
up to nine different sites and and
basically it shows little thumbnails of
each site I have to do is press on them
let's go so let's go ahead go to the
apple website so just click on it now
estimates start to loaded now while it's
loading i'm going to you guys a little
background on the interface along the
top you guys will see that it's that is
the full address bar okay so on the top
you go ahead the tap up here tap up here
first night work there we go okay so if
i tap up there i'll pull up the address
bar so let's go ahead and exit apple com
let's go to somewhere else let's go to
actually i'll just show you guys let's
look up let's let's do a google search
so on a search ipod touch so see here
now automatically does a google search
or at least an autocomplete so it pulls
up a lot of stuff i plot texting aboard
its good one so if we're going to go
ahead and search ipod touch we just
press on it and it will i'm actually
bring us up to a google search where we
can say you know ipod touch not that
step that's pretty cool now that's what
sky cool sound effect but i don't really
don't like this menu but I'll get into
that in just a minute it's going to kill
the tab and come back so the top bar is
pretty cool it works nicely now all
these these these are pretty cool I like
being able to just want a one tap and go
ahead and come over and obviously if you
want add one just click on it and go I
had no idea google com just type it in
Oh calm and hit okay then just give it
one second you see the little spinning
wheel base
we'll go take a snapshot google com you
see right here so if you want click on
it Oh bring us to google com and if we
want to get rid of it all you gotta do
is just hold it and there goes so nice
and simple if I can't move them around
yet but you know it's not a big deal
okay so now all this stuff is fine and
great but the main thing is with this
browser it obviously has got to be the
tats browsing I'm as you see here there
are four little buttons down here along
with that which I will get to in a
second for the little buttons each one
of these can be a tab okay now if you
look down you'll see that they're the
little little circle things those are
light and those are pretty cool so I
studio and you get you guys a demo let's
go ahead an open up gizmodo now you see
there the light starts flashing that's
just when a tab is loading so that's a
pretty handy thing so if we're I'm fine
loading a different tab I look over here
and see this one's a little done so as
you see here it's a full it's the full
browser like safari I mean you know
what's just the same you got the same
same thing and everything and go ahead
and click on something you also have
multitouch so let's go to hook up a new
browser i'm going to apple site as you
see here is moto we have the over here
no working just fine but while we can
reap be reading this we're going to be
having an ethic age loading in the
background that's pretty cool it works
obviously if you have a newer device
like such as like a 3gs or a third
generation ipod touch this is probably
gonna run a lot better i'm running a
second generation ipod touch and it does
occasion get a little laggy so let's go
ahead and we still have our pinch to
zoom you see it's got a little lag
that's not bad I pinch to zoom and do
every we want and of course we have our
other tap here so another cool thing
about the tabs is that if you want to
preview which I will say this is not
exactly really that helpful but ER
preview just hold your finger over it
and you'll say that a little preview
appears you let go of it it comes so I
me that's high big deal i mean you
should pretty much figure out what tap
what little page you're looking that is
but what I really like is the tap
handling is pretty solid and also a
pretty solid because I have been able to
crash this although will say that this
is actually the new versions the two
point
update for this application I crashed
the 11 point oh this just came out this
morning so I'm been able to crash this
version yet but I bet I can so let's go
and open up some more tabs and you'll
see it's pretty solid soon okay we have
two sites one loading and let's open up
CNN com so you see here we're taxing the
device pretty well I mean you've got two
tabs loaded up in memory and then we
have two tabs loading and you see there
they are taking a little bit of time but
it's still not bad you see here that one
load just fine and there we go now you
see it's starting to slow down a lot and
but still usable we still have three
tabs and when go ahead and click on
anything we want and once the tabs
loaded it's really not a big deal as
long as you know it's not crashed or
something I mean if once you have a tab
loaded you know you can just scroll
through and read it just like normal and
obviously like I said the pinch to zoom
and all that kind of stuff still works
give it a second here there we go and
still works did you see here's I mean
that was that took probably five seconds
to do it and this is not running a humps
and smooth but still it's not bad having
four sites up you know as far you know
it's got tab browsing technically but
it's not that great so now let me go
ahead and show you guys this this is the
little drop-down menu you hit that
button and it pulls up a bunch of
different options you've got find your
bookmarks close tab add bookmarks but
this is what I don't like it go back and
go forward or both on this so basically
I'm off whoops close the tab if I want
if I'm going like some gizmodo okay all
right now this story is good but I want
to go back one stead of being able to do
something simple just I should have to
pull up a menu then hit go back that's
kind of annoying to me because go back
cuz you know something obviously going
to use a lot so to push it back in a
menu and not that great another thing is
that it also supports full landscape so
everything disappears and we can just
scroll through here just like normal or
we just put it up like this and then we
have our full you I back that's pretty
cool let's go ahead and cut off a couple
of these
as you see here it's nice and snappy nuh
go ahead and do it now you can scroll
through between them and it works pretty
well some squid just call anyway guys
that is my review of I droid mini
browser it's a really solid application
I'm loving it it's better than safari
I've really actually I had the one point
of update before and it was pretty
glitchy and I was really didn't want a
change from spar e but ever since that
this new one that came out this morning
the 2 point 0 update I have no problems
whatsoever i have run into any glitches
or anything I mean yeah I once you let
up or tabs you can get a little slow but
I mean come on that's that's still
pretty good I mean I mean unlike Safari
wear it constantly kills your tabs off
this will actually run a bunch of them
so it's really really solid i joyed mini
browser is currently 99 cents in the app
store and guys from 99 cents this is
really solid I mean between the the
search bar or the Omni bar kind of like
on Chrome you have your new tab page
you've got four tabs and well that's the
main thing right there I gotta say I
droid mini browsers really solid you
guys definitely recommend it if you
don't mind spending a dollar to get a
much better browser and you're
definitely going to enjoy it anyway guys
