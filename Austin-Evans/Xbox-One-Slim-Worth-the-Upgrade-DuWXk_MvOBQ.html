Microsoft unveiled the new Xbox one as
which looks like a standard slim version
of a console
however there's actually a lot more than
meets the eye with this one first of all
the S is tiny seriously
compared to the previous Xbox one the
slim is 40% smaller which is no joke
it's hard to appreciate just how much
smaller it is until you see it in person
a lot of that has to do with how giant
the original Xbox one was and the new
robot white color definitely helps to
make it pop the overall design still
looks fairly similar it split down the
middle with the optical drive on the
left and the vent for cooling on the
right side it has a new dimpled finish
which is interesting I guess it's still
not the most beautiful piece of hardware
design but it is a step forward they've
also moved the USB port up front for
easy access along with the sync button
and a new IR blaster which was
previously part of the Kinect speaking
of the Kinect it's pretty clear that
it's on the way out take a look around
back and there's no Kinect port to be
found Microsoft will be selling a Kinect
adapter which will be available for free
if you already own an Xbox one with
Kinect but it looks pretty goofy
otherwise though the ports are similar
you still have both HDMI in and out
which is appreciated along with two more
USB 3.0 ports for total of three IR out
optical audio and Ethernet what you
won't find is a giant power brick like
the ps4 the power supply is now internal
which means you just need a single cable
to power the Xbox 1s which is absolutely
a welcome change there's also now the
option for a vertical stand but arguably
the bigger news are the internal
upgrades while usually slim models are
about making it smaller and cheaper
console yes is actually slightly more
powerful newer games like Forza horizon
3 now support HDR displays which will
allow for wider dynamic range a feature
found especially on newer high-end TVs
it also can now support 4k don't get too
excited about 4k though it's mostly for
video you can now play Ultra HD blu-ray
along with watching 4k video from places
like Netflix paired with HDR video
support this is a small but much
appreciate upgrade to make the Xbox one
as a much more impressive home theater
box something a little more interesting
are the spec upgrades according to the
developers of Gears of War the slim
sports is slightly more powerful CPU and
GPU which they're using to make sure
gears for holds either a higher
resolution or framerate when playing on
the S interestingly Microsoft really
didn't go into detail on how they're
getting 4k and HDR support out of the
Xbox one as so I'm curious to see
exactly what's powering this thing on
top of the updated console there's also
a refresh controller
at first glance it looks nearly
identical but there's a new textured
grip around back which is similar to the
elite controller and it now also
supports bluetooth this not only gives
it longer range but it also means you
can connect it to a PC without needing
the Xbox wireless adapter the new white
controller will be included with the
slim and it'll be on sale for $60 but
there's also a new option for official
customization called design lab this
online tool will let you seriously
customize most parts of the controller
including the body grip buttons and
sticks this is legitimately cool
you can even engrave something on the
controller design lab is already live
and they'll be shipping in September for
$80 for a normal controller and ninety
if you want the engraving speaking of
the Xbox one S will be on sale on August
starting at $2.99 that will get you a
500 gigabyte console but you can also
upgrade to a terabyte for 350 or a 2
terabyte hard drive for 400 and the
pre-orders are live I don't have a link
in the description when it comes to a
slim console refresh I've got to say
it's nice to see more features and
better performance instead of just a
cheaper more stripped-down console so
what do you guys think about the Xbox 1s
let me know in the comments below and I
will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
