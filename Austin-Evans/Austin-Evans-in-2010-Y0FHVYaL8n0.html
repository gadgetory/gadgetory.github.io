okay iPod Touch 4th generation and so I
spent too much every all my time since
I've got it taking a look at it testing
and making videos I'm to get you guys
the best interview that I can stay I'm
here with a full recap of the recent
Apple of it I'm so honestly just
finished up roughly about 45 seconds ago
side only what I give you guys the full
rundown so let's go ahead and show you a
few of them that are already pre-built
as you can see here when you download
the program it does come with ten sample
orbs pre-built if renders High
Definition videos fantastic the core i3
just has knocked it out we've gone ahead
and come to jailbreak me calm and all
you gotta do is slide the jailbreak I'm
sure there are plenty of occasions where
you have needed a microphone that didn't
have one for whatever reason how about I
show you how to use your headphones
instead so this might not seem like much
today but if you take a look at it even
today we do use this up or stereo either
DVDs or blu-rays in the case of the Xbox
and the PlayStation 3 but still it is in
this disc format and that was a really
big boost because I mean back in the
early 90s mean almost any game you want
to play was I'm going to be on a
cartridge similar to the Sega Genesis
it's so welcome to this week's episode
of d3 live so today I'm gonna be talking
about a pretty big topic and it's gonna
be the Nintendo 3ds versus the Sony PSP
2
so some of the specs equality does have
a 7-inch display with a resolution of
1024 by 600 and it adds a ton of really
cool new features and thanks to the
developers of code themed I have a beta
invite to go ahead and show you guys a
little bit about it hey guys so today
I'm here with a jailbreak tutorial
showing head jailbreak your iPhone your
iPod touch or your iPad using the ring
poison it's the first one absolutely the
build quality um as you guys can see
here it they're all free mega every
little bit of it is on this you know a
shiny black plastic
we're chillin gives a really nice ball
can feel I've convinced my normal series
of tests down to three so let's begin
with the SunSpider JavaScript benchmark
so as you can see here the interface is
really quite nice looking that kind of
looks a little bit similar to what the
Mac App Store is going to look like
overall I really enjoyed my time with
the Roomba being a major geek I love the
idea of having a robot do work for me
from that perspective the iRobot Roomba
560 did a stellar job now another really
cool thing about online is that there's
actually a console I'm sure if some of
you guys have been seeing the ads and
they've been trying to get the word out
this will go ahead and choose between
single shot really multiple shot that's
timer and I'm fairly sure if you guys
can see that that would watch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
