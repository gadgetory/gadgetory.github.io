Lytro loom no it is one of the coolest
pieces of tech to come out in quite a
while except for the fact that no one
actually bought it so when this came out
a couple years ago it cost a whopping
$1,500
over today you can pick them up for
about two or three hundred what makes
Lytro special is it is a completely
different way of taking a photo so
instead of a traditional camera which
captures a flat 2d image Lytro actually
captures the light rays which sounds a
little goofy but it allows you to do is
change the focus the depth of field even
the perspective after you take the shot
and here is the camera itself which is
actually bigger than I thought there's
almost nothing on here there's a big
touchscreen around back a couple of
buttons and that's pretty much it it
feels like some like concept of a camera
versus an actual normal DSLR to put
things in perspective this is what the
Illuma like compared to a more
traditional camera at the sony a6300 as
you can see well this is not exactly the
smallest camera in the world it
absolutely dwarfs it especially with
this huge lens before we get started
let's see what we actually need to get
this thing up and running is actually a
kind of a cool unboxing experience
there's a lot here we've got a cleaning
cloth and it looks like a lens hood as
well I can't get over the fact that this
just doesn't look like any other camera
it's vaguely sort of mirrorless like but
with that huge screen around back and
essentially no buttons it's a super
unique look so we do have an
articulating display and since we have
no buttons thankfully it is a
touchscreen right so if I want can I
focus on the camera okay so we took a
quick test shot and first guys it looks
nice but if I want I can switch focus to
Ken Joe over to curvy that's actually
really cool
so the refocusing thing is definitely
nothing new so a lot of smart phones
have been able to do a sort of
rudimentary version of this by either
using multiple cameras or taking a lot
of stills and kind of merging them
together with this you're actually
getting full control of what it looks
like and at first glance it's not bad
what's interesting about this is that
inside it's actually kind of like a
smart phone so pound this guy is
actually a Snapdragon 801 processor now
mind you in 2014 that was little bit
more impressive than it is today but
that's still a lot of power for a camera
so when I start shooting one of the
things I noticed is that while it's nice
to have a big 4-inch display the viewing
are not great especially since it's
articulating when I kind of lower it
like I can't say anything unless I get
right in the sweet spot
that's nice although there looks like
some weird artifacting so even though
this doesn't focus like a traditional
camera you still can use the autofocus
button on the back as well as tapping to
get that initial focus so even though
this gives you a lot more flexibility
than a traditional camera you do at
least have to get it in the rough
ballpark as far as focus goes I feel
like when I'm shooting from lower angles
everything looks a little bit more
impressive there's a lot more kind of
depth to work with so handling wise it's
not bad it might not be the most
ergonomic camera in the world however
the weight does not run it into plants I
say oh it is it's almost like you're
trying to walk backwards with a camera
or something so what might not be the
most ergonomic camera in the world that
large grip really does help I'm not so
sure how durable this is going to be
it's all very very soft touch plastics
and rubber and there's definitely a bit
of metal here but it seems reasonable
maybe not $59 reasonable but definitely
$200 reasonable I gotta say this dynamic
range is awful like that's the sky is
blown out and your face is completely
gone I get that this is more of a pro
camera and that's cool it's nice to be
able to have some of the features where
you know you can actually refocus and
stuff but image quality doesn't really
seem to be on par with something like
what you could get out of a DSLR the
more I play with this the more I feel
like this will be a lot better suited
for video so it's actually not totally
crazy light doe does have a video camera
that they are working on but it's gonna
be a lot more high-end than something
like this Hoover the idea being able to
shoot video and be able to refocus after
the shot is really interesting once
you're done shooting you need to take
your photos into the light show app for
Windows or Mac so in like a traditional
camera that shoots normal JPEGs here all
of your photos have to be processed
first my initial instinct is oh god
everything's out of focus however I may
need to do is click on Ken's face and it
looks actually pretty decent so this is
actually a really good example of how
you get that little bit of depth it's a
cool effect I don't really think it's
going to make a huge difference in how
you would actually save your final image
but so you get things something very
slightly wrong it's easy enough to just
click and adjust it to kind of pull some
depth out so just like if you shot Raw
on a normal camera you can change things
like the white balance the exposure
saturation what I want to see is how
some of this virtual camera stuff works
so you can see here we can almost kind
of digitally adjust the
aperture that actually looks kind of
cool though maybe not quite so extreme
so once you I should get these processed
you're looking at a picture that's
around five megapixels but looking at it
it's a little soft so this is shot is a
2500 and honestly it's not really usable
I mean you can't see some of this cool
focus effect and it's not perfect but it
actually does look pretty cool the thing
I can't get away from is that the image
quality just isn't that great now don't
get me wrong this is an incredible piece
of technology and for a couple hundred
dollars there's definitely a lot worse
options out there however at the end of
the day the pictures are interesting it
does a lot of very cool stuff but the
tech just doesn't feel fully baked to me
so what do you guys think about Lytro in
the Illume devil be sure to let me know
in the comments below and I will catch
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
