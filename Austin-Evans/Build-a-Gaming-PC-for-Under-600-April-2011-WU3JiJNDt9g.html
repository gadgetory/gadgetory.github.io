computer you may find compatibility
issues with the following parts list
today mu with the next in my series of
computer build videos this time at the
six hundred dollar price point for a
very reasonable amount you will be able
to build yourself a gaming PC they can
run most any game on the market today at
high or even max graphics settings the
starting point is going to be an intel
core i3 2100 as one of the new sandy
bridge cpus this features a dual core
design clocked at 3.1 gigahertz which
combined with hyper-threading and some
Intel magic makes for CPU that will
match if not exceed many older
generation quad core processors for 125
dollars for a motherboard we're going to
use the biostar th 67 plus since the i3
2100 is incapable of overclocking anyway
we can save some nice cash by going with
an h 67 board you still get a nice
variety of features including four slots
of ddr3 RAM a pair of say 236 gigabit
per second ports along with foresight of
two ports and two USB 3 all on a micro
ATX board for $90 the graphics card for
the build is a XFX radeon 5770 this is
an outstanding last generation GPU that
features directx11 support and 850
megahertz core clock along with one hdmi
port a DisplayPort and two DVI
connectors in addition it comes with the
fantastic XFX lifetime warranty and
great customer service this will run you
105 dollars after rebate for the memory
will use a pair of 2 gigabyte p and wide
ram sticks for a total of four gigabytes
each stick is clocked at 1333 megahertz
in dual channel for this build this is
more than sufficient for most games out
there and leaves room for adding
additional memory in the future if you
need it not bad for thirty seven dollars
after a mail-in rebate six hundred
dollars isn't quite enough to afford a
SSD and are billed so we're going to use
a seagate barracuda 7200 RPM hard drive
with 500 gigabytes of capacity this is a
good compromise between speed and size
and is a great deal for forty dollars
currently a DVD burner is certainly
optional these days however it's still a
useful feature so we'll use a light on
CD DVD burner for 21 dollars although we
can easily cheap out and get a micro ATX
case
integrated power supply instead we're
going to use an antec 300 ATX mid tower
case and thermaltake tr2 500 watt power
supply by spending the extra money we
get a larger higher-quality case giving
lots of room for future upgrades in
addition to plenty overhead as far as
powder is concerned $85 for the pair
after rebates isn't half bad last but
not least we have a shiny new system
builder copy of windows 7 home premium
64-bit if you already have a copy of
Windows you can easily skip out on this
but either wise this will run you a cool
one hundred dollars so how much did we
end up burning through the debit card as
of april 26 2011 the entire list will
run you 592 dot eighty-seven cents after
all mail and rebates and combo offers on
newegg com of course since this is a
custom build feel free to customize it
to your own liking but overall if you're
interested in PC gaming this should get
you up and running with a nice rig
without breaking the bank</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
