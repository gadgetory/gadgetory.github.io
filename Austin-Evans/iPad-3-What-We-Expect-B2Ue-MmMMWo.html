video going over the iPad 3 so we're
getting very close so you only be a
couple more weeks now and we've got some
more information about the screen what
kind of specs it's gonna how it's gonna
look like all that kind of good stuff so
let's just jump right on in to start us
off with we had some pictures of what
supposedly they leaked ipad 3 first of
all the overall design seems to be
fairly similar to the iPad 2 or with
this actually now has a tapered design
so up top it's gonna be roughly the same
thickness give or take a little bit over
as you go down on the iPads that you're
going to get slightly thinner which
would be kind of nice it's kind of
similar to what Apple is done on the
MacBook Air if you take a look at the
second picture you will see that the
iPad 3 looks to have a much larger
camera so of course the iPad one didn't
have a camera the iPad 2 doesn't have a
particularly great one but according to
this rumor the iPad 3 will actually have
an 8 megapixel camera probably what the
same thing that you will find on the
iPhone 4s at this point it's pretty much
a lot that the iPad 3 will have a Retina
display and thanks to Mac rooms we have
a little bit more evidence as to why
they were able to pick up an iPad 3
display and put it underneath the
microscope and as you can see here it
looks to have exactly twice as many
pixels as the current iPad 2 so well
that means of course you need double the
pixels you will get a Retina display if
you do the math it's the exact same
resolution that we've been talking about
and hearing about for quite a while so
as far as what you kind of screen you
get on the iPad 3 it should look very of
course you know the colors I'm thinking
gonna be great but as far as the
resolution the detail everything it
should be absolutely outstanding just as
it is on the iPhone 4s finally we have
little information on the specs of the
iPad 3 so there's a logic board that
supposedly came out of an iPad 3
prototype and on you conclude the see an
Apple a5x processor right now the iPhone
4s and iPad you have the Apple a5
processor so this is a 1 gigahertz
dual-core chip and taking a look at the
name of the a5 X tends to indicate that
it would be more of a kind of a small
upgrade as far as speed goes I know well
this is certainly possible I'm a little
bit skeptical for a couple of reasons
the first thing is that some information
as far as quad-core CPUs was found in
iOS 5.1 tends to indicate of course they
would be capable of using a quad-core
chip on top of that there are also many
Android phones as well as Android
tablets which will be coming out in the
very near future with quad core
processor so I kind of find a little bit
odd that Apple would just stick with
dual core for a full other year but who
knows that's going to be about it for
the iPad 3 star as when we're going to
see this my best guess would be
March 7th we've got a lot of people
coming forward saying yeah that's gonna
be the date that Apple is going to
announce it so my best guess would be we
would see the event on March 7th and
would probably go on sale within a week
after that if you guys are interested in
more videos on the iPad 3 when it's
released of course including an unboxing
review demos all that kind of good stuff
definitely be sure to subscribe to the
channel here we go look at you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
