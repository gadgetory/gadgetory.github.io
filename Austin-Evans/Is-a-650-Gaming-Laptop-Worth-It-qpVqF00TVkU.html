laptop worth it so this is the new HP
Envy x-360 now while it might not look
like a gaming laptop inside it is
rocking the brand new AMD rise in mobile
if you've bought a laptop in the last
few years more than likely it was
powered by Intel however AMD has stepped
it up in a big way with rising mobile
not only does this have a much more
powerful CPU but the graphics should be
good enough for actual gaming so it is
definitely a larger laptop with a 50
inch display but as part of their x360
line or getting here is a fully
convertible design which actually isn't
too thick either however wise it feels
pretty nice so we're getting a slightly
sharp angular design which a lot of HP
laptops have had these days but
considering the 6m $50 price point it
looks and feels pretty premium open this
guy up I'm going to see the full-size
keyboard as well as number oh as well as
the Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen speakers something
you won't find however are any stupid
Intel stickers all over the laptop
actually there are no AMD stickers at
all are they reports there's a pretty
decent selection including HDMI a USB 3
as well as your headphone jack and on
the other side you're going to be
getting one more USB 3.0 a USB C that
supports charging as well as a full size
SD card slots HP doesn't claim that this
is a gaming PC but with horizon 5 inside
it should be capable of some decent
gaming so not only are we getting a quad
core Xen processor we're also getting 8
Vega GPU cores now that's not going to
be able to blow away some proper
dedicated graphics but the idea is is
that for $602
especially considering that this is a
very battery focused sort of lightweight
laptop it should give us decent gaming
performance
Rison has proven to be pretty impressive
on the desktop side offering a lot of
fast cores at a reasonable price
thankfully that comes across to rise in
mobile so in Geekbench while it's not
quite on par with Intel's latest 8 gen
15 watt processors it actually performs
really well compared to slightly older
Core i5 definitely plenty of performance
for pretty much any kind of normal usage
where things get really interesting is
with those Vega graphics so it is a huge
step up over something like Intel
integrated graphics and it's even on par
with some of the lower end dedicated
graphics options now this might not
sound that impressive beacons
that this is all in a 15 watt chip it
nearly matches until the latest and
greatest on the processor side and
completely destroys them on the graphic
side and again this is from AMD to put
this to the test we have csgo now here
running at 1080p on medium where she's
getting pre decent frame rates so we're
averaging somewhere between the high 40s
to mid 50s and that is definitely very
playable obviously ideally you're
running it like three hundred thousand
frames but considering that we've got a
6m 5000 laptop I'm definitely I'm
complaining next up we have rocket
League now this is a game that is pretty
popular and it's also not that hard to
run and yet again here running at 1080p
this time on quality settings now the
frame rates actually really impressive
here where's pretty much staying above
sixty frames per second at all times
while I was terrible so in theory we
actually could bump the settings up all
the way up to a high quality if we
wanted to move over to GTA and we're
actually getting pretty decent
performance so on normal settings at
1080p we're getting between 30 to 40
frames per second for less demanding
areas like this we're actually in the
mid 40s or so we get a lot of explosions
sometimes the dips around 30
but again pretty playable to really put
things to the test we have pub G and
well this is not so great so I had low
settings at 720p we're barely getting
like 27 28 frames per second I mean this
is a little bit more of an open area but
you can't really walk beside this
building we're still barely touching 30
it's kind of usable it's not the worst
experience I've ever tried but um maybe
not the best pub G machine in the world
things aren't all perfect and normal use
either so his first thing out this
laptop I had some weird driver issues
where the screen would go really dim and
I would have no control over it and
sleep mode just completely disappeared
thankfully if you windows updates fix
that but still not the best out of box
experience now it's not a huge surprise
considering that this is one of the very
first rising mobile products to actually
go on sale so there might be a few kinks
to be worked out I will say though the
envy x-360 is a nice piece of hardware
and of course you do have that fully
flexible hinge and while it is nicely
weighted I don't like how much wobble
there is when you actually touch it
although again this is a very common
complaint with pretty much any of these
sort of convertible designs the keyboard
also isn't too bad it's not like do I
like the spacing in the layout with
having the number oh but it also has a
nice feel and importantly especially
considering the price it is going to
backlit with the screen issues patched
it's a good panel so if 15.6 inches with
a 1080p resolution it looks pretty good
and especially with this kind of size
and price point I feel like 1080 is a
totally reasonable sweet spot for gaming
as well as productivity now the actual
display itself the color is nice and the
contrast is pretty impressive however it
just doesn't get that bright so you're
looking at a dead on it's okay but that
combined with the fact that it's really
reflective means that if you get this
guy even slightly off access it is
really hard to see anything so like a
lot of other HP laptops recently it does
have Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen branded speakers
especially considering that's a pretty
big speaker oh that's directed straight
at you not only does it sound pretty
good but it gets surprisingly loud
however it's not all great so the
trackpad is just kind of okay now I
really wish it did have Windows
precision drivers as is the tracking is
okay and it does support most of the
major gestures but the tracking could be
a lot better and especially the trackpad
size feels a little bit small for a
laptop in 2018 there's also Windows
hello support for facial recognition
which is a nice feature except that for
me it really only works when I get my
face very very close to the laptop the
webcam isn't much better so it is at
least 1080p so as you guys can see even
this quality team crispy this is
definitely not the biggest issue though
is the hard drive so while the rest of
the system is pretty well inspect out
with Verizon five dual Channel eight
gigs of memory however having a
mechanical hard drive and a laptop in
2018 just feels slow it would be so nice
if they had actually configured this
with an SSD on one hand rice and mobile
is seriously impressive look mat just a
few months ago and Intel was selling
15-watt laptop processors with
lackluster graphics and only two cores
yeah they've stepped it up to quad-core
now you look at AMD who has come out of
nowhere with an impressive park core
design and some seriously powerful
graphics again this is from AMD I know
it keeps saying that but it is really
impressive what AMD has been able to
pull off especially coming out of
nowhere like this now sure this is not
going to be a super high-end gaming PC
that's going to work for everyone but it
does have enough power to play some
pretty decent games on the other hand
the ndx 360 is good but not perfect I
feel like the guy had about 85 percent
right with a better trackpad a couple of
tweaks and especially
standard SSD I would like this thing a
lot more what gives me really excited is
that this is forced Intel Nvidia to
price some gaming laptops in this sort
of $600 price range so if you guys want
to see a video on one of those
definitely be sure to let me know in the
comments below and I will catch you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
