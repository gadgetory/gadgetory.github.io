a really cool tweak for your iPhone iPod
Touch call the Nexus S live wallpaper
basically what this does is port so to
the Nexus live live wallpaper that
you've seen in Android 2.3 Gingerbread
over on to your iPhone or iPod Touch
it's really cool and the thing I like
about it I'll just give you guys a bit
of a better view here is that this is
not a video looping and winterboard you
know you via Slee there have been you
know animated backgrounds for a while
however this is not just some video
looping that you know is draining
everything this is an actually really
cool looking live wallpaper that doesn't
really take up any system resources
doesn't really sell your device down at
all so this is pretty much the whole
thing you guys can find in Nexus S just
in Cydia by searching Nexus S live
wallpaper it is free now one thing that
I've found with all what live wallpapers
is that there's one little bit of a bug
so if you go ahead and open up a folder
it will go ahead and revert to the your
standard background a little bit of an
issue but I don't think it's a huge deal
I definitely love the look at this so if
you guys are interested again you can go
ahead and check it out in Cydia you will
need winterboard installed but you can
just check out in Cydia and search Nexus
S live wallpaper it's pretty cool tweak
a definite recommend you guys take a
look at it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
