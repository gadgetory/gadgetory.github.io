today I'm here with the next series in
my tutorials on how to customize Windows
Vista with a pretty cool application
called nimi visuals I said it wrong so
forgive me I'm basically what name evil
visuals is as it is a well it's a it's a
application to enhance your Windows
Vista basic desktop now do note if you
are running Windows Vista ultimate or
Home Premium or anything like that you
can pretty much get by this video unless
there are a few effects in here but it's
really not really meant for you it's
mostly meant for people like me who are
running Windows Vista basic who do not
have Aero and though we don't have any
of the cool transparency effects its
basically what this this video is about
is just show you guys a really cool
program so that you can do all the
things basically add some add some flash
add some nice I cane to desktop anyway
let's get this one started
okay so the first thing I want you to do
is on your right you need to take a look
at there are two links I'll have one for
a must need you might have to have this
service pack installed it's called the
dotnet framework some of you might have
it some of you might not I will have the
link in there check it out because this
you have to have this this installed on
your computer before the visuals will
work if you have it that's great
if you don't have it go ahead and
install it it will take a little while
to install but yeah so once you've done
that go to the next link which I will
show you right now this link is
basically just to install the program
prior to come on to open if it open it
right okay so basically this is a really
basic installation
you don't even install the program it is
really really very simple let's just let
this load real fast basically what the
program is it do all kinds of
transparency effects um some cool
lighting effects all kinds it just some
nice just a nice eye candy basically
free desktop so basically a real simple
if you go this link let's see you can
read it like I don't know if I said
before but this is totally free and I do
know that there are paid ways to do this
but I like this myself it's free it is
still somewhat glitchy it's it's but
still if you don't go crazy with the
effects it's fine anyway so let's just
go ahead all I have to do is hit
download now download it's very simple
one of the easy install it does not even
install basically what it does is
wherever you download it
be sure to make sure that you never
delete that because it's not actually
installed the file the file that you
download is the entire thing so if you
accidentally delete that then the whole
thing will be gone so just keep that in
mind when you do it so just download it
just to have it put run it and then you
have to run it once first and then what
you can do I just close this out it's
just what I just did was I just dried a
shortcut onto my
stop but once you first run it if you
can see down here the little icon will
pop up down here and basically you will
look down there and hit Center and this
is this is the thing and I here you can
see it you know
now before I began I will definitely
want to let you guys know if you have
Windows Vista basic computer you will
need to kind of be careful with some of
these let's say that they will mess your
computer up but well most computers that
were running Vista basic can't run arrow
and that's for a good reason
because they just don't have the
hardware so even though you can do one
of the stuff in here you might want to
just be careful maybe I add like a half
a dozen effects which would really slow
your computer down really it's all about
customization just just check what you
want what looks good but don't check so
much that you your computer starts lag
or anything like that basically just
kind of experiment now as you can see
here on the pre books on the previous
video I had how to install themes and I
have the windows 7 theme as you can see
here I've already got the taskbar
enabled I was just show you this real
fast you see that this is transparent
which normally is not I've already got
this on I will show you how to do this
but um so you can see that it's already
starting to look like Windows 7 I will
have a full video on more stuff to do
like how to change taskbar concert
anyway so once you had this up and I
open up effects and basically what you
do you can't go into feature didn't have
it auto do it but you know it's not a
big deal I'm just going to show you
there are quite a few effects um aren't
a lot but there are quite a few and
basically what you do is you you have
different the different things like
transparency effects and windows or you
can go into all I'm just going to active
just to show you guys it's a I've only
got two on right now it's the taskbar
and start menu like I said you can see
down here the taskbar is transparent and
the Start menu looks very nice the
transparent and again that that's a
glitch that I will try to fix for you
guys later but kind of taking this
slowly and then non active window
transparency now to show you guys what
that is and I open up a couple of
different windows
there we go open that up and I open up
both a music now I'm gonna show you guys
and it takes just a second to load if
you
I just Angela you look at like for
example this documents you can see the
it is transparent you can't see it so
much something go ahead and minimize
this it's kind of difficult you see how
it fades in and everything um my
computer's a little slow so you might
adjust it might just like love it there
but as you can see it looks nicely
transparent and then if it wants for
point does make it on my computer does
take a second but it's not really a big
deal for me and then you can see like
that that just adds a little bit of nice
transparency looks nice or headshot all
these down pull this but seriously I
will just be really brief and show you
and one thing when you click them when
you hit one of these be sure to hit this
little refresh because that will show
you that they come up sorry you forgot
to mention that okay I back out again I
can show you there were quite a few
I will not really show you that meaning
whenever I turn them on my computer like
so I will but there were quite a few um
man just mess around with them something
like I said don't go crazy try as many
as you want and then test your computer
out and see if your computer starts to
lag using you know blue windows or
whatever then you know that you might
not want to use that one so much same
goes for like all any of them and in
addition you know if you add like four
or five then maybe your computer might
not run that well in addition some of
you some of these depending on what what
hardware you have might not even work at
all if it doesn't don't it's not it's
not the program it's just that you're
you don't have like maybe the video card
or whatever like that anyway that's just
about it guys don't want drag this out
but it's a really cool thing if you have
Vista basic and if you don't there are
still things for like if you have like
Altima tour whatever
like like windows edge snap which I
won't I sorry I can't show a lot of
these it's gonna slow down but some nice
effects um I mean none of this is
strictly necessary I mean almost all
just for looks but it's kind of nice I
mean you can just look through like I
mean I mean I'm gonna try to do them all
um the program is pretty robust in my
opinion I haven't had any problems with
it I haven't used that lot yet is still
fairly new but I like quite a bit anyway
that's just about it guys
