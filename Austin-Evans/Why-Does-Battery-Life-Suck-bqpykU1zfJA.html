the video talking a bit about battery
life batteries are a lot of devices that
we use on a day-to-day basis whether it
be a phone a tablet a laptop you name it
now obviously pretty much any kind of
electronic device that we use will draw
power now for example if you have
something like a desktop or a game
system something that's plugged into a
wall no big deal you can pull bat as
much power as it wants as long as you
can you'll pay your power bill it's no
problem on the other hand portable
electronics are pretty much entirely the
mercy of their batteries and well sure
there are some devices such as ereader
they can actually last quite a while a
lot of charge for the most part you're
going to be constrained to a few hours
before your battery hits zero if you
take a look at how technology is
advanced in the past 10 20 years you'll
see the batteries really haven't done
much for example in 1999 you could go
buy a powerbook g3 from Apple it's going
to have a 333 megahertz processor and
yet still going to get about five hours
of battery life contrast this was a
brand new MacBook Pro you buy today and
while it has a 2.5 gigahertz quad-core
processor which is about a hundred times
faster and yet you're not really going
to get much better battery life well you
can really trace it all the way back to
the 1960s when Moore's law was invented
basically what this means is that every
18 months integrated circuits in this
case CPUs need to double in speed and
this is actually happened pretty much
consistently over the past 50 years
every 18 months or so you see a pretty
major job and everything is about twice
as fast as it was 18 months previous and
of course all this trickles down into
phones tablets and pretty much all other
devices we use for example if you'd open
up the smartphone such as the iphone
what you're largely going to see is a
circuit board attached to a battery of
course it still works is still a great
phone and deep smartphones in general
are still taking off at an incredible
pace but just imagine if the battery
didn't have to take up such a huge
amount what else like it add more memory
could be faster etc etc course every few
months we hear about some major new
battery breakthrough that's going to do
this so it's going to do that but for
the most part these things never really
pan out but coming back to the here now
there are definitely some tips that will
help you improve your battery life today
for example screens are one of the
number one draws of battery life so it's
not big deal to you just turn the
brightness down a little bit same goes
for closing onion applications for
example something that's really not
necessary like a live wallpaper can
definitely give you a little bit more
time I also highly rec
that you calibrate your battery on a
regular basis if you're not familiar
with what this means basically what it
is take your device can be pretty much
anything with rechargeable battery and
burn it all the way out until the device
shuts off and then immediately plug it
in and allow it to be fully charged up
by doing this not only will it give you
some more accurate readings but will
also be very helpful for your battery
life in the future anyway guys it's
gonna be about it I'm very curious know
what did you think about the video if
you wanna see more like this that's be
sure to let me a comment down below let
me know let me to change anything or how
it was because I can't my doing videos
like this I think it's kind of fun if
you enjoyed this video definitely sure
to leave a thumbs up and if you want to
be notified whenever I post them to
video be sure to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
