here with the closer look at the new
Galaxy s4 samsung invited me out to New
York City for the launch of their new
experience shop and Bruno Mars was even
there and played an awesome private
concert but they also had the galaxy s4
out on display I'll definitely be doing
a full review of the gs4 soon but since
I was at the event I had the chance to
catch up with Ryan Biden to ask him some
questions about the phone all right
intro so so really you're reading your
questions off an HTC One sure so as
Director of Product Marketing my team is
responsible for all of the messaging for
a phone so how we talk about them the
features that we highlight and basically
how they get sold here in the US so
galaxy s4 our brand new flagship device
and there's really probably four main
things that have somebody who has no
idea about this phone I draw your
attention to so the first is as soon as
you pick it up you're going to see the
big bright screen 5 inch full HD super
amoled beautiful display looks fantastic
then when you start to use it there's a
couple of things you're going to want to
do right away want to start taking
pictures with the camera so we've got a
great high-end 13 megapixel zero shutter
lag camera in there with lots of really
unique software features that make
taking those photos and really taking
really unique photos that much easier so
with modes like dual camera eraser shot
drama shot being able to do really
unique stuff you never do with a camera
let alone a cell phone camera before so
lots of neat stuff there we've got some
really neat new ways to interact with
the phone with air view and air gestures
so now I can interact with my phone
without even touching it so either
hovering my finger over to get more
information or waving to answer a call
if my hands are dirty or my hands are
full so lots of really neat ways to
interact with the phone and then the
other piece would be that we've actually
got a really cool feature built-in it's
got an IR controller so it can now
actually control your TV set top box
home theater system DVD player blu ray
player all of that stuff and it's got an
integrated program guide so show
recommend shows for me based on what I
like to watch and then I just tap the
show watch it on TV so lots of oh and it
does all the basic stuff you'd expect
your smartphone to do as well so you've
got all these really cool really unique
stuff plus all the bay
obviously the galaxy s3 was hugely
successful for us I mean it's done
great-greats been very successful in the
market and from a design language
danboard it was also very well received
so what we wanted to do is create a
device that kind of continued that feel
on the things that people liked about
the galaxy s3 in terms of design
removable battery kind of look and feel
but then really extend the software
functionality make it truly unique so
for us it became less about kind of the
hardware specs although they're great
but it's what are those experiences on
the galaxy s3 that people really liked
and how we can continue to build and
refine them the great thing about being
Samsung is we make lots of devices in
lots of different areas so for example
we know people like a great camera on
the smartphone and we have products like
the Galaxy camera that we can leverage
to understand how can you do cameras
differently how can you do that stuff
better and then take that you I now kind
of bring it back into our devices so
really understand how consumers using
all of our devices and start to bring
those things together why exactly did
you guys choose to go with the same kind
of plastic design it's about something
like metal or glass or yeah I mean not
surprisingly it's a common question what
is they so the thing to keep in mind
around all that stuff is it's about
being very purposefully designed so we
know that people are using these phones
for a long time carrying them around and
as they get bigger they tend to get
heavier so one of the things that's very
important for us is keeping the device
thin and light and so by using the
polycarbonate materials instead of
aluminium we get to be able to do that
the other thing is that it allows us to
have that removable battery and
expandable memory and at this point
we're pretty unique in the spaces we're
just about the only ones doing that
today so of course big thanks to Ryan

galaxy s4 in the comments below if
