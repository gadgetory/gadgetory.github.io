going to be building myself a brand new
gaming PC rig it has been quite a while
since I've actually built a system
that's going to be for my own personal
gaming exploits and well it seems like a
good excuse to do another PC build
tutorials better hold my fort night
skills Dave we've got some pretty
high-end hardware and most of that is
thanks to Intel we're also enough to
sponsor this video so first of all we
have the 32 gigabyte obtained module
we're actually going to be doing
something kind of cool with this a
little bit later with our steam drive
but we also have this the holy grail of
gaming CPUs the core i7 8086 so what
separates this from a standard core i7
is what's still going to have that same
six core design it's going to be clocked
even higher the boost talked on this guy
is 5 gigahertz and that's out of the box
as a k-series processor we can overclock
it even farther
although 5 gigahertz is pretty fast for
the case I'm using the NZXT H 700 I now
this is a very large case it actually
does support a ATX motherboards as I
almost cut myself with a knife that
would have been bad but one of the main
reasons why I want to go with this is
because this is my news build that I
actually want to use for a while and I
want to be able to have plenty of
expansion and with my set up currently
as is at home space really isn't an
issue so it should be no problem to be
able to fit this guy underneath the desk
before we get too far into the build one
of the first things I want to do is
start swapping out some fans so this
case actually does have quite a few it
has three 120 millimeter fans up front
the problem is is that well they're not
RGB of course we need RGB the next up of
the build is the motherboard so we are
using the asustor primes these 370 a a
seuss generally make some pretty solid
boards in fact they make some of the
best boards period and the top of that
we're also trying to unify everything
around or a sink weather will actually
get everything on board is another story
but this should do the job
one of the nice things about going with
a Z 374 like this is that we're going to
be able to support not only our m2 SSD
we can also take advantage of octane at
the same time so we're going to be using
octane and a little bit of a different
method than usual typically speaking you
would pair this with a standard
mechanical hard drive you would run
Windows absolutely everything on it and
the advantage is that this is going to
give you a much much faster response
time on things that you're going to be
using on a regular basis think about
like window
your main programs anything that the
system sees that you're constantly using
it will keep stored in the obtain cache
but for this video we're actually gonna
be taking advantage of this for a steam
library inside this very plain box we
have what is well a pretty plain looking
hard drive but this my friends is
something kind of special this is a full
14 terabyte Toshiba hard drive and not
only is this basically the biggest hard
drive that you can get your hands on
today but this pair with octane means
that we're going to have 14 terabytes of
some very very fast storage if we really
want to go crazy we could have picked up
14 terabytes worth of SSDs but well
that's going to be ridiculous it's also
going to be really expensive yeah yeah
that 14 terabyte hard drive isn't cheap
but if $550 plus the cost of an octane
module which is really reasonably priced
we're going to be getting a lot of the
speed but in a much much simpler and
much less expensive package install a
top 10 memory is going to be very
straightforward we just need to line it
up and then if we use a single screw we
can hold into place the only thing you
need to keep in mind is whether or not
your motherboard actually does support
obtain memory what are you doing okay in
addition to being useful when you're
building your own PC octane is available
in pre-built systems such as desktops
and laptops some of which I've already
taken a look at very recently for the
rest of our system storage we're going
to be using a samsung 970 pro SSD now
this is not going to be strictly
necessary technically we could run
everything off of the 14 terabyte octane
setup but well what's not to like about
a little bit of extra overkill in our
lives now comes the sad part cutting the
factory seal on one of the very few 8086
--is that are left in the wild so it's
going to a good place very very gentle
with this so with the 8086 on board it's
just a matter of lining it up with our
processor not using the super cool
assist tool and we should be good to go
we also have some memory by the way
Jason and Karis so we've got 16 gigs of
G skull sniper
X which should give us plenty of speed
especially considering that this is
actually rated up to thirty four hundred
megahertz progress so we have our
motherboard inside the system we also do
have our cooler so because we do have
such a high end CPU we do you opt for a
240 millimeter all-in-one cooler
this is going to be the courser h100 I
Pro with extra RGB because Ken thought
RGB would be a good idea for the system
on top of that we also do have our 14
terabyte hard drive installed it's going
to be kind of tucked around back so it's
gonna be right here but the important
thing is that well you don't wanna look
at that you want to look at the cool
stuff like this the GTX 10 atti which
was graciously donated for three days by
a good friend of ours who shall not be
named he wanted to be anonymous so this
is the ROG Poseidon platinum edition of
the Tenaya TTI now what's interesting
about this car is actually has built-in
cooling for not only water but also
liquid so if you wait I just say water
and liquid because this is a hybrid card
that can be used with liquid or air
cooling it should be pretty easy to
integrate in the build with that we have
what is basically the completed bill all
that's left to do now is tie it at the
cable management put the case back
together and see if this actually is
going to work my favorite part of any PC
build after night of Windows updates and
cable management the next step is to get
Intel octane memory up and running so
the first thing we need to do is make
sure that everything is set up in the
BIOS so then I do we have our 14
terabyte drive showing up here but
importantly we also have Intel Rapid
Storage Technology turn on then you just
need to install the Intel obtain utility
and after a quick restart we are going
to be able to see that natalie is our
obtain module showing up but we also
have our SATA drive which in this case
is the 14 terabyte guy so now if I just
hit enable this is so unnecessary they
did not have to make the animation so
cool so we now have an intel octane
volume with 13,000 and 39 gigabytes
windows just sees it as a single drive
which is one of the advantages of octane
so you don't need to do any kind of
switching back and forth it's going to
be able to do everything in the
background so we just go ahead and
create a new volume should be able to
yeah just mount it there okay we are
formatted so if I open up our drives
there we go we've got our octane drive
which looks like it's gonna be totally
fine
so right now I'm just copying over a
single steam game which is going to be
pop G but when the advantages of having
14 terabytes for a steam drive is who
can install like what like
seventy-five 75 gigabyte games that's
like all the games and with that
Lightning PC build is complete well
unless you count J's graphics card which
I should probably give him back but
luckily for us there's going to be a new
graphics card soon so maybe stay tuned
for that and give me little bit of time
to download 14 terabytes of games I get
to a part two to this video right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
