of the year where we take a look at some
of the coolest gear out there kicking
things off we have the Xbox one elite
controller while there weren't exactly a
ton of people complaining about the
normal Xbox one controller deally takes
it up a notch by bringing
customizability into the mix you can
swap out the thumbsticks with three
different options and it makes a
surprisingly big difference there are
also a pair of D pads the standard
option and a fasted version which is
better suited for things like fighting
games around back you can add up to four
paddles which can be remapped to nearly
any button on the controller this is
mostly useful for situations where you
want to press a face button without
taking your thumbs off the stakes on top
of that you can customize basically
everything in software including
remapping buttons and even going as
granular as adjusting the acceleration
and actuation of the sticks and triggers
everything can be saved to a pair of
profiles on the controller you can
switch between as well as saved on the
Xbox for tons of other games on top of
all the customizability the controller
is really well felt it feels premium the
swappable parts all attached with sturdy
magnets and everything you might need
comes in a dope carrying case things
feel a bit tighter than the standard
controller and you can even flip up the
stops for the triggers which can be
helpful for shooters making things even
better is that the elite controller
works on a PC - which is really nice for
gains that are better designed for
controller input it might be pricey but
this is easily one of the best
controllers ever no wonder they're
basically sold out everywhere something
that's a bit easier to find is the new
Nintendo 3ds XL while portable consoles
aren't as popular as they used to be no
one told Nintendo and they released an
updated version of the 3ds earlier this
year it brings it solidly into 2015 with
much improved 3d which was always a bit
of a weak spot on the original 3ds it
uses face tracking this time to adjust
the effect on the fly which works way
better I basically let the 3d off on the
earlier models but with the new 3ds it
feels more natural and I get to
appreciate the cool effects that I've
been missing in games over the years
speaking of the game library has gotten
really good on the 3s there are a ton of
fun titles like Super Smash that work
way better than you would expect and
classic handheld titles like Pokemon are
right at home here in addition to amiibo
support the new 3ds is also quite a bit
faster than the last gen you'll notice
it in menus along with some games like
smash or optimized to load much quicker
it might not be hugely exciting but it's
hard to argue that the new 3ds XL isn't
one of the best handheld game consoles
out there while NVIDIA has been making
graphics cards for a long time and they
experimented with hardware like the
shield tablet 2015 is a year they got
serious with the shield Android TV this
is a hybrid set-top box in game console
but with a controller included in the
box it's basically ready to go it runs
Android TV which means you'll have a mix
of games or originally for Android only
with a few more intense titles that are
designed specifically for the shield
you've also got streaming options with
GeForce now but the selection of games
that run natively has improved a lot
over the last few months and it keeps
getting better it's rocking some pretty
powerful specs too with an a core Tegra
x1 processor and a smaller version of a
desktop GeForce GPU streaming boxes like
the Apple TV have added games but
there's really nothing that can touch
the shield beyond something like an Xbox
Playstation or PC there's no doubt that
the consoles are more powerful but not
only is the shield smaller and quieter
but it does have a big advantage 4k
support there are quite a few video apps
available including google cast and
Android TV along with the Tegra x1 make
sure everything stays nice and smooth as
gaming spreads to more and more devices
I really think Nvidia is onto something
with the shield on top of my tech of the
year gaming picks I also teamed up with
my friend Marquez from mkbhd Jon from
TLD and gender from your average
consumer to round up our favorite phones
tablets and headphones which you should
absolutely go check out anyway guys
thank you so much for watching and I
will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
