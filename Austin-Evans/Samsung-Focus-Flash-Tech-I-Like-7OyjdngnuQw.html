next episode of tech I like today we're
going to be talking about the samsung
focus flash and now this is a pretty
good phone but it also runs Windows
Phone which in my opinion is one of the
best OS is around let's go ahead and
take a look the focus flash is a 3.7
inch Super AMOLED display it's
definitely nothing on something like the
Samsung Galaxy Nexus it actually is
really really nice so of course since
it's a super amoled display blacks are
super super dark and the colors are very
vibrant and very rich it also has the
same internals of pretty much every
other current generation windows phone
with a 1.4 gigahertz single core
Qualcomm processor 512 megabytes of RAM
as well as both the front and rear
facing camera even though this is more
of a budget model actually has a really
nice design so up front like I said
there's a front-facing camera as well as
the screen you also do have a pair of
capacitive touch buttons as well as a
physical windows button flip it over on
the back and you have a kind of faux
metal design which is where the battery
and sim card goes on top of that of
course you do have that 5 megapixel
camera as well as a speakerphone we can
talk about Hardware all day long but the
most important thing is that this runs
windows phone 7.5 mango now I've said it
before and I'll say it again this is an
absolutely fantastic operating system
it's also really fast so even though
it's only a single core processor
whereas most phones these days are dual
or even quad-core that does not detract
from performance at all anything happens
very very fast so opening apps flying
through menus a lock on stop it really
really just happens almost
instantaneously which is really
impressive considering this is basically
last generation hardware all windows
phones also have deep integration into
xbox live so when you first set up your
phone you're able to go ahead and bring
in all of your information from xbox
live over this means you get your
gamerscore your avatar and on top of
that you can also download new Xbox Live
apps to your phone play them you can
deviate gamerscore probably the biggest
problem with windows phone right now is
the lack of apps now while this is not a
huge deal for the most part general you
can find an app that does most things
that you need it is a little bit
annoying when you're looking for
something such as Instagram which just
flat-out isn't there however I do expect
this to change soon as windows 8 is
going to share a lot of DNA with Windows
Phone 8 and what this means is you
should be able to see a lot of apps on
both platforms which should be a really
nice thing for both Windows and Windows
Phone as much as I like the focus flash
I really can't recommend it not because
it's a bad phone or anything but because
the Nokia Lumia 900 is coming now I got
a hands-on of this to see yes I gotta
say it is absolutely fantastic
now i just have LTE also a much larger
display but it has probably one of the
best phone designs I've ever tried so
you guys are interested in a windows
phone I definitely recommend holding off
for the Lumia 900 but that's not to say
anything bad I love the folks flash if
you're interested in a really cheap
windows phone it is a good way to go
anyway guys it's gonna be about it this
week's episode of tech I like hopefully
you guys enjoyed and if you did doesn't
be surely this video a thumbs up really
appreciate that helps me out a lot on
top of that if you're interested in more
