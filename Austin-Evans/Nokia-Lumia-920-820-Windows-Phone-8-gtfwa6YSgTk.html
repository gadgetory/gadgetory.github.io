look at the brand-new Nokia Lumia 920
and 820 is some of the first Windows
Phone 8 devices to be launched these
have a lot going for them so let's take
a look to start with let's go over the
flagship the Lumia 920 and the first
thing is that it keeps the same
one-piece polycarbonate design and
that's a thumbs up on my book so of
course if you take a look at it's gonna
look fairly similar to the previous
generation however that's not a bad
thing at all is those were some of the
best looking phones out there plus it's
got some new colors like this yellow
come on that's got my name written all
over it it's also got a Nokia pure
motion HD plus display great name huh
it's not like I just took 20 takes to
get that name right or anything of
course not
this is a 4.5 inch panel with a
resolution of 1280 by 768 which is just
like 720p except it's 768 P because
Nokia is special beyond that it does
have a couple of cool features so you
can use it with gloves on which is not
something you can do with a lot of other
smartphones it's also supposedly got
higher refresh rates than any other
smartphone out there internally you're
going to find a 1.5 gigahertz dual-core
Snapdragon s4 processor and this is
pretty much the best of the best right
now and its really nice to see that
Windows Phone is finally going to be
expanding from just single core
processors I know that was kind of a
little bit of an issue for a while
beyond that's also going to have a 2000
million power battery which should give
it plenty of battery life for a full day
of usage and it's also got NFC built in
the 920 also features wireless charging
so it looks like it's finally time to
retire that Palm Pre of yours of course
this is going to be very simple thing so
basically you just take your 920 you put
it on a variety of different surfaces so
for example Nokia's going to be selling
a dock and there's also this pillow so
you can put your phone on a pillow and
it charges wirelessly one of the more
impressive things to me is a pure view
camera no no this isn't going to be a 42
megapixel behemoth but it still does
have 8.7 megapixels to work with the
real cool thing here is that it does
have optical image stabilization this is
a first for smartphones and what it
means is that there are tangle springs
built into the lens of the camera so
let's say that you're taking a picture
and low light almost cell phone cameras
want to go ahead and keep the flash on
as there's just not enough light over
the 920 actually cannot use the flash
and because it has those Springs to kind
of keep your image stable you can have a
longer exposure and get you a better
low-light picture this is also great for
video now that the 920 can handle full
1080p HD so again those little tiny
Springs are going to help make your
image a little bit clearer so when
you're holding around yourself
there's gonna be less wobbling less
shaking and better quality moving on to
the little brother we have the Nokia
Lumia 820 like all the brothers it
didn't get all the cool Big Brother toys
so it's only got a 4.3 inch display with
a resolution of 480 by 800 beyond that
though the 820 does share most of the
same specs so you are gonna have a few
changes so for example you will get
removable backs with the 820 and that
will allow you to get at the slightly
smaller battery as well as add a micro
SD card now unfortunately there are
going to be a few things missing like
NFC hope you can get that back if you
decide to go buy an nfc-enabled
backplate so kind of cool little bit of
customization it's always nice to be
able to get at a micro SD card and
change the battery both phones are using
the new Windows Phone 8 operating system
now I'll go to in depth on this for the
most part it's fairly similar to Windows
Phone 7 however there are some cool
changes like the home screens are now
much more customizable probably the
biggest thing for me though is now based
on the new windows 8 kernel so what this
means that you can design an app for
Windows 8 desktop and then you can pour
it over to a Windows 8 tablet and then
you can pour it over to a Windows 8
phone it's all going to be fairly
similar
unfortunately no key didn't get into
specifics as far as release day or price
although I definitely don't expect it to
be very long when this phone is expected
to launch in the middle of October
anyway I'm curious to know what do you
guys think about the new Lumia 920 and
820 firstly the 820 the lower resolution
screen kind of kills it for me but the
920 has my name written all over it I
can't wait to get my hands on that but
again definitely be sure to let me know
what you think in the comments below
anyway guys if you enjoyed be sure to
leave a thumbs up if you're interested
