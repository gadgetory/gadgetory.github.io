the video showing you some tips on how
not to get hacked now in the last couple
days there have been some major websites
that have been hacked
including last.fm key harmony and
LinkedIn and while there's nothing you
do about its a specific website getting
hacked if it happens it happens but
there are definitely some things you can
do to make sure that your data is safe
guarded and secure the first tip is very
simple don't use the same password on
multiple sites now I know we've all done
this before however it's a very bad day
as far as security goes so let's say
you've had an account at last.fm for
example okay so you use it and you have
the same password on that as you have on
multiple other sites well all it takes
is something like this to happen where
last.fm gets hacked all of a sudden your
password is available most likely with
your email address or all kinds of other
information it's available for anyone so
all they need to do is say oh okay you
have a gmail account with this password
let's go ahead and give it a shot they
go to Gmail they punch in the password
from last.fm and bam they have access to
your email and once they have access to
your email then of course they can reset
passwords they can get at pretty much
anything that they want to avoid this
it's really easy just don't use the same
password on multiple sites now to do
this it's really simple if you get some
crazy awesome brain just get a bunch of
different passwords for different sites
and just remember them if you're like me
though you probably can't do that so in
that case I recommend using LastPass one
reason you should use LastPass is that
will allow you to create a long random
password so for example a lot of this
might use a password similar to this now
at first place it looks like a nice
secure password however it really isn't
for starters it's all lowercase now when
you want to create a good secure
password it should always contain a
mixture of lowercase and uppercase
letters as well as punctuation on top of
that it's a dictionary word now anytime
someone's trying to hack you it's very
simple to go ahead and crack it if it's
a standard word straight at the
dictionary so instead you should use
something like this which LastPass will
create now of course there's no chance
that you're going to be able to memorize
this by yourself
but since LastPass has it saved you
really don't have to worry LastPass is
also integrated into most major browsers
so all you need to do is download the
extension and it will automatically it
fill in all the information that you
need as far as your passwords go you can
also opt for LastPass premium which is
$12 a year and will allow you to access
LastPass on pretty much any kind of
mobile device out there another tip is
to change your passwords regularly now
but the site that you rarely use
doesn't have any kind of major personal
information it's probably not something
that you need to worry about however if
it's something important like banking or
email it's a good idea to change your
password once to twice a year another
tip is to use antivirus software now if
you're running a Mac or a Linux computer
you really don't have to worry about
this however if you are running Windows
XP Windows Vista or Windows 7 an
anti-virus is a good idea now I should
know the antivirus is actually not
necessary so a lot of people do not use
antivirus and never have any issues in
fact I've had antivirus on my computer
for several years now without having any
issues however it is a good backup what
I recommend is to download Microsoft
Security Essentials and this is what I
run and I think it's absolutely
excellent not only does it not really
take up a lot of resources so it doesn't
bog your computer down like a lot of
other antivirus softwares but on top of
that it stays update and does pretty
much everything it needs to in the
background of course there are some paid
ones as well however I generally don't
recommend these just because well they
might be slightly better sometimes than
security essentials that of course they
cost and they're almost always going to
take up a lot more resources and slow
your computer down another very easy
thing you can do to keep yourself a
little bit more secure is to keep
everything up to date now there's a lot
of different things that are involved in
getting yourself on the internet so at
the base level you have your operating
system so this could be Windows 7 it
could be Mac OS 10 line it doesn't
really matter there are always new
updates to help with security and bugs
and all that kind of stuff it's very
simple to keep your computer up-to-date
now highly recommend that if you haven't
updated in a while just double check and
see if there are any new updates
available and install them to make sure
that you're as secure as possible you
should also keep your browser up-to-date
so if you use a newer browser such as
Google Chrome you really don't have to
worry about this as it will
automatically keep you up to date
however if you have an older browser
such as Internet Explorer it's a great
idea to use the update functionality
from time to time to make sure that it
is in fact fully up to date you should
also keep your plugins up-to-date so
these range from everything from flash
which is most likely what you're using
to watch this YouTube video right now to
QuickTime to Silverlight to Java
now generally these are going to be
spread all over your computer with
different options and control panels
however the best way to check to see if
they're all up-to-date is to use the
Mozilla plugin checker this website is
made by Mozilla the makers of Firefox
however it does work in any browser what
it will do is scan your computer for all
the different plugins you have installed
and see if any of them do need to be
updated if so a simple link will appear
here we can download the latest update
and get that all taken care of
lastly but definitely not least it comes
down to common sense
so of course you really need to be
careful about downloading shady programs
there's all kinds of spyware and adware
that is not a virus
technically but it's something that you
may accidentally install while you're
installing something so typically free
software will have toolbars or might
even have stuff that will put ads on
your computer all that kind of stuff and
this is not anything that antivirus will
take care of as you're the one saying ok
ok ok on the million check boxes so
anytime you install something it looks a
little shady just be sure to read
carefully if there's gonna be any kind
of toolbars or anything like that you
should also be careful with torrents and
illegal downloads now if you want it
towards something by all means go ahead
it's none of my business but you should
be at least a little bit wary of these
so right through a virus scan or
something before opening it up is you
never know what could be lurking inside
so you guys have it a few tips on how to
keep yourself more safe and secure
online and while there's no foolproof
way of doing this by taking a few simple
precautions such as not using the same
password on websites installing some
antivirus and being wary of what you
download it can make a big difference if
