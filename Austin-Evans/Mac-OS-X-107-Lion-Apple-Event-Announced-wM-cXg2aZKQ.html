update video just letting you know that
Apple just finished announcing that they
will be having a press conference one
week from today now this conference is
going to be all about the mac which is
pretty long overdue considering so
actually it looks like this one is going
to be mostly focused on the software
side so what it looks like is there
going to be announcing the next version
of OS 10 which looks to be lying as soon
as the taking a look at this logo does
anyway so beyond that um we probably
can't expect at least some new mex so it
would be surprised if we see maybe you
know a new macbook maybe the new macbook
air or who knows maybe even just an all
new mac all together and I'm so of
course guys I will be covering the
entire event live I'm it does it will be
happening once again I was just saying
next Wednesday the 20th at ten a.m.
pacific time so of course come little
early i will be live streaming the
entire band on blog TV you can subscribe
and i'll go ahead and put a video up
soon as it does i'll go ahead and cover
the entire thing live anyway guys
definitely let me know what you're
expecting to see out of this event i'm
now it's pretty much a given that we at
least get a preview of the next build of
OS 10 however what exactly are you
looking forward to seeing in that or
maybe are you looking forward to seeing
a new macbook air or something like that
whatever it is definitely let me know in
the comment section below anyway guys
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
