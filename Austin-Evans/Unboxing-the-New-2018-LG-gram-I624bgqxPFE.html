one of my favorite laptops of 2017 but
now it's back for 2018 with a brand new
addition huge shout out to LG for not
only sponsoring this video but also for
hooking us up with the very first 20 18
gram outside of LG now yes this is a
sponsored video however a few guys have
been watching the channel for a while
you'll know that I really really like
the gram so this is my 2017 lg gram if
you call my video I did last year there
is a lot that I like about this laptop
however there were a few things that
wasn't such a huge fan of and that
pretty much is what the 2018 gram is all
about
so the Graham is still available in 1314
as well as 15-inch varieties so this is
the maxed out 15-inch version which LG
sent mostly so I can take a look some of
the higher-end features that you
actually can get with the Graham now pop
open the box and the first thing we see
is the Graham itself and Wow so after
using the 13 for about a year now the 15
looks enormous but it's still pretty
lightweight especially considering how
big the laptop is we're also going to
get a USB c2 Ethernet adapter so like
the previous grand this is helpful
although it is only 10100 Ethernet so
it's not going to be crazy fast but nice
to have in the box and then we get the
power adapter so one of the nice things
is that even though this is a standard
barrel plug you actually can't use usb C
on the gram to charge it so especially
if you have one of the LG USB C monitors
or pretty much any other USB C charger
you can plug it in that way for such a
big laptop it always like surprises me
at how light this is
so I think that's actually where the
grand name comes from it weighs just
over a kilogram so even though it kind
of looks like plastic it's actually a
magnesium alloy and according to LG it's
actually survived a lot of different
durability testing although I'm not
exactly going to drop test my shiny new
one-of-a-kind laptop to test so I'll
just take their word for a mat drop
testing the laptop can take your closer
look inside the laptop and you'll see
that two of the biggest features have
their own wonderful stickers on board in
case you're curious about your new
laptop this guy not only has the new 8th
gen Core processors but it also has an
upgrade to a full Thunderbolt 3 port so
in addition to doubling as a USB C port
the Thunderbolt 3 port also does support
power data as well as something like a
5k my door
or even in an external GPU now you
should keep in mind that not all the new
grants will have thunderbolt 3 some will
just have standard USBC but this is a
really nice thing to see you're also
getting the power plug a USB 3.0 port as
well as full-sized HDMI and on the other
side at least on the 15th version you're
going to be getting two more USB 3.0
ports a headphone jack as well as
microSD one of the biggest upgrades for
the Graham is the brand-new quad core
processors so inside this guy we're
getting a core i7
8550 you 16 gigabytes of RAM as well as
one terabyte of SSD storage now don't
get me wrong the old Graham wasn't
exactly slow but moving up to a
quad-core processor makes a big
difference even normal day-to-day use
and especially when you get into heavier
tasks such as like video editing or
gaming this guy also now has dual
channel memory which is going to free up
a lot of additional memory bandwidth
especially when it comes to gaming now
you probably shouldn't pick up the LG
Gramma's gaming computer with the u HD
620 graphics are ok for some light
gaming such as rocket league here we're
playing at 720p and that was terrible on
performance settings alright you know
what we'll just call that intentional
remove a few screws from the bottom and
you get access to everything inside the
laptop now you might very well void your
warranty like this but there's actually
some interesting stuff in here including
not only access to our memory but we
also have dual SSD slots
now most grams will ship with one of
these SSD slots empty however because we
have the one terabyte version this is
going to be populated with a pair of 500
gig drives but it's really nice to be
able to see that not only can you
upgrade your memory but you can also add
an additional SSD down the road you know
what I've got to give LG a shout-out
here this is a really easy to work on
laptop even though they might not
necessarily want you to get inside of
here
everything is logically laid out so you
can get at your memory you can get your
SSDs the battery is pretty much right
front and center they did a really good
job of making this very friendly if you
do need to get in here to say repair
something battery life has been one of
the big strong suits of the Gramm and
that continues this year so we're going
from a 60 watt hour to a 72 watt hour
battery which brings battery life from
18 hours up to supposedly 22 and a half
according to LG now keep in mind that
that is with the 13 inch model the 15
does lose a little bit off the top and
you also have to consider that even
though it does have that bigger battery
it's going to be slightly offset by the
more powerful processor but that being
said this
is going to last you a very very long
time off the battery regardless of
whether you pick up the 13 14 or 15 inch
version of the gram you're going to be
getting a 1080p IPS panel now that
resolution might not be anything crazy
but it's plenty sharp even on the 15
inch model color is nice and vibrant
you're getting good viewing angles
decent brightness and importantly some
of the best contrast I've ever tried on
a laptop one of the more annoying things
with the original Graham was the
placement of the webcam it's below the
screen and gives a great view of the
inside of your nose thankfully LG has
addressed this with the new grin when
they move the webcam up top above the
screen you know like every other laptop
ever another small but welcome
improvement is with the fingerprint
sensor before it was on the touchpad and
well it really wasn't that big of a deal
it could get in the way sometimes
however thankfully for the 2018 model
they've moved it back to a much more
sensible location of the power button
I've got to give LG props it really does
feel like they were listening to the
feedback from the 2017 model and rolled
a lot of that into tweaking the new 2018
Edition now if I may make one suggestion
for the 2019 LG Graham how about a
dedicated GPU option if you guys want to
know more feel free to check this guy
out at the link in the description and
I'm curious what do you think about the
2018 LG Graham let me know in the
comments below and I will catch you on
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
