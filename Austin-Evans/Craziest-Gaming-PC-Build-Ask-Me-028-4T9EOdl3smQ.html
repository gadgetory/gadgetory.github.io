don't you will do a crazy high-price PC
build we're just gonna roll with it
so do you will do yes I do will do a
crazy high-end PC build and that was the
cut the compensator Allah illogical
computer but it's pretty intense for
Titan X's Extreme Edition processor some
badass motherboard 750 series SSD check
it out the thing the card the mark are
they're not right the most like crazy
system I've done was the electron which
was like four thousand dollars it wasn't
that crazy a little more reasonable
of a crazy bill the compensator
literally makes no sense and no one
should ever build it yeah I had a pair
of nine 80s and at 59 60 X C that's true
size it was high end but it wasn't like
completely insane like for Titan X is so
much yeah hey Austin which is better the
Galaxy Note 5 or the s6 edge+
so that's actually good timing because
we both just were using I was using the
note 5 for the last few weeks you've
been using guest Accenture Plus recently
right yeah I actually really liked this
green very violent screen I really like
the curve I know not everyone agrees
with me but I like how it fits in my
hand I viciously aggressively hated the
battery life so yeah battery is
definitely something that I'm not super
happy with I would probably lean more
toward the nuclide because I feel like
the S Pen is slightly more useful than
the the edge screen what they're they're
almost the exact same phone there's not
really a huge difference between them
yeah what was your favorite part about
filming scrapyard wars with the crew
scrap you're worse so that's actually we
just film that earlier this week you
actually don't have any idea when it
might be going live I shoot a few weeks
or something like that but I don't know
I think it's about yeah a few weeks yeah
I mean it's a lot of footage what we had
like that terabyte one a haribhai the
footage and one person editing it I
think you guys are gonna enjoy it it was
a lot of fun I don't know how compared
to like other scrap your awards you guys
have done for me it was life's really
fun so much fun yeah I think oh I don't
want to say any spores but because of
how the competition worked what was
between
and me so was like a three kind of
competition yeah it was awesome I just
can't say like the rules
what music player do you prefer Spotify
Pandora or Apple music so I really like
Spotify I've played around the aqua
music a little bit and it's fine but I
feel like Spotify is kind of like the
way to go
what do you use like whatever player can
play my music and file explorer does
Spotify have this bastian soundtrack
because that is the main thing I we can
check right we can check right now
I mean I'm joking I have not bought like
an album or anything in probably two
years because everything is on Spotify
there are a couple things I can't get
but like 98% of what I listen to I can
just plug them Spotify I just I actually
still play records like actual like
record records you probably off the door
or something to rude even if you don't
use five I don't really care but you
should totally get out straight like
come on it's 2015
get with the program what do you think
about the sony xperia z5 premium is 4k
really necessary on a phone
no no I know I don't think it is 1440p
in my opinion we've talked about this
portal - about this before is like kind
of nice but it's borderline for sure
yeah and to go on to the same
conversation we've talked about every
phone thing so far just gonna take more
battery and yeah 4k is way beyond and
it's just gonna take even more battery
yeah I I think it's cool like I think
for VR that would make a lot of sense
like a 4k looks yeah I'm super high
resolution high DPI screen microphone I
mean I've been tried the z5 premium yet
so I do want to hold off but I a lot of
times have difficulties seeing the
difference between a 1080 and a 1440
screen so I doubt that there will be a
huge advantage going up to 4k
will you ever continue your old youtube
channel so I had one video on one
channel or really long time ago I don't
know if this is what this is referencing
but it was an unboxing of an old ducky
keyboard or that is gone I will never
come back but I do have a YouTube
channel it has a few videos that are all
shot and not edited yet and one crappy
ice bucket challenge so man I can't wait
to subscribe
right now right sounds amazing there's
one video and it's like not even very
good was filmed with the phone so one
was a cool thing I wanna let you guys
know about is that I actually did a
awesome video with Josh from fractal
design going over the define r5 in the
world's quietest room so you saw the
video right yeah that's sick so
basically we shot this in like December
and it's finally come out there's like
crazy testing involved in everything but
you guys can check out the video on but
linked in the description and cards and
a lot of stuff you guys want to check it
out but that was so much fun yeah so

awkward hand gesture I do enjoy to give
