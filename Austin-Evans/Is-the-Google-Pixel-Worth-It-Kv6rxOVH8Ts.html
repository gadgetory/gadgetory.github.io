Google pixel worth it
Wow on top of the standard white and
black colors there's also very blue and
you know what they're they're not
getting that is very very blue so my
first impression is that this kind of
looks like an iPod Touch so you've got
the white front you've got that fairly
large sort of iPhone iPod like bezel
from the front and then I'm back you get
that stupidly bright blue color you know
I've kind of dig it so we get a simcha
and some paperwork you know I was about
to throw all this paperwork away but you
actually get three free months of google
play music with YouTube red so you guys
haven't tried YouTube bread yet give it
a try
three months now that's actually a nice
little touch that they've got the power
brick matching the very blue phone
that's cool
appreciate that next we have the Google
pixel XL so you can think of this is the
bigger brother to the normal pixel so
it's pretty much the same way that
there's the iPhone 7 and 7 plus it's
essentially the same phone but you're
getting a couple small upgrades like a
bigger screen you're also getting a
bigger battery
however pull it out of the box you see
that it looks basically the same not
exactly a bad thing though this is a
very interesting design at first glance
it looks super Allison generic but very
forgettable I guess however when you
look around back you get this giant
window so it's kind of color coded so
you can see this one's white this one's
sort of a lighter blue but what they're
doing here is something kind of
interesting there's actually a taper so
at the bottom of the phone it's much
thinner than it is at the top and I
think they do that to keep you from
having a camera home I will say the
white front isn't super flattering to
the pixels so this is a phone with large
bezels now that's not crazy it's about
the same size as what you would get on
the iPhone over there at least you're
getting an actual home button here this
is literally just wasted space I feel
like they could put a speaker or
something or just got rid of it all
together I kind of liked the idea of
having the fingerprint sensor on the
back of the phone I feel like why it
makes sense to be on the home button
it's kind of a little more convenient I
mean if it's sitting on the table it's a
little bit difficult to kind of
the phone but most of the time it's
sitting in your hand your fingers
already there so I'm a big fan there's
some nice touches with the hardware here
the power button actually has a
satisfying click and it's textured so
even if it's in your pocket you can pull
it out and quickly know which button
you're pressing and the whole phone
feels very sturdy it might not be the
most unique piece of hardware I've ever
seen but this definitely feels like a
premium device the issue is there are
400 other phones that feel just as
premium and this is a whole lot more so
the pixels are expensive and that's an
interesting strategy because I feel like
one of the most popular necklaces of all
time the Nexus 5 really was so huge
because it was a great phone at a budget
price these are not budget at all so
you're talking about over $600 for the
pixel and over 700 for the pixel XL and
that's what 32 gigs of storage you can
put these things up to 128 for another
$100 they'd better be good for that
price so after playing with the pixel
phones for a while the first thing that
jumps out to me is the performance these
things are fast so inside you're getting
the standard high-end Android stuff
you've got a Snapdragon 820 one full
gigabytes of RAM it's a speedy phone on
paper if you look at the benchmarks it
might not quite match up to the iPhone 7
however it's definitely up there the
thing that jumps out to me though is
that it actually feels fast so if you
look at something like the galaxy s7
which on paper is very similar there's a
little bit of lag it's not quite as
responsive is something like the pixel
which really seems like Google spent the
time to optimize it and make it really
as fast as possible something else
that's been impressive is the battery
life so this with most of my time with
the regular pixel and even though it has
a smaller battery than the XL it's
actually held up really well I've been
able to make it through a full day no
problem the software experience is nice
and clean though so if you get the
Verizon model you will find a couple
extra apps however they're all totally
uninstalled both bottom line if you get
a pixel you should expect a very very
clean build of Android these guys are
also rocking great screens so the
regular pixel has a 5-inch AMOLED
display with a 1080p resolution with the
excel bolt set up to 5.5 inches in 1440p
they're both great displays the biggest
difference really is that resolution for
VR so if you get into Google daydream
which is the big new Google VR
initiative you're going to see that
while 1080p looks fine as a normal phone
the 1440p is going to look a lot better
when you strap
our headset on however unless you're
really into VR you're really not going
to tell major difference both phones are
nice and sharp I generally do like the
hardware of the pixel however my biggest
issue is a lack of waterproofing which
is something we'll find on the iPhone
and s7 however my buddy John actually
did a full water test and it actually
didn't do too badly however between the
lack of water resistance and all the
glass over the place it might be a
little fragile and that's where my
friends at Rhino shield come in so when
they reach don't want to sponsor a video
I was totally down I usually don't like
to do drop tests however this thing is a
little special it might not look like
much however this simple bumper is going
to give us some serious protection so
not only does it have a lip to cover
both the front and rear but it also has
a custom material on a honeycomb built
inside which means that in theory this
should survive an 11 foot drop test so
to put the pixel to the test it's time
for drop test so this is about ten feet
or so I'd say onto solid concrete so in
three two one
Oh
all right and oh it's still your
recording uh I mean it's a little dirty
from the floor but honestly I think it's
fine screen still works yeah
totally good so this thing is no joke
now on top of it being available for the
Picts lifestyle you can also get the
Rhino shield for something like an
iPhone galaxy s7 one plus three it's
pretty legit all right so I'm curious
about the cameras on the pixels so I
have my good buddy Lamar here and he was
lucky enough to bring his car so I'm
gonna use that as the first camera
sample early they didn't uh uh the thing
are they're glad you Roland style today
so from what I've heard what they're
doing is it's constantly taking pictures
like non-stop bra and when you hit the
shutter button it just takes that frame
and then goes and gets a couple merges
it in HDR so you pretty much always
we're taking shots so process that you
in the background
exactly so when you hit the shutter
button all it's saying is hey look this
is the point where actually want to save
so that's why it's like immediately
taking stuff so something interesting
about the pixels is that they shoot 4k
with supposedly some really good
stabilization okay we are now recording
on the pixel can look in like mild
cyborg high that's all too crispy yeah
that's - Chris are cheap ah this looks
really nice yeah you'll see all the
parse out miss for shaving this is that
good okay well here do this it looks
really nice there's like some actual
depth of field like those trees behind
you look really nice so one thing with
the pixel phones is that unlike the
iPhone where you actually get a pretty
major difference between the plus and
normal 7 these cameras are completely
identical the camera app is a lot better
here I never really liked the normal
Google camera apps hi mom mom watches
she she watches you does she really yes
she does
well I am I mean it's hard not to watch
you yeah subscribe to youtube.com slash
Wilson's I that's not this most
important thing though how does it
selfie 1 looks good no this is actually
really nice and you can see the HDR it's
like pulling some of the highlight
detail from the trees so is the Google
pixel worth it sort of sure it will be
nice if it had a little bit more of a
distinctive design with less bezel and
waterproofing would be nice over
honestly there's really not a lot to
complain about I think it's easy to say
this is the best Android phone out there
and
basically it can really hang right with
the iPhone so if you're looking for a
super awesome dope legit ridiculously
solid incredibly impressive magical
phenomenal terrific phone so what do you
guys think about the Google pixel
