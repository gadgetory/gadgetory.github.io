13-inch HP Envy x-360 with rising seven
inside this is either going to be one of
the fastest 13-inch laptops you can pick
up or it's going to catch on fire you
may remember a few months ago we did
take a look at a bigger version of the
MB and it was cool it was not only going
to be a much larger laptop this is also
powered by rising v rise instead on the
other hand should be a little bit more
exciting what really drew my attention
to this is just how much power you're
getting in such a tiny package Meli is
this going to be a 13-inch laptop it's
going to be a really thin one at that
the first rise in laptops we took a look
at we're fairly low in sort of a more
the budget market with stuff like
mechanical hard drives but now we're
actually starting to see some that are
going to be much higher end with some
properly D suspects including an SSD so
I've been using the index 360 for a few
weeks now and I've got to say I
absolutely love this hardware and
nothing against the 50 inch version when
you shrink it down to a 13 inch laptop
this really does feel like the sweet
spot of the Ultrabook market the chassis
is entirely made out of aluminum and it
is seriously been it 15 millimeters and
less than three pounds
the it really stands out it's some of
the nicest laptop hardware that you can
buy you won't find Thunderbolt 3 is this
is an AMD system but it does have a
decent selection of ports including two
USB a ports as well as a full USB see
which does support DisplayPort
video as well as charging although I
will mention that you also do have a
normal charge board if you don't take
advantage of USB see creating these
speakers are straight-up awesome now
yeah they do take up a little bit of the
space but it is going to be totally
worth it so now I do you have banging
off some branding on the top speakers
which you're going to be facing directly
toward you there's also going to be a
pair of speakers on the bottom which
helps to give you a little bit more of
that low-end
now no it's not going to be quite as
good as something like a 15-inch MacBook
that's going to be much more expensive
and honestly for something that's this
small and this tiny and this portable
and this light and this thin and other
acronyms and adjectives and other things
it's great it sounds really good I need
to stop talking now you're also going to
be getting a touchscreen as well as I
full two in one design now in large the
laptops that's not always going to be
the most useful thing in the world but
considering how small and light this is
I actually did find myself using it in
tent mode and some of the other modes
fairly often now look it's not going to
be perfect hardware it would be nice if
it had a few more USB ports especially
something like Thunderbolt would have
been cool but for the most part I've got
to say I'm incredibly impressed with
stole all this and put together
especially considering the price unlike
basically every other Ultrabook on the
market this is going to be powered by an
AMD rising processor now in this case
it's going to be the rise in seven
twenty seven hundred you this is the
top-end model with four Zen cores which
all have hyper threading as well as the
full vega ten GPU then though it's not
going to be any kind of insane
overpowered gaming laptop what it is
going to do is give you much better
graphics performance than pretty much
anything on the standard intel sides the
idea is that in that same 15 watt TDP
you're going to be getting competitive
CPU performance and that much better GPU
performance but the issue here is that
the last time I took a look at horizon 5
system it was in a 15 chassis so with a
13-inch model are we going to have
thermal issues yes now just purely
taking a look at the CPU if you run it
through Geekbench you'll see that well
no it's not going to be quite on par
with the latest H and Intel poor stuff
it's not going to be that far off and
importantly in real-world use you're not
going to notice a massive difference the
graphics side is where things get a
little bit more interesting so as you
would expect with those Vega GPU cores
it is going to be more powerful than the
UHD 620 integrated graphics but what's
also interesting is that underperforms
the horizon 5 and the 15 inch version of
this laptop even though this is going to
be the higher-end horizon 7 with even
more GPU cores hmm
this thing straight up thermal throttles
now considering that we only have a 15
watt TDP of course there's always going
to be some degree of that when you get
into the long sustain loads when you
pair it next to the 50 inch version with
Rison 5 this guy is going to be
significantly slower and a lot of that
is because this clock speeds have to
come so far down so technically this
could be running up to a gigahertz or so
but realistically under sustain load I
was saying anywhere between 350 and 500
megahertz on that GPU clock and that's
going to be a big problem now sure for a
quick burst it's going to be completely
fine when it comes to long sustained
loads such as gaming which is going to
be pretty common if you know you want to
try to gain for more than five minutes
the thermals on the chassis and health
and this is really kind of hold back
what that Rison ship is capable of open
up the MV and you're going to find a
very basic looking cooler now that is
made worse by the fact that HP is pretty
conservative with the tuning on this guy
so one says it's about 65 degrees on the
GPU the throttling is going to kick in
that's going to be great if you want a
nice quiet and cool laptop if you want
to do anything more serious like gaming
it's going to mean you're going to be
leaving some serious performance on the
table there's also the issue of drivers
so unlike a traditional AMD graphics
card you can't just download them
straight from the site instead the
drivers should come straight from the
OEM in this case HP the problem is all
of these rights and laptops are that are
coming out are way way behind on driver
updates this guy for example is using
drivers from a few months ago but
they're stories of some other rising
laptops that have six seven even eight
month old drivers that's just never
going to be a good thing for gaming I've
played a lot of games I've done a lot of
testing on this and of course the second
we start recording this happens we're
just gonna throw a little restart its
way it's dead oh okay so fortnight not
really a big fan of running on the
system right now we're just
disappointing because this does
legitimately even with all these issues
have a lot more power than other
ultrabooks the issue is just that well
it kinda speaks for itself I guess the
screen is pretty solid so my unit has a
13.3 inch 1080p display although there
is going to be a 4k option and while
it's not going to be the most color
accurate thing in the world it's going
to be a little bit on the DEM side but
my biggest issue is just it's going to
be very very reflective considering that
an Intel ultrabook is generally going to
be about $1000 or so for this level of
hardware you're actually want to be
getting a pretty decent deal the problem
is is that you're going to be giving up
some on the CPU side and definitely on
the you know software working side
that's an important side in case you
were curious HP sells this with rising 3
5 &amp;amp; 7 s options and based on the level
of throttling you get in this chassis I
actually think it's better to go with a
slightly lower end config with resin 5 8
gigs of RAM and 256 gig SSD for $750 the
13-inch HP Envy x-360 is one seriously
unique little laptop no no it's not
going to be a great gaming machine that
definitely tuned it a little bit more on
the cool and quiet side versus raw
performance but I will say this good
luck finding a much more powerful laptop
than this in such a small and thin form
factor since we finished shooting the
video the HP Envy found an early demise
so I did was I plugged in a HP brand a
USBC charger to this guy which
apparently didn't play well with it as I
heard a little crack he started smelling
bad and not only does it not take any
power but it just straight up will not
turn on anymore
now I haven't opened it up to find out
exactly what the issue is I assume
something fried but what's weird is this
does accept USBC power so for example
when I plugged in earlier a 50 inch
macbook charger it had no issues but
apparently whatever the wattage or the
amperage was on that other HP charger
was incompatible so maybe stay tuned as
I try to get this repaired or replaced
because right now kind of did</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
