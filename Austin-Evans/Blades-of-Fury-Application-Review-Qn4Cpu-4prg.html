i'm here with application of you on a
new app by gameloft i'm in love with
this thing it's it's fantastic um yeah
let's go ahead and jump into it
basically it's just a brawler you know
just button Smasher you know just it's
really almost like an older arcade game
but its graphics are phenomenal I mean
really just amazing um there's some
options i'll go ahead and show you the
real quakers you know and options pick
languages game settings controls you
know that sort of thing also the
controls were actually really quite good
basically you can either have a choice I
mean you have a virtual d-pad or
joystick the d-pad works fantastic and
then you have a few buttons on the side
one of the some of the best controls for
the iphone now then go into profile you
do all this kind stuff now there's
replay i'm actually going to show you
that but it really works well you can
record your matches every single time at
the end it'll give you an option to save
it so now there's multiplayer as well
where you can play sadly it's just you
know over local so you have to be
somebody else with an iphone or an
itouch there's close to you but still
great feature you know okay so let's go
ahead and jump in there are several
different modes or story okayed but
basically they're all pretty similar um
you know you just pick character and
beat the stuff out of someone else so
let's just go ahead and hit up kate mode
now the battle count where you can say
like three and battle time all kinds of
stuff but you know i'm just going to go
ahead and just go for it so now you pick
a character so you know you there's a
bunch of different characters um like
him and this is this is my guy but now
let's go ahead just get right into it ok
this is i'm going to pretty fast paced
but it's tons of fun and like I said
these graphics for I mean if this would
have been out on PlayStation and look at
that I mean guys seriously totally
cheesy line I'm just gonna start
attacking basically you have this year
and just attack you smash attacks and
you had different button combos where
you guys depressed like can you do with
an attack like these red lips this is
like this light attack and this is like
the heavy attack and you have magic
which is this blue button up here y'all
set the co butch nothing that much and
like most games etob user shield you
know it will break and staff but ok so
let's go ahead and show you guys there's
nothing that'll quick and say he didn't
catch me normal difficulty is very easy
and you can go for a while and it's
basically two out of three rounds and
let's go ahead and knock them down now I
flap an eye on now lets you sure you
guys want these magic attacks okay now
you hold the button down charge it and
expose your special attack use
obliterate them you see almost not dogs
helped out yeah that's not much
challenge out me touch me yet but there
we go it really it's fun didn't you
smash the buttons you know but these
graphics are awesome and the gameplay is
tons of fun the bigots very repetitive i
will say hat I mean they say the same
thing over and over again but you know
you look at these graphics I mean that
not to mention the games fun and it's
just a good just smash button just blow
them off me it's fun see this button
right down here that's just to save a
replay actually you know I'll say that
replay that's just hit new battle and
then it's go ahead and uh oh i forgot to
mention you can also do your do your
little lot you can have the music play
it's not really that handy just because
it kills all the sound effects but you
can see there's another back here you
can see all this just fantastic looking
I mean 38 so can go ahead and get out of
this actually just show you guys um show
you guys some time let me show you guys
a replay real fast um this I'm sorry
guys I'm just this game just came out
like the other day I've just been
playing with it almost non-stop waiting
for the keynote and everything so it's
great so let's just pick oh I don't know
this one and use your flight and it
takes a minute to load and then you know
you just watch you have to do anything
so
is one out of court earlier on and you
see it's that guy and it's really cool
because I mean you can pretty much just
record your replays and it's really cool
now one thing I will say is that you
probably will want after you play it for
bed to turn up the difficulty but I mean
guys this game I highly highly recommend
it is currently 699 in the EPSCoR and
guys get this I'm no serious do you like
these kind of games maybe you don't
graphics great and it's such a long
thing because you see here the story
mode you played through each care
playthrough with each character you
unlock new characters same way with
arcade survival and practice and you're
constantly unlocking new skins and
everything especially when I'm really
looking forward to it is like Wi-Fi
multiplayer like random internet that
will be freaking awesome yeah guys a
review of this game is just awesome I
highly recommend it guys check it out
and I mean I highly recommend it that
just kids enough anyway guys thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
