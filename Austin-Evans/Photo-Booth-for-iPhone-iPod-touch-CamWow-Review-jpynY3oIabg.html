of cam while for the iphone and ipod
touch so as you guys can see here the
best way i can describe this application
is photo booths for the iphone the ipod
touch is it pretty much emulates it
perfectly from the ipad with just a
couple of minor things so the guys can
see here we have lots of effects all of
them are being rendered in real time
really runs quite well on the ipod touch
4th generation and of course the iphone
4 so let's just pick a random one less
this one as you can see here um it's the
same kind of photo booth funness that
you can you know photo booth finest you
guys know the drill it's the same all
the same effect sprung photo booth on
the mat and of course photo booth on the
ipad although one thing that it is like
an ipad is touch so you can't really you
know affect the you know the transitions
or anything like that you know the
effects rather not a huge deal but you
guys can see there's there's some fun to
be had if you want and you know see my
giant here except that looks kind of
cool if you also if you like flip around
to the back basin camera so if you don't
have okay an ipod touch 4th generation
iphone 4 you can do all this from the
back so it looks kind of cool anyway
still actually let's put my fingers
there and take a picture so you just hit
the button it will take a picture it
runs pretty well in the pretty smooth
but i'll just show you guys hear another
a couple of options you can log in via
facebook if you want to do that or you
can remove the watermark now this
application is free and you can it's
fully feature you can do everything you
want except it does add a watermark so
if I back out and show you guys that
picture I just took and you can see
there's a little can well watermark
there sometimes you can just crop that
out and you just delete it however if
you want to remove the watermark you can
you do have to pick two dollars via
in-app purchase not that great but
considering that this is free I think
it's a good compromise you can play
around with it do whatever you like if
you decide you want pay for it you can
otherwise you can just keep using the
free version just have a little bit of
fun with it so let's move around to the
front facing camera again and I'll just
show you guys
here last month yeah this is actually my
favorite ones I'm you can see here it
just renders everything in just three
colors white gray and black I think it
looks pretty cool I mean you know it's
nothing amazing is just one more
pictures show you guys but it's nothing
amazing but it looks kind of nice and
you know it's just kind of a fun thing
to have on your iPhone so you guys if
you're interested in this like I said it
is free you have to pay two dollars to
remove the watermark but of course
that's entirely up to you but definitely
recommend check it out play around with
it and see what you think</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
