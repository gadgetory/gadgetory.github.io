an unboxing of the brand new Nintendo
Wii U is the first new console of this
generation there's a lot riding on this
so let's take a look first step is to
pop the lid where we'll see two more
boxes so let's start with the top which
contains the accessories we get a full
retail copy of Nintendo land which is
only included in the deluxe set some
paperwork including a club nintendo
invite QuickStart guide in three
languages to help you get the Wii U set
up and a beefy manual that goes into
much more detail next we have the
massive power brick for the console
along the still fairly big charger for
the Wii U gamepad amazingly enough
Nintendo also includes an HDMI cable in
the box which will get you up and
running fast a two piece stand to put
the Wii U upright a matching stand for
the gamepad controller plus a cradle you
can use to charge the gamepad easily as
if that wasn't enough they also include
a censor bar for using Wii remotes with
all that out of the way let's move on to
the good stuff first off we have the Wii
U gamepad which is definitely the most
interesting part take it out of the
protective foam and you'll see the
controller and tablet hybrid ready to go
the gamepad itself is fairly large and
bulky but it's also very lightweight and
comfortable in the hands you'll see
quite a few buttons on board including a
pair of control pads and the full
complement of controls including a d-pad
shoulder buttons and your XY a and B
buttons up front you'll find a
front-facing camera which can be used in
games or for video chatting and on top
is where your stylus hides charging port
headphone jack and volume control around
back is support for future accessories
along with a small sync button to
connect it to the Wii U itself
speaking of let's take a look at the
console unwrap the deluxe Wii U and
you'll find it's much larger than the
original Wii with a glossy black finish
much of the general design is stayed the
same with a slot loading optical drive
and clean overall finish in fact putting
aside the size difference you can almost
mistake the Wii U for its predecessor
taking a look at the back you'll see a
pair of USB ports fan HDMI l AV L
connector for the sensor bar along with
the power connector up front is an eject
button for the optical drive your power
and sync buttons and behind the flap is
an SD card slot and two more USB ports
for a total of four so there you have it

deluxe set if you're interested more
