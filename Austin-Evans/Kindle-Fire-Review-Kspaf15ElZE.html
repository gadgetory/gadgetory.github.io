here with a review of the Amazon Kindle
Fire this is one of the first tablets to
come in at a lower price point while
still aiming to be a solid contender but
does it have what it takes at first
glance it looks promising the Kindle
Fire design is quite similar to the
BlackBerry PlayBook with a sturdy build
up front you'll find a 7 inch display
with a resolution of 1024 by 600 while
it is billed as an IPS screen I also
can't say that it's that spectacular
brightness is reasonable and colors are
ok but one of the biggest draws of an
IPS display are great viewing angles but
here on the Kindle Fire they're simply
average on the bottom of the fire you'll
find a small round power button microUSB
port for charging and syncing along with
the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack a
slight gripe is how small the power
button is but beyond that everything
works and feels fine flipping it around
to the top you'll find the stereo
speakers well they certainly aren't
going to blow you away I was rather
impressed the sound is quite decent
internally the Kindle Fire isn't half
bad sports a 1 gigahertz dual-core TI
OMAP 4 processor 512 megabytes of RAM
and a gigabytes of internal memory there
are some things missing like a micro SD
card reader for expanding your storage
as well as a microphone or camera
however for the price there aren't many
complaints all of these specs results in
a mostly good experience in using the
fire it runs Android 2.3 with a custom
Kindle skin and supports everything you
would expect in a tablet including
browsing the web email music video apps
and of course books as this is a Kindle
it would be a poor review if I didn't
talk about the reading experience in
general it works just like the Kindle
app on other tablets with support for
the entire Kindle library of books
including those as you have already
purchased there are also several other
Amazon services on fire you have a
newsstand for reading newspapers and
magazines and the Amazon mp3 music store
in addition you have access to
purchasing TV shows renting and buying
movies and streaming videos through
Prime instant video z-- the Kindle Fire
comes with the Amazon App Store it has a
reasonable selection of apps to choose
from with many of the staples including
Angry Birds Netflix Hulu and many more
there's also a featured free app
everyday which will help you pad out
your app library without breaking the
bank the apps themselves are less than
fantastic for the most part many are
made for Android phones and are blown up
to fit on the larger tablet display
which is a bit disappointing on the
other hand the
core processor is more than powerful
enough to handle all the games I threw
at it
Amazon has spent a lot of time touting
the silk web browser it uses Amazon
servers to speed up your browsing
however I didn't really see any benefit
from this at all the browser is very
similar to stock Android with the
addition of tabs it's not the smoothest
in the world but gets the job done and
has flash pre-installed DUI is a mixed
bag you get a lot on your home screen
with a carousel of your most recently
used items a dock for any content you
like along with a search menu and links
to important apps like books music and
more up top you'll find the
notifications and to the right of that
is where you can control screen
orientation lock brightness volume etc
this brings me to one of my biggest
problems with a Kindle Fire no physical
home or volume buttons to change the
volume you have to leave what you are
doing tap the top right and then drag
the slider which can be a massive pain
same goes for exiting an application
need to tap on the bottom strip to make
the home button appear battery life is
quite excellent on the fire I was able
to get close to nine hours out of a
charge with reading listening to music
on headphones and doing a bit of reddit
I mean web browsing standby time is also
good meaning you'll most likely get
several days out of the fire before
recharging the Amazon Kindle Fire is a
great tablet for $200 period there's a
lot to like from the great 7 inch form
factor battery life in excellent Amazon
ecosystem well I'm not the biggest fan
of the software or the lack of hardware
buttons I really feel that the Kindle
Fire is the first time that it's habit
has become cheap enough that it makes
sense for a lot of people if money isn't
an issue the iPad is a much better
tablet but overall for the price I
recommend the Kindle Fire if you feel
like being awesome doesn't be sure to
leave this video a thumbs up and if
