future of game controllers valve usually
does things differently in the steam
controller is no exception
pop open the box and you'll see the
controller self and a few accessories
like a USB cable included wireless
dongle and double-a batteries the steam
controller has a very different layout
than you're probably used to we've got a
single traditional stick and face
buttons but to try pads up top
everything about this controller takes a
lot of getting used to even something as
simple as having to face buttons on the
bottom right feels totally backward the
single control stick works well enough
it has a grippy surface with a convex
shape like the ps3 you'll see the
traditional shoulder buttons and
triggers on top and a pair of built-in
paddles on the back this actually works
really nicely although you'll probably
have to remap these manually as most
games assume you're using a 360
controller one thing I'm not a huge fan
of is the feel in the hand the plastic
feels a little cheap and it doesn't have
the same reassuring half that the Xbox
controller has the shape buries itself
into your palms which feels fine but
there's a fair bit of glossy plastic
which gets coated in fingerprints almost
immediately the weirdest thing by far
though are the track pads that name
isn't a coincidence it feels a lot like
a laptop touch pad where you would
normally find a thumb stick the other
side is a giant d-pad which works fine
although it's definitely not the most
precise thing I've ever tried on the
complete other end of the spectrum we've
got the new Xbox one elite controller
open this up and you're immediately
greeted by a hard shell carrying pouch
while this might be a little unnecessary
for a normal controller it comes in
handy for the elite as it's modular the
thumb sticks and d-pad are
interchangeable and all of your options
fit inside the case one of the first
things that jumped out to me is just how
rock-solid it feels it has a satisfying
cap and feels like it's up to some
serious abuse flip the controller over
and you'll find something else that
makes the special customizable paddles
these can be mapped to any of the normal
buttons on the controller and you can
pull them off easily thanks to magnets
it's a really dope setup you'll also
find a pair of bump stops for the
triggers this allows you to shorten the
Matt up travel independently which can
be helpful for some types of games for
the thumbsticks you have three options
the standard sticks from the Xbox one
controller a convex stick and the
standard option that's much taller like
the paddles these are magnetic which
makes swapping them dead simple and they
still feel solid while gaming you can
mix and match these as much as you'd
like which could lead to some
interesting combos depending on what
games you play the same goes for the
d-pad you can use the normal style or a
fasted version which feels a little
mushy but makes a lot of sense for
fighting
it also has a switch to move between
custom profiles along with the same
headphone and headset jacks for the
latest Xbox one controller the cool
thing about the elite controller is that
all this works not only on the Xbox one
but also on Windows setting things up is
simple just download the Xbox
accessories app and you can load premade
configurations or make your own you can
really go in depth with this by
remapping buttons and even adjusting the
sensitivity of the triggers and sticks
it's not all great news though the elite
controller still comes with double-a
batteries out of the box and while it
works wirelessly with the Xbox you'll
need to use the included cable or buy a
wireless adapter to play on PC so when
you put it all together how did the
steam controller an Xbox elite stack up
the steam controller is weird very weird
not only does it have odd button
placement but the touch pads just feel
backwards the best way to use them is
less like a laptop tri pad and more like
a typical thumb stick which in theory
works but in practice is incredibly hard
to get used to with enough practice you
could probably get good with the pads
and they make sense for some traditional
PC games that use a mouse and keyboard
but for the most part it really feels
like valve are trying to fix something
that just isn't broken the Xbox elite on
the other hand is the traditional
controller taken to the extreme as its
based on the Xbox one controller it
feels familiar but they've tweaked the
feel of the buttons and sticks this is a
welcome change the panels can be helpful
for when you want to keep both thumbs on
the sticks and the bump stops are nice
for quick reactions especially with
shooting games there's really not much
to complain about
especially once you start customizing
things it's a rock-solid controller the
steam controller is a lot cheaper and
while it try some new things it just
doesn't make much sense when you can
spend ten dollars more to get a normal
Xbox one controller the elite on the
other hand is about as premium as it
gets
Microsoft made what's one of the best
controllers period but it comes with a
steep $150 price tag to match so what do
you guys think about these controllers
let me know over on snapchat and I will
catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
