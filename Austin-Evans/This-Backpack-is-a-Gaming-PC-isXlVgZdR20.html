little bit different this is a full
backpack PC now you might ask yourself
why would you want a computer on your
back to which I reply virtual reality
with this you can have a completely
untethered experience so it is it not
only is it a full computer but it
actually has a battery built-in so in
theory you can play a game for about two
hours or so without needing to plug into
anything and that includes running the
headset off of the built-in battery
since this is battery-powered I'm really
curious how the whole setup works I mean
we're talking about a computer with a
core i7 and a gtx 1070 it's not going to
be power sipping by any means as always
I'll have a link to the VR go in the
description but be warned this guy is
not cheap so first we have the system oh
it's so heavy whoa oh you know what this
is actually not as heavy as I thought it
was going to be there's a 95 watt hour
battery that's uh that's no joke whoa
all right we our battery DUP so I guess
the idea is you can see the status of
each battery on the back of it
um now now we've got some weight so run
back you're gonna find all your standard
ports like a couple of DisplayPort HDMI
for some reason to Ethernet which is a
little weird on a backpack PC but the
idea is is that when you're not using
this on your back it still works as a
normal desktop so we have a DC end power
adapter as well as DC out so basically
you can plug in something like the vibe
headset directly here and we'll run off
the batteries now let's get into the
accessories which are equally enormous
so alright those are some accessories so
here it looks like we actually have the
backpack part yeah there we go
you know what that's actually not bad
ladies I don't know how I'll feel after
like two hours of VR gaming with this on
my back but it uh it's pretty
comfortable so when you're not in
backpack mode you actually have a normal
power supply as well as power cable and
oh this is probably for charging the
batteries man so the batteries use the
same power adapter from the system so in
theory if you want to do some extended
via our wireless gaming always keep one
battery on the charger and keep one in
the actual VR go and then just hop swap
them as they start to run out you know
what this is actually really well
thought through and hiding behind these
flaps on top we have a couple more USB
ports as well as we have HDMI and DC out
so this is probably the best place to
plug in all the five head gear stuff
full backpack mode but when you're done
with this you just pull it down and
you've got a desktop yo you know what
you stop ruining my vibe I said you know
what is it that bad to say you know what
come on Kenny's trying to ruin the video
so we have the VR ghost set up as you
can see it's actually not a crazy setup
in desktop mode so since we have power
HDMI and USB which is although the vibe
needs to be plugged in this is straight
inside the PC that means that we get to
avoid using this guy which adds tons and
tons of extra cable bulk alright this is
going according to plan so I have a PC
which is probably about to drag bunch
stuff with me we're now semi mobile so
the next step is we need to get the game
started all right I got this so let's
make sure this is actually working
yes okay so now comes the fun part of
trying to unplug myself all right
we're fully untethered now that phones
are here somewhere uh where my hitbox oh
ok will management there we go
I'm VR man ok this is a fully untethered
VR let's do it
okay you know what this is kind of cool
so top brush is actually a game where
you can do full 3d painting so with the
power of VR we can really create these
these wonderful masterpieces so just
something really special about being
able to have a fully untethered virtual
reality experience I have two cables
around I don't need to worry about
running into a wall
I very much I'm kind of immersed in the
game next we have Star Wars trials of
Tatooine this is actually not a full
game it's more of a demo
however Star Wars and VR sign me up and
I'm on Tatooine Wow hey our to do the DK
look at the lighting dude
hahahaha
well well that's that guy what happens
thanks for helping don't judge me I got
a little to say totally I'll be right
there you go crisis averted when you get
a little too vigorous with the
lightsaber the PC may or may not
actually stay on your back the veer go
is surprisingly good sure it's not
perfect and honestly it's probably not
the best idea to spend this much money
on a PC that lives on your back sure it
can't work as a normal desktop but if
that's all you need this is a little
little overkill however if you really
want to get the ultimate VR experience
it's hard to argue with this so what do
you guys think about the fee art
go-devil be sure to let me know in the
comments below and I will catch you in
the next one
I also hope I've been looking at the
camera this whole time I don't know
where I am</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
