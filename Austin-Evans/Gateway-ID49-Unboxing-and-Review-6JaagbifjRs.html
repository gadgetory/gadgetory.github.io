review of the gateway ID 49 on video
guys I just got this laptop go ahead
give you guys a full unboxing interview
it's going get into the box you can see
here is not a ton in here we do have the
laptop of course on the top it's really
thin like that top but we will go ahead
and show you guys that in just one
second so as we go ahead and open up
this kind of messy looking box we will
find a few things the first thing is the
the Quick Start Guide yeah so guys I've
never you gonna open it not a big deal
but you know you might want go ahead and
take a look at um and we'll go ahead and
open up this compartment right here and
you will see this is the power cable
it's a standard Acer logic 8 way power
cable pack so I have quite a few of
these but yeah no big deal it's kind of
large and here's the power adapter
itself so yea nothing guys all that
exciting but not a big deal so now we go
ahead and open up the battery um guys
this is a six cell battery it's kind of
grew it's a pretty interesting design
nothing that great I will go ahead and
tell you guys all about the battery life
just a little bit but there's a battery
and let's go ahead and open up the
laptop itself guys I really like the
design of this laptop it's really thin
it's really light is a 14 inch notebook
and yeah it's only about one inch thin
so it's pretty thin so go ahead open it
up usually get this piece of paper off
the keyboard it does come with a cloth
so this is a pretty nice high-quality
cleaning cloth really handy for wiping
fingerprints and auto stuff off yeah
guys that's it for the unboxing let's go
ahead and get to the review okay guys
I've now had this laptop for a little
over a week and a half and I think I'm
about ready to give you guys my full
review I'm so guys overall I have been
extremely pleased with this computer um
you know it's got a lot of really cool
features I'll give you guys the full
specs and all kind of stuff
but first let's go give you guys a quick
tour I'm so to begin with let's go ahead
and take a look at the top of the unit
so from the top left you can see that
there are two buttons one is a
customisable hotkey so you just click on
it and you can have it launched for
example your web browser or whatever and
right beside that you have the button
that will turn on off Wi-Fi I'm so
moving along to the right we have
touch-sensitive buttons these are
actually really quite good they are very
responsive and they will go ahead and
light up when you click them so you can
go ahead and skip and stop you can you
know fast-forward rewind and you also
eject the DVD which incidentally that is
the only way to do it there is not a
button on the DVD guide itself on lastly
we have the power button which is
actually a little bit rubberized it's a
nice finish and there is a speaker bar
all the way around now the guys this is
a Dolby home theater virtual surround
sound sound bar um guys the volume is
not fantastic but it actually is
somewhat like a home theater it really
does sound a little bit like surrounds
down you go ahead and you turn on a
movie music doesn't work so much you
don't because it's not made for surround
sound but I mean even with just the two
channels it will give you guys if you're
special if you're like sitting against a
wall it will give you some pretty good
sound now guys this is a fourteen inch
laptop so it does of course have a
full-size keyboard and actually it's a
really nice keyboard I'm sure as you
guys can see it's it's a really
interesting keyboard design it looks
very similar but it's a very the keys I
have a lot of give to them which sounds
a bit hogging the keyboard but it's
actually nice so as you can see here you
know as you're typing on them it really
works great it's actually one of
probably one of it's not the best laptop
keyboard I've ever used obvious now one
thing I do know is that behind the keys
is a it's all really glossy black
plastic I'm so guys I'm sure you know I
use this for a point you do this for a
week now and it's still pretty much
perfect I'm sure here you know in a
month two months six months it will
probably all that black plastic will
kind of get a little dirty and grimy
so the laptop probably won't look quite
as nice after that it's still not that
big of a deal moving on we have the
trackpad so guys let's go ahead and move
it up a little bit now guys this
trackpad is actually one of the main
reasons that this laptop caught my
eye um so guys ordinarily you can use it
just like a normal track pad but as you
can see guys it does not have two
physical buttons is all one trackpad and
there's just online I'm so guys this is
a really interesting trackpad for a
quite a few different reasons
first of all it doesn't work just like a
trackpad it is not multi-touch enabled
out of the box however but still it does
it is somewhat multi-touch as you can
obviously keep your finger
the bottom and use it on the top but
guys the whole trackpad depresses when
you click on which is actually much more
useful than you think it actually really
does seem a lot more like a mouse we
actually press on and actually does the
whole trackpad blowers but one really
cool thing is that it actually glows um
so guys there is a go ahead and use an
app on the computer as you can go ahead
and just turn a shortcut turn on and off
it does automatically show up when
you're on battery which is a nice touch
but the guys the whole trackpad will
light up when you go ahead and click on
something so it's a pretty handy little
thing as you guys can obviously see it
is a very thin and light laptop it is 14
inches the screen is of course and it is
only one inch thin then guys this is
even more impressive we can consider the
amount of ports and it does have a full
DVD burner so let's go ahead and give
you guys a quick walkthrough so from the
lutf um on the right side you will see
there are three USB ports which is
really really nice to have that many USB
ports just on one side there is a
somewhat odd place I will admit
especially because you know that's where
I usually plug in my USB mouse but it's
not that big a deal it also it does have
a full dual layer DVD burner which is
great on laptop this than it is small
now guys like I said you can't open this
normally you actually do need to have
the computer on and have hit the
touch-sensitive button but it's not that
big of a deal now over on the left side
you will find the Ethernet the fan
exhaust port a Kensington lock port VGA
as well as HDMI out for hooking it up to
your high-definition TV you also go
ahead and find the fourth USB port and
as well as audio in and audio out that
much is on the front except there is a
multimedia carburetor that will read SD
XD memory stick quite a few different
formats really nice go ahead really very
simply just go ahead and slide your
memory card in off it right back out in
that big deal then there is a hard disk
indicator as well as a battery indicator
which is pretty nice lastly guys there
is of course a 1.3 megapixel webcam with
two mics guys this is actually is a
pretty decent webcam I'll show you guys
some footage from just in just one
second and the mics are really quite
good one thing though is that it does
have pretty active noise cancellation so
actually it will actually cancel out the
speakers so I've actually had pretty
loud music playing on the speakers in
the
almost entirely drowns out it's pretty
impressive way guys so this is a pretty
good test of the webcam on this is a
pretty low light situation and also
doing my xbox 360 running in the
background so she could you give you a
really good indicator of how the noise
cancellation microns work as well just
the general overall quality okay guys so
that's enough about the hardware let's
go ahead and talk a little bit about the
software the specs and some general kind
of performance I'm so guys look why I
just rattle up a couple of the specs for
you guys here um it does have the Intel
Core i3 - 35 M mobile processor with the
integrated Intel HD graphics I'm guys
the processor on this thing is really
really impressive for us again guys a
lot of this computer is you have to put
in perspective of how thin and light it
is so guys a core i3 chip if you didn't
know they just announced and released in
just the past few months and guys it is
a big step up it is a dual processor a
dual core processor but it will go ahead
and it has full multi-threading
capability so inside Windows Windows
recognizes that it is a quad core
processor and this helps especially for
you know definitely very intensive
applications such as you know maybe
video editors or running multiple
applications at a time that Windows will
be able to actually have it doing four
different things at once rather than to
a really really solid processor guys it
also does have four gigabytes of ddr3
RAM very fast RAM and with Windows 7
home premium 64-bit install it's
definitely plenty guys it does have a
500 gigabyte hard drive um guys while
I'm talking the hard drive that is
probably one of the only things I do not
like about this computer although the
fact that you can have 500 gigabytes
that is fantastic but guys it says it's
a 5400 rpm hard drive but it's a pretty
slow harddrive at least on the model I
have right here um you know I guess I
don't have any like specs or anything
you know directly to show you other than
the fact that I have another very
similar gateway laptop that also has a
Windows 7 and a hard drive
supposedly 5400 rpm and guys when I'm
loading like when for example when
you're booting up or when you're you
know loading stuff up from the hard
drive
it definitely tends to be quite a bit
slower and I even go to show in the
Windows XP
index the hard drive is not listed that
high compared to other similarly speed
hard drives obviously yeah guys let's go
ahead and talk a little bit about the
graphics um as you probably know it does
have integrated until high-definition
graphics like I just said and they're
decent um you know for a laptop that are
okay of course you will be able to run
full Windows Aero you'll be able to play
some games for example I'll play urban
terror and it does pretty much on full
maxed out 720p video it will go ahead
and pretty much play the game no problem
does it does do a good job but guys I
mean you're not gonna be able to play
crysis on it or something you know
really into in-depth you probably could
play maybe like Call of Duty and like
modern warfare
you just turn the settings down some as
the process of is really powerful it's
just the graphics aren't that great but
guys if you're really looking for a
gaming laptop I probably look elsewhere
but if you just start like me I just
play an occasional game with maybe
there's not like huge graphics and this
is a pretty good way to go so guys
there's just a couple more things I like
to cover um battery life on this is good
not spectacular um it generally guys
depending on how you use it of course
battery life on laptop vastly berries
um but guys if you're just doing general
web browsing on Wi-Fi with screen
brightness maybe 75% then you can go
ahead and get three close to
three-and-a-half hours on it um that's
not amazing guys but with the core i3
that's not exactly the most power
sipping chip ever so I can understand it
now of course if you're really working
it if you're playing a game or you're
you're watching a lot of high-definition
video which doesn't actually text it
that much but if you guys are really
working it then it will probably only
last maybe about two and a half hours so
guys battery life is not fantastic but
it definitely is decent that's usable
I'm so guys the white the laptop is not
that bad it's actually a bit heavier
than you might think considering that it
is you know only about an inch then I'm
so guys it weighs a little bit more than
five pounds to be honest guys I'm here
I'm coming off a laptop that weighs
close to seven pounds so this one feels
pretty light but you know it's not
terrible it's just not fantastic
again okay guys so that is it for my
full review of the gateway ID 49 and
that guys I will mention that there are
multiple versions of this laptop some
have different processors such as some
have a Core i5
you can also get this with better
graphics cards
there's even larger screen varieties
with a number pad on the keyboard so
guys there are a lot of different
versions on this one is just the
standard 14 inch with the core i3
because I think it is plenty powerful
for pretty much anything you need to do
besides really intense gaming it renders
high-definition videos fantastic the
core i3 just you know just knocks it out
especially with my video editor that
also utilizes the GPU doesn't take any
time at all to render go ahead and
render just giant High Definition videos
like the one I'm doing right now but
yeah guys so for the price for the size
for the power this is a fantastic laptop
and I don't regret buying it one bit so
guys if you're interested go ahead
definitely check out the link in the
descriptions you can go ahead and pick
up your own but you guys definitely
recommend if you're in the market for a
laptop you know you want something
that's fairly thin and like you know you
want something with some decent power
and ok battery life guys this is a
fantastic way to go anyway thanks for
