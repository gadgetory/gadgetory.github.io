developer conference Apple unveiled iOS
5 there are a lot of great new features
so let's begin with the new notification
center if you are an Android user these
new notifications will look very
familiar as you pull down from the
status bar to see all of your new
notifications on top of that you can see
notifications on your home screen from a
wide variety of apps so that's SMS call
for example you just need to swipe
across the notification to view it next
is Twitter integration in iOS 5 you can
log into your Twitter account from a new
settings page and have access to your
account from several built-in
application such as Safari youtube and
maps once Twitter is connected you can
use it to populate your contacts page as
well which looks really awesome moving
on we have a revamped version of Safari
the first new feature is reader which
works similarly to Safari on the Mac and
PC and allows you to strip extra content
out of websites to give you a more basic
and simple reading interface there's
also a new feature called reading list
which allows you to save web pages to
read later it even works on multiple
devices so for example you could begin
reading a page on your iPhone and finish
it later on your iPad best of all is
this new support for tabbed browsing and
Safari making it much easier to view
multiple sites at a time the camera app
has also been majorly overhauled you can
now take a photo right from the lock
screen as well as use the volume up
button as a shortcut to taking a picture
you can also do some neat tricks such as
pinch to zoom while taking a photo as
well as having a decent photo editor
that allow you to do some retouching
from inside the camera app a huge
feature is pc free now in iOS 5 you can
sync and activate your iPhone iPod Touch
or iPad without even needing a computer
keeping with this all new software
updates are going to be downloaded to
your device making it totally plausible
to never plug your device into a
computer ever software updates are now
going to be much smaller as well by
downloading the updates as opposed to
the entire OS another big feature is I
message drawing a lot of inspiration
from BBM and working for the iphone ipod
touch and ipad you can now message
between other users with text video
photos and contacts and it is supported
on 3g and Wi-Fi there is also a lot of
smaller updates including Wi-Fi syncing
to iTunes and multitasking gestures iOS
5 will be released later this fall for
everyone and a beta version is available
to the developers starting today it will
be available for the iphone 3gs iphone 4
ipod touch 3rd generation
touch 4th generation iPad 1 and ipad 2
so overall I have to say that I'm very
impressed with iOS 5 while it wasn't a
revamp Apple certainly add a wide
variety of new features giving a lot of
new life to the iphone ipod touch and
ipad what do you think definitely be
sure to let me know in the comments
