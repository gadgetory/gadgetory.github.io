here with another episode of ask me so
if you guys missed it this is my series
where I answer all kinds of questions
straight from you guys so let's just
jump right on in will you be doing PC
build videos with the gtx 760 ARDS
definitely so I've already got builds
playing with both the GTX 780 as well as
770 so you guys can definitely look
forward to seeing that as well as saying
as the intel has little chips come out
next week I've also got other builds
that are also be using those as well so
lots and lots of new PC builds coming
your way as well as a full tutorial
showing you how to build a Haswell
computer probably some overclocking
stuff lots and lots of built headed your
way if I wanted to get some gaming news
which website should I go to and what
games do you want to play at e3 that's
actually a question from my friend
Louise so he and I are actually going to
be heading out to e3 in about a week or
so if you guys don't know what III is
it's kind of the big gaming convention
of the year we'll see some more stuff
about the Xbox one the PlayStation 4
lots and lots of new games all that kind
of stuff and if you guys are interested
in more definitely be sure to go check
him out at gaming vlog net that's his
site he actually does a really good job
of running it lots of cool reviews and
all that kind of stuff as far as what
games I'm really pumped to see
definitely this the new Super Smash
Brothers game I'm really looking forward
to that if only for a reason to finally
actually use my Wii U again the new GTA
game should be awesome as well as Gran
Turismo 6 so yeah that's probably the
top games I'm looking forward to but of
course if you guys are interested in
seeing all that kind of stuff doesn't be
sure to stay tuned as I will be doing
lots of videos on the new Xbox the new
Playstation some of the cool new games I
see and all that kind of fun stuff why
do you use Mac I actually use Windows
and Mac so the computer behind me is
obviously running Windows that's what I
do most of my editing on it's in fact
it's just what I spend most of my time
on and of course I do a lot of gaming on
it whereas I do also have a MacBook Air
which is more for portability so for
example when I go to things like III
it's awesome to have I just throw it my
backpack walk around the show for all
day then when I get a chance start
editing videos it's really really great
for that so yes I do use Mac's but I
also use Windows I do have preferences
like for example OS 10 is just a little
bit nicer and easier to use in my
opinion whereas Windows obviously has a
lot more features such as being able to
play games so there's no real winner
between
the two but I do use both Windows and
Mac will you review the aqua find five
definitely in fact I'm already working
on a review of the find five so I've
been using this as my main phone to the
last little while and I'm liking it
quite a bit so if you guys want to see
the full review definitely stay tuned it
should be up here before too long
what phone are you using is your daily
driver right now and show your setup on
your phone right now I'm using the
unlocked HTC One I've already done a lot
of videos on this so it won't go over it
again here and I'm running a couple of
little customizations so I do use
battery widget reborn Pro - handy little
widget that gives me a little bit more
information about my battery for example
also there's a little pull down
notification which will show me if I
swipe it down a little bit more
information about like how my battery
life is some quick system toggles I also
am using Nova Launcher prime I'm not a
huge fan to be totally honest of the
stock sense on the HTC One so I prefer
something that's a little bit more like
a standard Nexus and Nova Launcher does
a great job with that and then I pretty
much got the standard kind of apps like
Spotify I might do use Facebook
messenger for all my SMS just because I
like the chat heads do you think Xbox is
focused on an all-in-one entertainment
system will affect gaming or it'll be a
whole new generation of awesome games
like we expected by the way the Xbox one
looks like a VCR I had so yeah the Xbox
one does kind of look like a VCR however
I'm not really worried there won't be a
real game console so I think the main
reason why a lot of people are worried
is that at the event they pretty much
just shut off stuff like Kinect stuff
like the TV integration and that's all
fine and good but it won't shut off a
couple games however the way I look at
it they were just really getting a lot
of the boring stuff out of the way is
they're also having in another event
here in about a week or so at e3 where
they will definitely be showing off lots
of new games the stuff with Xbox Live
all the kind of new and exciting stuff
that you and me are probably interested
in so now I'm not really worried I think
the Xbox one will be just as good as the
console as the PlayStation 4 and the
Xbox 360 I'm not really worried what is
your favorite game to play on PC I've
been playing a lot of really fun games
lately so I'm actually working on
starting a gaming channel but if I had
to pick just one it would probably be
Starcraft 2 now I'm sure most you guys
have the same kind of game where you'll
be playing this you'll be playing that
but you always have that one game that
you go back to and for me it's
definitely Starcraft 2 so I'm gonna play
as much a part of the swarm as I did
with wings of Liberty but it's still
such a fun game I've sung so many hours
into it and it's an absolute blast
anyway that's about it if you guys have
