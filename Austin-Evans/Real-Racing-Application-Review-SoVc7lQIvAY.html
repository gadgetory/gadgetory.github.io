today finally I've got the real racing
full-on in-depth review guys if you seen
I got a couple I had I had it featured I
had a short condensed version of it
featured in a my last up this review
eight or nine or seven or whatever and
I've also showed you guys a replay you
guys check that out as well a replay of
what it looks like using some of the
really nice connectivity features but
now I'm going to go in-depth let me show
you guys the whole deal
you guys really enjoy it I this is one
of my favorite games so let's get this
started
anyway let's get this one started
so the first thing that you will notice
when you open up Real Racing is that wow
it is so polished graphics are so great
I mean it's really guys I know I've said
this before but I used to be a huge huge
fan probably maybe like 10 years ago so
of Gran Turismo from the original
PlayStation I spent half husband back
and I spent like all my time on that
that was the coolest game ever this is I
mean I this is like the original Gran
Turismo for iPhone I mean when I'm when
that Gran Turismo came out in total it
was like it just every other racing game
there's like test drive I mean it just
blew them away it was realistic and it
had good graphics but it really focused
on just the aspect of racing it really
focused on the cars were realistic
there's all kinds of customization and
it really focused more on like making it
realistic and it did as well as make the
cars look really great too
Real Racing is that's what real racing
does for me I mean it's got yes it's got
some fantastic graphics right up there
with Need for Speed I mean some really
nice graphics but what it really shines
is the the depth of just all the
different modes and just how I mean when
you race it just feels right now I'm a
pretty big fan of racing games so I mean
I've raced lots for the iPhone I touch I
mean things where they always go wrong
is usually like the controls or - you
know the - easy you're there you know
it's like they just don't feel right the
the physics they just I mean your car
like speeds up like crazy and mike takes
turns and just they just don't seem
realistic and graphics as well but if a
game is realistic and it actually is
usable I will usually I don't care if
the graphics aren't perfect guys
realizing nails all three of these I
mean the controls versus just I mean her
almost perfect one to one seriously
it where you especially can see it is in
the inside cockpit view when you're when
you're tilting
it I mean it's almost I mean almost
perfect as you tilt it left and right
the whole screen moves almost perfectly
I mean it's it's really great I will say
that the outside view when you're when
you're racing from behind the car kinda
is a little finicky but guys when you're
in the inside view it is just awesome I
love it anyway so enough with this let
me just get into the review okay there
are some several modes in lots of cars
choose from you can you can go through
career mode which has several different
Championships that you go to each one
you will unlock new cars get faster cars
there's hatches
there's sedans and there are also sports
cars and each one has their different
pros and cons such as their light weight
take turns better or have higher top
speeds etc etc career mode is where you
will apply spend the bulk of your time
because that way you unlock new cars and
you also get the new tracks and I gotta
say the cars they're Eisley and I'm I'm
kind of a little stickler for this I
prefer when cars are real they're
actually like you know like a real BMW
or whatever and these are kind of this
is just generic cars I get it but I mean
that's just kind of something that I
would have prefered like me for speed
everything has but I mean that's one of
my only complaints about this game I
mean seriously it's great there's 60
cars or so in the game there are also
which I will say most of them are the
same car there's like like they would
just be each one will have like more
faster or whatever and maybe like look a
little different like have like a
spoiler or like a different paint job or
whatever and then you go on through the
career mode and you can unlock you start
with hatches and blah blah blah you you
move on through then there are a couple
other modes there quick race which
basically you just real fast
they just that's one something I like to
do a lot because I like to keep really
like to keep my apart my pocket and when
I like board for like 10 minutes where a
plot might plot Real Racing do a race
real fast looks kind of funny when
you're sitting there tilting it around
but who cares anyway so you can quick
race where you just pick all your cars
and you know you can pick opponents and
what track and all that kind of stuff
you know let's do time trial which is
fun when you're really trying
practice but the main thing is the
connected mode guys this is seriously
really really awesome
basically what Connect is is it let me
just back up a bit just kind of tell you
a bit more realizing it seriously got
some really really nice connectivity
features now as you guys saw I had that
replay that was totally done through
real racing basic which do is when you
do a racing connection mode the real
racing the clouds on cloud sell which is
a service for different apps mostly
through like the such as flight control
and Need for Speed basically what it
does is when you race a race online the
connected mode it will remember it will
record it you go local log on with your
computer you can hit record you hook up
your YouTube channel you can you can
hook up hook it up through there and
then it will go ahead and when if you
want like let's say you had a really
good replay or you just whatever you can
go ahead and upload it to channel it
took to ten minutes tops from the time I
hit upload the time it was playing on my
channel I thought that was very cool but
it goes deeper than that you can there's
different leagues that you can join
there's a lot of really cool stuff and
yours also head to head local where like
let's say like you know you and a friend
have I can like an iPod in an iPhone you
have this game you guys can race against
each other just like standing across the
room which is pretty cool but I mean
I've shown you talk to you guys a little
about the stuff but the real reason that
this game is just so awesome it's just
because the just gameplay is just so fun
like I said there's an in there's an
inside cockpit view and it's really
really nicely laid out generally you
will want like a heads-up display
showing like how fast you're going your
time everything that is all included in
the car like for example like your laps
and everything will be up in your top
left corner like hanging from like a
little dial on your a pillar besides
your windshield saying goes for like how
fast you going like how like how long
you've been going for the lap and it
will show you like your intervals
between got in front of you or behind
you where
and it shows you basically like where
your tachometer would be on your
steering wheel guys this looks really
really cool because it just totally
makes it realistic seriously when you're
in the inside view there's nothing that
I mean obviously it's not gonna look
perfect like I'm like a xbox four but
there's nothing there's no anything that
would make you think that they would not
be real I mean it really gets into it I
mean even from the gear shifts which you
see the thing I really like about the
inside the car view is just that so many
games don't have that for consoles
I mean Xbox 360 games a lot of them
don't have that the Gran Turismo I mean
only the brand-new Gran Turismo has that
I mean this is a hypothesis an iPhone
and it has such just I mean the graphics
aren't is great but the way the inside
the car view is just I do that you've
got me I just love that there's also
like I said the outside of the car view
I find that a little awkward the
controls just don't work as well for me
when I do that but it's it's doable but
man I'm always inside car anyway now let
me go ahead and just really go briefly
on the controls
there are several control formats and
actually one which I kind of feel bad
it's actually cheating but I do it
anyway it basically it's where the
computer will control your gas and brake
for you and basically do a steer
basically what I do is you'll be
basically full throttle whole time and
then when you get like turns or stuff
it'll automatically brake and you can
adjust the auto brake like if you want
to be more conservative or you want to
try to maybe get more speed out of it
and you can do that too
there are several there are several to
things it was also just totally manual
or you know you'll have a little gas and
brake pedal on the screen and there's
also like just the accelerometer
sensitivity which is if you plan on
doing outside the car view definitely
recommend it maybe just adjust it and
then you can do different different
things like such as like you can
manually brake and it won't assist you
at all things like that the controls
really are great on this but I just love
just the inside car view how perfect the
accelerometer is anyway guys I'm kind of
going crazy on this but I real
is just an awesome game I love it I mean
it is right up there the it gal Connor
my two favorite games no problem
only reason I don't give this game a
perfect 10 and everything is because
it's ten dollars obviously that's a
pretty expensive s just as expensive as
it gets for an iPhone app and I went
ahead and I bought it I spent $10 I went
ahead and bought it just because I knew
this game was gonna be great I had been
waiting for it for a while but the thing
is guys his greatest game is if you
don't have to have it in a second I
might you probably want to hold up on it
I can't imagine it's gonna be $10 too
much longer and if you'd like today I
imagine it probably down to six or five
or whatever the $10 I would not mind I
did not I did not mind paying $2 at all
but you guys might want to just wait up
just a little bit wait for it to come
down in price and if you guys are
looking for a great racing game guys
this is it right here real racing go
