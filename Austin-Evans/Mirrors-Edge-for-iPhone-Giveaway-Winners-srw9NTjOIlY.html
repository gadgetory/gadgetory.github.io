most overlooked games of the past year
it's combined awesome graphics with a
gameplay style who is utterly unique
while it had considerable drawbacks in
the form of a bit of a cliche plot and
if he fighting mechanics nevertheless
Mirror's Edge is a great underrated game
stay EA announced that Mirror's Edge is
coming to the iPhone and iPod Touch so
let's take a look at what's to come
Mirror's Edge for iPhone looks quite
similar to the console versions no small
feat given the limited power of the
iPhone and iPod Touch the same
futuristic city is playable and the
mobile version but with the twist
instead of being from a first-person
perspective now it's a 3d platformer
it's an interesting twist on the
original but the new viewpoint could be
quite useful on the smaller screen
safely making the transition is much of
the same fun gameplay from the full
version including a bevy of wall jumps
slides runs and more that were so much
fun in the original as mentioned
previously the high tech art style has
also made its way over and while it's
obviously not as good as the console
versions the colors pop off the screens
and the landscapes look nearly as vast
Mirror's Edge for the iPhone is due
sometime January 2010 Adhan as of yet
undisclosed price likely either $6.99 or
$9.99 it will feature 14 levels perhaps
with more to come via in-app purchasing
while the details of the game are still
under ads right now it looks like
mirrors edge will be a winner come
