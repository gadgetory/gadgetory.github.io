of a different video all right I
definitely think it's something that you
guys would be interested in recently I
bought myself one of these it's a
Verizon palm pixi plus now of course
this is not like a super brand new phone
or anything and I think it's been out
for about a year and a half or so now
over the reason I'm making this video is
that they are now absolutely dirt cheap
so you can go ahead and pick these up
now for $50 off contract so if you guys
keep up with you know contract and on
contract phones you know that that is
really really cheap I think this is $100
on crack a contract when it was you know
out and everything on Verizon I believe
like three or four hundred dollars off
contract but now you can pick them up
for $50 without a contract on Verizon
right now which in my opinion is a
really good deal I mean you think you
buy an iPod shuffle for that price but
if you want you know this has a
touchscreen you got a camera
you've got Wi-Fi GPS you've got internet
you've got music videos you've got webOS
which I absolutely love webOS internet
at let mean you name it it's just a full
smartphone I've had mine for a few weeks
now I've really been enjoying it and I
even bought one for my dad I know there
are a couple things I do want to talk to
you guys about I'm not gonna be doing a
floor review or anything I think this is
a little bit too old but what I will say
is that I'm overall pretty impressed
with everything except the speed it is
kind of slow like a sitar megahertz
processor like 256 Meg's of RAM so it is
a little bit slow but to be honest for
$50 I'm more than willing to put up with
that so if you guys are interested in
picking one up there's just a couple
things I do want to let you guys know
about first of all if you live in the
United States it is much easier but
course this is a Verizon phone which is
a carrier in the United States it is way
way way easier to deal with if you live
here so if you decide if you live in the
United States you decide to buy one you
have two options the first which is to
just go buy it and then when you get you
know when you come to the mail go give a
call to Verizon or you can bring down to
your local Verizon store whatever and
have them activate it and put it on your
plan or make you a new plan so this is
great if you're already you're on
Verizon you just need like a replacement
phone or well you know you want to
backup or whatever you can do that now
they will probably charge you for
activation fees and all that kind of
stuff so maybe not the best option but
if you guys want you can absolutely do
that since of course it is a brand new
phone I know the second option is this
is what I did is you can activate on
page plus now page plus is a page
here they run off Verizon so anywhere
you have Verizon service you will have
page plus service and what you do is
just give them a call and of course I'll
have all the information you guys need
if you miss something whether in the
description of the video but all you
need to do is just give them a call just
let them know that you want to activate
a phone I just have the the Box handy so
you can read them off the numbers and
they can get activated and what you do
is the like fit for free and then they
will give you enough airtime where you
can get the phone activated and you go
through all your setup screens and
whatever and then if you want you can
add minutes and whatnot there are
definitely lots of plans you guys again
check it out in the link in the
description or if you want you can just
use it on Wi-Fi you know you need to use
the phone you just use it for you know
the apps for webOS for you know whatever
you want if you live outside the United
States short of having a friend who
lives here
you know activated for you it's going to
get a little bit more complicated but if
you want and you're technically inclined
and whatnot you can try to activate it
yourself I will have a link in the
description of this video I can't vouch
for whether work or not since I just
activated mine using page plus but if
you want I believe you can't activate
this as a developer so you can still be
able to use it at least somewhat but
again just check out the link in the
description and you know you can make up
your own mind whether you know about
webOS and all that kind of stuff anyway
guys that's it so not quite my standard
kind of video but I hope you guys found
this helpful
this is a really really good deal in my
opinion I think if you guys don't have a
smartphone yet or just want to try webOS
or have a secondary phone there's a lot
of different reasons why you might want
to so I definitely recommend to check it
out one thing is is that they're not
going to have these forever there they
obviously aren't making them anymore
and ones that they're that they're
selling right now are pretty much just
ones that they've got sitting around in
a warehouse somewhere so if you guys do
want one definitely recommend to get one
sooner than later as who knows that
they're going to be around in the next
couple of months if you guys wouldn't
mind it would really appreciate if you
could purchase it from the link in the
description I want to be totally
straight up with you guys if you do buy
it from that link Amazon will pay me a
small little fee for referrals so you
guys don't definitely don't have to if
you don't want to but if you wouldn't
mind I definitely would appreciate that
anyway guys if you have any questions or
comments or if you decide to buy one
you're having issues with activation or
questions or anything about that be sure
to either leave me a comment or if you
want you can personal message me get me
Twitter Facebook whatever I'd be more
than happy to help you out</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
