here with what to expect with the new
Moto X so the Motorola X phone has been
leaked and rumored and hyped for months
now so let's take a look at what could
be one of the coolest phones of this
year first of all we have a leaked video
from the canadian carrier rogers which
goes over in quite a bit of detail about
the new Moto X the phone is running
stock Android just like a nexus now to
me it looks like this is probably
Android 4.3 is there are quite a few new
features it looks like Google now will
be always on and listening which is a
little bit creepy when you think about
it but it's going to be working just
like how Google glass does so even if
your phone is locked all you need to do
is say okay Google now it will unlock
and open Google now and you can ask
whatever question you want the Moto X
also ditches the notification LED
instead having new notifications quietly
pop up on screen the camera app has also
been updated so you can launch it by
simply flicking your wrist and once you
get in there it seems to be much more
simple and easy to use now when we're
talking about the Moto X something to
keep in mind is that this is the first
real motorola phone that's come out
since Google took over now if you take a
look at the last google phone the nexus
4 this was a very high-end phone it only
costs about three hundred dollars off
contract about half as much as other
phones like the galaxy s3 and the iphone
5 the way I see it the Moto X is an
evolution of that is it actually won't
be a super high-end flagship to be
totally honest what's the point pretty
much every single company has some very
expensive phone that's very high-end
whereas this can be something unique
instead it will have more mid-range
specs with a 4.7 inch 720p screen a
dual-core Snapdragon processor LTE
support as well as a 10 megapixel camera
that might not sound that amazing but I
wouldn't be surprised if the Moto X is
closer to two hundred dollars off
contract now again other phones like the
HTC One the galaxy s4 the iphone 5 all
these are six hundred dollars and above
so this could be a really big deal it's
also going to be customizable and built
into us so that means you'll be able to
change the color of the phone as well as
even get some engraving on it if you'd
like the Moto weight should be launching
in August worldwide which means it's
only about a month or so away and it
will be launching a pretty much all the
major carriers including AT&amp;amp;T Sprint
Verizon and t-mobile here in the US so
what do you think of the Moto X between
phones like this and the new cheaper
iPhone I'm really glad to see companies
folk
saying I'm making cheap earth bones
which are still just as good if not
better at some of the super expensive
high-end flagships but definitely sure
to let me know what you think in the

of the Moto X as soon as it comes out
