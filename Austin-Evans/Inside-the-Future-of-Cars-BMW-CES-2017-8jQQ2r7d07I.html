at CES 2017 at the BMW pavilion where we
have the future of the interior so BMW
is also enough to not only sponsors
video but give us a sneak peek at a lot
of stuff and this is going to be where
we start back back this up what is going
on in again this is our hollow active
touch system a hollow active touch
system okay so it's made up of three
components you have a mirror display
here which is providing the hologram
right right have a LCD screen below
reflecting an image that appears to be
floating in space that is that is crazy
and we have a gesture camera here okay
got it this is tracking where your
finger position right wait I feel I feel
like I feel something my touch right and
so this is provided by its an ultrasonic
array do you get touch it for a while as
i cool I'm just gonna do this from the
side it looks like absolutely nothing
but that is crazy Wow
so basically it's this piece this piece
and the camera it all comes together to
come together to make an experience you
have a screen that's far away from you
right can't touch it yeah so we need to
move the screen closer it's the way to
do it with the hologram
this isn't kind of yeah that is wild the
way you're ready we can go on and
destroy me I guess I can do this for a
while okay so what else we have so with
the autonomous driving routes are not
about getting you through city but are
that you can get around recommended to
you guys like yes here so could it be
say based on mood or how you're feeling
wait hold on hon so I can pick the route
I want to take to the city based on how
I'm feeling
yep so if I'll be like one like a nice
leisurely driver I'm feeling calm right
now so it's able to read your biometrics
and knows your heart rate says that
you're home and that gives you your
appropriate route based on that so bow
around the leg take a nice calm drive
around the length so where are the
biometrics how does that work this would
be based on sensors oh actually in the
seat yeah Wow okay okay so click accept
around I want this route absolutely
hadrat style speakers top directional
speakers built in the headrests oh I see
and then there's shakers built in the
seat back yeah I know it's oozes start I
felt like kinda like the base almost I
see and you can take a video call right
here and this would be a personal call
that you could take I can Wow because
it's the hologram right I'm listening to
something else you're watching and
listening to this call
alright well would you like to join the
call I would you like to talk okay let's
let's start to Patricia so here she is
up on the main screen here and the
system is scrubbing through the content
of all the Collin is giving your
recommendations in this case Megan broke
her shoelace at the game we send one
directly to of her so it has an Amazon
Prime primary important action so here
the gold shoelaces let's send them to
the games hold hold on hold on cycle
aside let's break that down right so
what happened was I got a video call
yeah I answer the video call it was live
transcribing what she was saying to me
it analyzed what she said realized that
she ate some shoelaces and immediately
pulled it up on Amazon yeah can I get
this right now can you take this home
with me right now
yes I'll level with you per second right
I was walking over here I'm like this is
kind of an interesting looking car
I sit in here I'm actually in the matrix
right now yep this is unreal this is the
idea that we have in this be time we
time so we've right about to dude thank
you so much this is absolutely
unbelievable
my car is terrible now and I need anyone
with all this any Holograms any
Holograms in my life right now obviously
this is not something that you buy today
right but the idea that you get the the
hologram you get the the audio you get
the the cleverness of being able to
actually figure out what someone's
saying in real time figure out the
intent and then order something from
that is wild I don't know how long this
is going to be until it actually comes
out but that was the future
like I don't know what's there now
because I was a future this is awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
