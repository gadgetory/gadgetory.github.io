be top 5 best retro games ever with my
friend Ellie from that check
coming in at number five is pokemon red
and blue the idea is that you capture
monsters and pokeballs and fight them in
turn-based battles like many good games
it's a simple concept but there's a lot
of depth to it you travel around in
search of Pokemon while collecting gym
badges one of the most unique features
of the time is the ability to trade your
Pokemon with friends using the Gameboy
link cable you'd think this game was
made for children yet it has an appeal
for all age groups and maybe that's why
this game was so popular I know that
when I was a kid I was in love with the
game and the TV show fueled my interest
to play it Pokemon is the second most
popular video game franchise of all time
and even 15 years later their 6th
generation games are the most popular
games for the Nintendo 3ds I think
Austin and I can agree that this is one
of our favorite childhood games and even
now we still love the Pokemon games and
at number 4 we have Sonic the Hedgehog
Sonic the Hedgehog on the Sega Genesis
is a platforming game that was focused
on speed and reaction time it was quite
difficult to master
in contrast to its competitors such as
Mario it's fast paced and focus on
precision Sonic was created when Sega
requested a mascot character for the
franchise and it is now easily the most
recognizable character for their brand
in the game the goal is to collect rings
and defeat a boss at the end of the
level Sonic was a huge hit almost
single-handedly bringing success to the
Sega Genesis but on top of that it still
remains one of the best platforms ever
still influencing games today like Super
Meat Boy at number three we have pet man
this is an arcade game that launched in
1980 right the height of the arcade era
by the 90s it had earned over 2.5
billion dollars in quarters you play as
pac-man who has to eat all the pellets
to proceed to the next level while
avoiding the ghosts power pellets allow
you to eat enemies making you
temporarily invincible one of the best
things about pac-man is that it seemed
simple but it had a lot going for it it
was released in a time where space
shooters were quite popular so pac-man
brought something new to the table
consider one of the classics when it
comes to arcade games it was a no
brainer to include pac-man in this list
and at number 2 we have doom doom is
considered
an influential title in the gaming
industry as a devote the popularity of
first-person shooters also at the time
of its release its relatively realistic
3d graphics were a standout for the game
released in 1993 the game featured a
variety of weapons and was one of the
first games to support multiplayer over
a network doom is a science fiction game
where you play as a Marine who has been
stationed on Mars the gameplay consists
of shooting your way through levels
while fighting off demonic enemies to
give you an idea of just how popular
Doom was at one point it's estimated
there were more computers with doom than
Windows 95 and coming in at number one
is the original Super Mario Brothers so
Super Mario came out in 1985 to help
launch the NES not only is it a
fantastic side scroller but it really
helped bring the video game industry off
of life support in it you play as Mario
who has to jump through obstacles to
save Princess Toadstool
gameplay consists of jumping on blocks
stomping goombahs and collecting
mushrooms to get to the end of the level
Super Mario Bros helped to launch
Nintendo's first game console and Mario
got his start in one of Donkey Kong's
game back in the arcades in 1981 with
the named Jumpman but later got his own
game
since then mario has been in over 200
games and is considered the most popular
game character in the world mario has
had a best-selling game for over 30
years and is still wildly popular today
so what do you guys think is the best
retro game of all time let us know in
the comments below and be sure to go

the best pixel apps for your phone
anyway big thanks to Warby Parker for
making this video possible
Warby Parker makes high quality stylish
sunglasses and prescription glasses they
start at just 95 dollars which is a lot
less than most frames including what I
paid for my last ones my favorite part
is the free home try on program which
lets you go online pick out five pairs
of glasses you like and Warby Parker
sends them out free so you can try them
on probably my favorite pair is called
Rowan so there's a little bit thicker
than my usual glasses but I'm I think I
can pull it off what do you guys think

for every pair of frame spot Warby
Parker sends a pair to someone in need
