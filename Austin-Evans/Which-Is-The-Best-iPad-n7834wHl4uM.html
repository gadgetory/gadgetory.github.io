here is what should be a simple question
which is the best iPad take a look at
Apple's site though and you'll see for
iPad models in 20 different
configurations ranging from three
hundred dollars to nine hundred and
thirty dollars before we even get into
the video
absolutely ignore the iPad 2 it's coming
up on three years old it doesn't have a
Retina display it's got a much older
design and still four hundred dollars
just stay away
that leaves the first generation ipad
mini ipad mini with retina and the iPad
air to start with let's take a look at
the physical designs there's a lot of
DNA shared between all three you're
essentially looking at a slab of
aluminum and glass and hands down these
are the best built tablets you can buy
the original iPad Mini is actually
slightly thinner and lighter than the
new retina model which is a trade-off
considering that the newer model does
have a better display in a bigger
battery and use they feel great in the
hand even for longer periods and I'm
still convinced this is the perfect size
for a tablet the iPad air is quite a bit
larger however it's surprisingly light
for the size which considering it's
called the air maybe isn't such a
surprise after all it's definitely an
improvement over earlier iPads however
it is a two handed device one
disappointment across all three are the
speakers now they sound alright but the
problem is both speakers are on the
bottom which actually ruins any sort of
stereo sound
you'll also find cameras on the backs of
the new iPads there they take pictures
and video and you shouldn't use them
because you look totally ridiculous when
you try to take a picture with an iPad
definitely the biggest difference
between the iPads though are the screens
the iPad minis both sport a 7.9 inch
display where the iPad air has a much
larger nine point seven inch screen I
won't get too much into the actual size
of the screens as this really comes down
to preference but the many tends to work
a little bit better for portability
where the air is a little bit better for
creation where there's definitely no
debate is how these screens look the
first iPad Mini is flat-out
disappointing you're looking at a
resolution of 1024 by 768 versus the
2048 by 1536 on the iPad Mini retina and
iPad air as far as the actual quality of
the screens go it definitely favors the
iPad air even though on paper it's got a
slight disadvantage in pixel density but
the colors are better calibrated the
retina mini isn't too far off but again
the original mini falls way behind here
and that's really where you're saving
the hundred dollars by buying the old
iPad Mini as opposed to the new one as
that pretty much takes that directly out
of the screen so for some people it's
something that you can get used to and
that'll be fine
over for me having a Retina display
makes it so much more usable getting to
the specs were looking at the older
Apple a5 in the original Mini compared
to the Apple a7 in the iPad air and
retina mini Geekbench shows a huge gain
in performance with the Apple a7
equipped iPads and you'll see a similar
golf in gaming with GL benchmark
however numbers and benchmarks aren't
everything in actual use there's not
anywhere near as big of a difference all
three run the same apps and for the most
part things run nice and smoothly you'll
see the occasional hiccup on the
original mini but performance really
isn't a major issue for any of the iPads
that said the retina mini in air both
come with much better specs and they do
tend to run a bit smoother and more
importantly load apps faster and handle
games easier so to break it down let's
start with the original iPad Mini it's
by no means a bad tablet however for
$300 I would much rather go and buy a
Google Nexus 7 and save myself the extra
70 bucks the iPad air on the other hand
is basically the best 10 inch tablet you
can buy it's gotten faster it's gotten
thinner it's gotten lighter and it still
has that awesome Retina display however
for my money the iPad Mini with Retina
is the sweet spot it has pretty much all
the same power and performance and
screen from the iPad air however it does
it with a much more compact form factor
and you get to save $100 in the deal
hard to argue with that so what do you
guys think what's your pick for a tablet
