here at the first look at Windows 8.1 it
might sound like a minor upgrade but
this latest version of Windows brings
quite a few very nice changes to start
with the modern UI has been cleaned up a
good bit you can now change the
background to match your normal desktop
making it much smoother to switch
between the two the live tiles are also
more customizable just like Windows
Phone allowing you to resize them and
organize them into groups unlike before
you can now actually get to a lot of
settings without leaving the modern UI
which should be especially helpful for
tablets one of the biggest things I
noticed is just how fast everything is
when those eight was already snappy but
a point one seems to smooth things out
farther even if you're using a standard
hard drive if you're just looking to
quickly jump into something a new app
page sorts everything out nicely a bit
like how the old start menu used to work
speaking of the Windows button is back
personally I didn't miss it too much I
mean the Windows key is a thing for a
reason but it works just like you'd
expect bringing you back to the modern
UI you can also get access to some
helpful system toggles by right-clicking
it which is a lot more convenient than
before
in general Microsoft has done a lot to
bring Windows back to being more like 7
for desktop users including giving you
the option to disable the annoying hot
corners one of the big advantages
Windows 8 has over other tablets is
great multitasking and 8.1 improves here
as well allowing you to resize your apps
however you like to be honest I wish
Android and iOS would steal this already
it really is useful Bing is also heavily
integrated into Windows 8.1 and I can't
believe I'm about to say this it's
actually not terrible if you tap the
Windows key or open up the modern UI and
start typing it'll automatically start a
general search for everything including
apps and files on your PC it can also
pull results from the standard Bing
search alongside apps in the Windows
Store and more do a search for a
celebrity or point of interest and you
get much more info which is surprisingly
really helpful if you're a PC gamer
Windows 8.1 also includes support for
DirectX 11 point to share from the Xbox
one which brings some new features for
games with improvements for things like
shaders as well as more performance out
of AP use the windows 8.1 preview is
available from the Microsoft now it's a
free update to Windows 8 with the final
release scheduled for later this year
it's still early but it seems relatively
stable
if you want to give it a shot overall
Windows 8.1 while not a massive update
fixes almost all the major issues I had
with Windows 8 and even add some useful
features along the way if you're still
holding out on Windows 7 it very well
might be worth a look if you're
interested in more feel free to check
out my hands-on of the Xbox one and if
you enjoyed be sure to leave this video

this
anyway guys that will catch you next
