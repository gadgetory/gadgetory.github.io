lot easier to pick up so I was able to
get each one of these three iPhones for
less than $200 on prepaid carriers what
are they worth it I did a video on this
iPhone 5s last year where it cost me one
hundred and fifty dollars
however today you can easily find these
available from $129 but even as well as
$99 off contracts it's the same story
with the iPhone 6 well some places have
it listed for 300 or even as much as
$450 oh they will pick this one up for
only 200 the iPhone se is also available
for cheap so it still costs 400 dollars
unlocked straight for an Apple I was
able to take this one up for only 160
prices are definitely going to vary
depending on what sales are going on in
the big downsides that these are all
going to be locked to a prepaid carrier
but I'm curious what kind of iPhone are
you getting for $200 to start with we
have the iPhone se even though this is a
little bit of an older design this is
actually a pretty new phone it only came
out about a year ago what's cool with
this is it's actually not even a base
model so this guy's going to be rockin
32 gigs of storage the embossing
experience is pretty straightforward so
now do we have our Apple stickers and
paperwork right here there's also going
to be the old-school Apple earpods
we have our USB power adapter as well as
a lightning cable put it side-by-side
with the iPhone 5s and the SD a looks
very very similar so what you're getting
here is a pretty small phone now the
repair it's kind of rare to actually get
a decently expect small phone these days
but it's it's small it's definitely
really small it still feels premium
though it's not only do we have the
chamfered edges as well as the nice
metal and glass design but most more
important of that it feels sturdy and
that's not something that you can always
say about budget phone moving over to
the iPhone 6 just like the SE we're
going to be getting a 32 gigabyte phone
which is going to make this a lot more
usable with the iPhone 6 we're getting
something that's basically the same
design as the current iPhone 7 so if
things have been tweaked just a little
bit in the last couple years for the
most part you're really not going to be
missing out on much arguably there are
actually some design improvements here
so known as the iPhone 6 still has the
physical home button but it also does
still have a headphone jack you're
getting some nice upgrades with a safe
most notably Apple paid support so it
was actually something I use I'm pretty
much a daily basis you're also getting a
much larger 4.7 inch display compared to
the smaller 4-inch panel on the others
so while this is though hope it's small
by most flights of standards today it
feels
a lot more usable the specs are pretty
interesting so the iPhone 5s is the
oldest phone here is rocking an Apple a7
processor with one gigabyte of RAM
whereas the iPhone 6 has the Apple a8
and the iPhone se has the newest Apple
a9 with a full two gigabytes of memory
all three feel reasonably snappy but the
5s is starting to show its age a bit
with only one gigabyte of RAM it does
get a touch slow sometimes when you're
doing a lot of multitasking there really
is not that it's the same story with the
iPhone 6 and really use it feels almost
exact same as the 5s a lot of that does
have to do with the fact that it also
runs 1 gigabyte of RAM on the other hand
the iPhone se is super quick so it has
the same specs as the iPhone 6s which
absolutely puts it on par with a lot of
current flagship to put things in
perspective
all three iPhones are going to be more
powerful than a budget option like the
Moto G 4 but it really is the iPhone SD
that takes to win here all three are up
to date on iOS 10 and they're all
getting the iOS 11 update later this
year
that's especially impressive when you
look at the iPhone 5s which came out all
the way back in 2013 I've got to give
big props to Apple for supporting a
phone like this for five years pretty
much no one else does that the biggest
issue is just the smaller screen sizes
on the 5s and D I see you like it a lot
of people do like a smaller phone but as
far as I'm concerned it just feels a
little bit small and cramped to be fair
you're not really losing any
functionality everything is just a
little bit smaller than usual but if
you're used to a bigger phone these are
going to be a little bit hard to get
used to when it comes to cameras the
iPhone 5s mistakes have a very
similar-looking 8 megapixel camera
whereas the SE bumps that up to 12
megapixels thanks to the iPhone 6s which
it basically stole all its parts from
first we have the 5s this is probably
the best camera on a smartphone when it
came out but today that's actually not
bad the dynamic range is not quite there
but this is a really really difficult
shot these all look pretty nice so I
would have to give a slight edge to the
SE here but really I would be happy with
any of these phones well smart phones
have definitely advanced a lot over the
last few years what's impressive is just
how decent these iPhones feel to use you
know the three and even four years old
what's really impressive is the camera
on the se well it's about a year old at
this point it really is only topped by
flagships like the Galaxy s8 and iPhone
7 video and the se also looks nice so
choose from full 4k and while it might
not be a red the stabilization means it
actually looks really nice the iPhone 5s
hides its age surprisingly well for just
a little bit more
less than half the price it wasn't it
launched I think the iPhone I see is an
obvious upgrade but only if you're down
with a smaller phone which leaves us
with the iPhone 6 well it might not be
the most powerful in the world I think
the larger size more than makes up for
that so would you guys pick up a $200
iPhone and if so which one would it be
let me know in the comments below and I
will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
