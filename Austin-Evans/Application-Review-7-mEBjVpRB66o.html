today I'm here with my application
review 7 I've got three apps here all
three of them I'm pretty excited to get
the word out about so it's going I'm
going to first I'm going to do unblock
me free want to top pay is one of the
top free apps right now it's pretty cool
on unimpressed with it
I've also have an app called crossbones
it's a pretty cool pretty unique app I'm
enjoying it and then lastly I have
Crowell which is an app awesome
some of you guys know about but it's a
really cool and one of my new favorites
and I'm enjoying it a lot so let's get
this one started
okay so the first step that I'll be
reviewing today is unblock me free this
is one of the top free apps right now I
believe it's second I'm not I'm not sure
it's one of the top ones and I
definitely see it is very very cool
first strengths about you'll see it has
a million levels I did not realize I
just want to download
I started playing through it I'm like
okay I hit 25 it's done No all right 50
think has over it has exactly 400
different levels so I mean this is it's
very cool and they're all fairly
challenging
I was never either haven't gotten stuck
on any of them I mean it's way a couple
minutes and figured out but I am very
impressed this it is a lot now if you
don't know what this app is it's uh it's
very very similar to blocked and that
was one of the top paid apps a while ago
it's one of everybody's favorites
basically this is really close to being
just a free version of it um it's got
two modes it's got relaxed mode which is
basically you have all the puzzles and
you just relax chill just take as much
time as you want and then change mode
which is basically the same same puzzle
the only difference is that it counts
your moves
it's like it says okay so you've done it
every time you do one move it counts it
down and then if you've beaten the
puzzle before like let's say you did
beat level four on and you did thirty
moves well then it'll show 30 moves and
then you won't try to beat that and
obviously you can't always beat but it's
pretty cool um what I really like the
graphics are well I mean they're not
graphics they're just it looks nice it's
got a nice polish um level difficulty
like it's not insanely difficult which
is I mean obviously - good thing but I
don't know I almost would like a little
bit more challenge because I mean it
when you first open up even level one
there's no real there's a there's a
tutorials just to help page it just
shows you how to do it even mean
straight from level one you'll see it's
it I mean the the field is totally
blocked in you've got all kinds of stuff
to figure out
but that said I I like it a lot it's
very simple it looks
nice you can every time you pass level
it saves it so yeah and it lost us to
tell you the moves you're in challenge
mode the it looks nice in its decent
challenge but my favorite thing is is
it's free there's a paid version I
haven't checked that out
I just might but the free version the
way it is right now is just really good
I'm having a lot of fun with it
definitely definitely I recommend
checking that out okay so the second act
I'll be reviewing is called cross bones
this is a $2.00 $0.99 application
currently in the App Store and I know I
think it's it's I think it's pretty good
basically it's I'm gonna be terrible
trying to explain it because it's kind
of a complicated game when you're trying
to explain it basically what it is is
it's like a matching game where you will
have their different there's different
cards or whatever you want to call them
they each will have one color one of
what either it's gonna have red green or
blue on it and then in addition it's
going to have go either 1 2 or 3 knives
1 2 or 3 cups or 1 2 or 3 wine glasses
and basically what you need to do is you
need to get three of and you have to
match them it's kind of its kind of I'm
gonna be terrible explaining it
basically like if you had a red cup a
red single cup red double cup and red
triple Cup you could match those
together and then you take three cards
off the game and you would get the
points same way if you had one green
knife two blue knives and three red
knives you would get that two and then
that's just an easy mode in the then
medium or hard then the then each color
will have like green will have a line
two lines or three lines it's now I will
meet definitely does sound complicated
but once you get into it start playing
it it really is not that big a deal at
all
I enjoy it basically it is that it's
it's a very cool it's a pirate-themed
game and when you play through it it's
cool you basically you can add your own
avatar you start out as this pirate and
you can add your own avatar you can play
multiplayer games I'll get into that a
little bit later there's a colorblind
mode which is again that's I mean gal
cons just about the only other
that has close binds so that's that's a
definitely a cool feature it'll also
give you hints and it's cool basically
what you do is when you go into
single-player it's you and then you can
have one two or three opponents and then
you can use easy medium or hard
difficulty and then once you get into it
basically there are going to be nine
cards on the table which is everybody
uses those and then you will have four
cards in your hand down bottom basically
what you do is you just pick you you can
you can mix and match the cards up top
or on your hand or in your hand
basically your objective is just to get
just to get as many points as you can
get as many triplets as you can and just
keep going and then until you went it's
it's very a polished game I will say
it's very polished
it's very no glitches I've had this game
for a little while there's no glitches
really been testing out so no glitches
there's no lag I mean it's a very very
cool game the the thing is though the
difficulty well you can understand while
you understand how to play fairly
quickly when you get into how to
actually win it it gets complicated
I mean espect I mean even the easy mode
it's very simple I mean you can look at
the thing ten times not see anything and
there could be five five matches sitting
there so it's not it's not easy at all
and that's when you get into medium and
hard it gets much tougher so I'm a
little on the fence about this one it's
it's a good I mean it's it's good but
the three dollars I'm not really sure
yeah I'm not really sure there is a
light version in the App Store you guys
might want go check it out I definitely
recommend if you're thinking about it
check that out before you buy it and I
know that's that this one's kind up to
you okay the last type that I'll be
reviewing today is called Crowell most
you guys will know Crowell is it came
out a while ago and it's definitely a
very fun game now for a while it was
$5.00 I would really not it looks great
I wanted to get but I was not really
wanting to pay $5.00 for it well uh it
has gone down to 99 cents for a limited
time I picked it up and I am NOT
disappointed whatsoever it is a very
very
cool game I will go through it pretty
briefly because this is have been
reviewed a million times I just
basically it's it's basically just a
very edges hack and slash just I mean
just just like an old arcade game but
with some just awesome graphics
especially I mean for the iPhone I mean
it's just unreal basically you were like
a guy who has a like a stick I'm a snake
like a big rod or whatever I don't know
what it is basically you just side
scroll through the missions through the
levels and you just walk along and you
be up anything that's in your way then
you go all the way along through the
level that's basically the whole game in
a nutshell there are the controls are
really simple
on the bottom left in the bottom right
you have two arrows no it's it's just a
basic aside school you can't go any
other way you just have to go left or
right and there's two attacks you have
your heavy attack and then you have your
light attack and that's that's basically
about it not control wise it's a lot of
fun you can use beatin bash your way
through you'll have different you'll
have different all kinds of different
levels which just look awesome camera
views kind of zoom in a lot which mean
it looks good you'll have different
bosses and then at the end of the level
you have some really cool is like it's
like a cutscene basically have to tap
different parts of the screen at the
cutscene I love those cutscenes they
just look awesome I mean when you're
just just running along jumping in like
monsters will I pick you up and you have
to dodge and all kinds of stuff it's
really simple because the cutscenes look
great and all he has to do is just track
the different icons when they come up on
the screen to dodge and everything it's
definitely a lot of fun I won't get in
too much into too far into it like I
said there's been reviewed a million
times before
um guys guys I highly highly recommend
this game from 99 cents if you picked it
up before obviously but if you had not
picked up this game it's 99 cents it's
for a limited time I don't know it could
be the rest of the day or it could be
for another week or whatever I don't
know um but I definitely recommend it it
is a lot of fun be sure to check out
