here with the review of the new 2013
MacBook Air 11 inch hardware wise apple
hasn't changed much this time around but
there isn't much to complain about the
air is still among the thinnest and
lightest laptops around measuring point
six eight inches at its thickest point
all the way down to just over a tenth of
an inch with an aluminum unibody design
there's practically no flex in the
laptop and it's someone who is used in
air for the last couple years this bill
can definitely take some abuse even on
the 11 inch the keyboard is full sized
with the exception of the shrunken
function keys and while it's lacking a
bit in key travel overall it's a great
keyboard to use turn down the lights and
you'll see it's got automatic
backlighting which is a nice touch the
same praise can be said about the
trackpad it's got a smooth glass surface
with multi-touch and it's still much
better to use than most windows
trackpads along the left side you'll see
the MagSafe 2 port for charging a USB
3.0 port combo headphone and mic jack
along with the new dual microphone setup
flip it around to the right side and
you'll see a thunderbolt port which
doubles as mini DisplayPort along with
the second USB 3.0 port for a total of
two the 13-inch air also has an SD card
slot built in here up top above the
screen you'll see a 720p webcam which
works fine for Skype and Google Plus but
isn't really anything special where the
largely unchanged design is a bit of a
disappointment is in the screen it's a
good panel with decent color and
brightness but it's not as accurate as
I'd like the viewing angles are
disappointing and most importantly of
all the resolution is fairly low unlike
the retina MacBook Pro line the air
still features a 1366 by 768 screen
which while isn't a deal-breaker is
nowhere near as sharp as even most
windows ultrabooks today while from the
outside it looks almost identical to the
last generation under the hood there are
some major changes it's powered by the
new Intel Haswell Core i5 and core i7
processors and these deliver two major
improvements compared to last year's ere
is the new HD 5000 graphics delivered
between 20 and 30% more performance
allowing you to do some light gaming
where you'll find the biggest gains or
in battery life put simply it's awesome
the 11 inch air is rated for nine hours
on a charge and with moderate use with
Spotify open writing this review in
Google Drive and watching a few YouTube
videos I was able to get just under 7
hours on a charge that's a massive
improvement over the
last model where I usually struggle to
get four hours with the same workload if
you want to check out how the 13-inch
air performs go check out my friend
Marquez's review of the new 13 inch air
right here as far as how actually using
the air goes it's a very snappy laptop
the base model might look disappointing
with a low clock speed of 1.3 gigahertz
but it's almost always running well
above that and paired with the new PCIe
based SSD it's downright fast doing most
tasks like opening programs browsing the
web and more it's also outfitted with
support for 802 11 AC Wi-Fi which is
approaching the speed of wired Ethernet
and is a nice addition while the air has
never really been made for heavier loads
like video editing it absolutely is
capable I use the air while traveling to
edit all of my videos and with the a
could go by tram upgrade it handles
Adobe Premiere and After Effects fairly
well the 11 inch screen is a bit small
for complicated projects and it takes a
while to render but considering the size
and battery life I have no complaints
the MacBook Air is one of the best
laptops period right now it's got plenty
of performance for the vast majority of
people a great design solid keyboard and
trackpad and now some phenomenal battery
life the lack of a Retina display is
disappointing but if you're looking for
a thin and light laptop the 2013 MacBook
Air is absolutely worth a look if you're
interested in more check out my speed
test and gaming demo of the new air and
