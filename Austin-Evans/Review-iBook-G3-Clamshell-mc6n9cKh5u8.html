the review of the Apple iBook the iBook
was first announced in 1999 and even
though many things have changed it's
interesting to take a look back first
let's go over the design there's no
doubt that it's unique even today with
its rounded corners and rubber coating
open it up and inside you'll see a
fairly standard keyboard and 12-inch
display while things have obviously
advanced in the last 13 years there's
actually a lot that's the same take the
keyboard and trackpad for example the
layout of the keys isn't too far off
from Maxima today and the trackpad while
a bit small really isn't half bad the
iBook also has several firsts for
example you could get one with an
airport Wi-Fi card which made the very
first mainstream laptop with wireless
internet
well it's something we take for granted
and everything from our phones to
thermostats today it's kind of amazing
to realize that just over ten years ago
this was a feature that wild an entire
audience
another impressive thing with the ports
within a year Apple that introduced the
iBook special edition which is what I
have here with a 56k modem Ethernet USB
firewire 400 and a headphone jack /
composite video out for running a second
display not too different to what you'll
see on a MacBook Pro today Oh in
dimension it has a handle yeah the first
iBook clamshell models came with a 300
megahertz PowerPC g3 processor 32
megabytes of RAM 3.2 gigabyte hard drive
and a CD drive the final special edition
models came with a four hundred and
sixty six megahertz CPU 64 megabytes of
RAM 10 gigabyte hard drive and DVD Drive
not exactly cutting-edge specs but since
I'm crazy I've upgraded mine to 576
megabytes of RAM as well as a 32
gigabyte SSD the iBook clamshell is
released with OS 8.6 however you can
upgrade it to OS 10 easily while the 800
by 600 screen was impressive back in the
day it definitely looks dated today as
most websites struggle to be viewable
with the low resolution even some OS 10
menus aren't usable that said the iBook
actually does a respectable job as a
laptop as long as you keep your
expectations low everything is slow but
it gets the job done what's most
impressive is how the iBook actually
passes newer laptops in some areas for
example there are no fans in the laptop
as everything is passively cooled which
makes it silent except for the noisy
stock hard drive with an SSD it's 100%
quiet unless you're using the optical
drive battery life is also really
impressive giving about four to five
hours on a charge which is right on par
with my MacBook Air well it's little
more than a novelty these days there's
still a lot to like about the iBook
clamshell the design is definitely one
of those love it or hated things but
personally I like it as it still looks
unique without being obviously dated if
you want to upgrade it a bit you can
even get a computer that's still usable
today regardless though the iBook
clamshell definitely remains one of my
favorite Apple products ever if you
