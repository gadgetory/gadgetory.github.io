TouchPad 4G so earlier today HP
announced that they will be releasing a
4g naval version of their touch pad
tablet now well this is no major
surprise we've long known that there
will be a 3g period so find out it's
actually going to be 4g compatible AT&amp;amp;T
is certainly really quite nice what is a
big surprise is that they are already
bumping up the hardware specifications
one of the biggest problems reviewers
had with the HP TouchPad Wi-Fi model
those the fact that it can sometimes get
a little bit slow a little bit laggy
from time to time now well a lot of this
I'm sure will be fixed with an upcoming
software update it should be very very
soon one of the biggest ways to do that
one of the easiest ways is to just
improve the speed of it so with the
current one that of course just came out
about a week and a half or so ago does
have a 1.2 gigahertz dual-core processor
whereas the HP TouchPad 4G model will
have a 1.5 gigahertz dual-core processor
personally a little its split on this on
the one hand it's always better to have
bad faster hardware's just across the
board you faster you can do stuff faster
and all that kind of stuff however on
the other hand you've got really
considered what the early adopters think
I mean there are a lot of people who are
really excited about the touchpad you
know who bought the Wi-Fi model and they
won you know tell their friends
everything and now or we can have after
they're really brought their brand-new
tablet there's already a newer faster
version I mean I can just imagine if you
know what Apple have done something like
this with the iPad the here they
announced the ipad 2 and you know we can
half later they go oh by the way we've
got a new even faster model it's going
to be coming so I'm very very curious to
know what you think about all this do
you agree with HP do you think hey you
know it's a new tablet they can up the
speed and do whatever they want or do
you think it's kind of a little bit of a
snub to consider that it's a week and a
half old tablet and it's already started
to get a little bit outdated definitely
be sure to let me know in the comments
