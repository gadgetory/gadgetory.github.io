at the audio quality on the iPod Touch
4th generation some go ahead and split
this up into two things I'm go ahead and
take a look at the speaker quality as
well as at what sounds like on the
headphones so it's when you start with
the speaker quality so I'm gonna go
ahead and use a track from Kevin
MacLeod's it's actually my my intro and
my altro so that's why I just let's make
sure how I you can hear that so just
wanna take a live feed so that's pretty
much it guys
um as far as the speaker goes it is not
that great as you probably would have
expected the speaker actually is right
here and I'm actually not really all
that fond of it because it's kind of
easy to cover up as far as the speed
goes though it's got decent volume if
you have an iPod Touch 2nd generation if
you have an iPod Touch 2nd generation
go ahead and check out it's gonna be
very very similar to that it's pretty
penny
it's got ok sound I mean I'm in a pretty
quiet room right now so I mean obviously
I could hear just fine but really don't
be expecting a whole lot from the
built-in speaker on the iPod Touch 4th
generation decent but really pretty
tinny and just not that great now on the
other hand um I can't show you guys this
but I have listened to quite a bit of
music on my headphones using the iPod
Touch 4th generation in between
different media players etc and I had to
say that the iPod Touch 4th generation
does sound very good with headphones in
I don't know if they used a different
sound chip
I've got no idea what they've done but
it does sound considerably better as far
as you know just just about everything
there's also there's a lot more detail
in the music I guess compared mentally
compared to the same generation so again
guys is kind of subjective but and it's
not gonna be a huge deal it should be
you know the reason you buy it but if
you're worried about the audio quality
if you're interested or whatever speaker
quality decent not great but the sound
from the headphones does sound very very
rich very full and very very good
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
