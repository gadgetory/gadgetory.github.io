video on the next generation xbox 360 so
the current 360 has been what this since
around two thousand five deadly doesn't
seem like it's been that long but it
certainly has been quite a while and now
with the Nintendo Wii II that will be
coming out next year seems like everyone
is starting to focus their attention on
the next generation of consoles
according to boy genius report the
next-generation Xbox will be announced
at next year's e3 and of course III just
past ports this year showing us the wii
u's so i would not be surprised
whatsoever if we do see the
next-generation Xbox next year you know
if you took a look at the microsoft
event this year it was very lacking in
anything really brand new course the
past couple years have been devoted to
connect so i think a lot of what they're
focusing on right now is working on the
next generation xbox indeed according to
the report it seems like they've already
been hard at work on the xbox 720 since
all the way back in two thousand six as
far as what we can expect in the next
xbox to really aren't a lot of details
right now of course i would expect a big
jump in processing power and graphics
and whatnot also when we surprised if we
do see some kind of second-generation
connect i know microsoft's been pouring
a lot of time a lot of energy and a lot
of effort into the kinect for the 360 so
wouldn't be surprised whatsoever if
there is much more integrated into the
next Xbox preps it even comes with it
hey guys that's about all we know right
now definitely very interesting
different going to keep an eye on this
but what I'm really interested to know
is what do you think are you interested
in the new xbox you still go with your
360 or are you looking more towards the
wii u with playstation 4 whatever
definitely be sure to let me know in the
