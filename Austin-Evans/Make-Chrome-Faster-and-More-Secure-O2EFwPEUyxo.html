how to increase your browsing speed as
well as security while using Google
Chrome and what I want you to do today
is enable an option called click to play
plugins and what this will allow us to
do is not automatically run all flash
Java Silverlight etc all these plugins
around the web they're not going to
automatically run unless you tell it to
so it should enter this it's going to be
really simple just come up to the
address bar and type in about and then
flags if I can type it correctly here
you guys can see here this is kind of
the experimental part of Chrome there's
a lot of things you can enable in here
and by all means feel free to kind of
take a look around and see what you want
to enable but no one we're looking for
is titled click to play I want you to do
is hit enable scroll down and relaunch
Google Chrome at this point you can
simply leave everything alone and simply
click to play on any plugin that you
want on any site
whoever this does get a little bit
annoying for example if you're wanting
watch YouTube you want to have to click
to run the plug-in every single time so
there's going to be an option up on the
top right you can click on that and it
will say do you want to continue
blocking plugins on this site so take
for example there are some sites that
you might want to always allow plugins
such as YouTube I need to do is click
always allow hit done and then if we
want to go ahead and open it up the
video will play just fine like you would
expect so this is a good method of not
only increasing your security by now
allowing plugins to run on absolutely
any site you go to but on top of that it
can also speed your browsing up for
example if there's all kinds of flash
and this and that does you don't want to
automatically run you can totally ignore
it anyway guys if you enjoyed this video
definitely be sure to leave the thumbs
up and if you're interested in more
