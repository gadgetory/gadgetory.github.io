youth an unboxing of the new iPad this
is the 2012-13 eration model with the
retina display 16 gigabytes of storage
and Wi-Fi the box is very similar to the
ipad 2 so much so that it's quite easy
to confuse the two in the store just
looks the lid toss it aside and you'll
see your brand new iPad before we take a
look at it let's set it aside and see
what else we get in the box for starters
you get your standard guide to the iPad
warranty information and have course
some apple stickers come on it's not an
apple unboxing without the Apple
stickers you also get a standard 30 pin
cable for charging and syncing your iPad
this was a 10 watt USB wall charger now
that we have that out of the way let's
take a closer look at the new iPad the
first glance good looks nearly identical
to the ipad 2 with the same thin tapered
design looking at the specs you can see
it's a slight bit thicker and heavier
but unless you have both on hand to
compare it really isn't a big deal up
front you'll find the same vga FaceTime
camera and the brand new Retina display
I'll get into this a little bit more in
another video but suffice it to say it
looks absolutely fantastic flipping it
around back you'll find your speaker
apple logo and a new 5-megapixel isight
camera well I still say the ipad is
observed for taking pictures with i will
be taking a closer look at this still
and video quality soon if you want to be
awesome don't forget to leave this video
a thumbs up and head up this playlist
which is where i'll add all of my new
ipad videos that are posted feel free to
subscribe as well to make sure you're
notified of all my new iPad videos as I
make them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
