in my series of web browser comparison
tests this time focusing not only on
speed but also the interface and
features of each browser this time
almost every single browser to the field
has been updated since my last test with
chrome jumping all the way to version 9
quite a few new betas of firefox for
complete our first look at internet
explorer 9 and alpha of the very
promising opera levin and lastly safari
five to begin with let's take a look at
arguably the most important feature of a
browser which is speed i've convinced my
normal series of tests down to three so
let's begin with the SunSpider
javascript benchmark sunspider is a
great overall test of javascript speed
which is crucial in today's browsers in
this test chrome and opera finished in a
dead heat with internet explorer 9
putting up a very impressive showing and
Safari and Firefox rounding out the rear
next I ran all five browsers through the
Peacekeeper benchmark Peacekeeper is a
great overall browser test that checks a
large variety of different factors to
determine the scores banking up the
previous tests you can see the offer and
chrome handily beat all competitors with
Safari and Firefox only managing about
half the respective scores in internet
explorer 9 finishing even further behind
the next test iran was the internet
explorer 9 fish tank this test relies on
html5 and GPU acceleration to anime 500
fish as you might expect internet
explorer 9 1 this test however chrome
was impressively just a single frame per
second behind firefox 4 was behind
somewhat even with the recent addition
of GPU acceleration however it was still
much better than opera which choked
along in just a mere three frames per
second rounding out the rear with Safari
which flat-out refused to run the test
at all with 500 fish when just looking
at it from the standpoint of speed the
clear winner is google chrome of course
however speed isn't the only factor when
deciding which browser to you
so let's move on to the interface of
each browser in this test I simply
measured how much screen real estate
each browser takes up of course each
browser is customizable as far as tool
bars etc go however here I simply
measured how many vertical pixels each
browser took two tabs open as you can
see Internet Explorer and chrome both
did very well only taken 57 and 59
pixels respectively safari did decently
as well however the lack of an option to
put the tabs up top heard it quite a bit
oper light behind due to the info bar on
the bottom of the screen which houses
many of the unique options to the
browser lastly is Firefox which wastes
quite a bit of space in order to keep
from looking identical to opera moving
away from numbers and into my subjective
real world experience I've been very
impressed with the interface of internet
explorer 9 by borrowing the Omni bar
from chrome and combining it with the
tab bar allows it to both save space and
make the browser look and work quite
well I was really surprised at how
natural it just feels to use while i'm
still a big fan of chromes interface
compared to internet explorer it really
does look at generation behind so this
round has to go to ie9 now on to the
unique features of each browser since
all five are fairly well matched in
speed and there isn't a huge difference
in the interfaces a lot of the draw for
each browser is all about the unique
features all my browser's features some
sort of add-ons for extensions however
the implementations aren't the same in
general I'm quite impressed with the
chrome extension gallery as it is easy
to navigate and let you install
extensions quickly it also comes with
the plus of not really eating up system
resources however extensions are for the
most part relegated to the right top
side of the browser which is a slight
drawback Firefox however does not have
that limitation and it also does have
the edge on the amount of add-ons
available here so really it's a toss-up
between chrome and firefox in my opinion
the unique features moved beyond that
however safari sports a lot of great eye
candy in the form of searchable history
and
new tab page both which add a lot of
class and look great to me one of my
favorite features in Firefox has to be
personas which now come pre-installed in
the browser personas allow you to
customize the theme of the browser by
simply mousing over a theme in the
gallery and all you need to do is click
on it to install it's a really great
feature in my opinion and something I
certainly wouldn't mind seeing in other
browsers opera has accumulated a huge
amount of customization and usability
options over the years which are one of
its biggest strengths you can spend
quite a bit of time tweaking every facet
of opera to your liking as well as the
navel features such as opera unite and
opera turbo Internet Explorer 9 is
unsurprisingly full-featured my pick for
the best feature however has to be the
accelerators which give you a variety of
options that appear when you select text
letting you translate or map something
for example you can install more
accelerators as well making this a
really really great and useful feature
as far as Google Chrome goes instant is
one of the best features I've used in
quite some time just like Google Instant
when you enable instant for Chrome it
starts loading websites and searches as
you type it greatly increases the speed
of web browsing and is on all around
excellent feature overall I was very
impressed with all five browsers of
course there can only be one winner and
today that is chrome opera has made
major strides in recent months to bridge
the gap an Internet Explorer 9 is
nothing short of astonishing and you can
consider how abysmal it has been for so
long in the end though I've got to give
it to chrome for offering the best
mixture of blistering speed a slick
interface and the great support for
extensions as well as the wonderful
instant feature</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
