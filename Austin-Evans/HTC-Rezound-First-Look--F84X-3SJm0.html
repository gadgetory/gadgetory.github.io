unveiled their latest flagship phone the
HTC Rezound bizarre spelling aside this
phone is rocking some serious hardware
with a 1.5 gigahertz dual-core processor
and a 720p screen the phone looks fairly
similar to the HTC droid incredible too
but it adds red accents for the
capacitive touch buttons and around back
giving it a very unique look it's all
because of the Beats Audio branding
that's featured on the phone which would
provide better audio quality combined
with the bundled beats by dre earbuds
that come with the phone moving on to
the specs the resound is top-of-the-line
pretty much everywhere it counts
internally it's got a 1.5 gigahertz
dual-core processor 1 gigabyte of ram 16
gigabytes of built-in storage along with
an included 16 gigabyte micro SD card as
well as compatibility for Verizon's 4G
LTE network externally you'll find a 4.3
inch display with a resolution of 1280
by 720 this matches the new Samsung
Galaxy Nexus but since it's on a small
display the pixel density should be
nothing short of fantastic you'll also
find a rear-facing 8 megapixel camera
with an F 2.2 aperture dual LED flash
and 1080p video capability the phone
ships with Android 2.3 Gingerbread with
HTC sense 3.5 however it will be
upgraded to android 4.0 Ice Cream
Sandwich early next year if you're
interested in getting your hands on the
rezound you'll be able to pick it up
starting November 14th for 299 dollars
on a two-year contract exclusively at
verizon stores and at best buy
