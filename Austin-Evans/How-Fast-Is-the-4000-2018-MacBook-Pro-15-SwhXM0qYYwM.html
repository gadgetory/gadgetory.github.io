is the brand-new 2018 15-inch MacBook
Pro now with the new core I nines inside
it promises to be the fastest macbook
ever with a $4,000 price tag and that's
not even the most expensive one I'm
curious how fast is it really this is
the first time that you've been able to
get anything more than a quad-core
MacBook well pretty much ever
so the across the line you're going to
be eating at least six cores on the new
MacBooks this guy is going to be the
quinine which is gonna be clocked a lot
higher but even the base model of the 15
is still going to be a 6 core or i7
something else new what this generation
is going to be more memory so previously
the MacBook Pro would top out at 16 gigs
of ram a fair bit but not really not for
a lot of creative professionals whereas
this guy you can't option it all the way
up to 32 gigs of ram finally yes so Wes
is currently using a lenovo thinkpad
workstation and even though they're
actually about the same price you can
see there's a huge size difference look
how much smaller this is look that's not
not even close another change is going
to be with the SSD so by default this
will come with a 256 gig drive however
you can option it all the way up to a 4
terabyte SSD no issue is going to cost
you $3,400 you know you don't want to
spend as much as a nice Jesus car well I
guess huh somewhat nice used car as your
SSD there's your option for real though
I mean if you really need that extra
space by all means go for it but as far
as I'm concerned a 1 terabyte SSD or
even a 512 gig Drive should be plenty
unless you're on 10 boletos phone
texting instead of running the camera
oh wow great I've already got a beach
ball that's really wonderful this system
has been on for 35 seconds and it's
already frozen in beach bawling I know
the new feature is going to be the Apple
t2 chip inside and that's also going to
be shared with the iMac pro essentially
it's going to be like an iPhone
processor that's dedicated to handling
all of the background tasks to the
laptop
so think about trains outside your
speaker's your webcam especially things
like security issues like making sure
that everything is correctly signed
ahead of time so to really see with this
new MacBook is capable of I have a
couple of other laptops here to compare
against so first of all I have a 2016
MacBook Pro this is going to be the high
end of that year
so we're getting the core i7 16 gigs of
RAM Radeon Pro 460 graphics as well as a
one terabyte SSD to give you a good idea
of what an equivalent Windows
workstation is going to provide we have
a 2016 Lenovo P 70 this guy's going to
have a Xeon e3 15:05 which is going to
be a quad-core skylake CPU very similar
to actually what's going to be in the
2016 MacBook you're also going to be
getting 32 gigabytes of RAM a Quadro p-m
4000 and 4000 it will set P it's an M
4000 GPU as well as a 512 gigabyte nvme
SSD and last but not least we have the
2018 MacBook Pro now this is going to be
maxed out with everything besides the
SSD the core I 9 32 gigabytes of RAM the
Radeon pro 5 60 X the only thing we're
missing here is a 4 terabyte drive but
with one terabyte of capacity the price
difference between these three is
actually only a couple hundred dollars
so let's see how fast the new MacBook
really is the first test we're going to
be running is Geekbench 4 and this is
going to be a pretty solid test of the
CPU capabilities of all three of these
laptops oh wow wow that's so fast okay
so the lenovo and the macbook are very
well matched so single cores slightly
ahead on the lenovo but multi-core is
going to be a little bit behind but the
20:18 absolutely destroys them both with
5595 on Signal Corps and 24,000 755 and
multi-core that that's fast of course
there's more to it than just CPU power
though so here we're going to be using
the geek bench for compute test to give
us a rough idea of what kind of graphics
capability are going to be on all three
of these laptops so here the lenovo
definitely takes the win with a score of
79 thousand compared to fifty eight
thousand with the 2018 macbook and forty
nine thousand with the 2016 MacBook now
the graphics side is definitely going to
be a big win for the windows side just
because you're going to be getting so
many more options and so many more
powerful cards available and a variety
of Windows workstations
except we have Cinebench now this is
going to be a little bit more of a
multi-threaded workflow as is basically
going to be cinema 4d just rendering a
single test scene and again anything CPU
related the core I 9 MacBook is
absolutely going to crush Meli's are
going to be a fair bit faster on this
single core score but even on the multi
thread with those extra two cores
available it is going to be seriously
fast next up we have the Asha speed test
this is going to be all about how fast
the
these are and all three of these systems
okay that one's not particularly fair so
it looks like the lenovo is using a SATA
based hard drive which means the read
speeds topping out at less than 500
megabytes per second and the read is
only about a 133 compare that with the
2016 which is over 2 gigabytes per
second on both read and write and the 28
key model which is actually going to
clear three gigabytes per second on read
and twenty seven hundred megabytes per
second on the right just like the iMac
pro a lot of this feed has to do with
the fact that it is using a t2 chip to
handle all the stuff including actually
running the SSD so when it comes to
writing and reading it almost three
gigabytes per second that's actually
really cool I've gotta admit that's
really fast next up let's put this all
together and do a little bit more of a
real-world comparison so we have DaVinci
Resolve running on all three of these
systems so we're starting out with some
7k red raw footage which is then being
heavily color corrected with power
windows and it's going to be exported as
a 4k h.264 file okay so it looks like
resolve is definitely a big fan of the
core i9 on the 2018 macbook here the 18
MacBook is going to be a full minute
faster than both the 2016 MacBook as
well as the lenovo p 70 now the P 70
does have other advantages beyond pure
performance so not only is it going to
run a fair bit cooler take a look at the
thermal shots I got on the MacBook which
was running pretty warm especially on
the keyboard area compared to the lenovo
it is a huge difference but on top of
that lenovo has a bigger 4k display and
you know actual ports which is kind of
helpful when you know you're doing video
or anything that's not using USB C so
conclusion time if you pick up the $7000
Q of the MacBook Pro with the 4 terabyte
drive it's not going to perform any
better but if you're looking for a
system that is going to give you a ton
of power and a pretty small and thin
form factor I'm going to say this
actually is a lot faster than I was
expecting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
