here with a video going over a $600 mini
gaming PC now this is probably one of
the most fun builds I've done in a long
time
as for $600 you're going to be getting
some serious performance be able to play
almost any game nextel at 1080p some of
the newer games you'll have to turn it
down to high but still you're getting
very very good performance on top of
that it's in a really cool little mini
ITX case I also have a couple other
builds you guys may want to check out so
I have a $400 gaming PC this is also a
fairly small build and for the price you
can get some really killer performance
on the flip side which one spend a
little bit more I also do have $1,000
gaming PC we're going to deliver some
stellar performance at 1080p and even
higher resolutions to kick our build off
we're going to using an Intel Core i3
3220 CPU now for gaming this is going to
be really really perfect especially
considering the price so the reason I
went with the i3 3220 is because it does
have a dual core design clocked at 3.3
gigahertz and also does feature hyper
threading which allows Windows to see it
as a quad core CPU as a new Intel Ivy
Bridge CPU based on their new 22
nanometer process there are several
reasons why we went with the core i3 so
if we're starters it's going to give us
plenty of performance so it's even 10%
faster than the older core i3
it's going to be plenty to handle pretty
much any game we throw at it now one
other option we could have gone with
would be an AMD APU it's going to be a
very similar price as well as a very
similar level of performance but it
almost needs twice as much power to run
and considering that of course the less
heat the better this is definitely going
to give the nod to the core i3 for only
about 120 dollars for a graphics card
we're going to be using a gigabyte
Radeon HD 7850 and for the money you
cannot beat this graphics card period if
you want to be able to matric see the
performance you're gonna have to spend
30 40 even $50 more now for the as far
as the performance goes and what kind of
games it can play you can expect pretty
much max settings in most games at 1080p
now some newer games such as battlefield
3 and Far Cry 3 battlefield 3 and far
cry 3 networks will need to be turned
down just a little bit so you're
probably gonna set them all about high
or so but most other games especially if
it's like a year or two old can be run
at Ultra and max all that kind of stuff
with zero problems at all now one thing
I do want to mention is that I chose to
go with the one gigabyte version of this
card for this build now the main reason
is just price the one gigabyte version
is really really under priced in my
opinion probably at least $20 more
expensive but since it's not we're all
good to go
but anyway besides that the 2 gigabyte
card would be a better option if you do
want to use your
here for a long time if you want
future-proof it a little bit some games
will start to be using two gigabytes of
memory as opposed to the one on this
card but right now it's not a problem
and for only about $160 it's going to be
well worth it for a motherboard we're
gonna be using the asou speed of an eye
now this is an awesome little mini ITX
board so for starters it has pretty much
all the features you would expect a
normal sized motherboard so you have a
full sized PCI Express slot so you can
slide in your graphics card without any
problems at all
it also has up to six eight well not up
to it has six SATA ports so you can plug
in all kinds of hard drive DVD drives
whatever you want there's going to be
plenty of expandability options now this
is an 877 board so it's not going to be
overclockable but since the cpu isn't
overclockable either not really a big
deal but only about $100 this is going
to be perfect for memory we're going to
be using 8 gigabytes of Samsung ddr3 RAM
now this is absolutely awesome stuff I
recently used it in my $1,500 build it's
gonna work just as well here so if you
take a look at it looks very boring so
it's actually going to be quite a bit
shorter than normal Ram and it also has
0 heat sinks or anything like that but
don't let looks fool you this is some of
the highest performing stuff that you
can buy so it's going to be normally
clocked at 1600 megahertz which is going
to be totally fine for most motherboards
and if you don't want overclock it you
can just leave it there and deliver some
really really nice performance but if
you do want to overclock it it can be
overclocked up to 2133 megahertz in most
cases I don't wanna say all the time you
may have some issues and you might not
always overclock super super high but
overall for only about $35 you cannot
beat this stuff for a hard drive we
wouldn't be using a 500 gigabyte Western
Digital caviar blue so this is a boring
little hard drive but it definitely does
get the job done so it's 500 gigabytes
of capacity that should be enough for
lots of games music pictures videos all
that kind of fun stuff although if that
is not enough for you you can upgrade it
to a one terabyte drive for about $20
more on top of that it is a 7200 rpm
Drive which means it's going to be fast
not quite as fast as a black Drive and
nowhere near as fast as an SSD
that's going to be plenty to get the job
done now if you guys do want you could
upgrade this to an SSD as well as that
one terabyte option that I mentioned
earlier and again I will link to all the
parts and the different options that you
guys could choose in the description of
this video but if you want to go with
the 500 gigabyte option which is what we
use in this bill it's going to run you
about 60 bucks for a case we're going to
be using the BitFenix prodigy this is an
awesome little mini ITX case and it
looks like absolutely nothing else out
there so well ok maybe with the possible
they like a shrink-ray version of the
mac pro but overall really really
cool-looking case it is available in
several colors including white which is
what I chose here you can also pick it
up in black red and orange now the cool
thing about this is that there really
are no major compromises
so generally mini ITX builds have always
been about compromise so you're dealing
with a smaller motherboard you can't put
its powerful 2 CPU on there may be no
graphics card small cases there's come
out a lot of compromise but the BitFenix
prodigy does away with a lot of that if
it's full sized graphics cards so the
7850 fits in there with plenty of room
to spare and on top of that also does
have a full sized mount for an ATX power
supply as well as lots and lots of hard
drive cages and you can put SSDs all
over the place probably the coolest
thing about it though is that you can
get some really nice performance so it
comes with a pair of 120 millimeter fans
which are just fine and that's what
we're going to be using in this build
but if you wanted to you could even fit
a 240 millimeter radiator on the roof of
their case which is really really cool
for something that is this small about
$80 this is going to be well worth it
for a power supply we're going to be
using a 430 watt corsair CX 430 now the
cool thing about this is that this is a
cheap power supply without being cheaply
made and there's a big difference there
so you're going to get some really nice
performance and efficiency thanks to the
80 plus bronze rating on there and it's
also a little bit smaller than a normal
sized ATX power supply now the reason I
mention that is that the prodigy
definitely does have a little bit of a
cramped area as far as where you put the
power supply in it's that little bit of
extra space that you get since this
power supply is smaller means that you
have more room to route all your cables
and all that kind of fun stuff for only
$40 this is going to be perfect last but
not least you want to consider picking
up a copy of Windows 7 or Windows 8 now
I'm going to leave this totally up to
you guys and a lot of people really like
Windows 7 and a lot of people like
Windows 8 but basically there's not
going to be any a huge difference both
can be able to play tons of games
there's really no really major
differences as far as compatibility that
I found a couple of corner cases where
stuff won't work on Windows 8 but in
general it's going to work just fine and
of course with Windows 8 you have more
updates and all that kind of stuff in
the future so whatever you want to
choose it's up to you it'll run anywhere
between 70 and $100 so there you go guys
an awesome little $600 Mini ITX gaming
build and all I have links to all the
parts I mentioned in the description of
this video prices are constantly
fluctuating and I'll also add some
additional options that you guys may
want to consider so if you want for
example a DVD drive you want a little
bit more powerful processor you want a
bigger hard drive whatever I'll add some
additional
options that you guys can choose from if
you guys are interested in more I have a
full tutorial showing you how to put
this computer together which you guys
can check that out here and on top of
that also we doing a giveaway of this
system very soon so if you guys want to
be sure that you catch that be sure to
subscribe to the channel so you don't
miss it anyway guys hopefully you enjoy
it and I will catch you in the next one
