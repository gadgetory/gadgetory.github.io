time in over a year it's time for QA
talk about your first PC build so if you
go back through the channel you'll see
that I've been doing PC build videos
since 2011 or so and a lot of reason why
I started doing those was because when I
want to build my first PC there are a
lot of good tutorials showing you how to
do it but I couldn't really find any
good resources for finding what Parts I
should actually use so I started making
those guides myself and then I finally
built one so yes I actually made the
first couple of PC videos purely based
on theory and I actually didn't build
any of them just org if this is not a
debate it's very obvious it's gif
getting a nod rule from Jimmy over here
it's gift ya Ken Ken yeah okay I'd like
to say we're about to have a problem yes
what are your favorite pair of
headphones right now I'm going to sound
like a giant loser but I actually really
like the Apple earpods yes they don't
sound that great yes they're kind of
expensive but I've never used a pair of
wireless headphones that were so
seamless jumping between your computer
between your phone between your tablet
it actually does really work pretty well
first car and favorite car so my first
car was a 2000 Mercury Cougar and it was
less than amazing but it was my first
car and I loved it I remember I picked
it up for $1,500
it had bald tires someone had to hit it
and then they like repaired it with like
bondo and stuff but I didn't care is my
first car and I loved it what music are
you listening to I've been listening to
a ton of everybody by logic so it
dropped a few days ago and I mean I'm a
big Logic fanboy I'll for you to admit
and I think everybody is really good
besides that though um I should be
listening to star boy a fair bit I think
that I've never really been that into
the weekend
but that's been good and abysm to a lot
of cold lately
when are you collabing a video with
Ralphie actually did a video with
Ralphie just a couple weeks ago so it's
over on his lego channel bill play
repeat where we built a f1 Ferrari
monstrosity what starting camera would
you recommend for kids on YouTube
smartphone seriously I do what I
recommend anyone to start with on
YouTube sure it's nice to have bigger
better cameras as you get more advanced
as you want to be able to do more things
but prefer touch anyone starting out
unless you're doing something very very
specific a smartphone
totally good enough why did your parents
give you the name Duncan's stop stop
don't you don't even have to do this
right now okay so my name actually isn't
Duncan that was a old internet name from
was like ten however my parents actually
did end up naming their dog Duncan
because you know they thought it would
be funny favorite non tech youtuber I
actually watched a lot of science
youtubers so people like smarter every
day
CGP grey very cassia my think these are
some of the channels that I actually
really enjoy because even though I make
tech videos after a while I kind of get
tired of watching them so it's nice to
see something a little different what
phone did you have when you first
started YouTube I actually didn't even
own a phone my first started on YouTube
which is why it was such a big deal when
I had my first ipod touch even though it
didn't have a camera at least it was
something I could use that had apps and
things but no my first smartphone was
actually a palm pixi plus when do you
want to get a baby no have you been
affected by the YouTube ad crisis
thankfully no so I know a lot of my
friends especially in the gaming side
have been kind of hurt people who make
more controversial content but as far as
I'm concerned Tech is pretty neutral and
so no actually really haven't seen any
major difference plus negative it seems
about the same as it was before hands
how many anime series flash movies have
you been forced to watch I will give Ken
full credit here
I've been forced to watch exactly zero
anime of any kind how long does the
process for a video from planning to
filming to editing it depends some
things that are a little bit more simple
like an unboxing can sometimes be done
in a day if we're really going quickly
usually a little bit more like two days
between getting the product and shooting
it then editing it and getting
everything else done but then there are
bigger projects for example when we went
to B and H up in New York City where it
took Nicole months just to plan out kind
of getting up there getting clearance to
use the store all that kind of stuff
then the shoot itself only took a couple
hours but then the edit took like five
days any plans for coming to India it's
funny so we did Kim Krispies a little
over a year ago in Los Angeles which was
easy because a lot of us are based here
but if we ever do a team crispy - or
even just a meet-up I actually would
probably do in India there's so many of
you guys who are so hardcore that I mean
this little bit of a flight but worth it
maybe we'll see did you drop out of
college no I actually never went to
college in the first place because
as I started doing YouTube a couple
years before I ever made any kind of
college decisions by the time it came
around I was like I'm already doing what
I want to do although you should stay in
school kids just not me who makes your
thumbnails
why mr. Kenneth bleed oh of course
thumbnail extraordinaire no but for real
you can look at some of Ken's thumbnails
compared to when I made thumbnails and
you should probably able to see the
difference ps4 Xbox R switch it's funny
you mention that because I did an entire
video comparing the ps4 to the Xbox one
to the switch
spoiler alert I think the switch totally
wins if you want any kind of portability
obviously as far as the actual console
you want to use well you have to watch
the video because I'm not going to spoil
it were you into technology at a young
age or did you discover it later in your
life I resented technology the second I
got my first gameboy color some things
about six or so and as soon as I had
that and realized how cool it was and
what I could do with it I was pretty
much how would you ever date a fan
asking for a friend
well my girlfriend might have something
to say about that can you call ken
savage Kenny for the rest of your videos
yes I can't call savage Kenny his real
true name of savage Kenny no you were in
question of the video my friend that was
pretty good so that is it for this Q&amp;amp;A
don't exactly get used to these as I
probably won't do another one for like a
year or so but hopefully you guys had
some interesting questions answered and
of course if you have anything else you
want to know hit me up on Instagram and
especially Twitter anyway thanks for
watching this video and I will catch you
guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
