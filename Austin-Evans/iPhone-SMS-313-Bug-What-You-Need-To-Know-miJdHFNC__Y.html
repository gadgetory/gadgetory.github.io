today I'm here with the video that
should be pretty eye-opening to those of
you who own iPhones recently at the poem
to own conference which is a basically a
place where hackers go to basically
showcases what book they found and
basically they sell them to you know
Apple Google Mozilla whoever whoever the
hack was against well they recently
found a very very eye-opening bug in the
iPhone which allows you by just simply
visiting a website to allege someone
downloaded your entire SMS history and
it's kind of scary stuff and it also
could be good news for jailbreak or
something so I'm gonna go ahead and roll
you guys through everything we know and
what we can expect anyway let's get this
one started
you know we don't actually have this
exploit out and that's probably good
thing because basically this is just as
dangerous as you know any kind of bug on
you know your browser such as Internet
Explorer or Chrome or anything like that
because basically kind of like in old
days of the iPhone where you know you
originally you jailbreak just by going
to a website and it would do it all for
you but this actually could be pretty
similar basically what it is is that
it's a bug in Safari now they didn't
tell us how to do it or anything but
basically by going there within like 10
seconds I want to say and of course all
you have to do is just by going to the
website then 10 seconds they could
download all your SMS all the ones you
sent all the ones you've got even the
ones you need to leave it within you
know just a couple seconds now that's
you know scary as is but what they
actually if they wanted to press it
which they didn't but if they want to
press it they go ahead and fully unlock
the iPhone and basically you know take
over basically jailbreak it and put in
whatever they wanted to so it's kind of
something you should watch for
now before I tell you guys this but it's
not a big deal because they didn't like
I said they didn't let anybody else know
they basically Apple bought it for
fifteen thousand dollars was basically
what happened and so Apple is working on
right now I'm sure they will have a
firmware update for the iPhone pretty
soon now as far as I know this only
works for the iPhone because it does go
off of the SMS but we don't know we
don't know all the details so it
actually might be applicable to the iPod
touch we don't know so guys this has
some good news and bad news and a
warning so the good news is it could
really be good for jailbreaking you know
jail breaks are continuously getting
harder and harder and you know these
everything is just getting really
complicated and it would really really
simplify jailbreaking all kinds of
devices if you can just go back to going
to a website and you know in ten seconds
your iPod or iPhones jailbroken that
would be you know great on the downside
is that you know this is actually a
legitimate security deal I mean you know
it's not like any of these you know
rickrolling things that you know he
didn't change your SSH password this is
actually serious stuff you know could
they could people could get a virus on
your iPod or iPhone
well I phone for now but I could see
iPod in the future and actually know
taking personal information and
everything so I guess the warning would
definitely have to be if you're really
worried about this and you're not
worried about jailbreaking go ahead keep
always keep on the update dated Ifill
firmware because they will definitely be
releasing something fixed for this
probably with you know a week or two I
know they're not mess around with this
and if you but if you want to try to
wait for the jailbreak you may not want
to go ahead and update for the wall
because this is they patch up the whole
it'll be gone and I would be surprised
if if somebody gets ahold of how how it
works and actually figures it out and
get some pretty cool jail breaks going
on but either way whatever you want to
do definitely be careful you know for a
long time you know us you know who have
an iphone or ipod figure we can go with
any link we've won who cares not a virus
well you know that's not so much the
case anymore
it looks like everyone's pretty safe for
right now but you know as soon as they
know now that hackers know that hey you
can do something with SMS it's a pretty
simple deal to go start looking for
stuff and I'm sure all kinds of people
are trying to figure it out right now
so giant guys just kind of be careful
don't know don't go to the links you
know just just kind of be careful don't
you can't surf the web with impunity
anymore because you know it's kind of
starting to catch up with you guys it's
just kind of that a little bit of a
heads up on this you know I wouldn't
worry about it too much and actually I
think it could end up being a really
cool thing allowing you to jailbreak
very easily but yeah guys just you know
just watch out from what you click and
if you're interested go ahead and get
the Apple update which will be coming
soon and if not definitely don't because
I'm sure as soon as it's out they will
definitely have a jailbreak or something
similar for so who knows anyway guys
