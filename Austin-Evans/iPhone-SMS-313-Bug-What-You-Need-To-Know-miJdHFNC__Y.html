today I'm here with the video that
should be pretty eye-opening to those of
you who own iPhones on recently at the
poem to own conference which is a
basically a place where hackers go to
basically showcase what both they found
and basically they sell them to you know
Apple Google Mozilla whoever whoever the
hack was against well they recently
found a very very eye-opening bug in the
iphone which allows you by just simply
visiting website to ledge someone
download your entire SMS history and
it's kind of scary stuff and it also
could be good news for jailbreaker
something so I'm going to go ahead and
roll you guys to everything we know and
what we can expect anyway let's get this
one started okay so let me go ahead and
kind of give you guys some background on
this you know we don't actually have
this exploit out and that's probably a
good thing because basically this is
just as dangerous as you know any kind
of bug on you know your browser such as
Internet Explorer or Chrome or anything
like that because basically kind of like
in old days of the iphone where you know
you originally you jailbreak just by
going to a website and did we do it all
for you but this actually could be
pretty similar basically what it is is
that it's a bug in Safari now they
didn't tell us how to do it or anything
but basically by going there within like
10 seconds I want to say and of course
all you have to do is just by going to
the website then 10 seconds they could
download all your SMS all the ones you
sent all the ones you've got even wants
you to leave it within you know just a
couple seconds now that's you know scary
as is but what they actually if they
wanted to press it which they didn't but
if they want to press it they go ahead
and fully unlock the iphone and
basically you know take over basically
kind jailbreak it and put in whatever
they wanted to so it's kind of something
you should watch for
now before I tell you guys this but it's
not a big deal because they didn't like
I said they didn't let anybody else know
they basically apple bought it for
fifteen thousand dollars was basically
what happened and so Apple is working on
right now I'm sure they will have a
firmware update for the iphone pretty
soon now as far as i know this only
works for the iphone because it does go
off of the SMS but we don't know we
don't know all details so it actually
might be applicable to the ipod touch we
don't know so guys this has some good
news and bad news and a warning so the
good news is it completely be good for
jailbreaking you know jailbreak should
continuously getting harder and harder
and you know these everything is just
getting really complicated and it would
really really simplify jailbreaking all
kinds of devices if you can just go back
to going to a website and you know in 10
seconds your iPod or iPhones jailbroke
that would be you know great on the
downside is that you know this is
actually a legitimate security deal I
mean you know it's not like any of these
you know rickrolling things that you
know you didn't change your ssh password
this is actually serious stuff you know
could they could people could get a
virus on your ipod or iphone well I
phone for now but I could see ipod in
the future and actually no take personal
information and everything so I guess
the warning would definitely have to be
if you're really worried about this and
you're not worried about jailbreaking go
ahead keep always keep on the update
updated I've Apple firmware because they
will definitely be releasing something a
fix for this probably within a week or
two I know there I got a mess around
with this and if you but if you want to
try to wait for the jailbreak you may
not want to go ahead and update for the
law because this is they patch up the
hole probably be gone and I would be
surprised if if somebody gets a hold of
how how it works and actually figures it
out and get some pretty cool jailbreaks
going on but either way whatever you
want to do definitely be careful you
know for a long time you know us you
know who have an iphone or ipod figure
we can go to any link we want who cares
not a virus
well you know that's not so much the
case anymore it looks like everyone's
pretty safe for right now but you know
as soon as they know now that hackers
know that hey you can do something with
SMS it's a pretty simple deal to go
start looking for stuff and I'm sure all
kinds of people are trying to figure it
out right now so Jack guys just kind of
be careful don't know don't go to links
you know just just kind of be careful
don't you can't surf the web with
impunity anymore because now it's kind
of starting to catch up with you so
ahead guys it's just kind of that a
little bit of a heads up on this um you
know I wouldn't worry about it too much
and actually I think it could end up
being a really cool thing allowing you
to jail break very easily but yeah guys
just you know just watch out from what
you click and if you're interested you
go ahead and get the Apple update which
will be coming soon and if not
definitely don't because I'm sure soon
as it's out they will definitely have a
jailbreaker or something similar for so
who knows anyway guys thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
