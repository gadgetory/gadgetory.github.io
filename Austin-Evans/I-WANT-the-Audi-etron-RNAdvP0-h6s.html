brand new Audi e-tron now howdy was
awesome F to sponsor our trip out here
to San Francisco for the launch event
and I've got to say I want one like I
really really want one the e-tron brand
has been around for a couple years now
primarily on the a3 e-tron it's a cool
car but it is a plug-in hybrid whereas
this is fully electric something I
really appreciate about the e-tron is
that it actually doesn't look ugly that
might sound like a backhanded compliment
but a lot of electric cars straight-up
do look like science projects this looks
like a classic outie with a little bit
of an electric Flair one of the easiest
ways to spot that this is an e-tron and
not a standard outie is going to be with
the grille it looks similar but the main
difference here is that it actually
isn't a full grille so in fact this is
the only area that will actually open it
up and that's purely based on how you
need to cool the battery or stuff like
the air-conditioning when you're on the
freeway it can all close up this is one
to be fully aerodynamic take a look
inside the e-tron what you're going to
find is something that is very much
classic aldi but with a lot of nice tech
touches so you get all kinds of
information up on here for example you
can get a giant high-resolution Google
map or you can get some more the
performance data it's more the economy
stuff as of course you're driving an
electric vehicle you want to be able to
see how efficiently you're driving
there's a bunch of different things that
you can do with virtual cockpit but that
my friends is just the beginning you
also have two additional screens here in
the center console so this is going to
be the main display it works for things
like your navigation and it does have
this nice little haptic touch feature
which is share with nalli this display
but also the one on the back seat this
is where you're going to do primarily
most of the stuff in the vehicle you can
pull up like car play your settings
whatever you want to do and below that
is where you can control all of the
different climate control stuff and a
couple of other settings so if I want I
can say just turn up the fan you can set
the dual zone climate control or you can
do a couple of other things like say
open your garage door or turn off the
screens altogether unfortunately we're
actually connected to the internet right
now but if we were I could show you that
Alexa is built into the e-tron this is a
new partnership with Amazon it's the
full version of Alexa which is using LTE
to be able to ask it well pretty much
anything you want so in theory you can
say on your way home hey Alexa
start my garage door open something
really cool that's sadly not coming to
the US is the virtual mirror now right
now it's going to be too loose into
Europe mostly because of the regulations
here but essentially it replaces the
standard mirrors with cameras what this
means is that not going to help with
aerodynamics but this little section
right here is going to be replaced with
an OLED display which will then show you
what's going to be going on behind you
on top of that it will even adjust the
view based on how quickly you're driving
so you might see a little bit of a wider
view on the freeway or a little bit of a
tighter view when you're on a side
street or whatever the case is but it's
going to be fully adjustable and it's a
freaking camera on a screen and your
side mirror thing I want it the start of
the show here is definitely the electric
powertrain now you guys you can kind of
see this from the outside so underneath
the floor of the cabin is going to be
the full 95 watt hour cell there is a
lot of engineering that goes into that
battery cell so on top of being about
the largest capacity that you can get on
any electric vehicle right now there's
going to be a lot of safety and
importantly a lot of cooling inside the
entire bottom of the battery is all
going to be liquid cooled and on top of
that this crash structure around it is
hugely important because you know if
someone hits your car you don't want
your batteries to be impacted so now
these are going to be an actual crash
structure on the side of the cell but
each individual battery cell they're
going to be 36 of them that take up the
actual battery space they're all going
to be individually protected with a very
strong steel frame there's not a final
us range number available for the e-tron
yet since it won't be going on sale
until next year but based on the
European cycle you should expect 200
plus miles on a charge and that combined
with the ultra fast charging should mean
that well I don't care it's fine it's
plenty for me the e-tron will charge it
up to 150 kilowatts now as far as I know
that's about the quickest electric
vehicle charge that you can find at a
full 150 kilowatt hour charge what you
can do is you can get this thing from 0%
to 80% in 30 minutes the e-tron is
powered by a pair of electric motors one
on the rear axle one on the front now in
addition to giving you the full outtie
quattro experience of all-wheel drive
you're going to be getting some pretty
decent power so the finalized figures
aren't in just yet here in the US but
you should expect somewhere in the
neighborhood of 350 to 400 horsepower
and importantly since it is an electric
vehicle you're going to have a lot of
torque and is going to be instant
there's also a boost mode
on board so if you want just a little
bit of extra power say you're trying to
outrun marques or something not that I
would ever do that in an e-tron then
there's actually going to be a little
bit of extra power for a few seconds
which you can engage either by putting
the car in sport mode or if you really
flip floor the throttle there's actually
a button on the back side of the pedal
which will then give you just a little
bit of extra juice for a few seconds
even though it's an electric vehicle
you're not giving up a lot of
practicality so this has standard air
suspension which you can see is
currently lowering all the way down you
have a couple inches of play whether you
want to go off row or you want to go
into dynamic mode which is just a fine
mode you should drive it in fun mode and
if you really want to go crazy with it
this can actually tow up to 4,000 pounds
if you get the tow package which I just
kind of want to try because you know an
electric car that's fast and roomy and
can tow I'm just really trying to sell
my fiance on this right now so just
between us
she's just roll with it okay what really
impresses me with the e-tron is that it
feels like it is the full package sure
you're getting an electric vehicle but
it's also a luxurious outing with all
the bells and whistles and importantly
all the functionality that you would
expect I was kind of surprised to say
this but I'm glad that Audi really
sponsored a trip out here because I
legitimately want an e-tron</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
