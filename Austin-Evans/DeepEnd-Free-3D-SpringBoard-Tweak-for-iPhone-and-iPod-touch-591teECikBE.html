on a very cool little cydia tweak called
deep end deep end is a freight week for
your iPhone 4 or iPod Touch 4th
generation it allows you to go ahead and
make your home screen kind of look a
little 3ds let me just show you how it
works so if I start tilting it you'll
see that the background starts to change
you can get a very really cool 3d effect
so you know as you kind of tilt it up
down all around to everything you know
the background just kind of Scrolls back
and forth oh yeah this doesn't really
have any practical value but it's a
really cool tweak show your friends or
just kind of just admire your background
to everything it looks pretty cool so it
definitely recommend guys check it out
it's very simple tweak you can find it I
will have it yeah I do have to add a
custom repo but it is free and you know
it's not piracy repos I mean this is
actually you know legit Lee free you
guys go ahead and check it out in the
description of this video hopefully you
guys know how to add a source in Cydia
but just add the source and you should
be able to download it is called deep
end I know there is only about one thing
I have to really show you guys in its
the settings
you can't go ahead and change a lot of
things so for example the zoom what does
is it kind of zooms in on your standard
background so like you can turn the zoom
all the way up or not all the way up but
up farther and you know the effect will
look a little bit better but the problem
is your background will kind of look a
little bit pixelated and low-quality so
I recommend go ahead and just kind of
experiment around with the settings see
what looks best for you also try
different wallpapers because some will
work better than others but overall it's
a really cool effect and I definitely
recommend you guys check it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
