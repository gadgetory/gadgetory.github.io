here with an $800 editing PC build now
this is just a little bit different from
my normal gaming builds as this is more
aimed at someone who needs to be able to
use a professional 3d application maybe
you're going to be doing some gameplay
streaming or recording or you might just
simply need a very powerful computer to
do some video editing to give you an
idea of the performance I loaded up a
copy of Adobe Premiere cs6 and then
rendered out a one minute video at the
YouTube 1080p preset and it only needed
about one minute and 31 seconds to
complete it moving on we have Cinebench
which is a more general overall
benchmark on the CPU side we got a score
of six point eight seven points and on
the OpenGL benchmark test we got a score
of fifty one point nine frames per
second since this is a very powerful PC
you can also do some gaming on it so a
loaded up Crysis 3 which arguably is the
best-looking PC game out right now this
is able to run it at 1080p on high
settings with a bit of anti-aliasing
definitely very impressive to kick the
build off one time using an AMD FX 8350
now for a build like this we can
absolutely use as much raw power as we
can get our hands on and the 8350
definitely delivers here with an 8 core
design clocked it up to 4.2 gigahertz
now heavily threaded programs such as
Adobe Premiere and Sony Vegas will
definitely be able to take advantage of
all these cores and that very high clock
speed is definitely great right out of
the box but if you'd like you can also
do some overclocking to push it even
higher all for about a hundred and
ninety five dollars for a motherboard we
want to be using a gigabyte GA 978 d3
now this gives you a lot of bang for
your buck is of course it does support
our 8350 processor as well as
overclocking it but on top of that it
also does support up to 32 gigabytes of
RAM if you want totally maxed it out and
it does have cool features that you
would hope to have hundred new computer
like this including USB 3.0 support as
well as 6 SATA 3 ports so that means
that you can add multiple hard drives or
even multiple SSDs all for about $85 for
the graphics card we're going to be
using a 2 gigabyte EVGA GeForce GTX 650
Ti boost so really long name inside this
is an awesome new card it delivers a lot
of the performance from the gtx 660 but
in a much lower price tag so one of the
really cool things about this is of
course it is an nvidia card is that it
does support credit which is very
important for programs such as the Adobe
cs6 Suite it also
does have two gigabytes of memory built
and which you can definitely come in
handy and on top of all this it's
definitely a very good gaming card as
well so if you want to go load up
something like Crysis like I showed
earlier pretty much any game out there
it'll definitely be able to handle it
all for about 170 dollars for memory
we're going to be using 8 gigabytes of
Corsair Vengeance ddr3 ram now this is
great stuff that I use in a lot of my
builds is not only is it reliable but
it's also pretty quick as it's close to
1600 megahertz now eight gigabytes
should be enough for most programs
however if you like you can very easily
upgrade this to 16 gigabytes or even 32
if you'd like however if you just want
to stick with the 8 gig version it's
going to run you about $65 for an SSD
we're going to be using a 120 gigabyte
Samsung 840 series drive now I am a huge
fan of SSDs especially when you're going
to be doing editing or anything like
that as it makes an absolutely massive
difference
so the 8:40 is going to be a great
choice for this build if not only is it
going to be fast and reliable Samsung
makes some of the best SSDs out there
but on top of that it's not going to
break the bank coming in at about $100
for the hard drive we won't be using a
one terabyte Western Digital caviar
green now the one disadvantage of using
an SSD is it typically does not have a
lot of storage space so that's where a
secondary hard drive such as the caviar
grain will definitely come in handy so
with one terabyte of storage this should
be enough for a lot of video pictures
all that kind of stuff however I will
mention that if you do need more space
this also does come in a 2 as well as 3
terabyte versions of course all those
links will be in the description of this
video
however it's the 1 terabyte version is
all you need it's going to run you about
$75 for the power supply we're going to
be using a 500 watt pour center CX 500
now I use these in my build all the time
and that's because not only are they
cheap but they're also very reliable
they're fairly efficient thanks to the
80 plus bronze certification and with
500 watts of capacity that should be
more than enough for the system as is as
well if you'd like to do some additional
upgrades such as hard drives on a lot
kind of stuff in the future so all this
for about $55 makes it a perfect fit for
this build for a case we're going to be
using the Corsair card by 200 are now of
course there make some fantastic cases
and the 200 are is no exception so some
of the things it's got going for it is
it is a full sized ATX enclosure which
means that you're going to have lots of
room for upgrades for example additional
fans hard drives SSDs all that will fit
into the 200 R with no problem on top of
that it's fairly well
it does have USB 3.0 support on the
front panel and not only that but it's
also very clean and understated looking
design all for about $60 so there you
have it an awesome $800 editing PC build
now of course prices are always changing
so I will have links to everything I
mentioned in the description of this
video as well as some additional
upgrades so for example if you'd like to
add some more memory you like to get a
bigger hard drive whatever I'll have a
bunch of extra links in the description
for all kinds of cool upgrades for the
system if you're interested more feel
free to check out my last bill where I
went over a $750 gaming PC if you
enjoyed definitely be sure to leave this
video a thumbs up and subscribe for more
PC Bowls like this anyway guys I will
catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
