video on all the Apple rumors that you
need to know this is going to be a
collaboration with my good friend Ellie
also you guys are probably know her as
at Jett and together we're gonna go over
all the rumors all over the internet
about anything to do with the iPhone 5
and beyond starting with the iPhone 5 we
know it will have a dual-core processor
a 4-inch display and will be available
on sometime early next month all this is
fine and good but what we really want to
know is what about the camera yeah you
know what the camera it's what you want
to know I mean come on are you
interested in something other than a
camera on a smartphone that has a
dual-core processor or a 4-inch display
16 gigabytes of storage 512 megabytes of
RAM and both Wi-Fi 3G 4G HSPA+ and LTE I
didn't think so the iPhone 5 well it's
like something I'm looking forward to
besides what's room and a white iPhone
to actually be available on the day of
the release since we pretty much know
everything we need to know about the
iPhone 5 it's pretty easy to go ahead
and nail down love what we're gonna know
about the iPhone 6 so while the 4-inch
display on the iPhone 5 is gonna be just
fine it's gonna be great a lot of people
are going to complain that it is still
too small so what Apple is going to do
for the iPhone 6 sometime in mid 2013 is
they're going to announce the iPad phone
let me get this right
ok so still no Bluetooth we can send
photos or videos to each other music
still no fold-out keyboard slide-out
keyboard right ok um still no expandable
memory rights exclusively we can report
the iPhone next generation which is the
official name for the next generation
iPhone if you didn't understand that
because it's the next generation iPhone
will have a ll dial up as opposed to
Wi-Fi 3G 4G or even five-and-a-half G
now what this means is that it will be
absolutely amazing at making really
annoying and loud noises making everyone
in your house get off the phone and you
know because you want to get on the
internet to go search your you know
internet forums and whatnot I mean what
is really going to be good for is making
you not want to go back to nineteen
eighty-seven still death-grip that drops
calls the iPhone rotary dial will be an
absolutely stunning piece of technology
that is so amazing that my vocal cords
are about to explode with awesome it
uses a rotary dial or do you understand
how awesome a rotary dial er is it's
like I don't have words that's the thing
about it okay hold on hallo what I find
are we have to it and you still there's
still no flash and you still need Wi-Fi
to use FaceTime anyway guys that's gonna
be about it for our comprehensive rumor
roundup hope you guys enjoyed of course
this was totally not serious in any way
whatsoever but the other day Ellie and I
we were talking we're like you know what
these iPhone rumors are just getting
silly so what we decided do we just make
a video just making fun of the whole
thing and we hope you guys enjoyed if
you did definitely be sure to leave a
video a thumbs up if you want go share
with your friends tell them about you
know how you saw a youtube video about
the iPhone 8 don't be impressed anyway
guys yeah that's gonna be a bad if you
guys are interested in seeing more
definitely be sure to hit the annotation
on the screen right now it can go check
out Ellie's video where we go over a lot
of them even more kind of silly and
crazy iPhone rumors and I hate you guys
if I go subscribe to her - she's awesome
her last name is awesome so you know I
don't have a joke here I don't where I'm
going with this
and today we're gonna go over punch any
rumors that you might need to know
whether it's iPhone iPad or thing so
sort of Polly about a four inch screen
but one thing that's a little bit not
less as much known your modem which is
obviously going to be not included you
need to pay another $300 for that
exclusively we can report that the
iPhone 7 team will have da I know this
is gonna be very entertaining and
interesting and things because the iPad
is phony</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
