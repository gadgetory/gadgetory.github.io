different with this video this is the
new Moto e and this is going to be my
only phone for the next week the thing
you have to keep in mind is that the
Moto e is a very very budget oriented
smartphone we're talking about $150 here
this is a version with LTE a little bit
later on there's going to be a $120
version that does not have LTE so the
battery life probably won't be too bad
on the Moto e we'll find out but the
camera I'm holding worried about so
instead of having a removable back panel
we actually have the removable bezels so
once you pop it off you'll be able to
see on the right side you have the
option for a micro SD card which is
important although not quite as much as
on the original Moto e which only had
four gigs of storage
this comes with eight gigs out of the
box which still isn't a lot so if you're
gonna be using this you'll probably want
to throw in a micro SD card but for my
weak little test I think I should be
fine and because the bezels are
removable that means you can swap them
out with different colors so I have the
white and red combo here which actually
I think it looks pretty good in person I
just friends it's really echoey in here
so first impressions are the screens not
bad so with it's not even HD it's 965
540 but but considering that the screen
is only 4.5 inches it actually doesn't
look bad
I mean yes if I look closely I can
absolutely see pixels but $450 I'm not
complaining so after one day with the
Moto e I've got to say one thing this is
an awesome size for a phone now I really
like the original Moto X and this is
almost the exact same size it's a little
bit thicker and slightly bigger in a
couple dimensions but overall especially
coming from the iPhone 6 plus this is
awesome actually fits in my pocket it's
really easy to kind of just hold and use
in one hand performance really isn't bad
now I think a lot of this has to do with
the fact that's running stock while we
pop which makes a huge difference so
today was a travel day in the Moto we
did great so I decided to take along the
Moto 360 today which is kind of funny
considering that the watch costs $100
more than the phone without a great
combo one thing I really appreciated
today was having LTE something that the
original Moto e and even the current
Moto G lack so I'm traveling especially
in busy places like airports usually
that's really difficult to get a decent
signal however because it has LTE was
actually able to do just fine I was
streaming YouTube you know the catch up
with Twitter all that kind of stuff no
problem all day long but I like is also
still really impressing me so I'm really
using the phone all day to listen to
pond
music as well as keep up with Twitter
and all that kind of stuff
I've still got 25 percent and that's all
4 hours of screen on time
now the phone did get slightly laggy on
me a couple times today usually when I
was multitasking sometimes would freeze
for 3 4 maybe 5 seconds before finally
catch up now this is a lower end phone
and it only does have one gig of Bram's
it's not a big deal and it only happened
maybe like two or three times in the
entire day but you can sometimes notice
it's really trying to struggle to keep
up so this is the Moto e this is $150
phone what do you think the front
speaker is definitely a nice feature
that I kind of wish that we had as well
cuz I will I will turn on like a podcast
or something and if I don't want to have
earbuds or something and I'm on the run
I don't have my Bluetooth speaker I'll
just turn it on just to have something
oh no I want to focus on my face okay
it's just really great it's really great
it's like VGA it's really grainy
considering how much makeup okay I mean
seriously
hey you know one yeah good oh see daddy
that's how thumbnail so it's a five
megapixel camera but the thing is the
last one didn't even have autofocus it
was really bad this one at least has
autofocus it's not terrible
I'm impressed I'm impressed that this
phone is $150 like total not like with a
contract so tomorrow is going to be my
last day with the Moto e I think the
thing that's really jumped out at me
most about this is that there really are
no major drawbacks sure it's not the
fastest phone in the world doesn't have
the best screen or the best camera but
I've used this just like we'd use any
other high-end smartphone all week long
and it is not let me down so after one
week with the new Moto e I think the
verdict is pretty clear first of all
this is a major upgrade over the
original you're getting LTE better specs
twice as much memory a much better
rear-facing camera and an actual
front-facing one is it perfect no over
$450 it would be hard-pressed to do much
better so I'm interested to know what do
you guys think about this format for
doing reviews that will be sure to let
me know in the comments below and if you
enjoy a Mike Schmidt
few more anyway guys thank you so much
for watching and I will catch you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
