inside tech today we're going to take a
first look at the Nintendo 3ds now the
Nintendo 3ds looks pretty cool I gotta
admit thanks to an FCC filing we have
some information about possibly the
screens and it looks like a release date
too so it's pretty cool we also had some
pretty cool stuff about a new ipad
jailbreak app called full force which
allows you to take your normal iphone
apps such as the facebook app go ahead
and blow it all the way up to your ipad
screen pretty cool lastly we had some
information on the HTC Wildfire HTC's
latest smartphones going to go ahead and
cover all this and more
okay guys let's go ahead and start with
a nintendo 3 years so the 3ds looks
pretty cool we've heard about it a
little bit basically it's going to be
far as we know a d/s that has 3d and
that's about all we know but thanks to
this recent FCC filing looks like we
know a little bit more so what we see is
that in the SEC filing they have a all
the parts on a 34 now of course this is
not always going to look like this
thing's probably three foot by 3 foot
but why this does toss is if you look at
the screens it shows that actually has
one is widescreen one it looks very
similar to the normal touchscreen on the
standard d has now this is a lot a lot
of people were expecting that you know
this was going to have to strain but we
have never had any kind of confirmation
on they excited would be backwards
compatible with these games but who's to
say that that would you know just cut
one screen in half and put the DSP on
top and bottom front letter but it does
look like this will have two strings it
does look like little ice cream as well
which is really good because you know
all the screens likely have been you
know a wide screen ratio which really
gets you know a lot more depth and
everything to the games so we don't have
a whole lot of information disappear on
that except one nice little thing that
they added basically Nintendo asked that
the FCC would hold and that release any
information until later this year are
right around the holiday season I'm not
that kind of ten stupid make me think
that is going to be out before the end
of the year probably you know november
october somewhere in that area now a
nice little thing if you have an ipad
there's a new app in cydia for free
called full force which will basically
upscale any app to your ipad screen now
of course you can do that with your
iphone apps already but what this does
is it actually made of Lee does it some
such as blowing it out that actually
pulls the everything and makes a lot of
X look like they're specially made for
the ipad this one is free guy so i
definitely recommend you check it out if
you have a jailbroken ipad it looks like
a must last thing we will be covering
today is HTC
smartphone the wildfires the Wildfire
looks pretty cool it's going to be an
entry-level phone but I like the look of
it but the specs are is going to be
running android 2.1 with cents it's
going to have a 3.2 inch qvga capacitive
touchscreen it's going to have a 5
megapixel camera with autofocus and
flash 384 megabytes of RAM and the
Qualcomm 528 megahertz processor I'm so
of course this is not going to be you
know I got a really powerful phone like
a Snapdragon phone it's going to be a
lower-end phone and it should be pretty
good person I like the looks of it looks
really cool and as long as the price
comes in a great it's going to be pretty
cool it also has a really nice thing
where it has a built-in widget that
allows you to share your favorite apps
with friends so for example you see cool
app you can share two friends then a
bunch of ways such as text email or even
Twitter so guys this one is only going
to be Europe only at least for the what
seems like they might bring it over to
some other places later it looks like
it's going to be a Europe only phone so
if you're in Europe you might want to
take a look at this one anyway guys
