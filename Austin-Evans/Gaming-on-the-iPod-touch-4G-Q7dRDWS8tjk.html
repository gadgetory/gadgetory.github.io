overview of gaming on the iPod Touch 4th
generation so of course the iPod and
iPhone as well as the iPad but all of
these are really great gaming devices
you know they always have been ever
since the app store but now force with
the iPod Touch 4th generation there are
quite a few big improvements so
obviously there is the much higher
resolution screen so games look
fantastic much better than say I may be
a PSP or DS screen but in addition
there's also a few new things such as
the faster processor which will allow
for much better graphics as well as
there is now a gyroscope so instead of
just you know maybe like just tilting it
a little bit it actually go ahead and
detect your movement in 3d space so you
guys should go ahead and little tiny
movements or totally noticeable to the
iPod touch I'm going to show you guys a
couple games that are prepared for iPod
touch that aren't everything in between
kind of just give you guys a good feel
of whether or not the iPod Touch 4th
generation is a good gaming machine to
begin with let's go ahead and take a
look at one of my favorite games on the
iPhone and iPod touch which is real
racing so real racing is fully prepared
for the iPhone as well as the iPod Touch
with support for Retina display as well
as the gyroscope for steering controls
so it should give you a really good feel
for you know what a racing game looks
like and this is pretty much the best
you can get it's fantastic I'll go just
jump into a quick race here mind you
pick a random track and just go ahead
and pick a random car I'm just going to
show you guys a little bit about what
the what the controls are and how it
works
so I'm not so sure how well you can see
this through the camera but the graphics
are really quite good especially for an
iPhone you know I would definitely say
close to ps2 graphics that say it's
right up there with the PSP so go ahead
and just jump right into the race and
you'll see here the accelerometer
controls are very very nice well I guess
it's just the motion controls in general
so it's going to show you
so as you can see here I'm using the
thing where the if I touch anywhere on
the right side say I let off this is the
gas and if I hit this this is the brake
all I gotta do is just tilt the iPod
left and right to steer and so it's
pretty simple and this is one of the
games where touch controls just work a
lot of games on the iPhone and iPod
touch kind of have touch controls Tecton
so for example you know a lot of
first-person shooters like you know the
thumbsticks don't seem to work very well
but in real racing it really does work
and there are also different things
where they actually can automatically
accelerate for you as well as
automatically brake depending on how how
much trouble you have or whatever
personally I think it's about perfect so
yeah I mean I'm playing pretty decent
I'm actually looking through my camera
so so you're the accelerometer controls
very very nice and precise so the next
game I'll be showing you is air coaster
pro this is another one of those really
cool games it is it works very very well
so I'm going to show you it is a
rollercoaster game so we go ahead and
pinch to zoom out kind of stuff let's
glad you jump right into the car so and
you see here it's going to start the
match it's not doesn't that start of the
match but start the game and you see
here is very very smoothing I should
take a look at the frames per second
down there it runs at a very nice clip
and you can see here with the respective
display it honestly is very very
entertaining in here you can actually go
ahead and I've watched this roller
coaster of I've run on these rokoff's
for a very long time on my previous iPod
um this is always a really fun app you
know you go to a theme park or something
we going to pull your iPod or iPhone out
of your pocket I'm fishing see here it
runs very very very smooth whereas on
the iPod Touch 2nd generation it does
run just a little bit choppy so again
gives you a really good indicator the
graphics are so great on the iPod Touch
4th generation as well as iPhone 4 they
are pretty much the same as far as
graphics are concerned the next game
I'll be showing you this eboydee
fixed picks I know this game is
fantastic I really really love it it's
it's well I'm having a try explain long
as you go ahead and get so basically
does these excel honors let's go and
just get in here and this is one of the
most unique little of this this is and
it really does work this just kind of
gives you an idea of what the motion
controls do quite just put this together
here basically the objective is to get
the put the puzzles together using each
so on
there we go so I'm go ahead just go
through a couple of these just trying to
show you on the 3d actually I know
obviously the iPod Touch and iPhone
don't have a 3d screen like the Nintendo
3ds does but you just take a look at
that I mean that's a really nice 3d
effect with these awesome pixel graphics
and so again know the games it looks
really quite nice on the iPhone and iPod
touch especially on the iPod Touch 4th
generation with it just it's got such a
nice looking screen all the artwork
really pops off colors really really
vibrant and I think it was saying the
iPod Touch 4th generation if I don't
think I can get this one but uh value by
Touch 4th generation definitely does
have such a high resolution screen it's
much much higher even though it's not
quite as big say the PSP screen on the
resolution and the quality and colors
all cut stuff are very very very high
and Plus come on you can't find a PSP
game with something like this thing
that's that's just too cool so the setup
guys I really like the iPod touch as a
gaming platform now of course that's not
the only thing it does you know it has
the internet email video apps all that
kind of stuff but strictly as a gaming
device I don't think it's a bad idea at
all now it is a little bit more
expensive than DS or a PSP at least it's
more expensive than the standard PSP
however I do think you get a lot more
you get the touchscreen and not only is
it a touchscreen but the screen looks so
vibrant so much higher resolution and
say a PSP screen or even the DS
it's much much higher resolution looks
fantastic you get a can't you get 2
cameras rather so there's so much more
you do get with the iPod Touch um it's
got motion controls got touch screen so
you do get a lot of different styles of
gaming in addition the games tend to be
much much cheaper so let's say you know
maybe there's the big new game out the
iPod Touch maybe like 10 it's usually
around $10 a lot of times less but for
any one of these big budget games such
as you know Madden or something like
that it's gonna cost you usually around
$10 to buy where did you know that same
release on maybe the DSO the PSP would
probably be 3035 even $40 so really do
get a lot of value now I will say that
some of the apps in the App Store aren't
that great there are a lot of kind of
games that just aren't fantastic but
really I can go ahead and wade through
the good one we read through the bad
ones
to get to the good ones you'll
definitely won't be disappointed so guys
that's pretty much it if you're thinking
about getting an iPod Touch 4th
generation for gaming I highly recommend
to do so there are lots and lots of good
games some like I said some aren't that
great such as first-person shooters
don't tend to work that well but games
is a really designed iPod that you know
I really utilize the motion controls and
the touchscreen well just do fantastic
so guys just really I recommend if
you're thinking about it definitely go
take the plunge it's a fantastic gaming
console there's a lot of really cool
things in it anyway guys thanks for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
