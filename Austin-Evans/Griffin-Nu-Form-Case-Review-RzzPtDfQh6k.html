today and here's something a little
different as you can see I'm going to be
doing a case review now this is not
probably we're going to be doing for all
that often but something this is a case
I definitely thought that I need to let
you guys know about anyway as you can
see it is the Griffin new form case for
the iPod Touch second generation um I
got this actual case I got this case
about six months ago I bought the $20 is
currently $15 now um you know I don't
like this case I'm going to be straight
up this is my second case I will show
you in just a second the first one I got
broke
I returned it I got this one and it
broke the exact same place it's still
usable but let's just go ahead and show
you guys what we got here
so this nice little packaging this
exactly the white came just open it up
like I said guys I'm not gonna be doing
these very often I'm just showing you
guys just toss it aside let me see that
bad this a lot of these and this takes
out and you put all the stuff back in
make it look nice and you can see that
it came with a screen protector and
these cleaning cloths yeah that by the
way I use the screen pick from this
really cheap not really worth a whole
lot is really thin lots of bubbles
anything so let's just toss that side so
you can see this is the case it's not
bad light looks very nice you can see
the discs right here and just slides in
perfectly and then you see this is a
rubbery and you can see it's kind of got
definitely got some wire and stuff on it
but it's not bad you know just cleaned
up a little bit and you can see it's got
this but okay let's see here if I can
show you guys this right here is my
problem right there
see this little piece plus right there
as snapped twice this one you really
can't see even if yeah you really won't
be able to see it all it's really hard
to sleep it right here it is cracked now
right now it's not a big deal I mean you
can touch it it's not it's pretty it's
pretty good as long as you don't really
mess with it but
before they cracked again and a whole
chunk of this came off which really me
and I let me show you one more thing if
you open it up and you see that the
Griffin but I'm not sure you'll be able
to see it was getting like yeah you can
see the two you see those two lines are
there that those come with perfect
matching marks on mine up and down there
so we also slightly scratched it which
is another thing that I don't know I
guess that's just kind of part of the
reason why when you buy a plastic case
just have to deal with that it also gets
tons of junk in there that's just kind
of unrelated because got open um now
there are some good things about it let
me go ahead and just slide my ipod in
here it's quite easy to put on
it's no problem just take it side like
this and then you take this part right
here make sure I can see this and then
you just slide right on it's no big deal
it looks quite nice like I admit it does
do some decent protection um you can see
it's got the got that really nice mark I
love the back of this it looks so nice
nice tapered um you've got perfect
access let's go ahead and just open this
up and then oh no you guys knows and so
you see here that really easy to turn
the volume down the volume lock it and
there's no problem at all
ports are all very accessible I mean
really guys this is a really short thing
I probably won't do these anymore um I
just want I just wanted to make this
real quick I don't recommend this case I
don't between this breaking right now
it's okay I've had this one the original
on I have about three months before it
broke and I have had this one for about
two months now and it's probably back to
break because it's definitely getting a
loser and you touch that you feel it's
got some give and I said you guys can't
see but it's right there um so that's
just about it
between the little bit of scratching on
the back now the case itself holds up
quite nicely I mean I mean it's nice and
just firm sturdy I like I love the look
of it it is $15 so it's not
that bad it does offer some visa
protection but I really don't want to
drop this I mean it's got I can leave it
back right and set down and it's not
it's got a lip sitting right there you
see the lip but the thing is between
this breaking in search the winds breaks
that's it might not seem like a big deal
but imagine a big chunk out of this
little piece of plastic here let's
mention it leaves my knee scratches on
the back nothing major but you can
definitely notice it so I don't know I
just I just don't recommend it
I mean I'm using it but my name is the
only reason I'm using is just cuz I
bought it and I'm cut she not only to
buy a bunch I've got another case but
it's just a little silicone I like this
warm which tells you a lot but I get
that's just about it
you know if you want you go ahead you
can check it out you know if this would
just broke the first time in the second
one but okay I will let it slide just
you know but they both vocal same way
and I haven't really dropped it just
general wear and tear just coming at
them in my pocket and that kind of stuff
so you know I definitely recommend just
just staying away from this anyway
thanks for watching and yeah I guess it
just about it um I don't do any more
case reviews I don't know I don't have a
whole lot of cases but anyway that's it
that's about it thanks for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
