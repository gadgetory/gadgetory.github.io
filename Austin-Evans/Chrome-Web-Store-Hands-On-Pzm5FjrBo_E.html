overview of the Google Chrome Web Store
I said this is just went live I'd like
to take this opportunity to go ahead and
give you guys a overview of it to show
you how it works and show you how you do
everything so as you can see here the
interface is really quite nice looking
and that kind of looks a little bit
similar to what the Mac App Store is
going to look like although of course
the one of the major differences being
that the Mac App Store is only for the
Mac while the chrome web stores for any
computer with the chrome with the Chrome
browser which of course includes Windows
Mac or Linux and obviously Chrome OS
this is what you guys a little tour of
it one thing is is that this is actually
the new hub for everything Chrome so
addition now downloading the apps you
now download your extensions as well as
your things here so I'm going to jump
into the themes
I'm using here we can go ahead and
download any of these things we can
scroll through and do whatever we like
same thing goes for the extensions you
know for these standard extensions that
everyone loves about Google Chrome you
can go ahead and pick them out and
download them just fine
however the manger thing is definitely
going to be the app support let me show
you how this works so those are gonna be
a slider there's featured hello let's
just go ahead and pick something around
and let's pick Google Books so by
clicking on this we have a little la
page where we can scroll through our
screenshots and say you know more about
it but in addition we got to scroll down
some here see a description see reviews
I'll tell you what version said when it
was updated all that kind of stuff I'm
still say we want to go ahead and
install Google Books so we click install
doesn't take just a moment they will
bring us to the new tab page where it
shows our apps and so you can see I've
already downloaded a couple but let's go
ahead and jump into Google Books so here
we go I know our shows I have three
books already installed I'm so we can go
ahead and read through any of these
books so you can just click on this one
and show you how it works we can go
ahead and read now read on the device
etc etc there's all kinds of different
things you can do with this now let's go
ahead and back up here and go back to
the Chrome Web Store now of course
that's you're not the only thing they're
also our games so I'll go ahead and jump
into games
pop it was one of the big ones so go
ahead and take a look at this pop it you
can go ahead this actually will be
coming pre-installed and some Chrome I
believe in Chrome
and she actually will go ahead and
automatically have this one and I
believe next month or so but you can't
go ahead and download it now I already
do have it so go ahead and jump over to
the new tab page and open pop it now all
these are going to be done in html5 as
well as several other brand-new web
technologies so they're gonna run really
quite nicely now this is a fairly simple
game we can go ahead I just jump right
in on into it I'm not so sure how well
my screen record is picking this up but
the performance is very very nice and
very smooth I mean you can go ahead and
just pop the balloons yes it's the same
kind of game you see all the time but it
works quite well
so there you go guys that's just about
it for my overview of the Chrome Web
Store now there is much more you can
quit and also purchase apps and there's
all kinds of stuff that dies definitely
go ahead and take a look at of course
we'll have the link to check it out it's
chrome.google.com/webstore so go ahead
and check it out on your computer and
definit let me know what you think
anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
