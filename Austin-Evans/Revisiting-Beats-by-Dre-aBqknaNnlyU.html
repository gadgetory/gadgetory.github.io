some new beats by dre headphones now
that might not sound exciting on its own
however take a look around back you'll
see there's something a little different
these are 130 dollars for headphones
that's still kind of expensive or when
you consider that most beats are two
three four hundred dollars these guys
are actually a little bit more
affordable so if you guys remember Apple
actually bought beats by dre a couple
years ago and these are some of the
first headphones that have actually come
out that are made by Apple change the
way you hear sound so see about that I
am a little bit skeptical so you guys
probably know the beats by dre have a
reputation typically there are a lot
more bass heavy and maybe not the
greatest value for the dollar
interesting carrying case I guess it
says beats EP on it so that should do
come in a couple colors so this is a
blue model which actually kind I think
looks cool so even though Apple owns
beats by dre now you're actually still
getting a standard 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack
because courage you know they feel
pretty nice we're getting actual metal
here everything is nicely padded the ear
cups do look a little small it just so
happens that I have my color matching
Google pixel phone here I think it's
only natural that we start with a little
bit of dream yeah they sound like beats
um there's definitely a lot of bass
involved which is not really a surprise
and honestly I think a lot of people do
prefer sand bass the mids are definitely
subdued though that's that's definitely
sort of a beats characteristic of the
headphones but I don't hate it man
there's so much low end though it does
kind of overpower okay so these actually
are a bit better than I expected but to
actually properly compare them I have
two of my other favorite pairs of
headphones so first of all I have the
gray toe as our 80 ease these are
actually probably my favorite pair of
headphones around so they're a little
bit more of a specialized pair of
headphones first of all I think they
look awesome with the retro styling but
more importantly they're a really nice
sounding open back pair of headphones so
the idea is with an open back headphone
is that you're gonna get a little more
of a wider sound you have a little more
soundstage and typically it's a little
bit more detail on the high end but the
downside is pretty much everyone can
hear exactly what your list
- that is where these status audio CB
ones come in so you guys have probably
seen me talking about these a couple
times and videos however especially
considering that they're closed back
headphones they sound incredible yeah
you see B ones they're no joke so this
is a much more neutral sound so while
they're a little bit more bassy than
something that the Sr 80s they don't
even come close to the beats over
because it's a more neutral sound I
actually really liked using these for
things like video editing sure it's not
like a completely flat studio monitor
but it's a really nice blend of pretty
much anything sounds at least good on
these so we've got a lot of headphones
here we've got some phones we got this
this looks like a little bit of a
disaster right what I don't know is
really what are the strengths and
weaknesses of each one and more
importantly are the beats which are
slightly more expensive than these pairs
actually worth it okay so after
listening to all three of these pairs of
headphones for a little while I think
there's some really clear differences
and reasons why you might want to pick
up any of them so start with we have the
CB ones these are still some of my
favorites and if I had to pick one pair
of headphones to listen all of my music
on it would be these there's solid
padding here you can fold them up and
while not a huge fan of the gold color
these are easily the most comfortable
pair of headphones here to listen to for
a long time and the best part is these
are actually the cheapest did eighty
dollars on the other end we have the
great o SR ates
now I will have no shame admitting that
I am a huge fan boy for these headphones
Anila did look cool my opinion and sure
they're not the most comfortable but the
sound is just unique where the SR 80s
really shine is in the high end so it's
incredibly clear and honestly the music
just sounds detail there's very little
muddiness which is definitely something
you can find especially on the beats
however there's not a ton of bass and
honestly for some types of music such as
hip-hop they're okay but they do fall
flat and falling flat is something that
the beats do not do this is a very
paunchy a very rich a very warm sound
now some people will not like this and
of course music is a thing that is very
much based on your own personal
preference so for certain types of music
such as hip hop which is kind of beats
by dre hip hop yeah it makes sense these
sound good compared to the Gredos they
are nowhere near as detailed and
compared to the CB ones you're getting a
much more honest a a muddy sound but
certain tracks do not sound is
clean as they do on the statuses
personally I don't think these are going
to pull me away from the Gredos and the
statuses however whether you like the
look of them whether they like that warm
sound for $130 the beats EPS are not bad
headphones but of course music is all
about personal preference so I'm curious
which one of these headphones would you
go for definitely be sure to let me know
in the comments below
I have course we'll have links to all
these headphones in the description
anyway guys thank you so much for
watching and I will catch you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
