overview of iOS 4.1 for the iphone and
ipod touch so iOS 4.1 when it comes out
here in the next few days is going to
bring quite a few substantial new
features as well as a lot of bug fixes
everything so let me go ahead and I'm
going to run you guys through everything
that's going to be new so but to start
with let's go ahead and take a look at
some of the things that we actually
can't see so there's going to be both
fixes for the iphone 3g so now if you
have an iphone 3g on 4.0 you're gonna
you know of course you're going to
realize it's very very slow well that
should be an issue any longer it's going
to be quite it faster a lot more
responsive so that's that's it
definitely good news i'm an addition the
proximity bug has been fixed that's
great as well as some bluetooth issues
for quite a few different devices all
that stuff should be fiction 4.1 so
definitely a really good upgrade lot
really glad to hear their pics a lot of
that stuff now the additions are also
some several new features so the first
which is game center so let's go ahead
and jump in and show you what games in
it looks like so game center if you
don't know already is basically the you
know the iphone ipod touch equivalent of
maybe like xbox live or PSN something
like that basically you go ahead you can
earn achievements you can play with your
friends you go ahead and you know
automatch can join parties or not maybe
not party but you can go ahead and join
up with your friends in their games so
it's going to be a really cool feature
so basically game center will be
included in 4.1 for everyone and it's
actually going to be pretty cool so just
kind of show you guys usually a quick
tour of the application so you can go
ahead and come over here you can add
your friends so all you do is just come
over here hit plus and you just punch
him whatever the name of your friend is
and go ahead and play with them I can go
ahead and come over here to games now
right now on 4.1 there are no games just
yet but as soon as it comes out next
week a lot of games will be coming out
for Game Center so you guys should go
ahead and hit that button right there as
soon as it comes out to go ahead and
scroll through all the kinds gains that
are already ready for Game Center and I
do expect that while there will be quite
a few new games a lot of current games
such as angry birds and several others
will be updated to work with game center
so you know for example like i said you
play Angry Birds or you know dozens and
dozens of applications you already be
able to instantly
use Game Center and play with your
friends so that's definitely pretty cool
unless they can go ahead and come over
here to go to your pending friend
requests so I think game centers going
to be pretty cool on that I don't have
there are no games currently out yet
until it comes out there's nothing
really I can show you as far as how it
works although definitely stay tuned i
will actually do a video later on
showing you what game center looks like
in action ok so now let's go ahead and
take a look at ping which is now fully
supported in iOS 4.1 so ping is pretty
simple it's actually a pretty full
featured client for inside the app it's
inside the iTunes application it's
pretty full featured other why I just
give you guys a quick tour especially
can follow people so for example just go
ahead and follow muse go ahead and
scroll through here you can click like
you know you can like stab you can
comment and in addition to our videos or
photo gallery go ahead and view those
from inside this application so I think
it's pretty solid if you're already
using ping another new feature in 4.1 is
HDR photo capability so this means if
you have an iPhone 4 is that you will be
able to take much better-looking
pictures than before basically what HDR
means is that it takes instead of just
taking one picture and that's that it
takes several pictures with different
levels of exposure kind of puts them all
together maybe one looks a little bit
better with the dark when you want this
little bed with the light well it takes
the best of all worlds puts it together
and there you go and you did usually
better pictures oh and of course you can
go ahead and stick with the standard
photos as well so you know it's just
kind of whatever you want but in general
you should be able to get better
pictures with this anyway guys that's
pretty much it for my 4.1 / you but
before I sign out I do just want to just
say one thing because I've actually I
mean I know I've got a couple questions
about already i'm going to get quite a
few um as far as jailbreaking 4.1 is not
jailbreakable just yet um I know there
is actually a method going around you
actually use redsnow to jailbreak your
iphone or ipod touch with it or and it
really I've actually I have tried it
Cydia doesn't work but you can't go
ahead and enable background background
multitasking as well as home screen
wallpapers help them guys I do recommend
don't do this it causes a lot of
problems for me it cause the Wi-Fi to
stop working the ipod wouldn't shut off
and there are a few random bugs and
glitches here and there because
obviously I redsnow is not prepared
what so guys I really recommend do not
try this wait for an official jailbreak
to come out you know you can try to be
like and yes you will get all the
features but it's like I said it's gonna
be very very buggy very very glitchy I
highly recommend to just hold off until
an official jailbreak solution is
available hey guys if you have any more
questions or comments about 4.1 feel
free to leave them in the comments i'll
do my best friend answer and clear you
up anyway guys thanks for watching
Oh
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
