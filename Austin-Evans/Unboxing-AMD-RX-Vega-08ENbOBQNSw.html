while since AMD launched a new high-end
graphics cards but rx Vega is here
almost here I have both of the new card
the RX Vega 64 as well 56 which comes in
slightly less cool packaging so be sure
it's Andy for saying these that a little
bit early
64 will be launching on August 14th
whereas the 56 will be coming out on
August 28th unfortunately I can't tell
you how Vega performs today but I can't
do to show you what comes in this super
cool press box at least I hope it's
super cool whoa okay that's kind of cool
what what is this Radeon rx Vega yo that
is pretty cool it's like the full 3d
logo when it's glass it's just the
actual Vega die Joe you can even see the
HBM to memory so that is actually one of
the advantages at least in theory over
the rx10 series is it has a lot of very
fast memories as directly on chef this
might be one of the coolest things I've
ever gotten in a press box I love to
take a look at chips like this
especially you very rarely actually get
to see what a GPU looks like without
being you know inside a whole card
alright see what we got
woo comes in a surprisingly nice-looking
metal chassis wow that's that's real
metal there you know what I've actually
seen pictures of this and it looked kind
of decent but in person this is actually
a really nice looking reference design I
mean I still think that the 1080 and
1080 Ti reference designs super cool
looking but that's a really heavy
this is realizing that before we get too
far into Vega 64 we've got to take a
look at our slightly less cool unboxing
of 56 so essentially this is going to be
the lower end version of the same GPU so
just like there's the GTX 1080 and 1070
this is going to be the more affordable
version and it's also a nice slightly
less cool looking cooler although is
that Team Rocket logo Ken that's the
Team Rocket logo right
you know what sometimes I was doing in a
boxing I'm just really surprised and you
know what
congratulations AMD so to start with we
have the Radeon rx biggest 56 so like I
said this is going to be the cheaper
model it comes in at $400 it really is
aimed at the gtx 1070 you know at least
when those prices finally come back down
to earth anyway we've also got the new
Radeon flagship the RX Vegas 64 now this
is going to come in at $500 at least for
the base model and it is going to be
aimed at the GTX 1080 there are actually
three different designs of RX Vega right
now though so all the 56 cards should
come in this sort of black fairly basic
looking cooler of course this is a
reference design there will be different
versions at some point once you step up
to the limited edition what you're
getting here is a much much nicer
looking card at least in my opinion
so in pictures I feel like it doesn't
really do it justice but having that
full metal shroud actually does look
really nice both of these cards are
powered by a pair of 810 PCIe power
connectors and not only do they have the
GPU tach which is light up depending on
how much load the GPU is under but they
have the dual BIOS which as well as
three DisplayPort and a single HDMI port
there is also a liquid-cooled version of
Rx Vegas 64 but that's actually where
things start to get fairly confusing
even though it seems like they're just
three versions of these cards the
pricing gets very very complicated
well Vegas 56 is $400 in Vegas 64 $500
seem to be fairly reasonably priced the
big issue is it the crypto mining market
while that is declining is still causing
major problems for GPU m√ºller most mid
to high-end cards for both AMD and
NVIDIA nearly impossible to get your
hands on right now but the ones that you
can find are usually marked up now the
repair things are getting better but
there are a lot of cards that you cannot
get for MSRP right now the counter and
you're offering what are known as Radeon
packs so for $100 more you can get a
couple free games like pray and
Wolfenstein as well as discounts on PC
hardware
however those discounts are very
specific for example you can save $100
on our Rison seven and motherboard combo
or $200 on samsung freesync display if
you're building a very specific high-end
system this can make sense but for most
people it's just not a good deal
confusing things even farther is that if
you want to pick up Vegas 64 liquid you
have to get inside a pack which means
it's going to run you 700
I get that AMD are trying to make gamers
happy by offering them a specific bundle
that crypto miners probably aren't going
to be interested in but unless you are a
very specific person they really don't
make a lot of sense I feel like this is
a big experiment and Andy has hinted
that they're open to changing the
pricing on these bundles depending on
how well think so I can't say anything
today about how well Vega performs but I
can't say that Andy could really use a
big win right now the GTX 10 series has
been hugely successful not because
they're incredibly powerful but they're
also very power efficient that is a
dangerous combo so what do you guys
think about AMD Vega and how they've
handled the launch let me know in the
comments below and I will catch you on
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
