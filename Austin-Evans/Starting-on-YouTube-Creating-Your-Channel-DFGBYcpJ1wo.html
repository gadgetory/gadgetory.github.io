first in my new series of videos showing
you how to entirely set up your YouTube
channel make videos the whole deal so
guys I have been really fortunate I've
had a lot of success on YouTube I almost
have 5,000 subscribers I frequently get
more than 10,000 views a day guys that's
just fantastic and really it's all
thanks to you guys I mean if it weren't
for you I'd just be making videos and
not just be talking to a camera while
still talking to a camera but you guys
get you guys know what I mean so I
really feel like it's about time I give
back to you guys I really want to help
you guys with something I think I know
at least some about how to create your
own YouTube channels so guys YouTube is
a fantastic place to be right now
YouTube is just going up and up and up
and up and it is a perfect place for
creativity and just I mean almost
anybody if you know what you're doing
almost anybody with the camera can go
ahead and make videos on YouTube and get
big now goes I mean I'm not saying that
you know guys anybody can also be as big
as you know Shane Dawson or you know
Fred or something like that I mean
that's a little bit much but still it's
not you know too hard to believe you can
if you really are passionate about it if
you really know what you're talking
about then you really know how to make
great videos it's not a stretch to
believe that you can be really really
successful hopefully quite a bit more
successful than I am so guys I mean what
you're going to go ahead and start this
entire series I'll be talking about
literally as many details as much as I
can to help you guys Chris channels make
your videos try to get your videos more
views how to get subscribers literally
as much stuff as I can to help you guys
out and really creating your own
channels so let's start from the
beginning and let's decide what kind of
videos you want to make so this is not
something that you know you can only
make my kind of video whatever
absolutely not there is so much
different things that you can go ahead
and do so just guys it really is going
to come down to what do you know about
what do you like for me I'm a huge nerd
so I like to talk about tech and
something I like to do I'd like to talk
about to people about tech anyway so
it's just
the natural extension that I want to go
ahead and make youtube videos about it
the guys there is so much more than just
making tech videos um so what i really
suggest is to think about what you're
good at
okay everybody is good at something you
know so like I said for me
I know ton about tech I always read
about it and everything so you know I
make the videos but guys you likely are
probably good at something else so maybe
you're really funny so maybe you might
want to make comedy videos like scared
something of that maybe you like you
know paying attention to the news you
can be a reporter you can actually
report news on YouTube that's great
maybe you know you're like doing makeup
and that kind of stuff there's a huge
market for making no makeup tutorials
not kind of stuff so guys really the sky
is almost the limit here as long as you
really know what you're talking about as
long as it's something that you're
passionate about you can absolutely make
a channel about it so guys once you've
decided whatever it is and of course you
don't absolutely have to you know lock
it down to one specific thing so for
example taking me for example I first
started doing strictly iPhone app
reviews that's fine it was in it work
pretty well but I decided I want to
branch out so I'm gonna head and went
out to pretty much anything that has to
do with tech so of course now I do
tutorials I do all kinds of you know put
news all everything so really you don't
have to pick one thing and stick with it
forever so if you decide you know you
start doing maybe that comedy video so
you know you start by you know doing
skits everything and also you might want
to expand out to something else or make
it a larger broader audience by all
means go for it but guys it does help
when you first started to have at least
a decent focus on some thing you want to
do so maybe whatever it is just go ahead
and pick out that specific thing that
you want to focus on you can expand out
and do whatever you want later but as
long as you happening of something that
you do plan on doing so now that you
know what you're wanting to do your
videos on of course this doesn't have to
be a snap decision you know you can
spend a little time you know thinking
about it now it's time to go ahead and
create your channel so some of you guys
might already have channels but what if
you you are going to want to go ahead
and create a brand new channel to go
ahead and start a video from scratch so
guys a very important thing and believe
me take it from me you need to get a
good name so guys the name is not the
most important thing
you look at some of the big youtubers
and some of them have kind of you know
stupids kind of sounding names obviously
my self occlude so guys absolutely
absolutely
pay attention to your name and really
think it over before you pick one so
really what kind of tends to be is make
it kind of professional sounding that's
a lot of times that will work so you
know maybe should do like Apple videos
on like the newest Apple news maybe like
Apple reporter or something whatever it
is I'm sure you know a lot of names are
taken but make it professional or make
it sound really you know like you've
spent more than five minutes thinking
about it so kind of almost considered
like a business if you're going to start
a business would you just go ahead and
make it me oh come up with a name and
you know go run with it in fact you're
two minutes for snot at least sleep over
it I mean sleep on it think about it for
a bit and then we'll pick out your name
and yes as long as it hasn't been taking
you should be good to go now that you
have the idea of what your videos are
going to be about and you have your
channel name all picked out now it's
time to go ahead and make your channel
background and layout now guys this
might not be the first thing you want to
do and if you guys want to go ahead and
skip the step and do it later I can
understand that but it does help them
you do have a nice channel layout so
guys there are a couple different ways
of doing this first of all is making
your own which is probably what most of
your going to do so guys this is my
channel this is I made this all myself
and well it's not that great but I'm not
I don't pretend to be know a whole lot
about no image editing and photoshop and
everything like that if you are good at
Photoshop I highly recommend make your
own you can make some really good ones
in Photoshop and if you don't know
exactly how to do it just you know look
up a tutorial like I said guys I'm not
that great so in each each what I would
give would probably be pretty terrible
but just look it up if you want to make
your own you know YouTube does have a
really really robust system I mean you
guys can do all kinds of stuff change
the font change the colors with pretty
much everything upload a background
image there's a ton of different things
you can do to make your channel really
pop so guys make your own or you can go
ahead and download a pre-built one so
guys there are several different ones
I'll have a link in the description to
my two design that's a great website
where you can download your own themes
they're 100% free and just download them
and use them um so guys if you want to
go ahead and just have a
pre-made theme maybe have someone make
you want or make yourself one at a later
date that's just fine but anyway I do
recommend go ahead get a theme set up go
ahead and make it customize it some or
just download a prebuilt one just kind
of get your channel all set up and
that's it for the first episode so guys
let's go ahead you can quickly recap
what I'll be covered so first we covered
deciding what your channel is going to
be about so you now you have a pretty
good idea of the theme of the channel
and generally what's going to be making
videos about you also now pick out your
channel name so hopefully it's a pretty
good name some things you know you won't
be embarrassed about me oh and you have
50,000 subscribers and lastly we have
your channel layout all design so
whether you just did it yourself or
you've had a pretty custom pre-built one
downloaded any rate you do now have the
groundwork all the basics are done so
guys next we're going to be covering the
videos so I'm going to talk about the
do's and don'ts as well as what kind of
equipment you need so that did like stay
tuned for part 2 should be coming very
soon anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
