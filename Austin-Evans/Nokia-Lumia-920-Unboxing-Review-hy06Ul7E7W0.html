here with a review of the Nokia Lumia
920 with Windows Phone 8 a unique build
and one of the best smartphone cameras
out there let's take a look pop open the
box and inside you'll see the phone
itself and a tool to eject your micro
SIM dig a little deeper and you'll find
an NFC demo tag extremely boring safety
info a Quick Start Guide and a little
smart set-up guide lastly you'll find a
micro USB cable for charging and syncing
along with the USB wall adapter to juice
the phone up it won't take you long to
see the Lumia sticks out from other
smartphones in a big way take down a
glossy yellow finish there's no doubt
its unique and I'm a big fan of how it
looks of course if you want something a
bit more tame it's available on other
much more boring colors including black
the Lumia is also a very big phone at
ten point seven millimeters thick and
weighing in at almost 50% more than the
galaxy s3 the overall size is quite
large as well with a footprint roughly
on par with the Nexus 4 but with a
smaller screen all that said I actually
really didn't mind the added heft is it
reminded me of the old indestructible
Nokia's with excellent build quality the
body is a single piece of polycarbonate
aka plastic and as its coloured all the
way through you don't have to worry
about scratches removing the finish up
front you'll find the 1.3 megapixel
front-facing camera which is capable of
720p video and your speaker grille and
below or the capacitive back windows and
search keys for some reason the screen
and buttons are offset quite a bit from
the bottom of the phone making the
entire front appear off-center up top is
the headphone jack and micro SIM slot
and on the right side is the volume
rocker sleep button in the dedicated
camera key which is nice to see on
bottom is your micro USB port for
charging and syncing along with the very
impressive speaker this is by far one as
a lot of speakers I've heard on a phone
in quite a while delivering enough
volume to fill a decently sized room
with music finally on back you'll see
the 8.7 megapixel camera and LED flash
which I'll get into in a minute it's
also compatible with the Qi wireless
charging standard and 18t is bundling a
free wireless charger with the Lumia
right now the screen is a 4.5 inch IPS
panel with a resolution of 1280 by 768
making it slightly wider than normal
720p phones and a huge step up from
older windows phones it is a bit smaller
than the 4.7 and 5 inch screens on most
smartphones today but you aren't losing
out on too much and it makes up for it
with 332 pixels per inch the display
itself is very nice with good black
levels and decent saturation both of
which are important with the live tiles
on when
phone the start of the show here is
definitely Windows Phone 8
just like the Lumia itself it's a very
different experience than your average
smartphone and it's easily one of the
sleekest and smooth this UI is out there
the home screen is all about live tiles
which do double duty is app icons and an
addict glance bit of info for example a
missed call or new tweet you can also
resize the tiles and rearrange them as
much as you'd like just like Windows 8
you can customize the colors the entire
OS but beyond that what you see is
basically what you get this is
definitely not a phone for people who
really like to customize as a Windows
Phone you'll find integration with
SkyDrive Office and Xbox Live Office is
included and is decent for viewing or
editing a word or excel doc on the go
but not much more than that
gaming was originally supposed to be a
strong suit of Windows Phones as you can
connect your xbox live gamertag and get
achievements from mobile games but the
selection is lacking you'll find a few
games like Angry Birds and Final Fantasy
but overall there really isn't much in
the store right now and support is a
little better you can find an app to do
most things but a lot of what you'll
find is really lacking in quality the
Google app isn't bad if you want to
avoid using Bing but it hasn't been
updated nearly eight months the Twitter
app is just terrible with constant
crashes however and the list goes on
that's not to say some apps aren't great
and basically enough Internet Explorer
really isn't bad just like the rest of
Windows Phone its buttery smooth most of
the time and is one of the fastest
mobile browsers out there SunSpider is a
great example of this it not just a
score which is able to clear the iPhone
5 in Nexus 4 you run into occasional
issues with fonts not rendering properly
but overall it's a really nice browser I
don't want to give the wrong impression
here Windows Phone 8 is a major step
forward and in some ways surpasses both
iOS and Android the big issue is the
lack of apps which hopefully will
improve now the Windows Phone and
Windows 8 share a lot of DNA but right
now it's far behind its main rivals the
camera on the other hand is the best
you'll find on a modern smartphone
period with eight point seven megapixels
and an LED flash to work with it might
not seem too great on paper but it has
one major advantage optical image
stabilization with tiny Springs inside
the lens to keep it steady this allows
the Lumia to deliver spectacular
low-light performance comparing it to
the iPhone 5 and Nexus 4 you can see
there's really no contest it pulls an
image is better than some point and
shoots in normal daylight the images are
quite nice as well although not a huge
improvement over ordinary smartphones
that optical image stabilization makes a
big difference for video so I'm walking
around on some pretty uneven
here and yet the camera keeps it nice
and smooth don't go ahead and bring it
down here for you guys you see that
1080p video looks really nice on lumia
920
inside you'll find the Lumia 920 is
powered by a 1.5 gigahertz Snapdragon s4
dual-core processor and one gigabyte of
RAM Windows Phone has always been fast
and this does a great job of making sure
the phone stays incredibly smooth the
Snapdragon s4 is starting to show its
age as the s4 pro has been released but
it's still an entirely competent
performer impressively the phone
includes 32 gigabytes of storage which
is generous considering the price call
quality is quite good on the AT&amp;amp;T
network with LTE onboard if you have in
your area you can expect impressive
speeds unfortunately it hasn't rolled
out here yet so I did my testing on
HSPA+ which can give you reasonable
speeds above 5 megabits per second
battery life was good enough in my
testing delivering enough juice to make
it through a day of moderate use thanks
to the 2000 milliamp hour battery the
Nokia Lumia 920 is easily one of the
most unique phones out there definitely
in a good way it looks and feels like
nothing else and Windows Phone 8 finally
delivers modern specs including a
dual-core processor an HD screen it's
incredibly smooth and the camera is
stellar
but nap support is severely lacking and
it is a big heavy phone it's not going
to be for everyone but for only $99 you
could do much much worse than the Lumia
920 you can check out more reviews of
