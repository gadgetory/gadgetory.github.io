look is the two latest DSLRs by Canon
the Rebel t3 and the t3i these new
cameras are now situated the low end of
canons DSLR line and both pack a lot of
brand new features so let's take a look
starting with the t3 you'll first find a
very attractive price point of $600
which includes the body as well as an 18
to 55 kit lens for the money you will
get a body that is very reminiscent of
the current t2 I however with a
downgraded 12.2 megapixel image sensor
and 720p video capabilities both of
these specs are down compared to what
its biggest competition should be the
Nikon d3100 which sports 14 megapixel
stills and 1080p video however specs
certainly aren't everything the t3 will
be on sale at the end of March
stepping up you'll find the Canon Rebel
t3i which looks to be a real powerhouse
it has the same excellent 18 megapixel
CMOS sensor from the current t2 I along
with the same 1080p video capture
however it brings a lot of additional
features for a video capture it looks
almost beat outlet Canon 60d including
digital zoom a wide variety of filter
effects and most importantly a brand new
flip out display which will be perfect
for video the t3i is available at the
beginning of march for eight hundred
dollars and a body only configuration or
for an extra $100 you can get it with an
included 18 to 55 kit lens the t2 I will
remain on sale and will slot between the
t3 and the t3 I personally I'm liking
the t3i a lot the t3 isn't particularly
bad but it looks to be more thoroughly
outshine by its bigger brother no doubt
will be all be seeing a lot more of the
t3i which I'm sure will 90% of major
YouTube reviewers will be using by
year's end sounds pretty good to me</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
