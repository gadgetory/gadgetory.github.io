video going over my top five city of
tweaks now there's a jailbreak for all
devices on the most recent from err
let's just go ahead and take a look at
some of my favorites to start us off
with we actually have a combination of
two tweaks so the first one is Infini
dog so as you guys can see here on my
dock I can scroll through here through
as many icons as I want
I had seven here but you could add quite
a few more so there's that but there's
also a combination of overflow
now overflow is what gives you this nice
little Cover Flow effect so as you guys
can see here as I scroll kind of gives a
nice little effect you see the little
icon appear and whatnot now these are
very customizable so for example as you
guys can see here I have five icons that
you can see at one time and there are
seven overall however you can customize
this however you want you do two three
five ten or whatever you feel like works
best for you
now infini dock and overflow each will
cost you $1 so it's a little bit pricey
just to kind of get you guys a nice
looking dog but in my opinion I think it
looks well worth the price the second
tweak is probably some things a lot of
longtime jail regulars will know and it
is SB settings
my husband's Eddings has probably been
my favorite jailbreak tweak for a couple
of years now and it's really simple to
know why so what it allows you to do if
forces is now in the Notification Center
on iOS 5 is it allows you to get access
to all kinds of very important system
toggles so for example I could turn on
airplane mode I can turn it off and get
quick access to brightness if I want I
can you know mess with that you have
access to all your data you can turn off
the location services you can go through
and see what apps are running free them
up and turn on and off sh-sh Wi-Fi etc
etc and if you scroll over here you have
a couple of options you see a little bit
about your IP address desk free ramp you
can also go ahead and respring or reboot
et cetera et cetera so SB settings in my
opinion is a must-have and it is free in
Cydia now this next week while
admittedly a little bit geeky is
definitely very very useful for a
jailbroken device it's called I file and
what it allows you to do is go through
your entire file system on your device I
know that a couple of reasons why you
would want this so the first one is and
this is really helpful for me is when
there's some kind of new theme or tweak
or whatnot and it's actually not in
Cydia and you need to install it
manually I file can help you gotta get a
good idea of where you need to put it
and whatnot and on top of that this is
also really helpful if you're having an
issue so sometimes there may be some
problem with your device so for example
there may be some kind of corrupt system
file or what have you and ordinarily
you're gonna have to try to install
sh-sh and go through get a client on
your computer and try to set it up right
and that may or may not work over with I
file for example if there's some kind of
problem or issue or whatever a lot of
times you can just open this up and fix
it I know this is free so I recommend if
you have a jailbroken device go ahead
and get it even if you never really use
it just have it there in case you need
it but beyond that you can't pay for it
if you do really enjoy it now this next
week is probably one of my favorites
that's seen a long time and it is called
zephyr now zephyr allows you to
multitask really simply and really
easily so for example ordinarily you
know if you want to multitask you have
to double tap the home button scroll
through your apps whatnot kind of little
bit of a pain hello little zephyr all
these do is swipe to the right and there
we go I'm in the next application same
thing goes if I wanna do it again keep
going I can go into Cydia now this is
really really nice you guys can see here
it's very smooth very fluid it does take
maybe like a half second maybe one
second before you can do the next thing
as it loads but it's about the same lag
as if you were actually you know
multitasking and whatnot and it's really
cool on top that you can also customize
so for example if you want to be one
finger you want do two fingers or
whatever make sure you don't
accidentally do it and now there's
another feature and actually just came
out in an update the other night and it
allows you to actually close apps just
by swiping up just can see there if I go
ahead and just open up I file again I
can be doing whatever I want
you know multitasking etc etc swipe
across and if I'm done and show and I'm
done so Zephyr is an absolutely awesome
tweak I highly recommend you pick it up
it is three dollars so it's a little bit
pricey but in my opinion it's worth
every cent of that last but certainly
not least we have dream board now dream
board if you guys been jailbroken for a
while it's very similar to a winter
board put on crack so if I open it up
here you guys will be able to see they
will open up a launcher now only had the
two themes installed and you can install
many many more just like with winter
board you has a little example of what a
theme is like so as you guys can see
here that quickly that simply we are now
running a very similar theme to Android
so you can scroll through all your
different apps and whatnot we can go
through all our programs of course just
being our apps
so let's just say we want to open up
compass and we can see that and if we
hit the home button it'll bring us right
back here so there's a lot of really
cool stuff here for example I can turn
on
animated weather change our background
wallpaper so if we want to change it
over here just and see it runs really
nice really smoothly just like you would
expect to normal you know iOS at to run
and let's say we're done with it we can
go ahead and tap this right here and
then come over here and it will bring us
right back to our iOS or indeed if you
wanted to switch to a different theme so
dream board is free and if you're
interested in customizing your device
it's definitely the ultimate it's very
simple and very easy and I think it's
just really an awesome tweak to have
that's gonna be about it for my top 5
City of tweaks I'm very curious to know
though how about you guys what's your
top 5 list definitely be sure to leave
that in the comment section below and if
you'd like to see more of course you can
take a look and share them with everyone
else in the comments and before I go I
do want to mention if you're interested
in this wallpaper indeed any of my
others that I usually upload feel free
to check it out I will have a link in
the description of this video if you
enjoyed this video definitely be sure to
leave it a thumbs up and if you're
