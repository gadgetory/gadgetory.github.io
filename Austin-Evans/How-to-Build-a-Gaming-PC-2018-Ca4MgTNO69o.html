sick but it's also sick is the PC that
we're about to build yes my friends is
2018 which means it is time for an all
new gaming PC build tutorial so as you
guys will probably be aware building a
gaming PC is not that difficult I like
to compare it to something I do an adult
Legos now I will be giving a full
tutorial on the photon 4.0 today so if
you guys want information about the
actual parts that I'm using as well as
the performance you guys can go check
out that video the idea here is it
pretty much anyone with an afternoon can
build yourself a computer before we get
started let me give you a quick tour of
the parts that we're going to be using
for the bill so any computer is going to
need a processor in this case a Rison
520 400 g now what's cool about this is
that not only does it handle the
processor but this also has integrated
graphics inside so even though I will be
showing you what it's like to install
graphics card with this build you don't
actually need one next we have the
motherboard so the idea here is that you
put the processor in here the memory in
here you connect the SSD pretty much
everything in the build will connect to
this in some way next we have RAM so you
can think of this is the short-term
memory of your computer every time you
open up an application it lives in this
this build is also using an SSD so this
is basically the same thing as a hard
drive it's where you store files and
programs and all that kind of stuff the
difference is is that SSDs while a
little bit more expensive are much much
faster in this one specifically is in
the smaller m2 form factor like I said
earlier this bill doesn't actually need
a graphics card but especially
rebuilding a higher-end gaming PC or
you're doing anything that's really
heavily reliant on 3d applications
how many graphics card is going to be a
big help the literal heart of any
computer is the power supply so this is
what takes the power from the wall and
provides it to all of the different
components inside your system last but
not least we have the case now cases are
actually pretty much dependent on your
style so every computer will need a
certain size of a case depending on how
many hard drives you're putting in what
size motherboard but a lot of this does
come down to your personal preference
and with this one we're going a little
bit stylized now any time you're
building a computer you do need to come
prepared with a wide variety of tools
depending on what situation comes up or
not actually the only thing you really
need is a Phillips screwdriver I'm not
kidding you can build an entire computer
with just a single screwdriver so now
that we've got all that stuff out of the
way the last
to do is find your workspace so
generally speaking I like to find a
decently sized table if you're gonna
have parts and cables and stuff kind of
all strewn out and make sure that you
don't build on carpet if you can avoid
it static electricity is the enemy of a
computer Bart
believe me hey well and then I'm going
to show that those are that can I'm an
expert it's fine just get you at home
don't build on carpet unless you're an
expert or Ken sells you else the first
step is to get the case out of the box
now even though we're actually not going
to be putting everything inside the case
as we go that will happen a little bit
later I still like getting the case out
of the box and ready to go so this is a
little bit of an unusual case it is the
Thermaltake core p1 the idea is that
because it has a giant tempered glass
window we're actually using it to show
off the build I will say that this might
not be the most beginner-friendly case
in the world concerning that we actually
have to put the case together and
usually just comes fully assembled out
of a box but let's see how it actually
is to build one quick case changed later
we have the BitFenix Phenom a case that
thankfully does not require 17 steps to
put it together so I'm going to be using
this for the tutorial even though the
main build I will eventually have to
rebuild into the other case but
especially just because I've got to
actually show you guys how to do it
things are going to be much much more
common in this case versus the other one
where you're going to be doing a lot of
weird mounting and whatnot this is just
going to make everything a lot easier
the first step is to remove the four
thumb screws on the back of the case
which will allow us to remove both the
left as well as the right side panels
now we mostly need to do this to
actually be able to get a little more
access to the case but with that open we
can see that there's actually a fair bit
of room inside this generally speaking
bear cases are easier to work on and as
you get smaller and more sort of custom
it gets a little bit more challenging
but the good thing is pretty much all of
them do have a very similar layouts
usually you'll find a box full of
hardware so we can open this guy up
later but she's had some screws and some
random bits and pieces that will need a
little bit later on if you're coming on
back we will see where the power supply
is installed now cases will put this in
different locations sometimes it's gonna
be up top but with this one it's going
to be in the bottom for all we need to
do here is just remove the four thumb
screws to keep this little bracket in
place so going back to my analogy about
this being the heart of the system it
really does sort of provide power to
basically all of our components now
power supplies will come in different
sizes they will be more or less powerful
than
the day they are very simple there are
two major types of power supplies
modular and non modular so this is a
stay tuned on modular supply which means
that all of our cables that we're going
to need come Priya attached however
higher in power supplies typically do
come modular which will allow you to
actually plug in each cable that you
want basically making it a little bit
cleaner inside your build so you don't
have a bunch of extra cables hanging
around before installing this guy take
note of where the fan is so depending on
your case this will either be facing up
or will be facing down so with this guy
it's going to be facing down because
they have this little mesh here the
important thing is always make sure
there's some ventilation you can't put
this sort of like face down like a table
or face down like a flat piece of metal
otherwise it will overheat and bad
things will happen inside the power
supply box you should find four screws
and this is how we're going to mount the
power supply to the bracket which will
then go attached to the chassis and in
that all cases will actually do this so
sometimes you can completely ignore the
bracket in cases will have you mount
this directly onto the case one thing to
keep in mind is that when you're
tightening things down start on one
corner and then move to the opposite
corner to make sure that you're applying
even pressure so I'll do this screw then
I do the one on this corner and then
I'll do the final two so with the power
supply installs the next step is to set
this guy off to the side and grab our
motherboard like it was saying earlier
the motherboard is pretty much what
everything in the computer connects to
so there are a few things that you need
to keep in mind obviously pick a
motherboard that is going to be
compatible with your processor but the
size is also important so as you guys
can see here this guy is pretty small
this is what's known as a mini ITX board
now this is happens to be a mini ITX
case which all works out you can go with
a smaller motherboard in a bigger case
but obviously not the reverse so
something like a micro ATX or a full
sized ATX motherboard would not fit in
your case so you're going to go pick one
of these guys out make sure it supports
the correct processor and make sure that
your case will actually be able to fit
it now anytime you see an exposed
circuit board like this you want to be a
little bit careful especially a stack
electricity so it comes in this
anti-static bag and when you grab it
trying to grab onto the actual board so
something like one of the metal pieces
should be fine and once you pull it out
I like to actually set it on top of the
motherboard box so even a small
motherboard like this is going to have a
ton of different sockets and cables and
connectors all over the place but you
only need to pay attention to a few of
them that you're actually going to use
in the system some of the most important
things is where you install your
processor
so Intel and AMD do this slightly
differently it's pretty much always
going to be a gray socket in the middle
the next thing you'll find are your den
slots so every motherboard is going to
be a little bit different here this
board has two however some have four or
even eight this is where you're going to
install your memory and the only thing
to really watch out for here is to make
sure that you do have the correct Ram so
this like most modern motherboards are
going to support ddr4 however older
systems will use something called ddr3
or even all the way back to ddr2 all
very similar to install just make sure
you get the right kind below the
processor is going to be your PCI
Express slot so since this is such a
small motherboard well you only have the
one however a lot of motherboards will
have four or even seven now this is
going to be where you're going to
install various different adding cards
typically speaking it's going to be a
graphics card but sometimes you might
install an SSD here maybe like a video
card maybe a Ethernet adapter depends on
what you're doing but that is going to
be where you're going to install a lot
of different adding cards move down to
these small rectangular connectors and
this is what is called a SATA port now
SATA ports can be used for a couple
different things typically speaking it's
going to be either for an SSD or for a
hard drive but if you're still
old-school and rocking an optical drive
that will also plug into the SATA port
right beside that is our 20+4 pin power
connector now this is what supplies the
main power to the motherboard as well as
a lot of it to the processor to the
graphics all that kind of stuff this is
going to be the biggest cable that
you're going to plug in from the power
supply and usually it's going to be
mounted on one of the sides of the board
for easy access now in the top corner
here you're going to find our four plus
four pens CPU power now motherboards can
be a little bit different here some only
have four pens whereas this one does
have eight it's basically the same thing
because pretty much all power supply is
you're going to have a lead that will
either do four eight but this is what
supplies power to your processor
something a little bit unusual on this
board is where the m2 slot is so this is
where you're going to install higher-end
SSDs like we're using for this build and
typically you're going to find it
somewhere on the actual board itself
over on this guy it's actually going to
be here on the back spend the whole
thing around and this is where the rear
i/o lives now these are all going to be
all the ports they're going to be
sticking out the back of your case so
once you install your i/o shield you're
gonna pretty much be able to see it's
something a little bit like this
speaking of now is as good a time as any
to actually install this guy so it's
just a little piece of metal and the
only thing you need to do is make sure
that you're going to be doing it in the
correct orientation so for this guy
we're going to be putting it
and this guy's pretty easy to install so
what I need to do is line it up and
press it pretty firmly until it clicks
into place now you want to make sure
that this is all the way into place as
if it's slightly not quite correct
what's gonna happen is your motherboard
is not going to line up correctly and
that's just going to be a huge hassle so
if you ever have any problems with that
just make sure that this guy is fully in
also as we'll talk about in a minute
you'll see all these little metal pins
that are all over the place
make sure that these are pulled back
when you install the board the next step
is to install our processor so in this
case we're going with u Rison v 2400 g
but generally speaking it's going to be
very similar regardless of whether
you're using AMD or Intel so like I was
saying with the motherboard you want to
be very careful when you're handling
stuff like this and especially so when
you're talking about our processor so in
the back here if I open it up you'll be
able to see it there are lots of little
tiny gold pins do not touch these if any
of them get bent you're gonna be in
serious trouble the best way to handle
this guy is just to grab it from the
sides and hold it by the edges actually
installing the CPU is pretty
straightforward so if you come down to
the socket what you're going to see is
there's a little metal arm here that's
going to be their attention arm so we
pull that back and all the way forward
we're good to install the processor and
there's going to be a little metal notch
it's going to be on every single
processor which will tell you which side
to line it up with so once you do just
say gently down into the socket pull the
arm all the way down and that is all
ready to go the next step is to install
our CPU cooler now this is an area where
pretty much every single one is going to
mount in a different way so
unfortunately you will probably have to
dive into your instruction manual to see
exactly how to mount yours thankfully
though if you're using a stock Intel or
an D cooler they're not too difficult to
install the main thing to keep in mind
is that there's going to be pre applied
thermal paste here you do not want to
touch this as this is what's going to
make a solid contact between the
heatsink and your processor when it
comes to the am4 socket which is what
Rison uses you're going to want to
remove these two brackets that hold the
little plastic pieces into place once we
undo that we're free to install the
heatsink so they're going to be four
little screws here that you're going to
want to line up and when you do this
make sure that you actually set it down
smoothly so you basically want all that
thermal paste to make solid contact with
the processor don't try to like you know
put it off to one side or the other try
to get it down as smoothly and evenly as
possible making sure that all of your
screws are lined up then you just want
to tighten them down and the main thing
here is just like I was saying earlier
you want to do it in a cross pattern so
tighten that one a little bit then come
to the opposite corner tighten that one
down just a little bit come over here
and do this process until you get this
guy all the way locked down all right so
with that we should be able to pick up
the entire motherboard by the cooler and
it looks like everything went in pretty
well now the next step is to actually
plug in the fan so this is going to be
using a four pin fan header so you see
there going to be two little tiny
notches there basically that just means
that you can't plug it in the wrong way
so in this board we have our fan header
right here and simple is lining it up
and plugging it all the way in next up
it's time to install our memory so ram
is actually very straightforward to
install so the only thing you need to do
is like I was saying earlier make sure
that if you're using a ddr4 system use
ddr4 you're using ddr3 make sure that
you're using ddr3 the easiest way to
make sure that you're using the correct
memory is that there's a little notch
it's going to be about two-thirds of the
way down so in ddr4 that's going to line
up with the correct slot on the
motherboard it doesn't line up you're
probably using the wrong kind of memory
all you need to do is line it up slide
in and then with equal pressure on both
sides just press it down until you get
the click then we just repeat that with
the other dim and we're gonna be good to
go and so with that our motherboard is
actually pretty much good to go
so the next step is going to be
installing this entire contraption
inside of our case depending on your
case the motherboard is going to be
installed in a couple different ways so
most of the time it's going to live in
this sort of vertical section here
however with this guy we're going to
place it right down here so if we dig
through the little box of hardware that
comes with our case we should see a bag
of screws now we're going to need four
of these to mount the motherboard inside
now sometimes the case will actually
require you to install the standoffs so
you can see that these are already going
to be here if so make sure that you just
screw them all the way into place well
with this guy we just need to drop the
motherboard into place screw it in and
we're going to be good to go because
this case is so small it's actually not
that hard to get the motherboard lined
up so we just need to get it sort of
roughly in the right position right here
and then if we move it around to this
side we're going to make sure that all
these ports are actually going to come
through the i/o shield so this is going
to require a little bit of wiggling to
make sure that it's gonna line up
correctly but as long as it's on all
four of the standoffs which it pretty
much is we're good to screw it into
place it's a little hard to see on
camera but there are four screw holes on
each corner of the motherboard
to use to tighten it into place and
something you should definitely keep in
mind is that before you tighten
everything down make sure that
everything is lined up correctly
remember that whole thing about make
sure that you line up the motherboard
correctly so you don't have to
accidentally undo everything you should
also make sure that if there's any weird
parts on the bottom of the motherboard
that you have those installed before
everything is screwed into place so
normally the next step will be to
install a standard SATA SSD however this
time we're going to go with an m2 Drive
now especially with this specific WD blu
drive there's really no major difference
in performance the main difference is
that this is a much much smaller drive
which makes it easier to install
especially because it takes up less room
in your case stalling the drive is
pretty straightforward just need to line
it up with the connectors here making
sure that it rests all the way in there
and then we take that little screw that
we pulled out of it and that is going to
be either a tension mechanism to make
sure that this SSD doesn't go flying out
of your system if you're installing a
standard hard drive SSD or optical drive
in your system that's also pretty simple
to install so we look over here they're
going to be two connectors the smaller
one is going to be for data and the
bigger one is going to be for power so
every case will do this a little bit
differently so you can see they have
these little drive rails that you can
install not only a big three and a half
inch desktop hard drive in but also
something smaller like this laptop hard
drive so you're gonna want to mount it
to there and then for actual cabling is
very straightforward so you dig through
the massive power supply cables you're
going to find this long flat guy there's
a little notch on went in so it's only
going to go in one way all we need to do
is just connect this to our hard drive
once that's into place it doesn't really
click or anything it just slides right
in I'm going to want to find one of
these SATA data cables that come with
your motherboard again this guy's not
just it's only going to go in one way
and if we line that notch up it will
click into place and then you just plug
this end into your motherboard and you
have your fully up and running hard
drive or SSD for this video though no
more this we're going with our
upside-down and to drive that I totally
remember to install now something else
that most gaming builds do although we
actually don't need it for this system
is installing a graphics card so this is
going to be pretty straightforward what
we're going to be doing is using the PCI
Express slot that's going to be on the
bottom of the board
this one's metal most of them are
plastic but it doesn't really make a
difference and then what you want to do
is look around to the back of the case
and this is where we're going to get our
video outs so essentially just like the
she'll protects all those little ports
on the motherboard this is going to be
where you're going to get your video out
such as DisplayPort and HDMI so if we
remove the stun screws we should get
this little bracket out of the way we're
gonna hold onto that for right now but
what we don't need are these two little
metal pieces right here so this is just
a cover to keep your PCI covers from
getting dirty or anything getting inside
your system if you're installing
graphics card can get those out of the
way and now we install the actual
graphics card so ordinarily when you're
installing a graphics card you measure
to see that it will actually fit in your
case or not with this particular case it
doesn't quite fit which is fine because
we're not using a graphics card in this
system but if we were it would go in
right about here what this really means
is I just need to remove these drives so
it doesn't matter because we're not
using them anyway but that's gonna free
up the space to install a graphics card
which if we just line it up with the
slot it's going to go in a little bit
something like this now all you do is
press it down until it slams into place
that was a little bit more violent than
I expected however that is premature
always do to get it plugged in now we
actually need to use the power cables to
make sure that it has plenty of juice to
run all the crispy crispy 4k games that
we were going to throw at it if I wasn't
gonna take it out immediately after I
show you guys how to do this some
graphics cards especially lower end ones
don't require any additional power so
can pull everything it needs from the
motherboard but most higher end ones
this Radeon Vega 56 included need a
couple of these six plus two pink
connectors so all you do is just line up
the connectors and plug them in and then
we're gonna be good to get this guy up
and running it might look pretty
bare-bones that's because it is very
very simple and clean inside however
this is all the components that we need
to make our system work the next step is
the fun one connecting all these
wonderful cables and wires all over the
place to get this guy actually
operational so we actually only need two
sets of cables from our system so we
need the four plus four CPU power
connector which will go straight into
the motherboard we're also going to need
our 20 plus 4 pin connector which also
will go into the motherboard now this is
going to be a big fat guy and usually I
like to start with it because it's sort
of the most unwieldy cable to actually
connect all I need to do is line it up
and make sure that it clicks all the way
into place and that's gonna be it for
these 20+4 pin
now the next step is the CPU power cable
which is also going to be pretty easy so
I can find where it went this one's
going to be hard to see but all you need
to do is line it up with the little four
plus four pin connector on the
motherboard corner plug it all the way
in and you're gonna be good now it's
time to install the fan so this guy has
a fan right back here and it uses a
three pin fan header very similar to
what we used for the CPU cooler again
this guy has notches so it's going to
plug into the fan header on the
motherboard only one way now for most
cases you're going to find a ton of
different front panel connectors
dangling somewhere from the front
however on the BitFenix case we actually
have all of them attached to the side
panel now this makes things a little bit
cleaner because you can have the buttons
on the side but it makes a little bit
more annoying when you're building the
computer because that way you have to
kind of hold this high panel in place
while you run all of your cables so this
might look like a lot but it's actually
not too crazy so the big guy is going to
be our USB 3.0 header so only thing you
have to watch out for is that there's a
little notch on this guy when you plug
it in make sure it's all the way in I
definitely pulled these guys out and had
this entire plastic beads come with it
now beside that we're going to get all
of our front panel connectors I'll
explain how to do these in a second but
essentially that's what we need this
manual for a lot of little fiddly stuff
and then we have our audio so these are
going to be our audio connectors to make
sure that the headphone and the
microphone jack work upfront this guy's
we really straight forward we're going
to plug it in here when the only things
that this case doesn't have is a USB 2.0
header so that's going to look very
similar to something like this you can
tell that how the audio and USB headers
are installed because out of all 10 pins
they're each gonna have one knocked out
so again you can't install it the wrong
way last but not least you want to grab
all these little tiny front panel
connectors so this is where it's going
to be very important to take a look at
that manual to figure out the diagram of
where each thing gets plugged in as
every motherboard does it a little bit
differently so something important to
note is if you look on the bottom here
there's a little tiny arrows that denote
the positive versus the negative that is
very important as when you go to say I
don't know plug your power button in and
you put it backwards you're gonna hit it
and nothing's gonna happen just make
sure that all these connectors are put
in the correct way now this might not
look like a completed system but before
we start doing cable management and
close the case up and make sure that
everything is ready to go first we need
to do a test boot to make sure that we
didn't make a horrible horrible mistake
along the way so once you have your
monitor mouse and keyboard ready all you
do is hit the power button and hope that
everything works
hey we have fans spinning the rear fan
is spinning now when we actually get it
to post USB is up and yes alright so
that means that we've pretty much done
everything correctly the next step
that's actually getting the BIOS and
make sure that all of our memory SSD all
that kind of stuff is showing up
correctly alright and it looks like
everything is showing up so it shows AMD
Rison 520 400 G shows our 16 gigabytes
of memory we also do see that our 500
gigabyte SSD is showing up so from this
point what's left to do is to turn off
the computer unplug everything and then
we just need to do a little bit more
cable management to you know make sure
that the side panel will go on the case
but once we've done that we have a fully
operational computer throw a copy of
Windows on the sky install your drivers
and you're gonna have a fully
operational gaming PC if you guys want
to see how the photon 4.0 performs and
what the original case was supposed to
look like feel free to go check out the
video over here if you enjoyed
definitely be sure to subscribe to the
channel anyway guys thank you so much
for watching and I'm gonna go get some
sleep because I've been working on this
