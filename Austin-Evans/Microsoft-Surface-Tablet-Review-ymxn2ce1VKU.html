here with a review of the Microsoft
Surface RT tablet it's a tablet that
tries very hard to be a laptop it's
undoubtedly unique but is it any good
the first thing that pictures don't show
you is that the surface is big put it in
portrait orientation and it almost feels
like a joke compared to tablets like the
Nexus 7 up front you'll find a ten point
six inch screen with a resolution of
1366 by 768 which matches most Windows
laptops it's certainly not a Retina
display but the saturation and black
levels are top notch below the display
there's a capacitive Windows button
which works like the Windows key and
you'll find a pair of 1 megapixel
cameras capable of 720p video front and
back which are very average for a tablet
the rear camera is tilted downward which
takes a bit of getting used to but
seriously don't take pictures with a
tablet running down the port's along the
left side you'll find a volume rocker
and headphone jack and on the right is
the charging port USB 2.0 and micro HDMI
the USB port is interesting as you can
plug an absurd amount of stuff into the
surface which I demoed in a recent video
around back you'll see the tablet is
made out of what Microsoft calls vapor
mg which feels mostly like aluminium the
cake stand is an important part of the
surface is it allows you to use it like
a laptop it feels very well built and
closes with a nice snap but it's not
adjustable it works well when you're
using the surface at a desk but without
being able to adjust it it can be
awkward to use much at the time hidden
behind the kickstand is a micro SD card
slot which supports cards up to 64
gigabytes speaking of specs the surface
RT is powered by a quad-core NVIDIA
Tegra 3 processor clocked at 1.3
gigahertz along with 2 gigabytes of RAM
performance is impressive as Windows RT
runs extremely smoothly practically
everywhere in the OS about the only time
you run into slowdowns is when the RAM
is filled up which isn't too hard to do
with four or five internet explorer tabs
which point the tablet slows down
considerably the surface RT runs Windows
RT which is Windows 8 for ARM processors
there are pluses and minuses to this for
example battery life is excellent with
between 6 to 9 hours on a charge and a
slim nine point four millimeter frame on
the flipside you lose that on a lot of
processing power even the quad core
Tegra 3 pales in comparison to a core i3
laptop which makes a huge difference
with heavy lifting like gaming and photo
and video editing the biggest downside
is the fact that you lose all
compatibility with legacy windows apps
no Google Chrome no battlefield 3 and no
Photoshop are available on the surface
RT this isn't entirely a downside
as many apps will be ported over to the
Windows Store which is the only way to
get ads but it's still something to keep
in mind if you're planning on picking up
the surface is a laptop replacement
that's the thing
throw in the magnetic type cover and
that's basically what you have here a
tablet doing its best to be a laptop in
some ways it does a great job you've got
all-day battery life a USB port to use a
hard drive card reader or anything else
along the keyboard and trackpad that you
can fold away into the space of a tablet
you'll find Flash support in the browser
and office built-in along with the
traditional desktop but then you'll
realize that app support is starting
from zero and Windows RT is clearly a
1.0 release in the illusion shatters at
times the surface feels like a glimpse
into the future right up until your
fingers get tired to the lesson
spectacular keyboard or smartphone
internals the price is really where it
hits home the surface RT starts at $499
for 32 gigabytes however you basically
need the touch cover to get everything
out of it which brings your total to
$5.99
compare that with $399 for the nexus 10
and $499 for the iPad 4 and you end up
with something that isn't a great tablet
and isn't a great laptop it's a
respectable compromise that some people
will love but for me I feel like it's
not quite there yet once the app
ecosystem gets flushed out and Windows
RT gets sorted the surface could be
spectacular but right now it just isn't
feel free to check out more videos on
the surface here and hit that like
button if you enjoyed anyway guys I will
catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
