of updates no I don't do update videos
very often but there's a lot of stuff
going on I figure it's about time go
ahead and let you guys all know about it
so there's a couple big things the first
of which is that I'm going to be going
to Las Vegas Nevada
next week early next week and I'm going
to be at CES all week long and this is
going to be really really exciting I
can't wait if you guys don't want CES is
it's the Consumer Electronics Show it is
pretty much the biggest event for you
know tech of the year I mean it's gonna
be brand new tablets and we're gonna be
a bunch of tablets trust me tablets have
some phones that are gonna be TVs that
are gonna be I mean you name it anything
tech that you can imagine I mean
literally anything you can imagine it
will be there see yes and I'm gonna be
there the whole time I've already got a
lot of stuffs lined up are you meeting
with companies going to press
conferences it's gonna be a really just
amazing time I can't wait to go Steffan
guys keep a lookout for that I will be
posting and that helps ensure if you
guys are interested in that you know
just just let me know but I'm thinking
I'm probably going to be doing maybe
like a vlog for about a week or so just
showing you guys you know Las Vegas a
little bit and showing you you know I'm
here and they're just kind of behind the
scenes stuff and of course I would be to
posting moving immunity videos of all
the hands on of you know the tablets and
the phones and all the kinds of cameras
and all the kind of cool stuff that you
would expect to see so yeah guys if
you're a student applause let me know
I'm not entirely sure how I haven't
thought through that well but I think
I'll probably do at least something kind
of show you guys what it's like to be at
CES not cut stuff this is my first time
going so I'm really looking forward to
it anyway there's a couple other things
I also would like to mention myself as
well as Matt to mentis which you guys
can go ahead and check him out in the
description below or working on a
Windows app for me now this is I know a
lot of people bask hey why don't you
have an iPhone app you know and I do
plan on doing that eventually but learn
working on right now what we're working
on he's doing most for is a Windows app
so if you have a Windows computer fairly
soon I don't have an exact date it's
still in development we're still adding
features everything like that but you'll
be able to download an app and of course
I'll make a video and yell it's ready
you'll be able to download an app and go
ahead and check out state of jailbreak
you know check out all the you know the
information about jailbreaking you can
watch all my latest videos if you miss
one you can check that out you have a
direct link new I can actually go ahead
and watch anytime I'm live on d3 live
you'll be able to see that you'll be
able to follow me on Twitter there's are
going to be a bunch of really cool
things that we're working on should be a
really cool package now do keep in mind
that this is not going to be you know a
super full-featured app you know there's
going to be the basics but hopefully a
lot of you guys will enjoy it you notice
that happen to be open a bunch of tabs
find a bunch of different stuff you'll
be you know a little bit unique you will
have some good things in there so I'm
not really sure when it will be done is
still like I said in development we get
it it's pretty well it's pretty
good-looking right now but there's still
a lot some more polish and new features
that we want to add so whatever it's
done it could be done I'm giving me to
you hey but it will be done fairly soon
I'll go ahead and show you guys and
let's download it I know the last thing
I want to talk about is my setup now she
doesn't tends been a great year I really
do want to give you all a huge thank you
for I mean I've got almost 13,000
subscribers now we'll just pretty
amazing considering that thing the
beginning of the year I had only about a
thousand so huge huge growth and I
really really appreciate all the support
and so what I'm doing is I'm doing my
best to make she doesn't 11 an amazing
year I'm really really really just
pumped about next year so the first
thing I'm gonna do obviously is going to
CES and he puts tons of amazing videos
of all kinds of you know great tech
everything but I'm also going to be
changing my entire step look at myself
and brand new camera and I'm actually
not gonna spoil what it is but it's a
really nice camera I'll be getting it
probably towards the end of the week
I'll take it to CES of course I'm also
going ahead and working on a brand new
setup so better lighting better camera
better audio better everything better
set up I'm not gonna get a green screen
but I will get a better backdrop for my
videos or anything so guys definitely
keep a look out my videos are gonna be
much much better quality I hope you guys

probably forgetting a couple of things
but anyway guys just wanna let you know

might be it for Mac and Linux
