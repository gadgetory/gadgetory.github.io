YouTube was that kind of a funny story I
really wasn't planning on it but what
really was watching a lot of other
people and since I just got my ipod
touch up at your 8 she'd wanted this Red
River mine hand in reviewing some iPhone
apps on of course black first started I
was terrible I really didn't have
anything to go off on I just had a
microphone from I stole from rock band
and I had my ipod touch which I used for
screenshots um but I put it all together
I recorded it and narrated you know what
I thought about the apps I'm gonna put
it up on YouTube and people started to
like it which no idea why because they
were really terrible however it was my
start and I'm very very thankful that I
really did stick with it my channel
really has evolved and the time I've
been on YouTube on CLR first started I
was pretty much solely working on iPhone
app reviews slowly it kind of went into
a little bit of news maybe a couple of
screen guests don't firm about a year
ago I decided that you know what just
forget it I'm gonna go ahead and just
report on whatever I want
that's what my channels always been
about from the start videos that I'm
interested in I'm big into video games a
big into tech and so it just makes sense
that what head and make videos about the
stuff that I like now of course YouTube
will just didn't happen overnight
I honestly probably worked for close to
a year before I really started getting
these sort of recognition of course but
I think I really it was about a year boy
he deserved a recognition it was really
hard in the first and
2030 videos where you put it up you know
you're all eager and then I really just
didn't get to use and I've been getting
comments don't really care which was you
know is really you know kind of
disappointing if you spend so much time
and effort on video in the way Lily you
know pay the Benjamin watches it now
over I was very fortunate to have some
really good friends who helped promote
my channel I really helps me get off the
ground and before I knew it I was
starting to get Neil but 10 News starts
running into 50 be used or 10 turning
into 100 views now I'm turning into tens
and even hundreds of thousands of views
which I just think is amazing in my time
making videos I've definitely got a lot
of mannerisms and a lot of things I do
on every video hey guys hey guys hey
guys thanks for watching thanks for
watching thanks for watching probably
one of the biggest things I get
commented on on YouTube is my hair so if
you watch a lot of my more recent videos
I actually got in front of the camera
you'll see that my hair gets shorter and
longer and shorter longer but one
recurring thing through all of my
comments is get a haircut
I'll it person's really annoyed me you
know I didn't I didn't see any reason
but of course going through back through
some of my older videos I definitely do
see it was pretty well pretty crazy but
that's just the way I roll my first
ideas in retrospect definitely was the
whiteboard so back a few months ago I
was looking for something to make my
videos pop just a white wall and I was a
boring backdrop for since I didn't
really have a computer or nor a great
screen I really couldn't do anything
like that so I decided that hey good
idea to take a whiteboard turn off a
bunch of pictures of Teck pasted on
their set beside me and do some videos
yeah
pretty obviously that was not a great
idea and it definitely looks pretty
pretty stupid from looking back
are the more notable things I'm known
for in YouTube definitely is jewelry
I've made a lot of children tutorial
however the first time I Jill bro I
almost never even tried it so this is
back on you know how to years ago or so
and I was really afraid to G open my
brand-new I once I heard a lot of bad
things and I'm freaking very close to
doing it only barely decided to go ahead
and take the plunge of course I've never
looked back since but it's kind of funny
to think that for all the Jill ranking
news and tutorials I do I was so afraid
I almost didn't do it the very first
time I'm very proud of what the t3 live
and become now of course I've done live
strains before I started doing live
streams quite a while back however it's
only recently that I decided then hey it
might be good it actually made me know a
weekly thing and thanks it's actually
really funny how to started I was Lily
just had the idea I figured hey I want
to strive doing is some sort of weekly
lies string whatever put it on YouTube
well the way it worked was I was just
that wasn't a live stream and I asked
everybody well what do you think about
the idea rule of literally within 15
minutes everyone who helped me to pick a
name work the format out pick out what
we were going to talk about and think he
missed at Brian just mentioned it we
were already filming episode 1 of d3
drive I get team to be really impressed
and really grateful how much everyone
likes it I mean every week I get
messages when people who say that can't
calm or people who either like I can't
wait d3 live people who sit and wait
into the chatroom for our board starters
I mean it really is just amazing to me
that how much the community is really
enjoyed deeply live I have some good
things a blast to do it I can plan on
doing it for a very very long time net
that hit 10,000 subscribers I really
think that that's like one of the
biggest milestones that I've ever hit on
my channel you know that was something
that I really was
for my first turn my channel I was like
eh a dozen subscribers that would be
great
now that hit it that's kind of just been
saying I never thought that I would
really be able to pull it off I never
thought that I would get millions of
views all this stuff is just so amazing
I just can't just believe it it's like
it's like a dream job I mean I've all I
have to do is get up walk over make a
youtube video about something that I'm
interested you know and maybe talking
about something to help people you know
man do I do I spend a lot of time
answering comments and everything but I
think it's absolutely worth it YouTube
is so fantastic there's so many great
people all those people who subscribe to
me to comment on my videos who I
actually get to interact with on a daily
basis every time I post a new video it's
just a great great overall experience
I'm so pleased that my making 10,000
subscribers so really there's no reason
to break tradition anyway guys thanks
