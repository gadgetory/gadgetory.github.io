building the ultimate sleeper gaming PC
and it's all thanks to our friends at
Intel for sponsoring this madness the
rules are very simple we have today
which right now it is 10:40 a.m. to
build an entire sleeper gaming PC and
what does that mean well first of all we
want to find the oldest the most bays
retro-looking chassis we can and load it
up with some properly high-end stuff
we're talking a ninth gen core i7
high-end graphics opt a memory the
entire deal the main idea here is that
we have to have an overkill gaming PC
that looks like it's something from 1999
right like I don't want from the outside
there's no RGB there's no like huge
exhausts or anything like that like this
should look like some old like Windows
XP system but inside it can handle all
the latest games editing whatever we
want to actually throw at it we may want
to go for an ITX supplied but until we
find the case I don't want to commit to
that because I take supplies are more
expensive and generally not yeah well I
should this one's not so bad so we've
got let's go Wi-Fi built in as well as
we can
Oh does it have obtained though I did
support octane okay excellent
let's go ITX we've got I've got the
smallest cooler I can find let's get a
core i7 let's get our obtained I'm just
afraid that 1050 is not gonna be enough
power we need this to be awesome but
it's so hard to pick unless we were able
to find like a properly big old case if
we do I don't think it'll be a problem
but I'm just so nervous like I don't
want to commit to something like I want
it as small as possible what if we get a
low profile card and that's our backup
but we try to put the Arctic's 20/80 eye
in so that was mostly successful the
main thing I'm worried about right now
is that we still have a case there were
a couple in there that looked ok but for
the most part they all it's way too
modern the start of the show here though
is definitely the i7 9700 K it's a ninth
generation Intel processor it is a full
8 core chip and on top of that it's
overclockable now depending on the case
and everything else we choose I'm not so
sure how much we can actually overclock
Gabe but the whole idea here is that I
want to have a system which looks old
and retro and lame on the outside we can
handle the latest games video editing
streaming
whatever now we just have to find the
case and actually build it hey how's it
going I've got a little bit a weird one
I'm looking for an older system
preferably like one of the old like
beige towers I'm mostly just needing it
for the case it doesn't actually have to
be working would you happen to have
anything like that okay good this could
be a problem like do you think we
actually gonna have a real hard time
finding these old systems because he's
right most people just recycled them at
this point
gave me no one really wants them you
wouldn't happen to have any older
desktop towers Mike preferably something
beige no dude it's one o'clock we need
we need to have time to get back to the
office and fill this if we don't get
something in the next like hour we're
screwed there's no way Oh we'll be right
over them all right
okay that's kind of promising so I told
him what we needed he's just gonna give
us the case it might have some parts
they might I think he might just give us
one justic with just the case nothing
hot perfect yes success so Ken pulled
this one out
we're able to find a computer shop with
what I think is the perfect case so it's
nicely beige up front you can see it's
got we're doing that until Celeron got
the old school power button even got a
CD drive now we just have to actually
build this thing but this I mean look at
this imagine walking up seeing this
system and inside you've got a like a
full 20 ATI at core i7 oh man I really
didn't have to pull this one out I
really thought that we had I really
thought we had bitten off more than we
could chew and so with that we have
everything we need to build the ultimate
overkill sleeper gaming PC which is a
little bit of a mouthful but now that I
have a super cool wardrobe change
I think I'm ready come on how can I not
wear this it literally just showed up
Microsoft sent over a Windows ugly
sweater so I really don't know how old
the system is if I was to take a guess I
would say probably early 2000s but the
important thing is is it it has
essentially everything we need or at
least I hope so besides it is to say I
think it's time to pull the motherboard
out and upgrade it with something just a
little bit more modern the first thing
we can remove is our modem which I don't
think we'll be needing any dial-up
anytime soon so that we have our
motherboard damn things have come a long
way what Oh front panel we're gonna look
hilarious with a 28 epi this old system
and our i7 on this tiny little
motherboard that looks a little
interesting but we will make it work the
important thing is that does mount up to
our current spots look at that is this
actually going to work did I decide not
to do a terrible idea so with our
processor installed our cooler on here
our Intel Team memory as well as our RAM
we're ready to see if this actually fits
although it should be fine so if that a
big trigger build is actually already
ready we have the motherboard the core
i7 pretty much everything we need for
the main components now we figure out
how to put in our graphics card our hard
drive or power supply this is not a
crazy high-end unit or anything but
should give us enough power and
importantly at a semi modular which
should be helpful because cables might
be a little tricky in this case all
right three power supply screws should
be enough to keep that in place
I do see a problem and that the back
doesn't quite match the front but as
soon as we put the side panel on I don't
think anyone will be able to know this
excellent all right now now we've made
some progress so that looks pretty close
we still need to install the hard drive
but I actually think it's safe to say
now this is going to work now where are
we gonna put this I believe that's a
three and a half inch type thing oh yeah
no problem right like that
so with this the ultimate sleeper PC
hopefully is ready to go fingers crossed
oh okay I see fan spinning
graphics card spinning it's making
noises okay not a great sign we'll be
right back after a quick BIOS update of
our motherboard so after a little bit of
updating
and downloading and installing the
ultimate sleeper PC lives and I can't
tell you how happy I am with this build
you just look at it I will knit I may
have slightly misplaced the core i7
sticker so run you guys through the
build inside we've got proper components
we've got that core i7 9700 K full eight
cores overclockable the whole deal we
also have an nvidia r-tx 20 80 TI and
that's all inside this chassis which
will be a little bit of a surprise for
most people I expect oh yeah so we even
got the K speaker to work so it's wired
up to the motherboard here so if you
ever have a problem with your super cool
PC you'll get some helpful beeps just
like 2001 and ten days the crazy part of
this build is that everything works
exactly like you would expect the power
button works that speaker works the LEDs
work for the hard drive I mean the only
thing that we don't have fully up and
running is the CD drive because I don't
have an adapter to make it work but I
mean
I'm really surprised what we were able
to find in just a few hours and actually
make it work the fact that we're getting
this kind of performance out of a PC
that looks like this is awesome
I mean look we're maxing out our 1080p
monitor at 185 frames per second that's
full Ultra settings and everything it's
so smooth I love the idea that we were
able to build something but from the
outside looks so old school and so retro
but on the inside has all the power to
gain all the power to stream we can
video edit I mean there's literally
almost nothing we can't do at this PC it
has the power for pretty much anything
we throw at it but the looks from
straight out of 2011 ah
no so that my friends is the ultimate
sleeper gaming PC we've got all the
performance and all the nice
conveniences of a modern system but as
soon as we slide the side panel on from
the outside no one needs to know this is
not a Windows XP 2001 gaming box that
has been sitting in someone's grandma's
basement for 20 years
anyway huge shout-outs Intel for
sponsoring this crazy project if you
guys want to check out the core i7 or
some of the other parts I included in
this build the links will be in the
description we put that 92 millimeter
and a description Cooley's important
