here with a review with the HTC Droid
DNA for Verizon with a 1080p screen
quad-core processor an Android 4.1 let's
take a look the DNA brings along a
familiar Verizon red and black color
scheme which gives a bit of pop to the
design the front is fairly clean with a
single piece of glass with the Verizon
logo up top and the capacitive Android
keys below along the sides are red
accents which give a bit of texture to
the phone and around back you'll see the
DNA is entirely coated in a soft touch
plastic generally these surfaces pick up
dust and fingerprints easily but it
really wasn't a huge issue 89.7
millimeters thick it's on the chunkier
side but thanks to the heavily tapered
edges if you look a much thinner phone
in the hand here is where the 8
megapixel camera is found along with the
speaker with Beats Audio branding it's
not particularly noteworthy in effect
it's a bit too easy to cover with a
single misplaced finger along the top
you'll see the 2.1 megapixel
front-facing camera and red speaker
grille and below or your capacitive back
home and multitasking buttons there's a
notification LED hidden in the grille of
the phone as well as on the back which
is a really useful feature the rest of
the ergonomics are less than spectacular
however unlike most smartphones the
volume rocker is over on the right side
and more still it's narrow and blends in
HTC has opted to load the top up with
your micro SIM slot sleep button and
headphone jack having the sleep button
centered up top is awkward as it forces
you to hold the DNA differently compared
to almost every other large phone out
there
finally on bottom is your microUSB port
which is weirdly covered by a flap
microUSB is plenty robust to handle
being uncovered so it's beyond me why
HTC and Verizon chose to cover it up
here this wasn't cool on the palm pixi
and it definitely isn't cool for a
flagship phone at the end of 2012 it is
compatible with the Qi wireless charging
standard so your best bet is to buy a
wireless charger and ignore the fiddly
little micro USB port altogether the
screen on the other hand is absolutely
fantastic it's a 5 inch IPS panel with a
resolution of 1920 by 1080 and with 440
pixels per inch this absolutely destroys
every other smartphone out there right
now even when viewing the screen much
closer than you ever would normally
there's still an incredible amount of
detail not only is it high resolution
but it's also among the most vibrant
screens I've ever seen with top-notch
viewing angles
I have zero complaints at all here it's
noticeably better than any other phone
screen period the Droid DNA is running
Android 4.1 jellybean with the HTC Sense
4 plus skin
I've never been a big fan of cents and
this latest iteration doesn't do
anything to change my mind
the overall UI design is very different
than stock Android and a lot seems to be
changed for changes sake rather than
making things faster or better there's a
lot of Chrome all over the phone which
really doesn't hurt anything but it's
not a slick of a look as even TouchWiz
on the galaxy note 2 on the whole of it
the DNA is certainly a fast phone thanks
to the powerful internals and Android
4.1 but it's not as smooth as it could
be with animations frequently losing
frames most apps work just fine on the
1080p screen although it is easy to spot
graphics made for 720p or lower
resolution devices as with most recent
Verizon phones there's a notification
for Wi-Fi which never goes away which is
a minor annoyance and there's a good
deal of bloatware installed which gets
its own category in the app drawer
unwanted apps are fairly easy to hide
however so it isn't a huge problem
overall the software could be better but
load up a custom launcher hide the
bloatware and you're good to go the 8
megapixel camera is quite good overall
saturation is solid and there's a good
amount of detail to work with the white
balance gets tripped up sometimes but
you can adjust it manually if you need
low-light performance is right on par
with most smartphones salvageable for a
quick shot but it pales in comparison to
the nokia lumia 920 the camera software
is generally quite good its intuitive is
Android 4.2 however you have quite a few
manual options for ISO exposure and more
there are also some effects you can
choose from including a fun little
distortion effect which you can play
around with dots which rendered the
image in a series of interesting looking
dots and finally your standard depth of
field vignette and Instagram like
filters powering the HTC Droid DNA is a
Snapdragon s4 quad-core processor
clocked at 1.5 gigahertz paired with two
eco bytes of RAM and Adreno 320 graphics
this is the same combo you'll find in
the Nexus 4 and it delivers some of the
best performance in any smartphone
available right now it has plenty of
power to push around all the pixels on
that 1080p screen however some games
aren't updated to work on the DNA just
yet you'll also find 16 gigabytes of
storage built in which is about average
however the lack of a micro SD card slot
is a bit disappointing call quality on
the Verizon network is top-notch rifling
Motorola phones like the Droid Razr HD
you'll also get solid LTE data speeds
topping 30 megabits per second at
and even pulling in over 10 megabits in
my office where most Verizon phones
struggle with a 5 inch 1080p screen in
quad-core processor running off at 2020
million power battery I was skeptical of
the battery life but in my testing I
found I was easily able to make it
through a full day of use and then some
the HTC Droid DNA has some faults the
hardware is well built but a few design
choices hold the phone back it's great
to see Android 4.1 onboard but since is
really in need of a redesign that said
you're getting the best display on any
phone out there and top notch specs all
for a reasonable price if you're looking
to pick up a new phone on Verizon the
Droid DNA is absolutely worth a look you

DNA here and don't forget to hit that
