here with the new Mac Pro the question
is though is it worth it so let's just
get this out of the way first
yes the Mac Pro does kind of look like a
trash can unlike basically every desktop
ever the design is entirely rounded with
the only break in the appearance being
the ports around back in pictures it
looks black but in person it's actually
just dark polished metal and it's quite
reflective thankfully though it's not
too much of a fingerprint magnet what a
lot of the pictures don't quite get
across is just how small this thing is
set it next to a mini ITX system and
there's no comparison the Mac Pro is
just tiny put it alongside a more
standard computer capable of handling a
couple beefy graphics cards and you'll
see the difference is really substantial
now whether the size really matters is
something that's up to you now
personally I prefer having a little bit
more desk space but regardless it is
impressive that they were able to fit
this much hardware into such a small
package and a very uh napple like move
cracking open the Mac Pro is actually
simple just flip the switch on the back
and the entire aluminum housing will
slide right off giving you access to all
the parts inside one look around and the
nerd in me is very very happy while
everything is basically custom it's
nicely laid out with the to fire pro
graphics cards on display front and
center you can also easily swap in and
out the 32 gigabytes of ECC Ram which
while expensive to replace is standard
workstation grade stuff the SSD is PCIe
based and is just held in by a single
Torx screw unfortunately the downside is
that there's no room for any hard drives
inside the Mac Pro you're going to have
to make do with whatever size SSD you
choose instead you're meant to use one
of the Thunderbolt or USB 3.0 ports on
back for storage an external hard drive
enclosure will take care of that but
that's going to cost extra and clutter
your set up however the good news is you
can actually work on the mac pro as most
of the parts are fully upgradable iFixit
has a great teardown on their site and
with a little work not only can you swap
the memory and SSD but you can also
upgrade the processor the graphics cards
are technically replaceable however
they're custom so you can't just throw
in any card on the bottom is the own
we fan in the system which pulls air in
and up through the giant heatsink
everything is attached to hot air comes
out up top which is where you'll find
the handle for moving the MacPro
concerns this has a full Xeon processor
and a pair of fire pro cards which are
essentially Radeon r9 280x --is the fact
that it's cool by a single fan seems
like a very very bad idea but it works
in normal use you just can't hear it
even while cutting together video the
fan doesn't spin up in fact the only
time it's ever really audible is when
rendering out video and even then it's
not that bad
so while sure the design is pretty cool
for a full workstation grade system
however the real question is how does it
perform and is it worth the three
thousand dollars plus the configuration
I have here is sporting a six core Intel
Xeon processor at 3.5 gigahertz dual AMD
FirePro d500 graphics cards 32 gigabytes
of 1866 ECC memory and a 512 gigabyte
SSD as far as the benchmarks go on
Geekbench the Mac Pro scored 3606 on a
single core and 20 1072 on all cores in
senha bench on the CPU side it scored
962 and 4 graphics it pulled in seventy
six point eight frames per second one of
the most impressive numbers comes from
the SSD where it consistently pulls in
just under 1 gigabyte a second in both
reads and writes performance inside
Adobe Premiere is solid partially thanks
to that superfast SSD however it doesn't
seem to be taking full advantage of the
mac pro hardware just yet
the price is a bit harder to nail down
so not everyone needs expensive hardware
like Zeon's fire pros and ECC Ram
however if you compare it to Windows
workstations that do have all that kind
of stuff it's actually really not too
far off in the end while it has
sacrificed expandability and is
definitely expensive it really is an
impressively designed desktop so what do
you guys think is the Mac Pro worth it
let me know in the comments below and I
am looking forward to these comments
anyway if you enjoyed this video and you

sure to subscribe to the channel for
lots more tech videos well just like
this anyway guys thanks for watching and
I will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
