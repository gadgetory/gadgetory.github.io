5 and free windows applications now of
course pretty much everything you can
find a paid version of however you would
be really surprised at what you can find
for free and what should really be on
every Windows computer the first program
I'll be showing you is GIMP GIMP is a
free and open source Photoshop
alternative the ledge to do some fairly
advanced photo editing for free now it
supports a wide variety of features
including layers paths there's a wide
variety of color options tools and a
wide wide variety of filters allow you
to really customize and fine-tune
exactly how you want to create your
photos or any other graphic design work
now if you already use Photoshop there's
no real reason to change over to GAMP
Photoshop still does have some
higher-end features and generally it
seems to work a little bit better it's
got a little bit of a better UI but
overall if you're looking for something
free and you just need to do some
moderate photoshopping and whatnot GIMP
is definitely going to be a great choice
another very useful program is ccleaner
now CCleaner is a general utility that
helps you speed up your computer and get
rid of all the junk so not only does it
handle the standard system applications
such as getting rid of temporary files
and whatnot but it also will take care
of your various third-party applications
such as browsers you know splash player
there's a wide variety and what it does
it just cleans up the added junk the
temporary files all kind of stuff that
you don't need now it also does have a
registry cleaner I generally don't like
to recommend that you would use these
but of course it is there if you ever
decide that you need it but probably one
of my favorite features of CCleaner is
the fact that it will allows you to
really easily choose what programs you
want to run when you first turn on your
computer now that's a big deal of course
lots of computers get really slow as you
install more and more programs they
automatically load even if you don't
need them so all you do is open up the
ccleaner pick out whatever programs you
want to automatically run when you start
up your computer and you can be good to
go one of the first programs I always
install when I first boot up windows is
VLC media player
now VLC is a fantastic program that
basically allows you to play pretty much
any audio or video file you can find
this is really helpful as you can very
you know find QuickTime and plugins all
that kind of stuff but with VLC you
don't have to worry about anything
simply download the program pick out
whatever video file you want and it
pretty much plays it no issue whatsoever
in addition to that it also does run
with hardware acceleration and has a lot
of really nice features as far as to
playback and as well as allowing you to
convert your video files so if you need
to convert from mp4 to MOV or for
whatever reason you want to do you
absolutely do that with VLC now as far
as antivirus software goes there's
absolutely no reason to go out and pay a
lot of money for some supposedly great
software when you can just download
Microsoft Security Essentials now this
is a free antivirus software that is
obviously from Microsoft and it does a
fantastic job of keeping your computer
nice and clean and automatically updates
itself and it runs really well in the
background so you don't really have to
worry about updating your anything like
that it pretty much does everything you
need and on top of that it's really not
a big drain on system resources so if
you need an anti-virus software if
you're not happy with you currently have
or if you're tired of paying for it I
absolutely recommend Microsoft Security
Essentials now as far as keeping your
files secure and safe I highly recommend
using TrueCrypt using TrueCrypt allows
you to encrypt all of your files you can
do your entire system disk or you can
create specific disks and then put your
files inside of them it uses some very
very advanced security now I will say
that TrueCrypt is not the easiest
program to use it can get a little bit
confusing there's a lot of mounting and
selecting your files and making sure
everything works but overall if you're
looking for something to keep your file
secure and when I say secure I mean very
very secure I highly recommend taking a
look at TrueCrypt
so there you go my top five free Windows
applications that really everyone should
have now in addition to that I do want
to show you one last one and I get this
question a lot my screencast is what is
this thing on the bottom left of my
taskbar well this is called super bar
monitor what it is is a very very small
application that allows me to see what's
going on with my cpu load without having
to pull a widget up our opening task
manager now like I said it's a very very
simple thing there's really not a whole
lot to do about it
however it's definitely very useful
unfortunately it is only Windows 7 so
unlike the other five this is only for
people who have Windows 7 but if you do
have Windows 7 you're looking for
something like this I definitely
recommend it it's very useful to take a
look at any right if you're interested
in any of the applications I showed
definitely be sure to take a look in the
