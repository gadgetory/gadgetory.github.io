overview of Google Chrome OS so there's
been a lot of talk and hype and buzz and
all that kind of good stuff about the
latest operating system that's available
or being Chrome OS and since I've been
fortunate enough to have a cr-48 which
is a development version it's similar to
what you will actually be able to buy
here come next month when Chrome OS is
available but it's a little different
I'll get into exactly what all that
means but basically I've been fortunate
to be able to use Chrome OS for this
past several months though I'd like to
do for you guys today is give you a
little explanation can I explain some of
the things what Chrome OS is good at bad
at all that kind of good stuff so let's
go ahead and move the computer up and
the first thing you'll notice is that it
is really fast in starting so this like
I said this is not quite as fast as what
you will buy when you get a Chromebook
yourself but typically boot times are
under eight seconds so once you load up
Google Chrome OS you'll find that it is
very similar to normal Chrome on your
whatever computer that you currently use
so you have your tabs up top now you get
a couple of additional options so you
have a clock you have it shows your
Wi-Fi and your battery also shows you
where you can switch between your
windows so there's button I don't
actually have any windows up here but if
you I PI did I could switch between
different windows just like if you
opened up a program for example you had
like two Google Chrome windows open on
your Windows computer and you can scroll
between them looks very very much the
same on Chrome OS and as far as how it
works
because I guys very very similarly to
how chrome works you have flash html5 it
work very similarly to what you just
expect now one slight downside that I
found is it does not support Java right
now so what that means is let's say you
wanna go play Minecraft or something
you're not going to be able to do it in
the browser on Chrome OS again I don't
know think that's a deal breaker by any
means it's just a smited a could add it
without any major hassle so once you
load up like I said guys you'll be able
to get all of your data especially if
you're already a chrome user it will
have all of your data backed up just
like like literally when you first get
your Chromebook you log in it downloads
all your stuff from the cloud so you
know your bookmarks your your save file
I mean all the kinds of stuff that you
have normally on Chrome like your
passwords all that kind of stuff is and
your themes that are saved automatically
will come to the Chromebook you don't
have to do anything you literally just
log in and you're done
which is fantastic now I do I show you
guys there really is not a whole lot of
a UI or anything like that I'm like I'd
like a particularly standard computer
like say windows whatever I mean you had
your desktop and you have programs and
this and that start button but there's
none of that here literally the only
thing that's outside the browser is the
settings page and when you go into the
settings page this even this is almost
just like on normal Chrome the only
difference is you can set a couple
things like your date and time and just
the sensitivity of the trackpad get
tweets and then all that kind of stuff
it's not really anything all that
in-depth
now there is one fairly big downside to
Chrome OS and that is of course that you
were stuck on the web so for example
let's say you do Photoshop or you're big
into video editing or for whatever
reason you have an application that you
absolutely can't go without that is for
example on Windows or Mac and it's not
on the web there's nothing you can do
however there's a surprising amount of
things that you can do on the web so
what I'll open up is this and this is
the apps page of course I'm sure you
guys are familiar with the Google Chrome
Web Store and there are a lot of various
different apps and some of them really
quite good so I'll show you guys a quick
little demo like I have for example
TweetDeck is a fantastic Twitter client
I'm always using it Gmail you know it's
just email you know of course your your
email and they're all also various gains
to won't get into but there are actually
some decent games including Angry Birds
now there's Google Talk there's
applications that allow you to do 3d
modeling applications that allow you to
keep your use notes and whatnot there's
even a VA which is not quite as good as
Photoshop certainly but it allows you to
do some fairly advanced audio editing
all from the internet so while I
definitely understand there are a lot of
people who go oh well you know what I
need X program on it and Chrome OS won't
run for the vast majority of people if
you're just you know this is not meant
to be your number one computer to do
everything on but for a secondary
computer compared to something like a
tablet or ever Chrome West is more than
sufficient to get through I would say
95% of people's needs you'll be able to
find something in the web apps or online
or somehow you'll be able to get through
so that's why I am really excited about
Chrome OS I love that it's really secure
you have to worry about updates patches
viruses all the updates are
automatically done
you don't ever even really notice them
and it just really keeps itself very
simple it's really quick so if you're
interested in Chrome OS I highly
recommend it it's a very very cool
operating system it's a cool premise now
I do again I just do want to say it's
not for everyone you know it's not going
to replace your $2000 desktop or
anything like that
but for a secondary computer that you
can use carry around with you to get on
the internet and all that kind of stuff
Chrome OS will absolutely do the job</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
