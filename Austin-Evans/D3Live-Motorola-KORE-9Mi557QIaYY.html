episode of d3 live substan- be talking
about the motorola core tablet now the
motorola xoom was the very first tablet
that was launched with android 3.0
honeycomb it doesn't like google is
going to be doing the same thing with
motorola with the motorola core so what
we do expect with the court is there
will be the very first tablet to launch
with a new Android Ice Cream Sandwich
now that delicious name definitely will
equate to some pretty cool upgrades
announcing the full version of itunes
sandwich I'm going to not talk too much
about that as opposed to the tablet cell
but it does look like motor oil will be
getting it first and the core should be
the very first tablet that is launched
with ice cream sandwich alright so let's
talk a little bit about the tablet
itself now pretty much all tablets these
days will pretty much all of them across
the board are powered by a dual-core
processors in the case of Android
they're pretty much all just the same
Tegra 2 processor now this is a dual
core 1 gigahertz CPU very very fast for
going on a phone or tablet or anything
like that however with combined with
honeycomb it can be a bit slow sometime
so you know sometimes it can be really
really speedy but on occasion can lag
just not not we'd be quite perfect so
instead I either really enjoyed and do
all kinds of different things to
optimize performance looks like they're
going to much much easier way which is
just going to be adding a lot more power
one other change from the core is
opposed to something like the zoom is
the fact that it will have a four by
threes aspect ratio so this is very
similar to the ipad and ipad 2 and what
this means as opposed to the zoom which
was a very long screen which is nice for
watching movies and stuff but sometimes
it can be a little bit unwieldy to carry
around and polls and everything does
look like the core will have a more
standard 4 by 3 screen resolution so
what like it won't be quite as good for
movies and whatnot but it will be nice
for web browsing and a little bit more
of a full screen experience anyway guys
for the same segment of d3 live i'll be
taking live questions from everyone in
the chat as always every episode of d3
light is coming from the live audience
should you have some see your own blog
to be so squad you take a couple of
questions it's 3d a fad 3ds been a fast
like 60 years now um I think three is
overblown right now I think that
everyone's like oh let's go do 3d and
then people kinda like kick him back
because there are a lot of downsides to
three right now um
said I don't think 3ds ever going to go
away like I said threes been around for
a very very long time on all kinds of
different forms and if you can't look
back you can see like it got really
popular that kind of fell off and now
it's getting really popular and the
technology somewhat there but Upton
technology is entirely there so I think
3ds going to start going back down and
once everything's glasses-free once
there's a lot of 3d content once a lot
of this stuff is taken care of I do
think it will take off and whether
that's going to be in a year or ten
years I don't know but I do think 3d for
now is a bit of a fat I think it will be
going away okay I don't want that I
think it will be cooling down a lot I
think a lot of this emphasis on 3d is
going to slacken off quite a bit do I
think quad core the core will shoot in
the battery life or make it hot um it's
always a possibility but I really don't
think it'll be too bad i mean a lot of
this is the fact that they build these
chips they try to have the same power
efficiency and in fact a lot of times I
try to build and better so you know it
does have four physical cores it's gonna
be more powerful that does not
necessarily mean that's gonna just drain
tons of battery life and kick off tons
of heat because there are a lot of
really cool tricks and that everything
that they could do now that said we
really haven't seen a whole lot we've
seen individual we've seen engineering
samples we've seen them show it off we
actually haven't seen it in a tablet so
it very well may be worse on battery
life it may kick off a lot of heat but
we just don't know that yet so I don't
really want to say one way or the other
but I would definitely give them the
benefit of the debt I don't think that
just because it can be powerful it's
gonna be no just make us extremely hot
tablet and you have like three minutes
of battery back I'm I'll give them the
benefit of the doubt on that one am I
excited for AMD bulldozer yeah
definitely I've been a big fan of a
empty i used to use their chips i use
until now but AMD definitely has a lot
that they can go for with bulldoze or
i'm excited i think that there's a lot
of potential there but again i have
really seen a whole lotta it's still not
out yet so I'm definitely gonna reserve
judgment be I am excited really am
looking forward to what they have to
offer with it um was the ipod touch
camera sucks so much uh well i don't
think it's horrible I mean in good
lights on that at all um but it's a very
very small sensor in fact I've got mine
right here um I think one of the big
things they talked about is that I
bought it just thin right
and you can't put a big bulky camera in
there so it is there it's pretty small
camera there's no auto focus ring
tonight that and it's well I think point
seven megapixel it's not particularly
great for taking pictures but um I'm
hopeful I think that they will be doing
some better things with the ipod touch
5th generation I definitely think just
technology in general is always dancing
stuffs always getting faster better you
name it so yeah I mean as far as why
it's just not that great i think it's
just because i have to make a really
thin camera in there and there's just
not a whole lot they can do and
obviously they don't want to you know
these cameras don't cost anything at all
for them to make so they want to keep
the prices everything down but hopefully
they will start to you know and prove
that with next ipod touch um when do you
think the optical drive will die out for
good uh I give another few years um I
think optical media for computers is
going to be out just like just like
floppy drive I mean I'll say that right
now I've got an optical drive in my
computer I built it a couple months ago
or so I've used it once to install
windows and I used it once to watch a
DVD which look terrible because it's the
DVD so yeah I mean optical drives are
really not that necessary for a lot of
people I mean sure if you really are
always doing blu rays or DVDs or CDs I
can you have to be kind of helpful but
on the whole of it for computers I don't
really see the optical drive lasting for
more than a few more years I mean for
consoles and that kind of stuff if we
can see it hanging around but for the
most part I just don't see a whole lot
of point2 optical media and computers
right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
