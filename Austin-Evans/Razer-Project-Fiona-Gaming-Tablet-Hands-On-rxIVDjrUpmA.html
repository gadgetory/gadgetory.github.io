live at CES 2012 with the razor project
fee on a tablet so this is a really cool
tablet as you guys can see here it has
two dedicated controllers are actually
built in so this is going to be running
windows 7 and as you guys to see here it
will play full pc games so it's a really
cool design and we'll have of course
have a touchscreen but for the most part
you'll be able to just do your gaming on
here such as you guys can see here seems
to be running pretty nice and smooth it
does have an intel core i7 cpu so you
have plenty of power to run quite pretty
much any pc game you choose now as far
as this goes we don't have any price
release date this is more of a prototype
at this stage I think it's very cool to
see a tablet Jason see here it does have
fairly it's not too thin but you guys
can see here the controls are hard wired
in a little bit maybe bulky to carry
around but a very very cool concept and
I'm looking forward to taking a look and
seeing what it is like in the future so
that's it guys this has been the razor
project for you on the tablet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
