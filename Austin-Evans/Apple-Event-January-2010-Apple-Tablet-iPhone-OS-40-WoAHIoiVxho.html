today I'm here with a final rundown of
what all I think going to see at the
Apple event on Wednesday there have been
tons of rumors from the obvious ones
like obviously the Apple tablet will
probably see iPhone OS 4.0 and there's
also some been some more kind of odd
ones like the iPhone coming to Verizon a
new iPhone and a bunch of others so yeah
let's go ahead I'm going to run you guys
down over what all I think we're going
to see and yeah let's get this one
started
okay so obviously this event is going to
be focused on the Apple tablet so let's
begin with that the Apple tablet
everyone's been rumored about it for the
past several years probably even before
the iPhone came out so now that we're
finally seeing it I mean it's just the
hype is insane I'm honestly serious
if this Apple tablet even if it does not
make a sandwich for you on Wednesday
then no one is going to be happy with it
but a couple of things that I want to
get out first one thing is obviously
it's going to be a tablet touchscreen
just like the iPhone imagine basically a
big screen play between 10 and 11 inches
I think probably about 10.1 is going to
be where it's going to be it's going to
be a capacitive multi-touch screen just
like on the iPhone and imagine just just
blowing up um
now as far as specs and an iPhone OS
concern the specs are probably going to
be I'm thinking probably about netbook I
wouldn't even be surprised it may run an
Intel Atom processor which is what the
what most netbooks run but more likely
it's going to run a custom processor
made by PA semi which Apple bought a
couple years ago and we really haven't
seen anything what they're doing with it
so it's pretty likely that they could be
using it in the Apple tablet um there's
some other specs like Ram I like AI
stuff and be honest anything I'll say
would be just a total guest so just kind
of keep in mind that it will likely be
somewhere something like a netbook it
was going to be a MacBook or anything
it's going to be kind of low power but
you know it's it's not going to be a
full computer now the OS is something
that's a little well I don't know I'm
little worried about it to be honest now
obviously we're talking about something
that likely well like I said have specs
like a netbook so a lot of people and
there's been some evidence to that that
saying that's going to run iPhone
version of the iPhone OS you
no the just speaking straight from what
I've heard what I know and everything I
would definitely say it's going to run
the iPhone OS and I'm kind of that's a
little disappointing because obviously
it's going to be a tablet first it's not
just going to be the exact same thing
it's going to be blown up with hopefully
a lot of like Snow Leopard features and
just general desktop like you know
Windows running lots of things in the
background all that kind of stuff but
one big problem which could be is that
it might not really fully feature like a
computer I mean obviously it's going to
have a web browser and apps and it
should be able to run apps from App
Store but it might not have a lot of
other capabilities that you would expect
in a normal computer such as mean
everything from video editing to I mean
just uh running apps and main thing is
at have an open kind of thing because if
you look at your Mac you can obviously
do anything you want with the Mac okay
but if you look at the iPhone a list you
have to jailbreak to do all kinds of
stuff that you know you would expect to
do on computer so if Apple goes ahead
and kind of does the closed model that
they did with iPhone I don't know I
still think it's going to sell huge no
matter if they just come out with just
just a screen I mean people just can go
Oh Apple tab I'm going to buy it but
it's just kind of disappointing that it
looks like they're probably going to try
to wall it in but it's not out yet so
we'll see anyway so the next main part
is going to be the iPhone OS 4.0 now if
you guys remember correctly last year
and the year before they've done Apple
has basically showed off preview the
next version of the iPhone OS so you
know they did iPhone 2.0 and 3.0 and
they kind of showed it here about this
time usually was a little bit later but
around this time and then you it'll be
available for download everywhere
usually June July when the main iPhone
comes out with new I'm sorry so I expect
we'll see something like that again this
year they will probably go ahead and
have some new features
I really really hope they get
multitasking you know a lot of people
jailbreak myself included and that's one
of the main things to be able to run a
lot of different things at once yeah I
might slow your device down yeah my
dragon battery but as a consumer I'm
paying this money for your device so why
can't I have the choice
another couple things there that I
really hope it gets a UI update when the
iPhone OS first came out I mean it was
just awesome I mean you know you're
going from I mean that wasn't too far
away from when you know the old palm
style and you know that was come on hood
and so you go from this just gorgeous
looking and you have a home screen all
kinds of stuff I really hope that they
try to reinvent it because it's kind of
getting stale when you look at the
Android especially 2.1 with the
background wallpapers that you can
interact with it's a huge battery drain
but it really looks nice and everything
and you know it just makes it look
better
playing with widgets widgets would be
fantastic to have or stead of me having
to open my mail or this or that can I
have all pulled in on like a single
screen and as I said before jailbreak
applications which is what I was talking
about Apple tablet how come is that kind
of stuff and it works fine so it's some
normal person with just a couple weeks
worth of work can make something I see
no reason why Apple can't those are the
main two things I think we're going to
see I would be surprised will we see an
eye life update and also would be
surprised if we see some some kind of
new things I definitely would recommend
recommend I definitely expect that
there's going to be a MacBook Pro update
with the new core i5 and maybe even Core
i7 processors but the main thing that I
think we're going to see is the Apple
tablet I'm going to see iPhone OS 4.0
beyond that we might see four but I
prefer Verizon maybe I see a preview of
the new iPhone and who knows we might
see something totally something no one's
expected but I think those main two or
what we're going to see so you know
we'll see anyway guys be sure to post in
the comments what you think about all
this what do you think are you
interested in the Apple tablet
um can you not wait for iPhone or less
4.0 or do you have an idea that nobody
else has that you think there's
something cool coming anyway be sure to
let me know anyway thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
