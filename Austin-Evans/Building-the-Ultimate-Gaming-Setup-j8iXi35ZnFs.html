ultimate gaming setup 2.0 so big shout
out to LG for sponsoring this video and
letting us build this awesome setup the
star of the show is the new sj9 sound
bar I end up using sound bars a lot not
only for my personal setups but also
here in the office a big reason for that
is that while a full surround sound
system sounds nice
I don't know I'm always a little bit
nervous about like annoying my neighbors
about stuff where's where the sound bar
actually feel a lot better about being
able to just crank the volume and not
have to worry about it there's a lot
bigger than stuff I usually unbought
we've got the remote and sound bar so
Ken measured this and that the sound bar
should be pretty much the exact width of
not only the TV but the stand after
looking at the giant box I was expecting
the sound bar to be bigger what's cool
about this is it actually has some top
firing speakers for at most support I'm
not totally sure how well this space is
going to work with that most the idea is
is that to get a little bit more of a
surround sound feel not only is it
sending sound at you that's also
bouncing sound off of the ceiling which
in theory should give you a much more
surround sound this is actually a lot
thinner than I thought it was going to
be so well it actually fit looks like
it's gonna be close oh all right you
know what props the Ken this actually
fits literally perfectly it actually
touches both edges but it doesn't go
over that's actually pretty cool we also
have in the middle of this a subwoofer
which is not small alright so that whole
thing about not being able to annoy the
neighbors I take it back alright so I
may have slightly misjudged how big this
was it still should fit with the setup
though so we're actually going to be
doing some interesting stuff beyond just
the sound part of our gaming setup so
Ken has spent the last couple days
building this so essentially it's a way
of getting the TV off the table and
actually floating so now only does that
mean that we have plenty of clearance
for our speaker but because of this cool
design of having a couple pieces of wood
here with the mount we can actually also
just move the TV easily so the setup is
actually starting to come together but
we have a lot of work to do as you might
be able to tell
so one first time
so after a frantic afternoon of work we
have this setup and actually looks
pretty good so there's a lot going on
here but to start we actually have the
TV paired with the sj9 sound bar is a 55
inch LG e 6 TV
so not only is this OLED that also
supports 4k and HD are almost more
important in the resolution though is
that OLED display seriously a good oled
TV looks so so good
completely puts everything else to shame
but pair with the SJ 9 I'm excited to
see more importantly here what it sounds
like
hey guys Boston my voice might be gone
but what is this is the Mac there why
does this visit all right that actually
sounds pretty good so if the sj9 not
only are we getting that subwoofer which
is way way bigger than I thought but we
also have the speakers inside here that
gives that the 5.1 surround and the two
top firing speakers so the way we'd get
this set up is that we have the ps4 Pro
connected to the TV so we're getting
full 4k HDR there and then the TVs
passing audio into the sj9 via HDMI that
means that not only can we control
everything from one spot but we're also
getting the best audio quality what's
cool about this setup is that the actual
subwoofer itself is Wireless so besides
need to plug it in this is a nice clean
setup and speaking of the set up as you
can see savage kinney has been hard at
work so now I do have white foods but we
also have cool stuff too so we've got
our pip-boy action more white foods
because this is 10 set up sometimes I
have to deal with white foods in order
to get a really cool setup that's pretty
fair trade we also have our show full of
Nintendo stuffs including the NES
classic the gameboy color that I
embossed a couple years ago as well as
the Famicom which is actually something
we did a video on and never posted and
on this side we have another slightly
more adorable waifu lego stuff thanks to
Jimmy a DeLorean ps3 xbox it's a cool
set up but all the stuff on the side is
just for show what really counts is what
we have inside the console
if you're wondering why I'm standing
because there was a certain I'll
function with the couch and it's now an
eight-piece is right beside Ken
Wow Wow Wow that sort of actually
scaring me a little bit right now I feel
this is about to actually be loud yo
that sounds stupid can you even hear me
right now okay so this is actually
really loud if that song had such a
punch I've never heard a sound bar sound
like this
I am a hundred percent surprised you and
sounds like especially with that bass
this is gonna sound like a really weird
comparison
it sounds like listening to a movie
theater like it has that hugest punch
okay so we didn't quite have time to get
everything wired up yet game playing on
the Xbox one at 1080p it looks nice it
does sound good too
a few moments later the neighbors
literally just knocked all right I'll
turn it down turn it down I just love
the story of this video we start out by
saying I like using sound bars because
they don't annoy the neighbors then it
got really loud enjoyed the neighbors
and now we got complaints little tough
guys don't crank your sound bar up to
100% volume when you're doing a video to
be fair that tells you that it actually
is really loud in case you were doubting
me and it's that's pretty good proof</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
