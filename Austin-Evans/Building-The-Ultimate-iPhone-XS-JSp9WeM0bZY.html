ultimate iPhone 10s so I'm like when we
usually do these videos in the studio I
felt like why not take a little trip
outside to the park and enjoy some
sunshine and fresh air as I build really
stupid things for the internet to start
out with we have the brand-new Marshall
kilburn - and Marshall will awesome
enough to sponsor this video because
they to share an affinity for building
really ridiculous things on the internet
and they have some some special speakers
this my friends is how you do a
Bluetooth speaker so not did you hear
that one of the main reasons why we
chose the kilburn - for this video is
because it does support bluetooth 5.0
something shared by the new 10s and the
10s max now this actually gives you a
few different features one of the big
ones here specifically with the kilburn
is that you can pair with multiple
devices
Oh Oh we should we should leave I was
about to pass the speaker we can't do
this in front of mayor get back to the
studio a few moments later back in the
studio let's give this a little bit more
of a proper try pretty cool Scorpio on
the front which would make sense because
this is a Scorpio version of the console
that now has a skin covering all that so
that was eight this thing is so powerful
I can literally feel the air moving this
far behind it it has 125 watt amp and to
15 watt amps inside this is ridiculous
and the cool part about it is that it is
a fully wireless speaker you can get 20
hours of battery life so I'm not even
cranking it to 10 here and one of the
cool parts about it is that it is
multi-directional right so it's not like
Ken's only going to be able to hear on a
very narrow kind of thing I mean this
thing fills the room take one look at
the kilburn - and you'll see it's got
that classic Marshall style but it also
is fairly rugged it's ipx7
water-resistant so it's not afraid of a
day at the beach or something it does
feel pretty sturdy
I mean it's ready to party if you want
to get your hands on your own Marshall
kilburn - of course the link will be in
the description I've got to say this is
the loudest the best sounding Bluetooth
portable speaker that I've ever tried
excuse me I'm gonna go back to the park
now hopefully the mayor doesn't yell at
me for disturbing the peace
of course audio isn't the only component
in building the ultimate iPhone 10s
video also plays a huge role which is
where well some of our more creative
accessories come in first up we need the
KT nice that special and by KC nice that
special I mean the knockoff KC nice that
special the Alice op 3 pod so this is a
combo tripod mount and selfie stick and
that actually feels really sturdy okay
so I guess this could be better than a
tripod if I just I was able to lock it
down
I'm sure this light is gonna be very
useful shooting outside in beautiful
sunlight and wonderful shade with some
cloud cover and everything we could ever
want in life Oh
dude look how much easier this is okay
so now we have not only a tripod which
bounces a lot and it's kind of derpy but
we also have a light you see how
revolutionary this is so this is a test
of what the video looks like on our
super cool iPhone with the light which I
don't think is making a difference can
we do some cool stuff now so this this
is a slightly creative take on building
the ultimate iPhone 10s camera so first
of all we do have the be stripped case
as well as lens adapter now this is
actually meant to work with a wide
variety of smartphones and the idea is
that you can attach a much nicer piece
of glass such as this really nice
l-series 70 to 200 Canon lens but we
didn't really plan this out fully if you
can possibly believe something like that
and so we had to be a little creative
most notably there's a little bit of gap
between the lens and the iPhone you know
flange distance and all that kind of
stuff so using our three pod and our
little mini tripod we were able to get
it just about right to sort of look
decent this is what iPhone video really
should look like if it's shot by a true
professional setup and I mean this is
not a true professional setup but with a
little bit of ingenuity and a whole lot
of stupidness
we've got ourselves a an ultimate setup
my friends next up it's time for some
wireless charging action so the iPhone
10's actually does charge faster
wirelessly than the ten and we're going
to put that to the test starting with
this the apps Tronics bx x max iphone
10's max battery case this is a case for
the iphone 10's max which does have a
battery built in that also supports
wireless charging itself so you can make
a wireless charging sandwich first step
is to drop our iphone 10 s max into the
case it will connect it via lightning
and this is going to give us five
thousand additional milliamp hours of
charging capability this is the mo max Q
power 2x now we've actually take a look
at a couple of wireless the charging
battery banks in the past but what makes
this one a little bit special as not
only does it have a mass of 20,000
weight 20,000 20,000 not to dozens
20,000
and powers of capacity but it also will
support knowledge charging over USB as
well as wireless but it will support USB
C power and place first of all let us
see if this will charge the iPhone by
itself yes okay immediately pops up that
it is charging so the battery is working
now this needs to charge wait does it
charge it put down or something stupid
you know let's gonna have wireless
charging on the back right how do I ever
know if this is charging though there's
no like the LEDs are on the back so if
you put it facedown so right now the
battery bank is wirelessly charging the
case supposedly which is then charging
the phone which is definitely getting a
charge from something in the stack right
now if that's not enough how about some
air power or some knockoff air power so
I guess part of this is for the iPhone
and part of this is for the Apple watch
I think oh so that's the watch charger
which pops up Wow is this actually might
not be garbage I totally assumed it
would be terrible okay step 1 we have a
wirelessly charging Apple watch now it's
actually really cool as is now can this
monstrosity charge this isn't charged
via wireless does it this is a it
charges the phone wirelessly it doesn't
actually take wireless power
all right I'm just gonna we're just
gonna move past that don't worry about
it it's fine I'm just gonna put the
iPhone on the charger and pretend that I
totally knew the my wireless charging
sandwich is going to work okay so I just
do this Hey look air power
it actually works what this stupid thing
actually works we've got the watch
charging we've got the phone charging
don't worry about the case and the
battery bank that's all totally fine I'm
actually really impressed with the air
power and though this is not me just
clinging desperately on to any small
part of my contraption that actually is
working today so if you guys want to
check out anything that does work
including the wonderful Marshall Cobra
and to speaker which is linked in the
description alongside some of the other
slightly less impressive products you
can go check that out and if you excuse
me I'm going to go listen to some music
really loudly and charge my things
wirelessly I hope</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
