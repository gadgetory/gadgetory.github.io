the tour of the PlayStation Vita so I
haven't had this for long enough to do
my full review but I can do is give some
of my first impression some of the
things have been jumping out at me in
this first few hours of gameplay so the
first thing and probably most important
the thing that I've liked is the screen
it's a full 5-inch OLED display and I've
got to say it's really really nice so of
course you're not going to lose a lot of
the quality through you know my camera
and youtube processing and all that kind
of stuff but take a look at one for
yourself the colors are fantastic really
really rich vibrant a viewing angles in
fact you can see that in YouTube viewing
angles are practically perfect I mean it
you have to that mean even there you can
still see make out everything just fine
really impressive stuff I can't say
enough about the screen I take this a
hundred times over the 3ds 3d effects
are nice but having a nice clear
high-resolution display is way better
now continuing on with what's on the
display you guys will see here here's
the UI uh the UI is something that is
going to take me a little while to get
used to it's not bad so of course you
can get through there to all your
different applications so if I want to
open photos and just tap on that and
what happens is it adds in a little
spaces so if you guys can see up top
right I'll bring it close to the camera
you guys can see these four little dots
right here basically what that does is
show you what kind of apps that you have
open so if I want to open the camera I
can hit start or if I want to get rid of
it you just swipe it away same thing
goes if you lock the Vita
you hit the power button and then you
just kind of do that to unlock it
um it's alright um you can also if you
hold down something you can create new
spaces so if I want I can just add new
space and you know drag apps around you
could also change the backgrounds and
all that kind of stuff for each of your
spaces like I said the UI is alright
it's going to take some getting used to
I'm not a huge fan of the circular
bubbles and all that kind of stuff but
you know being able to swipe and you
know come over here and open the
PlayStation Store go back to my game is
pretty nice another thing I really like
are the controls so the PS Vita is
packed with pretty much every control
you can think of it's got a d-pad it
also has dual analog sticks these are
fantastic in fact I'll get you guys nice
close-up it's got nice action and you
can see they protrude up quite a bit so
of course that's not maybe the greatest
for in your pocket but unlike the PSP
which only had
one small flat little stick and even the
3ds which is the same way these really
learn themselves well to you know being
really good for playing games which is
which is whether they're for so in
addition to the physical controls you
have of course it's a touchscreen and if
I flip it over on the back and mine the
finger prints it's this whole thing is a
fingerprint magnet but this is also a
rear touch panel so some games such as
little deviants uses the rear touch
panel so you can I push the ground that
better thing and I'll have gameplay
demos up soon but there's that and
there's also an accelerometer and a
gyroscope so their motion and tilt
controls and that kind of stuff so it's
fun as that goes sony is really just
thrown everything at it you can pretty
much control this using anything you
like and i like that it really works
well of course there's lots more that i
haven't covered yet so of course there's
both a front and rear facing camera
there's a web browser there's a PS store
there's the battery life that hurts the
gameplay which tends to be pretty
important so to make sure you don't miss
any of my videos covering all these
different topics definitely be sure to
subscribe to the channel where you will
be notified whenever i post a new video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
