here with the tour of my office as well
as how I felt my videos of course before
any proper office tour begins we got to
start with the most important thing
which is the dog so Sam would you like
to say anything no this is my dog Sam if
you guys ever succumb to d3 live you've
probably seen him before
he's pretty much lives in my office so I
figured hey what kind of office tool
would be complete without a dog bin
right guys yeah this is my office look
what walk around him here I also set up
my lighting cameras and all that kind of
good stuff to kind of give you guys an
idea
it's that quite setup how I usually do
it not can explain why in a minute but
mostly just because I want to have a
little bit of room to walk around says
what you start with my filming set up
and I'll go ahead and move on to some of
the cool stuff we got in my office so
you guys can see here I had three light
boxes I have one above the camera I have
one that's not quite right but usually
it's kind of facing that general
direction
and I've got this one here which is
facing back gets that wall but just
because I want to get a little bit more
light in here I switch it around here oh
these are some really nice light boxes
when I give you guys a little look at it
from the back so you have a couple of
options so you can go ahead and for
example flip off two of the lights or
flip off all four so you do a little bit
of flexibility there I really appreciate
that because usually this one's kind of
like at half power so just so it doesn't
blow my face out so let me pull this
back and show you guys the interior
where all the cool stuff happens you can
see here it's got four lights with kind
of a reflective thing and it's got this
which kind of softens the light thus the
name soft marks so this is like to use
the great for video not a whole lot else
to say than I do really like them of
course you guys I've ever done video or
you know anything about it
you know that you absolutely absolutely
have to have good lighting I mean even a
good camera is not gonna do you that
much good unless you actually have some
good light so there's a little tip for
you guys there I also apologies in
advance that the camera quality isn't
fantastic or the audio I'm just using my
iPhone to record this since all my gear
I won't actually show you guys and it's
kind of hard to film gear with your gear
your reception anyway so moving on we
had my camera this is a Nikon d3100 you
guys can see from all right there this
is the camera actually been using for
about a year and a half or so
I like this camera a lot I've done a
couple videos on it so if you guys want
more information definitely feel free to
go check that out it's a really solid
camera there's definitely some things I
wish it had and I don't imagine option
to be using this for too much longer
it's time for an upgrade but it is a
silly really solid camera pretty much
95% of the videos I film our films with
this camera so if you guys want an idea
of the quality watch any of my videos
from the past year or so and you'll
definitely get a good idea of what it's
all about
usually I pair it with the Nikon 50
millimeter 1.8 lens great lens distance
II here when I kind of set up in my
studio deal we got the camera kind of
microphone then I sit roughly in that
general direction and it works pretty
nicely great depth of field Williams
really saw it lens wide just flat flat
the camera you call that what have you
called turning it on now yeah so I'm
going to turn the camera on just so you
guys can see it's usually how I film my
videos so you know I'm there I'm talking
something I hope you guys have all seen
before someone just turn that off and
move on to the next step which is going
to be the zoom h1 microphone again
another really cool piece of tech that I
really enjoy this is actually something
I've recently started using I've had
this in for a while took it to CES with
me this year in January so all the audio
for my CES videos was filmed on this and
if you guys have ever been to a major
trade show you know just how
ridiculously stupid loud it isn't there
but the zoom h1 will did a fantastic job
of getting me some really nice audio on
the show floor so great a great little
microphone and what I've now done is now
done my words have failed me I've got it
on a little just a little cheap tripod
and what I do is I just kind of set it
right about here I spin my chair around
and kind of face towards the camera and
this just goes right underneath the shot
so you guys can't see it but all the
audios film with the zoom h1 at least
when you see me talking to the camera
that's all the audios film from this
little guy I know that's a little silly
to have a little battery-powered
microphone on a full-sized camera tripod
but it works and that's all that really
matters to me moving right along here if
show you got some that just second I do
want to kind of
tweet this out now this is something I
bought a couple months ago or so to do a
review on and I did a review on it but
wasn't happy with how it turned out I
haven't gotten around to refilling it
but this is just a little wall outlet
the kind of ads USB ports so just you
can set right in here you have to rewire
anything like that you still plug in a
normal whatever right here you also have
a pair of USB port so you can charge
your iPad smartphone or one of the
millions of different things that uses
USB to charge it really awesome will
gadget if you guys want to check that
out I'll have a link to this as well as
pretty much everything that I show in
this video in the description of this
video so you guys want to check out more
go for it let's go and sit down at my
desk here hey you continue on there's a
lot of stuff for you guys to hopefully
don't mind watching a long video next up
is going to be my clips oh no my finger
is in the shot that's like my pet peeve
justjust there's a kind of a side note
until the off topic if someone ever puts
their finger in front of the lens like I
want to do violent things to them so
I've got to be really careful but anyway
yeah this is the blue Yeti this is the
microphone I used to use for all of my
videos now I'm mostly just use it for
voiceovers and you know different things
like that usually got a pop filter on
here but took it off the other day just
because it was kind of it's a giant pop
filter I'll put a link in the
description to it too but it's just big
say like a big stand on the back end
kind of takes up a lot of desk space so
I took that off but yeah this is a great
microphone do you see it in my videos
sitting right about here so if you
looked over at the camera you can see it
but uh cool microphone very very cool it
is USB powered which is good and bad
it's good because of course it's very
simple you just plug huh whoa whoa whoa
okay I gotta be careful really hard I'm
holding the phone with like a claw grip
right now anyway I was saying this is a
USB powered so you plug it into any Mac
or PC I actually don't have this on
because you guys Intel this is very very
loud and while I don't mind normally for
videos that drives me crazy so you know
this is off and this is plugged into the
MacBook Air whenever I need to record
which is over there Russia does that
second moving on here we have the
computer again you guys are probably
seeing this
again this all should be pretty familiar
to you guys this is in the background of
almost all of my videos this is a
custom-built PC I built about a year or
so ago in fact I once did a office slash
room tour whatever I titled it and that
was right after I finished building this
so it was about a year ago since then I
upgraded it to six terabytes of storage
which I know sounds just ridiculous but
I actually use it I got about four and a
half terabytes used at the moment I save
all my video files and all the project
files and the audio and blah blah blah
blah blah which eats up tons of storage
and it's really nice to have that stuff
around because all the time you know I
do a video on something I'm like oh yeah
I did a video on it six months ago I can
use a clip of that does that happen to
try to refill or in the case of CES get
all kinds of cool footage and use it all
year round so pretty cool stuff some of
the other specs just to go over really
quickly core i7 2604 gigahertz very
modest overclock especially considering
all the fans I've got well that looks
really dusty yeah forgot to clean this
before I did this in anyway we'll go
ahead and just ignore that but yeah core
i7 we've got 16 gigs of RAM which I just
recently upgraded again that six
terabytes of storage as well as a
hundred twenty eight gets SD Radeon 6850
graphics card or 750 watt power supply
also I did a video on this before so
again most of the stuff I've done videos
on so if you guys want more information
and I want to go to attend an
explanation of everything go and check
out my build a PC the $1400 one so this
is the fourteen hundred dollar computer
I built which it has been upgrade like I
said since then but yeah awesome
computer love it a lot
moving on here is what I steer it pretty
much every single day it is my assist 23
inch monitor yeah pretty good monitor
it's an IPS display of 1080p etc etc etc
very cool sorry I'm trying to hold the
camera steady but yeah
monitor it's it's amazing and stuff also
up top here I do have my webcam which is
just a logitech c310
nothing all that specials is what I
stream with d3 live and when I do Google
Hangouts Google Plus hangouts right
there and all that kind of stuff so it's
alright it's films in 720p and I do have
a review of that but I do need to
upgrade cuz it's not particular
amazing webcam what move over here we
have my router and modem and all that
exciting cables so I've got like mini
display USB there's actually nothing
interesting in there but moved in my
microphone out of the way up top here
you guys can see I do have some DVDs
like any good nerd I have a whole
spindle of DVDs that come in handy so
you know recovery discs Windows OS 10
Linux pretty much any kind of project I
do you know I can pull out a DVD and go
hey I need to go install I don't know
tiger on a computer or something I'm so
comes in and II wouldn't move on here
got just some cables and audio splitters
okay here's something I just got this
into review this is a Tokyo flash watch
so I'm gonna look for a review on this
coming soon I just need to get it
resized because it's too big for me um
you can just kind of remove links but
haven't gotten around to figuring out
how to do that yet so it's kind of in
the drawer right now
continuing on here we have some
different things I've got some business
cards tripod head USB and just junk
adapters a 3ds charger I think all that
interesting down here's where I keep
some of my devices so here is put on an
iPod Touch 4th generation we do have a
Samsung Focus flash I actually like this
phone quite a bit but unfortunately it's
on AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon is not all that
useful to me and also we have my very
first smartphone yes I had a palm pixi
Plus this was my first smartphone before
I got the iPhone yeah now let's say
about it it's actually wasn't that bad
of a phone to be honest like nowadays
you know after I've actually used a
decent phone like an iPhone and rittany
but back in the day that was actually
not a bad phone I liked it quite a bit
also here is a case for an iPhone 5
yeah back before the 4s came out
everyone thought hey it's gonna be a
4-inch iPhone 5 I actually bought a case
for that was supposedly for the 5 and of
course it never came out so this is kind
of useless but I hope that one day I
will have an iPhone that fits in there
so I can just say haha told you so
because if you guys remember I was
pretty much convinced that we were gonna
have an iPhone 5
I didn't turn out too well did it over
here we have my headphones is the audio
technica ath and fifties whoa a mess of
my microphone here audio technica ath
and 50s great headphones I've done
videos on them before so if you want to
check that out feel free to do so
also Marcus Brownlee and I just finished
giving away a pair of these so awesome
alright so moving over here we've got my
sunglasses which is not all that
interesting we have a couple of boxes ah
I love boxes it's just something I like
to keep around so I've got a core i7 box
as well as the box for my 4s alright
let's go ahead and move around here
again there's a dog we just decided to
pass out Kanna happens frequently as you
guys can see some of my cable management
and whatnot you know it's still not all
that great but it's a little bit less
messy than just cables all over the
place alright so we got a little
bookshelf here we have iPad one do you
guys see this is an iPad one actually
it's a paper iPad pudding that I made
before it came out this is actually an
April Fool's Day joke so back in 2010
but right before the original iPad came
out I basically made an April Fool's Day
joke saying hey I got the new iPad one
I'm gonna give it away and everything
and it was it was funny so yeah I just
can't keep that around to this kind of
cool right here we have a Amazon Kindle
Fire hello
yeah the Kindle Fire I was excited about
it I mean it was only $200 it's just an
of course pretty good for a tablet but
the software on this was just so bad
so I I only read books on it to be
honest it's just not my thing
I'll probably end up selling it soon we
just haven't gotten around to it oh yeah
oh we have any Intel packet but you guys
probably aren't interested in we do have
an otterbox stand so I've actually used
this in many videos but I had a lot of
questions about it it's just a really
simple stand it folds up if I could show
you guys if I had more than one hand see
you just put a phone or whatever in
there comes in handy he was just a box
for that Tokyo flash watch I showed you
guys here a bunch of copies of Corel
VideoStudio which I got from the video
studio booth while I was there
official YouTube speaker person in
Orlando last month actually ought to
give those away or something over here
we've got some spindle of new DVDs and
CDs I actually had to get a couple of
DVDs the other day
and like you know I just go buy some and
hopefully that's all the DVDs I'll have
to ever have to buy
I hear floppy drives are coming back so
they can just give me some more of those
you got Super Smash Brothers Brawl which
is an awesome game and moving right on
along here we have the Pico Dali oh it's
hard to film and talk with one hand yes
talking with one is difficult yeah okay
maybe not this is the Pico Dali I'd open
it up and show you guys but again I'd
probably just drop it all over the place
it's just a little dolly it's like a
skateboard with wheels you guys can look
it up or if I can find any link to it
I'll put in the description
it's alright honestly I don't really
recommend it I mean it's okay maybe if
you have a lighter camera but well now
and I put my Nikon on there it's just to
having it bounces all around but I have
used it a few times over here nothing
all that exciting just some tools I've
got some soldering a soldering iron
solder some different bits and pieces I
occasionally use
I got my nerd kit here I've got bits
thermal paste screwdrivers that kind of
thing this is a new MacBook Pro for
giveaway no I just kidding just kidding
no I'm actually anyway who's listed just
a box I don't have a MacBook Pro but I
just got this box on inside that's all
my kind of project stuff so guys and
that's this D I'll show you and I don't
realize just some project stuff we've
got an SSD some RAM or drives nice
different things I use for my various
nerd like projects lastly you're not
really lastly but last on the Shelf you
just got a few things I mean to be
putting on eBay that haven't got around
to palm pixi plus just not the whole
same one I got a second one some speaker
audio technica at2020 microphone just a
few things that I haven't that I of
course I get a lot of crap and I'll need
to keep it so that's just some things I
haven't gotten around putting on eBay
yet but you
this one get up here and step around
this giant light box which is in my face
closet nothing exciting in the air
except boxes and stuff that it's messy
and I'll show you guys another dog
I don't maybe it's the same one now over
here and while that light is really I
mean that light really messes up the
exposure of the iPhone here is another
box like I said I thought key these
boxes around they look cool just for the
50 millimeter lens oh wait I have a
couple of extra light bulb since these I
have 12 light bulbs in here all on total
I just keep a couple extra around the
box is it expose enough I just keep it a
couple extra round I honestly I could PI
put those up but I haven't got around to
it the epson workforce 635 printer
scanner copier all that kind of fun
stuff i actually have a lot of games but
unfortunately there's a dog blocking the
door so let me go ahead and move him out
of the way all right
so one dog out of the way and i should
go ahead Truong the video light on my
phone and you guys can see some of my
video games so yeah i won't go over

cetera I've got a cool smartphone you've
never seen your entire life the green
Motorola Q on I'm lacking a hand

first camcorder dabangg do this with one
hand oh yeah and it's actually still got
battery okay I guess let's store to the
internal memory my first game quarter is

up so got a couple extra tripods with
video you know I got let's see 1 2 3 4 5

these always come in handy there's just
a little simple ones that uh it's always
handy if you want to add an extra camera
microphone light accessory cetera et
cetera always come in handy to have and
last but not least we have my review
table so yes I know it's terribly
scratched up and stuff I kind of focus
it which it doesn't look so bad on the
iPhone but it's all scuffed and there's
burn marks and I'm sorry sorry gone
wrong but yes this is what I do all my
reviews on so you just put a light there
like they're like here or here and I set
some tripods up basically what I film
I'm like wedged in a little corner and
there's like tripods and cameras and
microphones and lights oh actually
