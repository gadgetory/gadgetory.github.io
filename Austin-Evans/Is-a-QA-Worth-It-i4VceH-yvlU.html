time for another QA but before we get
into it this video was sponsored by
honor and their new view 10 put an
entire series talking about it over on
the honor channel with jonathan morrison
and sarah deechi and here's a sneak peek
here guys johnson here back again with
Austin Evans and Sarah Deecee we just
talked about AI and I got a surprise
surprise oh boy tell me what close your
eyes don't don't close your eyes Oh what
is it it is the honor of you 10 now word
on the street is is packing some power
inside now what I think is cool is if
you imagine it in the work environment
so say your team all had these in their
pocket so the idea is that everyone has
like an actually smart assistant to help
them kind of not be late to work or
remember to texting you when you're
coming in late to work yeah or like or
maybe a situation where you're out on
production in a different country maybe
and you have like the the actual
translation yes I've been in situations
where you have to do interviews or
meetings and it's sometimes a little
hard to communicate when you don't know
that language so I think AI has a lot to
do with taking data and taking so much
information and really packing it into
something that people can understand and
so especially you know we make videos we
collaborate with people I think bringing
that into like the workplace with a
collaboration saying oh this person
can't make it maybe your calendar
updates and depending on other
information you know it makes new plans
I think that's exciting and the idea
that having something smart that opens
up so many possibilities right where
it's like you might not necessarily
think like oh let me connect this dot
with that dog but the phone is like oh I
know this is what you're doing and this
is you know who you're talking to like
the more information it knows and when
it's actually has some intelligence
behind it it can sort of connect a lot
of dots and make your life easier in a
lot of ways they you might not
necessarily think of what's the dumbest
thing that's completely ruined a video
we didn't quite lose the video but there
was a project that we shot actually a
few months ago where I deleted all the
raw footage before it was finished so
what I ended up doing was I took the
export that we had done sort of like the
temporary version and then I just recut
that and put it back
together as a video since the house fire
happened and you moved do you think it
helped or hindered your future compared
to if it had never happened amen
I think it helped things were going well
for me before it but the fire was really
kind of like a wake-up call to me and it
was sort of a forced fresh start which I
like to think was a good thing what is
the difference between your video
editing and Ken's video editing so
there's been some rumors going around
that ken edits all of our videos however
that is completely false
Jimmy carried a comment everyone's gonna
find out what I find so the way we do
our edits is actually Jimmy does I would
say 95% of our edits these days yep like
I'll do it a little bit here and there
but he's editing this video right now
make a thumbnail for this video yourself
don't let Ken do it all right so this is
me I'm very blurry and then this is this
is Ken a little-known fact actually
taught Ken how to make us thumbnails and
this is this is how every one of them
starts it's like this and then here's a
giant smile because Ken's just a happy
kind of guy there you go that is how to
create a thumbnail what was a transition
like from being a single person rodeo to
a team specifically with Ken well now
it's great but I distinctly remember
Ken's first day in which he forgot the
lens adapter and a microphone cable and
then at one point I'm pretty sure I took
the camera away from you and just shot
myself it was a how much of your Twitter
timeline is filled with Ken's anime
retweets over 90% alright so for all of
you guys who are smart enough to follow
ken on Twitter the best way of doing it
is to mute his retweets because Ken he
tweets some great stuff his retweets a
little questionable hey Austin when are
you getting married just kidding suggest
some best laptops or video editing
generally speaking gaming laptops are
pretty good for video editing and I
really like the Acer predator Helios 300
so now I have a GTX 1060 but it also has
a core i7 plenty of memory and SSD
that's great
and if you're on the final cut side of
things the Immaculate Pro 15 inch has
been honestly what I've been using to do
any kind of video editing for like a
year and a half now when did you move to
LA and get the office I actually moved
to LA in August of 2015 as
literally driving from Missouri to LA on
my birthday I originally actually worked
at a John's office so you guys probably
know Jon from TLD I worked out of his
office for almost a year actually until
we got this office that we've been in
for the last year and a half or so and
that's when Ken came on that's where we
kind of really started building things
up but yeah it's been a little over two
years at this point what piece of tech
are you most excited to see at CES I
feel like what I'm really really pumped
to see is more on the AI side of things
the self-driving side of things I know
that this CES actually got to ride in a
BMW that was fully self-driving or well
essentially fully self-driving I was
able to drive on the freeway take my
hands off the wheel talk to Ken in the
backseat and it totally just handled
everything so would be able to see more
stuff like that this year would be
awesome do you think Bitcoin is going to
fall down sometime and have you invested
in it I don't think it's going away
anytime soon to be totally honest I
think that it's going up it's a little
wild and volatile right now but
generally speaking I think it is sort of
trending upward and I haven't invested
my life savings in it but I do think
that there's potential I put a little
bit of money into it this kid never get
frustrated or annoyed between takes he
just seems so chill all the time you
guys have no idea
I live a personal hell every day I think
I'm on camera and everything's happy and
great and having a great time and then
Ken's just yelling orders at me do it
again you can do better than that
I'm not feeding my family with this it's
it's honestly kind of sad he pretends to
be chill but honestly it's it's not safe
I I need I need help - Ken how annoying
is it to work with the hey guys guy not
as annoying to me as it probably is to
Jimmy since he has to edit every video
at least I can listen to music while
Austin's talking so I can block it all
out hey Austin what's your favorite
fast-food restaurants I used to say Taco
Bell but since I moved to California
it's got to be in and out how much has
life changed since the start of your
YouTube channel so it's actually
reminded of this the other day someone
tweeted me a screenshot from a comment I
left our Marquez video seven years ago
talking about how my cousin nein was
great and I was basically totally
committed to making videos in 2010 so uh
a lot when I started the channel I was
16 living at home didn't have a job
didn't have any
money didn't have anything and I think
compared to then I feel like I'm a
different person like if we're being
totally honest I think that I had not
really fully grown up when I started the
channel I didn't really understand a lot
of things in life I feel like my life
could not have possibly turned out to be
any more different if I had not created
the channel and not made that first
video I honestly can't even picture
where I would be if I would have gotten
that job at Best Buy and so I lived in
Missouri forever like it's kind of scary
to think about to be totally honest
anyway that is going to be it for this
Q&amp;amp;A of course if you guys have any more
questions feel free to hit me up on
Twitter and as always Ken we'll catch
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
