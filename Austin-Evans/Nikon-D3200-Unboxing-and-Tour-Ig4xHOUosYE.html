here with an unboxing of the Nikon d3200
as the successor to the very
well-regarded D 3100 this has quite a
few new features so let's take a look
what I have here is the D 3200 with the
18 to 55 millimeter kit lens which is
the most common way you'll find the
camera once you pop the top you'll find
a few things including your warranty
information also included is a nikon
school invite a CD with the nikon view
and x2 software the user manual on CD as
well as a paper manual in both english
and spanish
next up you'll find the box that
contains your accessories in here is a
USB cable an AV cable your Nikon strap
and a cover for the viewfinder also
included is your MH 24 battery charger
and your en el 14 battery both of which
carry over from the D 3100 the next box
contains the kit lens this is the same
1855 millimeter the Nikon has had around
for a while and as a solid starter zoom
lens for the D 3200 the last box
contains the D 3200 itself wrap nice and
snug inside bubble wrap if first glance
the camera looks quite similar to the D
3100 and that's because it is the DSLR
still made out of a reasonably solid
feeling plastic but just about
everything from the texture to each
surface and button has been tweaked
around back you'll find the 3-inch
921,000 dot display which is a major
improvement the live view switch from
the D 3100 is now a button and you can
also notice some tweaks in the thumb
grip and a new button allowing you to
change your shooting mode up top the
mode selector has been removed and the
video record button is now between the
info and the aperture / exposure button
the grip is still a bit small for some
people but it's also been tweet as has
the placement of the shutter button on
the left side you'll see a button to use
the flash as well as a function button
which you can customize to adjust your
ISO image quality or white balance
beneath the rubber flap you'll see a
proprietary port for GPS or the Wi-Fi
dongle mini HDMI out a combo USB and AV
out port as well as a 3.5 millimeter
microphone jack which is a huge deal for
video shooters like myself over on the
right side you'll see a single SD card
slot which can handle SD SDHC and SDXC
memory cards on bottom you'll find a
tripod mount as well as the door that
houses the battery with a 24 megapixel
sensor minyul control over both video
and audio and optional Wi-Fi
connectivity the D 3200 has a lot
going for it if you want to see more on
the camera check out my full review in
comparison with the D 3100 as soon as
they're uploaded if you enjoyed
