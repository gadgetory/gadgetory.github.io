video going over a PC built for $1000 so
a lots changed in the last couple of
months since I did my last PC build
video so the Intel Ivy Bridge processors
are now out so not only are they a
little bit faster but they also take a
bus power so when when they're and on
top of that AMD and NVIDIA both released
all kinds of new graphics cards so let's
go and take the best of the best and
create a thousand dollar gaming machine
to kick our build off I'm going to be
using the Intel Core i5 35 70 K CPU now
for the past year and a half or so the
i5 2500 K is one of my favorite CPUs for
gaming computers and this is the
successor overall this is gonna be very
similar to the previous generation i5 so
it's still gonna have four cores without
hyper-threading support itself it's
still going to be close to 3.4 gigahertz
however the major difference is since
this is one of the new Ivy Bridge
processors is now based on the new Intel
22 nanometer process now this means a
couple of things for starters it's gonna
be a little bit faster for the most part
so don't expect any kind of major major
differences however it's still gonna be
very very fast and still gonna work
really really well for pretty much
anything you throw at it
on top of that it's also gonna take up a
little bit less power so instead of
being a 95 watt part it's not going to
be a 77 watt part so it's gonna be a
little bit easier on your power supply
your motherboard all that kind of good
stuff this is a case series CPU you
should be able to overclock it well in
excess of 4 gigahertz which makes it an
awesome start for a build for $250 we're
also going to be using a cooler master
hyper 212 plus CPU cooler and by default
you're gonna get a CPU cool or a lot
like this well this is alright for base
clock speeds and some kind of moderate
overclocking if you want to do some
major stuff and you wanna get the best
performance out of your CPU a hyper 212
Plus will be fantastic it comes with one
fan and if you'd like you can add a
secondary fan for push-pull airflow
about twenty-five dollars this is gonna
be a great addition to our build for a
motherboard we're going to be going with
a gigabyte gaz 77 d3h now I use a
gigabyte board in my build and this
one's got all the features that you need
this is one of the new z77 boards which
means it features full support for all
the cool new features in Ivy Bridge so
that means they will fully support
processor overclocking it also now
supports PCI Express 3.0 it also has USB
3.0 built into the chipset it fully
supports the intel HD 4000 graphics
built into your cpu so if you ever need
is there it also has a dual UEFI bios so
if you have any problems overclocking
your updating your bios you can always
revert to the backup and you're gonna be
good to go and of course it does have
USB 3 port as well
three six gigabit per second which gives
it pretty much all the major features
you need for about $120 for a graphics
card we're going to be using the asustor
Radeon 7850 this is gonna give us plenty
of power to run pretty much any of
today's games totally maxed out with two
gigabytes of gddr5 vram this is gonna
have plenty memory to handle pretty much
anything you throw at it on top of that
it's also based on the new twenty eight
nanometer process so just like with
Ivybridge what this means is more
performance with less power draw it also
fully supports PCI Express 3.0 it also
has a Seuss's direct Cu cooling
technology basically what that means is
that it's gonna have dual fans so it's
gonna be really good if you want to
overclock that what you devil it can do
and it's gonna give you some really
awesome performance for about $250 per
memory we're going to be using eight
gigabytes of Corsair Vengeance ddr3 RAM
those are the same stuff that I use in
my computer although this is with the
lower profile heat sinks now basically
the major difference is is that with the
low profile heatsink you can have more
room to mount a secondary fan on your
hyper 212 plus seat you cooler now again
not a huge deal if you want to get the
different version with the bigger heat
sinks by all means go ahead but overall
some really solid stuff for about fifty
five dollars for storage we're going to
be using a pair of drives starting with
an SSD no no sometimes I get some flack
from you guys about including an SSD in
my game build if you want to continue
using the caviar black by all means go
ahead however in my opinion an SSD is
totally a hundred and ten percent worth
it
le doesn't make your system way faster I
mean come on it's a gaming PC you don't
want to have a slow pokey old hard drive
in there but on top of that there are
actually not all that expensive
especially considering that SSD prices
are going down and hard drive prices are
still high so yeah we're gonna go ahead
and use an SSD in this one and ozz
agility 360 gigabyte SSD ought to do the
trick now be the first to admit sixteen
gigabytes is not a lot of storage cover
all you need to do is just install your
operating system your major programs and
games you know just this kind of stuff
that you need super fast access to
everything else can go on your secondary
hard drive now beyond that it may not be
the fastest or the best SSD in the world
for about sixty dollars it's absolutely
gonna smoke any kind of physical hard
drive out there for our main storage
drive we're going to be using a Seagate
Barracuda 2 terabyte 7200 rpm Drive now
this is going to be plenty of speed to
put on all your kinds of music pictures
media you can also install extra a
couple of games on there if you want and
on top of that since you've got two
terabytes that's gonna have plenty of
space for pretty much all your stuff for
about $110 it's gonna be a great
addition to our build for power supply
we're going to be going
with an OSI ZMOT Extreme Pro 6nr what
much they're supplying with 600 watts of
capacity it's gonna have plenty of power
to run our build as well as if you do
any upgrades as far as hard drives fans
that kind of stuff on top of that since
it's a modular supply that means that
you don't have a massive pile of cables
in your case simply plug in what you
need right at all you're gonna be good
to go for about $50 for a case we're
going to be using the antique 300 to do
I like this for quite a few reasons for
starters it's a nice big case so you get
plenty of room for all your kind of
awesome high-end hardware that you're
about to pack in there on top of that
you also have a really nice airflow so
since we're gonna be overclocking and
you want of course got a lot of nice
cool air flow to make sure everything
doesn't explode because exploding is bad
so you have nice air flow and you also
have quite a few extra fan mounts if you
want to kind of improve the airflow and
change it up all for about $70 is an
absolutely awesome case to start with
for an optical drive we're going to be
going with the missus DVD burner now
this is kind of optional I know a lot of
people don't even use optical drives
anymore however I've definitely pundit
it can be helpful of course you want
installed windows you want to install
any kind of programs that's on a disk it
definitely can't come in handy of course
if you let skip this you get like an or
if you want to upgrade to a blu-ray
definitely feel free but otherwise it's
gonna run you about twenty two dollars
and the other option is going to be
Windows 7 now I used to include this in
all my build
whoever got a lot of feedback from you
guys saying hey I don't need Windows 7
I've got an older version of Windows or
I'm gonna be using Linux or I've got
Windows 8 so if you want to go ahead and
skip this feel free but otherwise it is
gonna be a hundred dollars so what's the
damage overall the build is gonna cost
you one thousand thirteen dollars in 91
cents yeah yeah I know I lied I said
it's a thousand dollar bill but if you
gotta go flip your couch over fine head
extra $14 to go for it now definitely
keep in mind that prices are constantly
fluctuating so I have links to
everything in the description of this
video so keep in mind that by the time
you watch this it could be much higher
much lower or whatever but again all
links will be in the description if you
enjoyed this video definitely sure to
leave it a thumbs up really appreciate
that it helps me out and if you're
