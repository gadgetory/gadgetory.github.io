Plus hey guys this is Austin and today
I'm here with the video showing you how
to build a gaming PC for $500 so for
that money you could buy a console or
you can build yourself an awesome gaming
PC to start with let's take a look at
some games running on the $500 PC so
first of all we have battlefield 4 which
is definitely one of the best looking
games of 2013 now at the moment it's a
little bit glitchy especially on PC
however even with that we're still able
to run on medium settings at well over
60 frames per second next we have Crysis
3 another game that looks absolutely
fantastic even when you're running it on
low settings however with this PC we can
actually run on high at 1080p BioShock
Infinite is one of the most hyped games
of this year and it absolutely delivers
with great gameplay great story and of
course since it's running on a PC great
graphics as here we're able to run on
very high settings last but not least we
have Metro last light one of my surprise
favorite games of this year and here
we're going to be able to play it on
normal settings again at 1080p to kick
the build off we're going to be using an
AMD athlon x4 7 60 K so this is an
absolutely perfect processor for this
build as it is a quad core CPU that
clocks all the way up to four point one
gigahertz right out of the box which is
kind of insane when you consider this is
a $500 PC so as it is a K series part
that means that you can overclock it so
if you'd like you can buy a little bit
better cooling try to get even more
power out of the CPU but as is it's
going to run you about $90 for the
motherboard we're going to be using an
MSI a 78 M II 35 so this is the follow
up to one of my favorite boards that
I've used to a ton of my builds recently
and adds a few additional features on
top of the standard step that you would
expect clothing obviously support for
our processor as well as overclocking
but this also supports the new FM 2
Kaveri APU which I actually did a video
on a little bit ago so you will actually
be able to upgrade the CPU later on if
you choose it does have all the rest of
the bells and whistles including USB 3
SATA 3 and now it also does have a PCI
Express 3.0 slot so you get all your
threes covered and this is going to run
you about sixty-five dollars for the
graphics card we're going to be using a
two gigabyte EVGA GTX 650 Ti boost so
this is a great card for a build like
this so as you guys saw earlier it has
plenty of power to handle games at 1080p
and also importantly does
come with two gigabytes of memory on
board so more and more games are needing
lots and lots of memory so having that
extra gig of ram over some other
different cards which only have a single
gig can definitely make a difference now
unfortunately the 650 Ti boost is a
little bit hard to find right now it's
out of stock a lot of places so I will
also include the link to the AMD r7 260x
in the description very similar to card
very similar performance in price so if
you can't find the 650 Ti boost
definitely be sure to go check out the
r7 260x for memory we're going to be
using a gigabytes of Crucial Ballistix
sport ram so i've heard a lot of good
stuff about this so I figured it'd be
worth a shot to try for this bill and
I've got to say I'm impressed so one
nice thing about this in particular is
that it is a single 8 gigabyte stick of
RAM so because this motherboard only
does have 2 dem slots that means we can
drop this 8 gigs in and the single dim
and if we'd like we can grab another a
gig stick drop it in there and we will
have 16 gigabytes in our systems a very
easy upgrade path it also is rated at
1600 megahertz so it's going to be more
than fast enough for pretty much
anything you need to do it's going to
run you about $70 for a hard drive we're
going to be using a one terabyte Western
Digital caviar blue so hard drives
definitely aren't the most exciting
thing however the caviar blue series is
a solid line and with this one you do
get one terabyte of capacity which means
you've got plenty of room for your music
your videos your games all that kind of
fun stuff and also it is going to be
decently fast so definitely nowhere near
an SSD it's also going to cost you way
less than one terabyte SSD so this is a
solid choice for $70 for the power
supply we're going to be using a 430
watt corsair CX 430 so if you guys have
watched my budget builds before you know
that i absolutely love to use this power
supply as with 430 watts it's going to
be more than that for the build even
with a few upgrades and also very very
importantly it's going to be a reliable
power supply so you can think of this as
the beating heart of your build
if you cheap out here it can absolutely
cause huge damage in the rest of your
system so that's why this is a solid
supply i've used lots of them and have
never failed me it's also an 80 plus
bronze certified supplies so will even
save you a little bit on your power bill
all for about $45 for a case we're going
to be using the ROS well line em so it
used this in my $600 bill and I was
impressed with it so I decided to give
it a shot for this one as well so this
is a micro ATX case which means it's
going to be
a bit smaller than what you see behind
me here that's definitely a good thing
on my opinion as you get a lot less
weight and a lot less bulk on your desk
however it still has all the features
you would expect so it has USB 3.0 ports
as well as USB 2.0 ports is decently
built for a budget case and it does have
two fans so you have 120 millimeter fan
in the front as well as the back giving
you actually surprisingly good airflow
for a fairly budget case so this is
going to be a great choice for $55 so
there you go everything you need to
build yourself an awesome $500 gaming PC
now as always prices are constantly
changing so I will have links to
everything I mentioned in the
description of this video including that
extra graphics card also in the
description I will have a tutorial show
you how to actually put this PC together
so use this for my 2014 build guide so
