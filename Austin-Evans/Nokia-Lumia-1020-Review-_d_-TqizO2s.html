here with the review of the Nokia Lumia
1020 now this is a very special phone
for one reason a ridiculous 41 megapixel
camera so let's take a look as far as
the design goes you'd be hard-pressed to
tell it apart from a Lumia 920 from the
front only when you flip it around do
you notice the Bulge for the camera and
Zeon flash it does make letting the
phone down on its back a bit weird
sometimes but it really wasn't a big
deal and yes I'll go over camera
performance in a minute you'll find all
of your buttons along the right edge
including volume rocker sleep-wake and
two-stage shutter button for focusing
and snapping a picture it's still
available and some flashy colors like
this yellow and in typical Nokia fashion
the build quality is top-notch it's made
out of a fantastic polycarbonate that's
both matte and incredibly soft to the
touch
giving it a great feel in the hand I'm a
big fan of metal and smartphones but
I've got to say props to Nokia the 1020
is a solid and well-built phone on board
you'll find a familiar sight a 4.5 inch
1280 by 768 screen running Windows Phone
8 spec wise the phone isn't really
anything special the screen is good
without being able to match the
excellent 1080p displays on the HTC One
or galaxy s4 a feature I found
surprisingly useful is that the screen
will show you the time when it's not in
your pocket which doesn't seem to have
much of a battery life penalty it has a
1.5 gigahertz dual-core Snapdragon s4
along with 2 gigabytes of RAM and while
that's hardly groundbreaking it's good
enough for Windows Phone navigating
around the OS is nice and snappy and
with the 2 gigabytes of RAM multitasking
works well allowing you to jump in and
out of apps without much delay with such
a high megapixel camera thankfully Nokia
is included 32 gigabytes of storage
standard with the phone battery life is
alright
it only has a 2,000 milliamp hour
battery which was just enough to last me
through a normal day however keep in
mind that shooting pictures and video
will eat into your battery quickly I
won't go too in depth into Windows Phone
8 as it's practically identical to what
you'll find on other phones like the
Lumia 920 but two big things stick out
to me first of all while slowly but
surely app support is getting better
there's still a lot missing seriously
there's no Instagram on a phone with a
ridiculously great camera the game
selection is mediocre especially
considering the Xbox Live integration
and some of the apps that are here
quite match up to their iOS and Android
counterparts the biggest problem for me
is someone who uses a lot of Google
stuff is none of its here at all there's
a Google Search app which is nothing
special but beyond that you had better
get used to using the mobile sites Gmail
and Google Calendar support is alright
but apps like hangouts Google+ and drive
are all missing any sort of official
apps by far the most important part of
the Lumia 1020 however is the camera it
can be summed up very easily this is the
best camera you'll find on a phone
period like its spiritual successor the
PureView 808 is packing an almost absurd
41 megapixel sensor with so many pixels
to work with you can zoom way in after
the fact without losing much quality at
all you can also get some Pleasant depth
of field to really isolate your subject
which is something that's much harder to
achieve with other phones image quality
is very good with decent dynamic range
and stupid amounts of detail when you
snap a shot the phone saves two files
one full resolution shot and one five
megapixel picture that's been over
sampled this makes it a lot easier to
share the full registrars can be over
twelve megabytes which is too big for
many places online with so many pixels
crammed into the sensor raw pictures are
a bit soft but the oversampled versions
sharpen up things nicely although this
does add a bit of noise in some shots to
go along with the new camera nokia has a
pro camera app which is great if you
just want a quick shot you can snap away
in full auto mode which is smart and
good about nailing the exposure and
focus with a simple flick though you can
have manual control over exposure
shutter speed ISO focus and white
balance with the camera this good being
able to really fine-tune your image can
be a huge help for example when shooting
in low-light in auto mode the Lumia
can't quite pull in as much light as the
excellent HTC One but it has a terrific
job of keeping noise in check take
control with a longer exposure however
and you can really pull off nice shots
and practically no light the only
downside is that the dual-core CPU
inside the Lumia does take a couple
seconds to process each shot but
thankfully there's no lag near where
else and taking the picture video is
fantastic as well with image
stabilization quiet focusing and
impressive smart autofocus algorithm the
phone can give you some very
nice-looking files
since you have so many megapixels to
work with digital zoom and video doesn't
hurt the quality much allowing you to
get some shots you absolutely couldn't
get on any other phone the stabilization
and focus can get a bit weird if you're
walking and manual controls during video
basically boil down to zooming with the
white balance focus and video light need
to be set before you hit record if
you're not a camera geek a lot of that
probably didn't make much sense but as
someone who shoots photos almost
entirely on smartphones this stuff is
very very exciting the Nokia Lumia 1020
is what Windows Phone is needed for a
while now a killer app the camera is
absolutely the best you'll find on any
phone and for a lot of people that's
going to be enough to switch now is a
perfect definitely not even though
Windows Phone has seen some major
improvements lately it is still lacking
behind in a few key areas and while the
specs are pretty decent both the screen
and the internals are only okay they
really don't match up some of the newest
and latest phones including the Samsung
Galaxy s4 as well as the HTC One and
seem to be the Apple iPhone 5s with a
non-contract price of $300 this isn't
for everyone but it is the most exciting
phone I've tried in quite a while so if
you have to have the best camera look no
farther than the Nokia Lumia 1020 so now
that you see my review what do you think
of the latest Lumia phone is it
something that you would pick up or are
there too many compromises definitely be
sure to let me know what you think in
