here with a brand new 500 gaming PC
build except this one uh well these guys
built it while I was out of the office
for a day Ken and Jimmy took it upon
themselves to get a little creative with
the next PC build what do we want the PC
to actually definitely needs a window
illegal bloody handprint from the inside
trap or something oh yeah so where do
you want to start a case first okay
that's like right in the Front's that's
easy enough so if you leave we are
usually in the back corner yeah Jimmy
knows illegal layouts and stuff this one
has the exact same layout as Laura J are
we going for a full-size like ATX or
micro ATX or water I think we we go for
ATX and work back okay $49.99 $9.99 and
I got a window and look the red accent
yeah if we wanted to do just say have a
500 watt card or a 500 watt power supply
it's hard to beat $14 yeah a cheap power
spoiler like this might not be the
craziest thing
this looks really cheap like a blocks
which are lucky and it feels like I'm
fireworks box
this is marginally better yeah okay so
that one is 30 bucks 30 bucks
okay so we'll put this questionably
cheap power supply in hand cannon Jimmy
moved on to making some more mistakes
that penny mg 4400 is only 55
there's only 55 dollars so this
motherboard costs 60 bucks which cheap
which is that's pretty cheap yeah we're
still I think we're still under budget I
think we're doing pretty fine right now
so if we get this let's say right yeah
is there a big difference between just a
1050 and a 1050 Ti this one's only 93
bucks yeah no that I think if we want to
go super budget that might not be the
worst move so we penny crunched a little
bit but we have a little bit more money
to spend here yes so we're gonna go look
out for some SSDs which they're actually
recently priced so naturally the next
place to go is the Halloween store
because reasons I mean that looks like
the regular one because glow-in-the-dark
will probably not look good inside I
think this is good this one got really
fake looking this one that one this is
the one that we want if we get a little
bit of fake blood and put it on that
it'll look a lot better ten dollars so
we're good this is okay four dollars so
we have a little bit of extra money to
spend here is there like a little thing
where we could get like some spiders or
whole was he likely figured out like big
spiders and stuff three bucks each
so how many do how much money with like
$13 let's get two so we just finished
the Halloween decoration portion of this
and I think we did pretty well yeah like
so we walked out of there spending
twenty three dollars so if my math is
right I think we have four dollars left
over yeah so we're actually under budget
here so Austin you should be pretty
proud of us on this one so we've been
sitting in about three hours worth of
traffic to come back to work
but we got all of our stuff for our PC
but we also got some Halloween stuff
yeah helped design this thing and make
it our own like I've never actually done
any case modding before and I think this
is the like the the 9 year old arts and
crafts version yeah of what every other
PC youtuber does but I'm excited
all right so Jimmy did a really awesome
job putting all of the spider webs in
here we got some not actual spiders but
some really okay looking like plastic
spiders but they'll do the job they'll
look good in the light exactly and now
Jimmy's gonna do the blood hand splatter
on the glass for the inside of the case
they're gonna do a little bit of leg
just to add texture to it yeah that's
good all right so I'm gonna get my
oversized hand just nice and nice and I
don't want to make sure that a lot of
black on there yeah just gonna do a real
real perfect ah do like a like a slide
like a taper off oh my god I'm so happy
oh my god that actually looks really
good
hopefully it dries well yeah I'm gonna
go wash this off my hands now because I
don't want it to dry and me we got all
the cable management out of the way we
got our graphics things sorted out we
got windows installed we got webbed up
we got even more webbed up so now we're
gonna spin it around get it all going
we're gonna turn it on finish form whoo
oh my god guys we've been at this all
day gotta say I'm pretty stoked this is
awesome ready whoo oh my god I gotta see
this whoa that looks oh my god that is
so sick on you can see the little spider
in there oh it's so good it's so good
Wow we haven't played in the games yet
and honestly it is 11:13 I don't think
we're gonna play games tonight but we
will try come out tomorrow and reveal
the whole thing to Austin and hopefully
he'll like it
so I was gone on Friday and these guys
took the lead on building the PC but
from the little bits that I've heard so
far they may have gone a little bit over
the top with it
it's actually really cool I was
expecting this to be terrible
no offense this is actually really cool
yeah don't worry we thought it was gonna
be terrible to the cable management is
sufficiently spooky I'm already
terrified I gotta crack this open let's
see what you guys guys we're also about
the narrative too like this yes with the
hand like was trying to escape and then
like punched out the front like oh yeah
nobody with that graphic spread is it is
a 560 in arcs like six five sixty okay
and it's some Intel it was this me 250
is like a pentium or something yeah it's
a Pentium 4400 G okay I'm excite you
know what is this power supply it is not
not eighty plus and he was only $23
that's no don't do that yeah oh yeah
another power supply because who's 680
watts no it's not a wrinkle arm Engel
was literally just get this game running
oh I wish I had an audio what's going on
and you'd be able to hear me so if you
guys want to catch more spooky PC builds
with these guys make sure to subscribe
to the channel and if you excuse me I'm
gonna go play some outlast and probably
die before</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
