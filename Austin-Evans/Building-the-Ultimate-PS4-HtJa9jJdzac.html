yourself about this abomination about
this travesty is in front of me right
now
I didn't think so hey guys this is
Austin this disaster sits in front of me
are some of the most popular ps4
accessories not sure unlike a game PC
which you can fully customize the ps4 is
pretty much what you get is well what
you get however one curious about is
whether any of the stuff is remotely
worth it so to start with we have the
Nyko intercooler so they claims that
this is going to direct hot air away
from the console which in theory is
going to be a thing that actually could
be really helpful especially with the
old fat ps4 it could get really loud
under load some other things that drew
me to the intercooler is that this
actually is fairly well engage until ps4
design so as you'll see a second here it
basically just clips right on and that's
pretty much it so what we can have here
is it looks like one large fan a couple
of smaller fans and the cool part is it
actually has its own power pass-through
do I need to turn this thing on or off
or any extra cable it should just go on
the back this just clips into place I
think that actually integrates pretty
well I've got to say so it's even though
sort of same two-tone finish on the back
you still have access to all of your
ports and you can still plug in the
power cable right here now I'm curious
how well it will actually work but it's
worth a shot so if you're rocking the
ps4 slammer pro then Dobby has you
covered so this is the p4 series
multifunctional coolest and most exactly
how multi functional it really is so the
idea here is that not only can you
actually get a standard you can also
mount your controllers as well as some
games all in the one sedan so here this
is a little bit bigger this product can
decrease the temperature for the ps4
effectively improving its performance
and decreasing the power loss power loss
so these cooling products claim to lower
the temperature of the ps4 that really
shouldn't give you more performance the
real advantage in thing I'm going to be
looking for is if temperatures come down
in theory family should come down and
potentially longevity of your ps4 should
be improved a little bit but we'll see
so this is made for everything from the
fat ps4 to the slim to the pro so if you
have a slim it drops in here but if we
have the pro we should just be able to
get it in
something like this actually that's
pretty well so there's nothing really
holding it in besides friction on the
bottom we do have those wait what it's
really only pulling a little bit of air
from here I mean they look like
reasonable size spins but how is that
going to drive any significant air flow
into the ps4 next up we have something a
little bit more simple this is a ps4 USB
hub so as the name suggests it's free
straightforward it turns the two USB
ports on the front of ps4 into five so
this is specifically made for the fab
ps4 so in the back we have a pair of USB
ports and on the front we have one USB 3
which is a pass-through and four
standard USB two it should be pretty
much as simple just lining it up and
that's it again I appreciate how well
this actually fits with the original
design so even with this and the
intercooler it doesn't really look like
a Frankenstein
I mean it was not yet now it's time for
the big gun this is the donk Oh game bar
now that name doesn't tell you much but
what this is going to allow you to do is
install a full desktop hard drive into
your ps4 infinity storage super speed
dissipation and stability man I am
excited for this one oh boy here we go
oh that looks that looks like a lot so
this is going to require just a little
bit of surgery on rps score however it's
not going to be bad
so the ps4 as well as the ps4 splendid
she has port Pro all have removable hard
drive so this is going to allow us to do
is instead of using a small two and a
half inch drive like from a laptop to
actually use a full desktop drive this
is feeling like a dumber and dumber idea
each second so essentially this should
kind of go and replace this top piece so
this glossy piece right here just pops
right off and inside normally he would
just replace the hard drive here however
it's going to be a little bit more
involved with this guy so to start we're
going to take out the puny 500 you can
bite hard drive in favor of something
just a little bit beefier so to really
go all out we're upgrading this with a
four terabyte hard drive however this
actually supports up to six terabytes if
you really need all the storage you can
on top of that they actually just
announced the new ps4 firmware update
that will allow you to actually put
games on external USB Drive if you
really want to get crazy with it you can
put a ton of storage in your ps4 so
SATA cable in like that and i can close
the whole thing up so all this is is
really just a pass-through so once we're
ready we just slide it in to the
standard ps4 slot and screw it in
alright here goes nothing so we want to
run all of our power and data this
little slot get around here okay that
eyelashes power works now we just need
to drop the hard drive in like this and
a very stable but besides that you just
have to attach the cable and in theory
we pretty much have a four chair by ps4
oh it totally fits ha ha ha ha we've
created a must dude if this is about to
work I'm gonna be so happy
dude this is I got to say this might be
the proudest moment of my entire life
this is a masterpiece of elegant
Japanese engineering or that's all Ken's
fault
so one quick firmware update later we
have the ultimate Frankenstein ps4 up
and running and as you can hear kind of
loud we also have the Energizer extra
life to the controller so this is the
doc comes with an external battery that
clips on the bottom of the controller so
it doesn't really get in the way when
you're actually playing a game first
thing I want to check to see if our
storage is here so there we go
3.5 1 terabytes of free space there was
so many ps4 shipping with a 500 gigabyte
hard drive it can really get cramped
quickly so this is uncharted 4 and it
looks exactly like Uncharted 4 so I'm
curious about are the temperatures I can
pretty confidently say that this is
louder than a normal ps4 but I'm curious
what does that loudness actually does
anything so the ps4 would be in a cooler
and the cooling stand top out around 49
degrees with the exhaust however when
you take all that stuff off and run it
it tops out at about 50 that shouldn't
be huge surprise so the intercooler is
just adding additional fans for the
exhaust it's still restricted by how
much intake air can actually get into
the ps4
now the cooling stand in theory would
actually help things by giving it some
fresh air however the actual intakes
themselves are tiny and really not able
to make a big
so is any of this worth a kingdom so
first of all the Energizer extra life
doc is actually not bad
the doc itself is clean but most
importantly the battery doesn't get in
the way it legitimately does give you
extra time on the PS score which brings
us to the game bar so on one hand it
actually works really well once you get
past the setup it's completely seamless
and if you really do need 4 or 6
terabytes of storage with your ps4
that's kind of a no-brainer however if
you don't need that much storage it's a
lot easier to just install a one or two
terabyte hard drive and on top of that
the update to allow you to put games on
a USB Drive is coming soon I do really
like the USB hub so with the ps4 only
having two USB ports especially if you
have something like PlayStation VR set
up those ports disappeared quickly which
brings us to the intercooler and the
cooling stand don't buy these the
intercooler while it actually does
integrate pretty well and doesn't really
hurt anything I'm not convinced actually
makes any difference whatsoever
now the stands does give you a few
options like being able to dock your
controllers as well as inferior giving
you a little bit more cooling but again
I don't really believe it's actually
making any significant difference as
always always you guys need to any of
this stuff will be in the description if
you want to go check it out and curious
what do you think about this monstrosity

will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
