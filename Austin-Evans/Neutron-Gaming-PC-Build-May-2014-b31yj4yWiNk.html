video going over my latest gaming PC
build the neutron when putting together
the neutron I wanted to build the best
all-around gaming PC without costing a
ton of money that's why we've got a
quad-core CPU solid graphics card and an
SSD all in the case that won't take up
your entire desk the most important part
though is how does it handle gaming to
give you an idea of how it stacks up
with some of my other recent builds I
ran them all through the 3d market
firestrike benchmark this is a great
general test to see how the graphics
compare and as you'll see the neutron
nicely shows off what it's capable of
open up battlefield 4 and you're looking
at a very playable 47.8 frames per
second even on full Ultra settings at
1080p jump over to Metro last light
another excellent looking game that also
happens to be a lot of fun and the
neutron delivers just over 42 FPS on
very high settings another game that
delivers awesome graphics is BioShock
Infinite where we're also able to play
at 1080p on Ultra at 55 frames per
second load up grid 2 and not only is it
totally playable on Ultra but you can
even crank the resolution up to 1440p
without the system breaking a sweat
now let's crack open the neutron and see
how many corpse we find inside that was
joke that no one's going to get yeah for
the case we've got the Rose well line em
which I've used a few times in previous
builds as it's a great choice with a
pair of 120 millimeter fans enough room
for a micro ATX motherboard there are
actually two versions of the line em the
standard model and the a model which I
have here the only differences are the
lack of an LED for the front fan and one
fewer USB 3.0 port on the a version
which makes it about technology per the
choice is up to you
but either way you're getting a solid
case for the processor we're looking at
an Intel Core i5 44:30 a quad core CPU
based on the Haswell architecture while
a core i3 would get the job done moving
up to the core i5 means you get 4
physical cores which can definitely come
in handy especially in some of the more
demanding games on the graphics side we
have a Sapphire Radeon r9 270x
an excellent mid-range graphics card
with 2 gigabytes of memory and a factory
overclock with 270 X is a great choice
I saw earlier it handles 1080p gaming no
problem for the motherboard we have an
MSI be 85 mg 43 this is a great micro
ATX board with USB 3 on the SATA 3 and
support for up to 32 gigabytes of memory
speaking of for the neutron we've got 8
gigabytes of g.skill ripjaws RAM clocked
at 1866 megahertz which should be more
than enough for now while still leaving
room to upgrade later on for storage
we've got both an SSD as well as a
standard hard drive this really is the
best of both worlds in my opinion is you
can install windows and other programs
onto the SSD and everything else can go
onto the hard drive samsung has made
some excellent SSDs for quite a while
and the 840 Evo was definitely no
exception as with 120 gigabytes of
capacity you've got a decent amount of
space put it together with a one
terabyte Western Digital caviar blue and
you've got yourself an awesome set up
that isn't actually all that expensive
one thing I will mention is that to fit
both drives into the case you'll need to
also grab a 2.5 inch to 3.5 inch adapter
as well the SSD can be mounted on bottom
there's no room to actually plug it in
speaking of for the power supply we're
using a 500 watt corsair CX 500 so if
you guys have watched these gaming
builds before you know I'd really like
to use these supplies and not are they
going to be fairly affordable but
they're also very reliable and most
importantly they're going to have plenty
of power to handle this system today as
well as with some additional upgrades
later on put it all together and you get
yourself an awesome gaming rig that's
perfect for 1080p as always you guys can
find a full parts list in the
description of this video over on my
website anyway I've got to give a big
