time to upgrade
Matt's 2010 Mac Pro yeah okay
so Matt has had an unfortunate incident
recently and that his dog broke his IMAX
screen so took him up we're getting a
little bit of a project and see what we
can actually upgrade with his original
Mac Pro also if you guys don't know Matt
he's the one who runs this is and makes
fun of me on mystery Tech it's true this
is not a stock 2010 Mac Pro right it
still works right now but you want to
basically see if you can get it a little
bit less great I've done some
modifications with it these are all USB
2 and they have no way to really change
that so then I need USB 3 so I got this
card here which has worked really well
for me yeah but it needed dedicated
power it wouldn't run off the PCIe wait
so did you this came with an optical
drive right it has two optical bays the
door doesn't like to close when turns
out it's nothing meant to be right here
we've upgraded this several times over
the years that you've owned the Mac Pro
yes so what are you doing with the Mac
Pro once we're done rebuilding it so I
do video editing was this didn't you
clean this uh there's literally like an
inch of dust on your graphics card
probably never whoa this was an off road
off road yeah so when you travel with
this yeah so can you run me through the
spec of this guy so this is 2010 is it
what a quad core it is a quad core I
think 2.6 gigahertz xenon the first
thing is we should have prayed the CPU
if you're rocking the quad core this
goes up to was it like 10 cores it can
do 12 cores
maximum you've already got the hard
drives I think maybe we just swap out
this SSD for something that's just a
little bit more modern a little bit
quicker so we've got a task here so I
think the next step is I need to do some
googling and find some parts and let's
see if we can get this upgraded and back
to 2019 specs so it has been about what
two weeks now two weeks and we have
everything we need for the ultimate Mac
Pro Masaru the match pro apologies so
the ways of the Mac Pro works is that
while you can buy the CPUs you can also
buy the entire trait which essentially
is the motherboard we could gone to a
six core with a little bit better clock
speed but the real upgrade is
to the dual talking yes so essentially
what we have here are a pair of six core
processors it might not sound super
impressive thank you very much in this
sort of modern era where we have you
know what 32 cores and thread Ripper but
12 cores was a lot of power especially
for 2010 one of the interesting things
about this is that the entire upgrade
was actually not that expensive so we're
able to get the tray which of course is
the motherboard as well as the tools to
CPUs for a little bit over $500 now this
is like a what like a $6,500 config when
I first came out yeah and that's not
including the memory we got with it and
so we also have to get we got 64 gigs as
you can see by my giant pile of dents
here I mean I guess you do have the
limitation that single thread is
probably not gonna be super impressive
but what we're using it for is primarily
like editing I do play the occasional
game on it well you'll probably be able
to gain oh yeah I love my civilization
well so with that we've upgraded from a
quad core to a 12 core in this entire
setup with the new tray the dual CPUs
the 64 gigs of ram still cost us only
about $700 yeah which obviously is a
fair bit but considering that if you
were to bought this in 2010 it would
have been at least 10 times that really
not a bad upgrade so we went with a rx
580 AMD card um this is pretty much the
maximum that the system can handle this
is the original connector it's a pair of
6 pin it's correct and you've adapted a
six to an eight which already is bad
alright let's pull the 760 out so this
is actually built in support for a
little longer GPU yeah interesting
actually have we even measured to see if
this Strix card will fit um on paper I
mean it hold it looked like you'll be
it'll be fine oh we didn't clean this
out why is there already a 14 terabyte
hard drive in here I got excited locate
it so apparently mat stealing company
property and installing a 14 terabyte
hard drive in his Mac Pro so when we
started this project it was running
Sierra and so we wanted to go to Mojave
because we needed that for the graphic
art support but it wouldn't let us
upgrade it until we upgraded the
firmware of the motherboards but there's
a fun little problem with that is the
only way to update the firmware is if
you have the
original EFI graphics cards so we found
a guy in town who had one and let us
borrow his just to update the firmware
you're covered in dust right now no no
did you clean your dirty computer I
thought that's what you were doing
no I'm upgrading it with like 12 cores
and stuff I'm not cleaning do I look
like a cleaning service full service man
so with that we have our 12 core CPU 64
gigs of ram and our RX 580 next let's
upgrade dress is deep so with that
you've got a 1 terabyte SSD I think it's
time to see if this thing actually works
Matt what you have to do the honors yeah
I hope you take off my powered by EVGA
that's fine it's not it's powered by ev8
Oh a little RGB going here yeah hey it
works there you go alright go up to
about this Mac we see there you go to 3
gigahertz 6 core Intel Xeon say 64 gigs
ok cool so all of our 8 gig dims are
showing up so for reference we're going
from a quad-core xeon all the way up to
a pair of 6 core cpus and we're going
from 8 gigs to 64 gigs of ram now
Geekbench i think should show a fairly
substantial difference especially in the
multi-core 27:34 20,000 on the
multi-core
so single core obviously is now that
impressive of me it's essentially a
ten-year-old processor but 20,000 on the
multi-core for a 2010 system that's
ridiculous so for reference before the
upgrades the single core was 2175 and
the multi-core was 7600 wow that is a
huge difference
next up we have set a bench now not only
will this test the CPU but I'm also
curious to see how much higher the GPU
score is so especially consider that
this started out with a 5770 I mean a
580 is going to be then five six times
faster eight times the memory and it's a
massive massive difference so we're
going from 43 to 59 that's not that good
oh dude look at that I never get tired
of seeing like a million thread spin up
for Cinebench so you know what's crazy
with this it's not actually that
expensive when you consider right so
what do you think would have cost to
first of all like buy like your original
Mac Pro chassis and just do like the the
tray upgrade with the memory instead
I mean I've seen I've seen like the
original chassis x' go anywhere from 250
to about 450 the six core CPUs you can
get for like 180 which is bananas how
cheap that is and then the the five ATS
I've seen for 175 so R and news
realistically all the upgrades we've
done to this system are about a thousand
dollars maybe a little bit more
considering that we have the ones like
okay the 14 terabyte drive is like
that's overkill where you know that part
of it to really put this to the test we
have our resident editing man
Jimmy champagne it's me Jimmy I'm here
so we are editing off of an external SSD
so we're using this little Samsung t5
which is plugged into Matt's a USB C
card so that's pretty standard yeah
which is what we edit all of our videos
on but it seems to be fine so now we're
gonna try and sink the footage see how
quick that goes that went as quick as it
does on the iMac pro will do better
quality if this is unrendered 4k Pro
right here is this a woman background
render is a little slower than the iMac
pro boy so basically you have a tank or
iMac yeah which is obviously faster but
when you compare this to something like
a MacBook or an iMac this is still more
powerful I'd say it also to be faster
than the MacBook but noticeably slower
than the high Mac Pro so it's fine
somewhere in between which is pretty
funny for a nine year old desktop which
we just Frankenstein together yeah with
like less than thousand dollars worth of
parts so that my friends is building the
ultimate match Pro for something that's
this old the amount of power able to get
especially concerning the price is super
super impressive so if you excuse me I'm
going to go buy a lot more of these and
have some fun
that actually sounds really ominous like
as if I'm gonna build like some super
computer out of Mac perrault's I'm
actually not gonna buy any more of these</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
