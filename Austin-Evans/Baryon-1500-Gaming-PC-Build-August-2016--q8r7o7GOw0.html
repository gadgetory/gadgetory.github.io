baryon this is a $1,500 gaming PC and it
hits an interesting spot if you spend a
lot more than this you're really going
to hit the law of diminishing returns
sure you can spend two three four
thousand dollars on a gaming PC how it's
really not going to perform that much
better than something like this kicking
things off we have the Intel Core i5
6600 K now it comes to a gaming CPU it's
hard to beat a core i5 not only is this
a quad-core chip based on Intel's latest
gallic process but it's also fully
overclockable so out of the box you're
getting a clock speed of 3.5 gigahertz
however throw a little bit of extra
juice at it and you're going to get well
above 4 gigahertz no problem
you can upgrade to a core i7 however
there is very little difference in
performance when it comes to games the
main reason to spend an extra hundred
dollars on the i7 is if you want to do
more intense tasks such as video editing
to keep things cool we have a hyper 612
from Coolermaster this is a fairly beefy
heatsink it has six copper heat pipes
and it not only runs quiet but it also
gives you lots of room for overclocking
the real star of the show is that EVGA
geforce gtx 1070 graphics card this
thing is no joke
not only is it based on in videos new
Pascal architecture which means that
it's fast and it clocks really high but
it's also the EVGA superclocked variety
which means that it's clocked even
faster than the stock version it's
outfitted with 8 gigabytes of gddr5
memory which is more than pretty much
any game is using at this point now on
top of that this thing is seriously fast
as you'll see a little bit later on
it pushes some crazy pixels the Braylon
can also handle VR so I'm using the
oculus rift right now however it also is
totally compatible with the HTC 5 and
only does it run it completely smooth
but it's actually quite a bit above the
known spec which means this should be
able to handle VR for quite a while to
come yeah you can also kill stuff too as
that's part for the motherboard we have
the Isuzu 178 now I've got to say this
is probably my favorite motherboard out
right now not only is it fairly cheap
but it has all the features you might
want and then some you've got plenty of
USB ports including a dedicated 3.1 and
a USB type-c
you have an m2 slot for a super-fast SSD
which we're using for this build and
it's in a su sport which means that it's
built well and it's going to get plenty
of BIOS updates it's a really solid
all-around package for memory we're
using 16 gigabytes of Corsair Vengeance
lpx memory
now 16 gigabytes is actually kind of
overkill for gaming rig it's really more
for being able to do extra stuff like
video editing or you know using Google
Chrome for the SSD we have something a
little different this is a 256 gigabyte
Samsung 950 pro now as an nvme drive
this is way faster than any other normal
SATA SSD you're gonna get write speeds
of around one gigabyte per second and
read speeds well over 1.5 gigabytes per
second this is one seriously quick Drive
backing it up we have the one terabyte
WD black hard drive now this is going to
give you some much-needed extra space in
addition to the SSD it might not be as
fast but it's a perfect place to store
extra steam games and other random files
that you don't need to keep on the SSD
powering everything is the 750 watt EVGA
supernova power supply this is going to
be more than enough for the build as is
as well as if you want to do some
upgrades it's 80 plus gold rated and
it's a modular supply which means that
you can have some nice neat cable
management or not it's up to you housing
the baryon is the fractal design define
s I really like this case it only is a
large chassis with plenty of room for
upgrades it also has some really nice
cable management options pair with that
nice big window you can show off your
build in all its glory this can handle
some pretty intense 4k gaming so in GTA
5 we're able to play on very high
settings at 4k at around 54 frames per
second
moving on to shadow of Mordor the 4k
train keeps on rolling so here we're
able to play on Ultra settings and we're
still getting around 52 frames per
second jump into the witcher 3 and we do
have to turn the settings down to high
at 4k however the game still looks
fantastic
and we're getting about 40 frames per
second moving to a DirectX 12 game we
have ashes of the singularity which
really does put a lot of stress on the
system here though on extreme settings
at 4k we're getting 42 frames per second
at $1500 the baryon really does hit the
sort of high-end sweet spot as always I
will have all the links you guys need in
