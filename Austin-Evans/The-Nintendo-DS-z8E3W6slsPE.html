bold step along the undisputed leader in
handheld consoles the Nintendo
executives had a choice continue on with
the extremely popular Gameboy line or
tear up the playbook and start with a
brand new 21st century design currently
over 144 million DS models sold
worldwide the Nintendo DS the second
only to the Sony Playstation 2 as the
best-selling video game console of all
time to put that staggering number in
perspective the entire population of the
UK is a mere 61 million many attributed
the success of the Nintendo DS to the
still unique dual screen layout from
which the portable derives its name all
models of the DS share several defining
features including a folding design
allowing for two displays and a fairly
compact form factor a normal LCD screen
in addition to a bottom mounted
touchscreen and a built-in microphone
altogether these features open up a wide
variety of possibilities for different
styles of gameplay on November 21st 2004
antenna released the first D s often
referred to as the fad DS this version
borrowed a lot from the Gameboy Advance
SP including a similar folding design
rechargeable battery as well as
backwards compatibility with Game Boy
Advance games on the technical side of
things it was vastly improved with two
processors to run the dual displays a
brand new smaller game cartridge along
with support for Wi-Fi which meant that
at last the Game Boy Link cables could
be done away with in the last six years
Nintendo has updated the DS Hardware
three times the DS Lite brought a
sleeker design to larger and brighter
displays and much improved battery life
this was followed up by the DSi a more
substantial upgrade that brought even
larger displays front and rear facing
VGA cameras an SD card slot and a new UI
that includes support for downloading
additional software via the DSi shop
lastly Nintendo released the DSi XL and
nearly identical model to the DSi except
for the much larger 4.2 inch displays
now that the Nintendo 3ds has been
released the end of the line is
approaching for the DS while it
certainly wasn't a perfect console by
any means it definitely will be looked
back on as one of the most popular
consoles of all time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
