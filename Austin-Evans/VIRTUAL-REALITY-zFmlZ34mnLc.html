supercool band-aid right hey guys this
is Austin this is the oculus rift and
huge shout out to oculus for sponsoring
this video is mostly thanks to the rift
the VR even exists today but what is
virtual reality people have been
experimenting with VR experiences dating
all the way back to the 50s where things
were let's just say a little bit more
creative than they are today
now you can fast-forward to the 90s
where Nintendo launched the Virtual Boy
this wonderful headset which
spectacularly crashed and burns but how
does VR actually work as core virtual
reality is all about giving you the most
immersive experience possible
so think the holodeck from Star Trek and
not the TV on your wall
now that TV is a good example of a VR
just isn't sure with both of them you
can watch video and play games but with
the TV you're eliminated by the size of
that panel
whereas with virtual reality no matter
where you look as long as you have that
headset on you were completely immersed
the virtual boy achieved this with some
pretty basic tech uses a pair of single
color displays and two mirrors to flip
back and forth incredibly fast give you
a decent 3d effect but being limited by
1995 technology meant that this was not
a true VR experience back in 2011 the
first prototype for the rift was
completed duct tape and all now what
made this special was that for the first
time a head mounted display was paired
with not only a 90 degree field of view
that was wide enough to look convincing
but also motion tracking to allow you to
move your head in real life and
translate it into the game
you know like in real life when I move
my head left and right the world stays
with me I remember back in 2013 where I
first got to try not only an early
prototype of the rift but also of a
Valkyrie I put the headset on and I was
transported into a cockpit of a
spaceship and a giant dogfight in the
middle of space it was seriously one of
the most impressive tech moments I have
ever seen right afterwards I walked out
of the demo room pulled my phone out and
pre-ordered my own oculus dev kit don't
get me wrong though at this point the
tech was still very early one of the
biggest issues with the first dev kit
was its fairly low resolution of 1280 by
800 it was enough to get the idea across
the actual level of detail was really
low at this point
fast forward to 2017 and beyond as a
whole has seen some huge improvements so
take the rift for example now it has a
pair of super high resolution pen 80 by
1200 displays one per eye they have a
faster 90 Hertz refresh rate pair with
being based on OLED which 11
a lot of the earlier issues with
smoothness and persistence which is
important when the goal is total
immersion even a little stutter in a
game can cause you to be totally ripped
out of the experience there is a lot
more tech inside though
Laurette headset is filled with infrared
tracking dots which pair with the sensor
that it comes with is able to track your
head in full 3d space with a lot more
detail than the original dev kits well
there are some headsets like PlayStation
VR which take advantage of a console or
things like gear VR which actually use a
mobile device such as your smartphone to
be able to power them with the oculus
rift you are using a PC to power it
there are several advantages here most
notably you can have a ton of graphics
horsepower to push now like the graphics
but also to keep that performance stable
all this tech is great but the
controllers are also important
now the oculus does support these
standard Xbox one gamepad which is fine
for some games but what really stands
out are the oculus touch controllers you
can think of these as an evolution of
the original Wii Remote sure they do
have motion tracking what's more
impressive is the fact that these will
fully positionally track your hands
which will actually allow you to put
your hands inside the game this is
important a lot of games such as the
climb will use hand tracking in
combination with the buttons to simulate
actually climbing a cliff
it's a neat effect and can do a lot to
add to the immersion and immersion
really is the key to making sure that VR
feels right so you might be okay with a
little glitch or stutter when you're
playing on a PC monitor when it comes to
VR you're essentially tricking your
brain into thinking that the game world
is real there's essentially no margin
for error one of my favourite VR games
is job simulator so this is a great
example of how the touch controllers
works you can see that my hands are
completely one-to-one in the game but
reach over and pick up this cartridge
drop it in it feels very realistic when
you pair the rift with the touch
controllers it really does give you an
immersive experience so I look around
this office building it feels like I'm
actually here I can walk around I can
move my head I can pick things up and it
just feels right well it lets you do
some cool stuff like say copy some
resumes just drop it on a copy machine
hit that I can start brewing some coffee
start hitting buttons on my keyboard
into the phone I mean this stuff is
really cool it really does feel so
natural so simple I don't have to think
about it I can just literally reach over
hit something done next we have super
hot VR
have to stand very still because as I
move time will actually start playing
and have to okay here here we go and oh
no no get away that one and grab it
got it boom dude this is so much fun it
is easy to forget that just over eight
years ago consumer headsets like The
rifts weren't even a thing and this
really only went on sale a year ago so
there is a long way to go but if you
have not experienced virtual reality you
absolutely owe it to yourself to give it
a try so what do you guys think about VR
let me know in the comments below and I
will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
