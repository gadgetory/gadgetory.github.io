and I may or may not have made a little
bit of a mistake but today we're here to
redeem ourselves what we're going to do
we're going to rebuild the scrap inator
the scrap inator is a fifty dollar PC
the Jay and I got off of Craigslist last
year that we attempted to turn into a
game PC with less than perfect results
single core 2.4 gigahertz whoo so right
now let's go to storage let's knock out
like basically let's go see if you can
find the system I hope I didn't lose it
but there's also sleeping and buying
some other parts okay soon we're going
to have to gut most of you so if we're
going to put like rising five inside
with a decent GPU I don't know what kind
of power supplies inside of I'm sure
it's garbage all right so if this is
going to be fun um so when do we do the
videos September we have to do some
digging okay we got a ten sixty I get
started here or if I know I get to a
small form-factor power supply we've got
a 600 watt okay let's keep honest we
also do have one at a cake back here but
I think that can 60 especially should
work right I had a terrible idea
my lovely lady so we at our supply right
what do you think the system is going to
pull it full load just wild guess
well I don't know we've got we've got
the way you want to do it and then the
way I'm kind of going to try and make
you do it well I've got something that
might work for both of us okay
what's that will fit barely uh it might
not but we can make it fit it's not too
too long I've got the same power supply
subscribe Nader lives again I'll see
what we came into 400 there it is right
there oh I knew that all right what do
we got here ah we can work with that -
the problem with this case is it
actually doesn't have any cams at all in
right now it just has the stock fin and
the power supply eighty millimeter fan
that's it I want to reuse as much as we
can turn this but I do think this
motherboard got to come out there's no
way we're going to use a single cord
line so right now we have eight gigs of
RAM hopefully we're going to bump that
up to 16 we've got a 1050 which I think
should work pretty well and then we
stole a small fan as well as a once I
write hard drive from the Dell
so this is looking like the beginning of
the build all right let's get to work on
this guy so first of all I think the big
thing I want to do with this is keep it
as original looking on the outside as
possible I wanna give it away from the
outside from the inside we can make it
look whatever but like I kind of the
idea of it looking like well a fifty
dollar crack the idea is that it's just
unsuspecting so I think first step
should be just gutting everything out of
here and then I think we can slowly
rebuild with whatever parts that we can
salvage yeah I don't think there's gonna
be much left like literally it's just
going to be a steel frame when we're
ready to build in it we kind of keep the
soul of this guy though man we gotta
like the scrapping leader has to live on
and more than just body do you think
this can ever been taken off unless I
don't think so I like that is that is
original like half a camera no so I'm
not taking responsible life but that was
not us you can see where he wiped it
that modem though mm-hmm
what does a date on it would say um June
2007 I just love that someone had a DVD
Drive and like you know what I need a CD
Drive I thought maybe we could have
blown this out before we started tearing
it down it's okay we're in your studio
so inside those car shows and they find
like some cards from sitting in a garage
like 40 years there was like pressure
wash it down or like those home
remodeling shows so they crack open a
wall is full of like yeah that's quality
right age wire we wouldn't wanted to be
use that at all oh no way serious yeah
we're gonna
we just area that's that's right long I
like the idea of keeping the a at the
outside fairly original but I feel like
a lot of what we have to do is going to
depend on a couple of things one power
supply size we have to go hand inside
because there is no venture for sure oh
wait yeah okay
crisis number one yeah we have to turn
around the other way because the modular
cable hit the frame wait you're exactly
yeah actually you know what Barry she
doesn't look crazy
no no she looks like it's it like yeah
there that's pretty because it's it's
black in kind of a platinum color and
then you notice
seems were themed on that this is
intentional so now it's time for our
risin 5 processor so this is the 1500 X
so it means that it is quad-core so it's
kind of against the core i5 I'd say so
for this it should be more than enough
to go along with it though we have a be
350 motherboard now the only issue is I
don't know if this actually has a BIOS
update that will work with Rison 5 I
hope it'll just work out of the box
because it's not all getting perfect
stand up straight oh really
oh dude is this actually going to work
right now you have enough clearance in
the back well actually have a lot of
plants over here when we want to run
cables
yeah those more clients go to be ok here
comes the fun part installing these
1,500 eggs with that we have a rising
part in our build
so a 1050 should definitely stay um I
almost wonder though this is going so
well we can actually maybe step it up a
little bit or do you have a mine
maybe like a 1080 1080 item like that
your luck because I usually have one on
me haha is that gonna fit though because
if we got this dried I don't think
though I don't think it's gonna fit at
all
oh so you know we don't need these
bottom draw drives because we're going
to fill up the final quarters
yo he's gonna work in it all right now
comes the fun part that that actually
work Oh pull so tight yes Nidoran oh you
know what
that's right barely cleared though let
me tell you why because I was basing it
off the top plot and if they don't you
oh all right well that's looking pretty
good I think now it's just a thing of
getting some cabling throwing the memory
in I think this should work um the only
other thing is gonna be cooling but I
think let's get this all up and running
and then we'll figure that out so since
the scrap nadir is accidentally becoming
kind of cool instead of using a one
terabyte hard drive instead we're going
to using a samsung 950 pro all right now
we have an nvme SSD where's our memory
this is the only part actually a little
nervous about
I know Rison has some issues with memory
especially when you get higher clock
stuff worst case scenario we do one
stick and there we go
this is looking like an actual system
this everything else needs we plugged in
on the bottom like I know that's
proprietary to the other motherboard we
can plug it in hope that it's
miraculously the exact same layout okay
it's hit the exact came to know so one
of those never work think there's no way
we're that lucky hopefully works if it
doesn't work then we're gonna have to
face everything about this build is so
close we're barely making it like ah
look at that
there's not any slack on that whatsoever
but it's it okay um let's start to a
first place he works here hang I get I
got it
don't move don't wiggle that's it hey J
got it in anyway little light can do and
when it comes to insertion force time
for the moment of truth there are a lot
of things that could go wrong there
still are yeah but the things ready oh
my god we got lucky
the pin out where are you
two ten-year-olds motherboard match the
pin out I tell you I'm pretty sure they
were standard but just everything
spinning AMD always takes forever on the
first booth first ones yeah yeah
dude just going to work it could be
memory but I still think the memory
configuration on this right now it's
freaking it out a little bit yeah so we
go there a dude takes two minutes out of
the first boot dude yes the scrap Gator
lived in the tents 3033 we've got risin
five showing up fifteen hundred eggs
it shows boiling shows 8kg an old
channel 2133 like now but don't you say
cakes oh no it did freak out a little
bit so one of the memory isn't being
that's fine okay whatever okay this
works dude
this we're eating ourselves that's the
dude it'll never so you're sure this is
not the most practical build it's not
the prettiest build it's not the most
ghetto build but man it is the
slipperiest build I'm so proud of this
right now
so the scrap a lid if you guys one check
out the original $50 game PC challenge
of how we got this system in the first
place definitely be sure to check that
out you can also subscribe to jay who
makes cool videos and helps me dremel
sometime I'm curious what do you guys
think about the new scrap nadir let us
know in the comments below and we were I
or someone will catch you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
