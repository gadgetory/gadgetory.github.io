live at CES 2012 with the LG spectrum so
Chad you want going to take it away
absolutely Austin first of all I want to
welcome you to CES 2012 and the LG booth
I got a lot of electron of exciting
things to tell you about this is
actually a spectrum by LG this is going
to be available exclusively for verizon
wireless on January nineteenth at a
price point of 199 on under a two-year
contract a couple of really cool things
about this device itself this actually
is going to feature what we call a true
HD display so basically those days of
real watching HD television at home you
can actually pull that into a mobile
device itself but obviously is going to
be 1280 by 720 however we take it more
stuff than that it's actually 329 pixels
per inch within those 329 pixels there
are 12 sub pixels per that we utilize
what we call srgb stripe which is a
universal standard for HD broadcast and
HD televisions so what that's really
going to mean to you is you have
actually have a true HD display on top
of that in order for you to get true
natural colors we actually use an
exclusive LG HD graphic engine on there
to go through a six step process to
pretty much adjust skin tones and
overall color adjustment to make sure
that you get the proper skin tones on
the device another little neat way to
actually show HD content is verizon
wireless and LG we actually have an
exclusive partnership with the
sportscenter app and what you're going
to be able to get is ESPN content for
video and true 720p HD so if I tap on
the device here if you notice I'm
actually in a pure 4G LTE signal
strength so I'm actually going to tap
this app you're going to see connecting
on the device itself and what you're
going to see is true 720p content on the
device itself which is pretty cool so it
kind of takes you back to that first
time when you saw your Sports Center or
you actually saw your first football
game or baseball game in pure HD on a
television that same aha moments going
to hit it because now you're doing it
for the first time on a mobile device
exclusively with verizon wireless and LG
on the spectrum so if you look at this
absolutely phenomenal HD content on a
mobile device other cool things we've
got if we want to look at specs on the
device we're using a scorpion s3 from
Qualcomm a dual-core 1.5 gigahertz
processor we're
also using Adreno 225 fix processor we
have a total of one gigabyte of ddr2 RAM
on the device itself so we have 512 of
that dedicated a processor and 512 is
dedicated to the graphics processor we
also are going to have four gig total
the turtle memory on the device we're
also included micro SD card of 16
gigabytes which is really cool full DLNA
capabilities on the device itself we
also can do hdmi on the device itself
via an MHL adapter our mobile
high-definition link so you can get your
HD gaming content or your video content
out into the large screen that way as
well 8 megapixel camera on the device
itself for pure HD content and pictures
and we also have a front facing 1.3
megapixel camera other little neat
things on there are typical LG you I so
we got pinched in gestures on the front
screen we even actually have them in our
applications Avenger we can pinch in and
create folders you can even drag these
folders under the home screen anywhere
that we want drop them wherever they are
so you actually maintaining screen space
we even have gestures so when you get
phone calls you can actually flip it
over to mute the call flip it over to
pause the video even with our alarm and
actually you can go into our HD pictures
in here we can actually show gesture
support so we can actually tap the side
of the device itself to scroll ourselves
back and forth and again to show off
that HD content let me zoom all the way
in there and if you notice at actually
maintain resolution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
