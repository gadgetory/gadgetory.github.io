making some of my favorite phones for
quite a while traditionally you get a
great combination of good specs and
flagship level features at a price they
can be hundreds of dollars less than the
competition that is where the oneplus
sixty comes in it's definitely a good
phone but it does not revolutionize the
formula if you're familiar with the
oneplus six then you know the basics of
the 60 inside you'll find that same
Snapdragon 8045 which has been in almost
every major flagship of this year and
that is paired with either six or eight
gigs of RAM and 128 or 256 gigs of
storage this is as good as it gets right
now but it is no longer a unique selling
point previously oneplus is worth some
of the cheapest phones with the high-end
specs such as the Snapdragon 835 or 845
but nowadays you can pick up a poco
phone f1 that is going to be several
hundred dollars cheaper than even the
oneplus and it has that same spec it's
good it's great to have in a phone like
this but it is no longer some huge
revolutionary feature it's just kind of
what everyone expects at this point one
of the most noticeable changes is the
knotch it is significantly smaller than
now I pretty much anything else out
right now but it is right alongside the
essential phone which over a year later
actually still has one of these smallest
notches that we've ever seen if we take
a quick trip from garbage town up the
road to notch city we'll find an
interesting evolution of one-plus phones
over the last couple years so they won't
plus-5 was the last phone with the
full-size bezels which were
significantly shrunk down on the 1 + 5 t
come to the 1 + 6 and the notch is in
full effect which thankfully is a lot
smaller on the 1 + 16 it's also a very
slightly larger display at 6.4 inches as
opposed to 6.3 and that applies to the
entire 1 + 60 it's a little bit thicker
it's a little bit taller and it's a
little bit wider and it is definitely on
the the larger side of smartphones the
display itself is a nice looking olan in
fact not only is it fairly bright but it
is one of the most accurate OLED panels
we've tried right up there with the
iPhone 10s you'll also find something
pretty rare and in display fingerprint
sensor you know I'll go on are the days
of having a fingerprint sensor on the
back or on the home button instead it's
actually inside the glass it properly
works too so this little green icon
right here if I put my thumb on it it
will immediately scan my fingerprint now
to be fair this is not a perfect setup
it does seem to be a little bit slower
than a traditional fingerprint sensor I
did notice that it is a little bit more
prone to being slowed down or tripped up
if you have any kind of dirt or dust on
the screen but generally speaking it
does work
well there is a face unlock option but
unlike something more sophisticated like
the IR cameras on the iPhone as well as
the Oppo find X business Ted relies on
just the front-facing camera its quick
its reasonably accurate but it is
nowhere near secure to me is just using
that fingerprint sensor inside you will
find an upgraded battery before we had a
3300 milliamp hours so whereas this year
we've gone out to 3700 milliamp hours
now I haven't spent enough time to
really give it a full run-through but
based on at least early impressions it's
pretty easy to make it through a full
day of use with the 16 unsurprisingly
oneplus is stuck with their very stock
looking oxygen OS software which is
based on the latest version of Android
9pi now the good thing is you have a lot
of nice small customizations it doesn't
totally overhaul the look for example
the alert slider we all know and love is
still here to allow you to easily mute
the phone I really don't understand why
lots and lots of other people having to
stolen this it's just super useful what
you won't find is a significantly
improved camera no it is slightly better
so it's mostly in the processing and the
software side specifically with portrait
mode it's a little bit better at cutting
things out of the background and there
is an improved night shot mode which
will get you a little bit of better
low-light performance but generally
speaking this is decent but nowhere near
as good as the pixels and the galaxies
of the world the speaker sounds decent
but importantly it's just that a single
speaker
it's 2018 and basically all other
flagships have switched over to a stereo
setup which not only sounds a lot better
but importantly isn't easily covered I
mean all these do you really put a
single finger over the speaker and it
totally closed the volume personally I
wouldn't mind a bigger notch if I meant
that I did get those stereo speakers
audio quality on a phone is really
important to me speaking of the oneplus
sixty finally drops the headphone jack
now this isn't exactly a huge surprise
but it is they downgrade over the one
plus six to be fair you do get a USBC
headphone dongle on the box and the
battery is slightly larger because of
this but uh
rest in peace sweet Jack we also still
don't have any official water resistance
now you would think that by removing the
headphone jack that would make it a
little bit easier to water seal this guy
up but nope it's still completely not
okay to put this near even a single drop
of water or else your warranty stickers
will go screaming in agony speaking of
what we do still have a glass back the
16 still completely omits any kind of
wireless charging this is a
weird choice usually when you go from
metal the glass when the main reasons is
to get you a little bit of an easier
target for stuff like say I don't know
wireless charging something again is on
almost all 2018 flagships and yet it is
nowhere to be found on the 1 plus 16 the
1 plus 60 is a terrific phone and yet
it's not really much of an upgrade over
the 1 plus 6 in a world where the Google
pixel 3 is a true flagship it's really
hard to call this a flagship killer it's
a great mid-range phone but that's ok</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
