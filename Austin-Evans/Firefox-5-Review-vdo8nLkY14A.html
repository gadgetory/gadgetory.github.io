of Firefox five no you weren't seeing
things with the fifth version Mozilla's
browser they are officially moving on to
a much faster release cycle like chrome
with several version updates a year so
since it's only been a few months since
Firefox 4 was released this is a much
more subtle update keeping almost the
same UI and core but with a few
enhancements the first of which is the
fact that tabs no longer collapse on you
when you have a full screen of tabs
until you move the mouse white making it
much easier to close multiple tabs at a
time another new feature is that CSS
animations are now supported keeping
Firefox up with other heavyweights such
as Chrome Mozilla has always been a big
proponent of web privacy and now on
Firefox five you can have the browser
automatically tell websites that you
don't want to be tracked moving onto my
speed testing I found that Firefox 5 is
practically identical to its predecessor
meaning solid performance that still
lags a bit behind the fastest beyond
general bug fixes and minor improvements
that's about all that is new in Firefox
5 and it is of course a free update so
you can either wait for your
installation to automatically update or
do it manually from the link in the
description if you enjoyed be sure to
