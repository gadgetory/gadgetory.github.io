with an unboxing of the new 2012 MacBook
Air 11 inch I really love the air is a
portable machine and the newest model
brings some pretty nice improvements as
always the box comes wrapped in plastic
which we can make quick work of with a
knife
pop the lid and inside you'll see the
MacBook nestled away well take a look at
the start of the video in a minute but
first let's see what else you get inside
the box is your paperwork which consists
of a Quick Start Guide with a bit of
information on the computer safety
information which no one ever reads most
importantly of all Apple stickers you
know the whole reason you buy a macbook
movie on we've got the power adapter
it's very similar to the normal MagSafe
charger with fold out prongs and an
extension cable what's new is the
MagSafe 2 connector which looks more
like an iphone charger and is a bit
thinner now that the boring part is out
of the way let's take a look at the air
itself once you get the plastic off
you'll see the MacBook Air and all its
aluminum goodness just like the last
generations it's very thin with a
tapered design that goes from point six
eight inches at the top all the way down
to point one one inches thick on the
left side you'll see your Mac safe two
connector a USB 3.0 port a combo
headphone and microphone jack along with
an actual microphone on the right side
you'll see the Thunderbolt port which
doubles as a mini DisplayPort in your
second USB 3.0 the keyboard is unchanged
which means it's still rocking a
full-size layout with backlighting you
also see the oversized glass multi-touch
trackpad which really is impressive on
an 11 inch laptop above the screen is
the new FaceTime HD webcam I'm sure it
will be better than the old camera but
honestly it's a tiny webcam don't expect
much this air comes with eight gigabytes
of RAM a Core i5 and a 128 gigabyte SSD
there are lots of options including
going down to four gigabytes of RAM and
a 64 gigabyte SSD moving up to a core i7
and 512 gigs of storage one thing to
keep in mind is that you really can't
upgrade much on the air after you buy it
especially the RAM so make sure you get
exactly what you want up front anyway
that's about it for this unboxing if you
