with my top five gaming life hacks you
know because I'm really good at this
stuff coming in at number 5 is stop
using Wireless the future is supposed to
be all about ditching cables like this
right well my setup isn't the best
example going wired actually isn't a bad
idea the most obvious example is wired
versus wireless Internet if I compare
running my Xbox one on Wi-Fi versus
being plugged straight into my router
you can see there's a decent difference
especially in the download speed and
importantly for gaming the latency not
only complaining in help improve things
like your pain it can also help you
avoid lag due to random interference
especially in areas with tons of Wi-Fi
signals while sometimes running Ethernet
cables all over your house isn't
practical it can help you avoid some
problems something that's also easy to
overlook is plugging in your controller
while wireless controllers are usually
reliable these days if it's convenient
it makes sense to keep things plugged in
as having your battery dying game can be
a huge pain for number four we've got
optimizing your setup while most of us
will game whenever and wherever it's
actually really helpful to have a setup
that's nice and comfortable for you one
of the first things is getting a good
place to sit
I usually game in a normal desk chair on
PC and while you can spend a ton of
money on these the important thing is
that it's nicely padded and is height
adjustable bringing your chair to a
level where your wrists are comfortable
while gaming is important not only to be
able to focus better on the game but
also to keep yourself from straining
your wrists at number three we have
something for console gamers optimizing
your TV if you like to game on a PC odds
are you're using a monitor but if you
game out a console using a TV makes a
lot of sense compare a decent PC monitor
to a much bigger TV and you'll see
there's actually not a huge price gap
one of the big differences is that TVs
tend to do a lot of processing to make
the image pop which can add a bit of lag
where monitors tend to take the signal
without messing with it too much
luckily you can minimize this on most
TVs by turning on game mode dig into
your menu until you find picture options
and switch over to game mode what this
does varies by TV but it typically turns
down the processing on the image to
improve input times for seven TV
you might not notice much of a
difference but it's definitely worth a
shot to see if it works for you moving
on to number two we have fine tuning
your graphics settings this one is
definitely more aimed at PC gamers but
by tweaking your graphics settings you
can make a huge difference to the
gameplay while it would be nice to have
a PC that can handle every game
completely maxed out all the time
usually you're going to need to
customize your settings to keep things
running smoothly ideally you want your
game to be running at at least 60 frames
per second which is the max refresh rate
of most monitors the best way to measure
your framerate is with a tool called
fraps with it you can turn on an FPS
indicator to show you exactly how smooth
your game is running now jump into the
game settings and adjust the graphics
until you get a solid framerate
there are also tools that can help you
work out settings like Nvidia's GeForce
experience and AMD's gaming evolved but
I prefer to figure out things manually
once you get everything set up correctly
you should notice a massive difference
and finally at number one we have
dialing in your control sensitivity when
you're playing a game it's tempting to
just jump right in however spending some
time fine-tuning your controls can be a
big help most games default to a fairly
low sensitivity which is great for
people who are new to the game and just
want to have a bit of fun but as you get
better it can really slow you down by
jumping into the settings and turning
sensitivity higher you'll be able to
look and aim a lot faster with high
sensitivity at first you'll probably be
awful as there's a big learning curve
but dial in the exact setting that works
best for you and once you get used to it
it can make a big difference if you're
playing on PC the advantage can be even
bigger get the perfect mouse settings
and things like aiming and moving become
way quicker and easier it's a simple tip
but perfecting your controls can help us
surprising amount so what are some of
your favourite gaming life hacks
