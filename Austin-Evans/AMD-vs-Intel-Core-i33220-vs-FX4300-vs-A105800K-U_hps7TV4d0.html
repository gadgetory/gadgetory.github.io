here with the budget gaming CPU
comparison so a question I get asked all
the time is which is better AMD or Intel
and while there's no real clear answer
to that it depends on what your going to
be doing how much money you're going to
be spending all that kind of stuff what
we can do is compare some of the best
budget gaming CPUs out there so on the
Intel side we have the core i3 3220 and
on the AMD side we have their new FX
4300 CPU as well as their a 1050 800 K
apu for my tests I use two different
graphics cards so on the lower end I
used a Radeon 6850 now this is very
similar in power to something like a
Radeon 77 70 or GTX 650 Ti in all
honesty this is probably about the same
kind of powered graphics card this is
going to go in most systems with these
CPUs I also did all my tests with a
Radeon in 79 50 which is a much more
powerful graphics card and should show
more of the weaknesses and strengths of
each of the CPUs for the first test I
use the fire strike benchmark inside the
new 3d mark now this is a very
graphically intensive DirectX 11 title
which really destroys pretty much every
CPU and GPU that you run it on here the
6850 was clearly the bottleneck as all
three systems struggled to breach 10
frames per second for the most part as
far as the scores go is basically a dead
heat the core i3 barely edged out the
AMD CPUs
but really by such a small margin that
would basically call this one a tie
moving on to the 7950 it's clear that
fire strike is very very demanding on
the GPU as again all three systems score
fairly close moving on we have
battlefield 3 which is still one of the
best looking games out there so for the
settings on this one we have the
resolution set to 1080p and all the
graphics settings set to high now we
could have pushed this a little bit
farther however I did want to make sure
that I could get playable frame rates on
both graphics cards with the 6850 all
three CPU score within one frame per
second of each other which means that
this is pretty much for all intents and
purposes a tie now this is actually kind
of interesting is that it means that
even with a graphically intensive game
like Battlefield we're still pretty much
entirely limited by the graphics card
and not the CPU moving up to the 7950 we
start to see some more clear differences
between the CPUs so the 58 head case
starts to fall behind here scoring right
about 90 frames per second whereas the
FX 4300 score is about 93 and the core
i3 scores about 97 so I wouldn't call
this a huge blowout by any means however
it is still clear that the core i3 does
beat both of the AMD processors on this
one next up we have far far
three which is not only a very
good-looking game but it's also a lot of
fun when you're not benchmarking and
doing the same thing over and over and
over again like I was doing as far as
the settings go here again we're playing
at 1080p with all the settings set to
high with the 6850 here again we see
almost the exact same story is all three
CPU score very very close together
however move up to the semi 950 you'll
see it's a little bit of a different
story
so the 5800 K notch is about 54 frames
per second whereas the FX 4300 gets
about 57 and the core i3 gets about 63
so again these aren't huge differences
but the core i3 does edge out over the
quad core AMD counterparts next up we
have Skyrim which is a famously CPU
intensive game in fact when it first
came out you basically needed a Core i5
or i7 to actually run it properly
however now with a few patches that has
gotten better but it still does very
heavily texture CPU for this one I
install the high resolution texture pack
and coring the anti-aliasing all the way
up and put all the rest of the settings
at Ultra with the 6850 we see a slightly
for the core i3 however it's only about
a frame and a half per second which
really isn't a whole lot move up to the
79 50 and it's very clear that the 5800
K starts to ball night things with only
65 frames per second the FX 4300 does
quite a bit better at about 77 however
again the very clear winner is the core
i3 with over 91 frames per second so you
can call this whatever you want maybe
there Intel biased or whatever but
regardless if you're going to be playing
Skyrim the core i3 pretty much smokes
the AMD competition lastly I want to
look into power consumption this matters
in quite a few areas including your
power bill every month the amount of
heat that's being dissipated inside your
chassis as well as what kind of power
supply you're going to need to buy with
each of these builds I did a run-through
of Portal 2 with the 7950 and I
monitored the power consumption using a
kilowatt so the core i3 did really well
here using only 220 watts whereas the
5800 K needed 257 watts and the FX 4300
need 278 there are a couple interesting
things to take away from this if you're
going to be using an entry a mid-level
graphics card all three of these CPUs
actually perform very nicely as there
really weren't any major differences in
the games that I tested even when you
move up to a more beefy graphics card
all three CPUs actually do a really
respectable job so yes the core i3 did
typically pull ahead but usually it was
only by about 10% or so
which while it is a difference it isn't
massive in the fact that all three of
the CPUs could handle a pretty decent
graphics card like this without any
major problems with actually
impressive then there's price to
consider when I first started this
comparison all three of these CPUs were
almost identically priced at about $125
however since then the FX 4300 has seen
a price cut of about $20 now whether
this is permanent not who knows but if
it is a $20 difference actually makes it
a much more attractive option as if all
of that wasn't enough to confuse you
guys and pretty much ruin the entire
point of my comparison there's also the
fact that the AMD CPUs are overclockable
so with their stock heat sinks you're
really not going to be able to get a
huge difference however if you do want
to spend some money on aftermarket
heatsink you can't get a little bit more
of a moderate overclock which could help
narrow the gap between them and the core
i3 of course the power consumption is
already really really in the core i3
favored and with overclocking it's only
going to extend its lead there so there
you guys have it
while both AMD CPUs have their
advantages the core i3 outperform them
both and took up about half as much
power while doing it making it the
winner this time if you guys are
interested more feel free to check out
some of my other videos including my
$600 PC bill featuring the core i3 if
you enjoyed definitely be sure to leave
this video a thumbs up and if you're
interested in more videos like this be
sure to subscribe anyway guys I will get
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
