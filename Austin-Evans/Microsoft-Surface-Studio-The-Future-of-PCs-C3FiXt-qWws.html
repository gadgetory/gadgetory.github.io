with something I'm pretty excited about
this is the new Microsoft Surface Studio
so this is really unlike anything that
I've ever seen so at first glance it
looks like an all-in-one
however this hinge is crazy so what's
interesting about this over pretty much
any other all-in-one out there is the
idea that the guts are actually not in
the display but they're in this base
here so it doesn't look like much it's
still fairly thin you still have all of
your ports around back however all the
processor GPU hard drive all that kind
of stuff is in this base which allows
the screen to be a lot lighter and a lot
thinner that's how you can do this for a
while sorry so the studio is rocking a
28 inch screen with a resolution of 4500
by 3000 with 4.5 K resolution things
look nice of course if you have a
Krispie video that definitely helps
so something you'll notice is that it's
actually not a traditional widescreen
display so with that resolution that
means that when you're watching a normal
video like ours you're sure you get bars
on top and bottom however that give you
a little bit more freedom a little bit
more extra screen real estate especially
when you're scrolling through webpages
pulling up videos that kind of stuff so
inside you can get this with either a
poor i5 or i7 and get with up to 32
gigabytes of RAM you also get it with
some pretty serious dedicated graphics
either gtx 960 5 m or a 980 m storage
wise you're getting either a 1 terabyte
or 2 terabyte hard drive and that's
going to be pair with either 64 or 128
gigabyte SSD that's a little bit unusual
for a system like this not to come with
full SSD options however for the most
part pretty spectat
specs like a core i7 and a gtx 980m this
thing can definitely gain so right here
I have Forza horizon 3 however something
like this really should be able to play
basically anything out there it might
not quite match a dedicated gaming PC
especially when you put price to
performance in there but for all one
there's not a lot to complain about and
something else that jumps out to me is
that even though I'm playing a pretty
intense game this is really quiet I mean
you can hear it but you get way down
here I would be worried about thermal
throttling especially when you have
something I can I seven and nine
however it seems to be pretty solid now
alongside the studio there is the new
surface dial now even though this is
specifically for the studio you can also
use it on other surfaces or in fact
anything with Windows 10
however the cool part of this is that
you can drop it right on screen and
adjust just by scrolling it so the thing
is it's actually a fairly simple piece
of hardware so it has this sort of
rubber finish which allows it to just
stick you can obviously move the screen
around and stay right there
or if you want you can also just set it
down you grab the pin in one hand so I
can see that maybe you're sketching and
then you have a little adjustment so up
now I want to back up a little bit try
again so we also have the surface pen
now this is the same if you play with
the surface pro for the surface book as
I'm drawing here I can adjust the color
as I sketch on make a darker make it
lighter picture for a minute someone
with actual skill using this oh you can
also use it to zoom okay yeah that's
yeah that's a alright we should probably
pick a different picture to do all this
on that's a little disturbing so the
navigation is really simple so I can
just rotate it I get a little bit of
feedback and then when I just want to
click on something I just tap it one of
the things that strikes me here is that
everything is quick everything is
responsive I don't feel like I'm waiting
for anything to happen there's pretty
much no latency with the pen I'm able to
adjust my settings really easily if I
actually had Talent this would be
amazing the surface studio is cool so
there have been all-in-ones before there
been computers with touchscreens and
have definitely been high-performance
pcs however never seen such a blend of
all of these elements in such a cool
package I feel like I keep saying cool
but there's really not a whole lot of
other ways to describe it it's just a
really unique piece of hardware so the
studio will be available this holiday
although pre-orders are already live and
starts at $3,000 so what do you guys
think about the studio definitely be
sure to let me know when it comes below
if you want any more in-depth for view
when it comes out level 2 be sure to
subscribe to the channel anyway guys
thank you so much for watching and I
will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
