here with a review of grand theft auto 3
for the iPhone iPod touch and iPad this
is a straight port of the PlayStation 2
version and I'll say it right off the
bat this is a fantastic port of an
awesome game if you want familiar with
what grand theft auto is all about you
should be ashamed GTA 3 is an open-world
sandbox game it allows you to have the
run of an entire city with cars guns
pedestrians and more you can steal just
about any car you see and use it to get
around the very large city one of the
great things about GTA is how alive the
city is and just how much you can do for
example if you steal a taxi you can take
fares and if you take a police cart you
can do vigilante missions which offer a
lot of fun when you want on a main
mission speaking of you will meet
various main characters as you play
through the game you will give you
missions you get a cutscene with Saul
voice acting giving you a setup
on what you have to do missions can
consist of everything from picking up
someone and bringing them to a location
to taking out an enemy and much more
navigation is done by way of the map on
the top left of the screen which shows
points of interest tapping on it will
allow you to get a view of the entire
game map graphics are fantastic
especially considering this is an
open-world game with lots going on at
the screen at one time well it does look
a bit dated compared to something like
Infinity Blade 2 I had zero complaints
about how Grand Theft Auto 3 looks it
also runs quite well on my iPhone 4s
with only the occasional bit of lag when
the screen is filled with action as the
controls are entirely touchscreen based
they are a bit lacking different buttons
appear on the screen depending on what
you were doing with a virtual joystick
for walking a left and right button for
driving along with an assortment of
buttons to run jump get into a car and
warm at the top right you can see your
money help and swipe to change weapons
there are lots of little details that
really make the game fun random dialogue
from people on the street the excellent
radio stations the changes in weather
and even the sound effects all make the
world very immersive on the other hand
though there are some issues with the
game being made for a much larger
display than the iPhone some bits of the
UI are quite small that's easy to tell
that the cutscenes were never made with
a small screen in mind of course if
you're playing with an iPad none of this
even matters if you've played Grand
Theft Auto 3 you can expect
experience on your iPhone iPod Touch or
iPad
it's excellent fun to blast through
Liberty City and just cause mayhem
without even bothering with the missions
and that's what I love best about
open-world games and GTA in particular
if the language violence and subject
matter aren't a problem for you for five
dollars in the App Store I highly
recommend Grand Theft Auto 3 if you
enjoyed definitely be sure to leave this
video a thumbs up and if you want to see
