video on how to properly use a
microphone so a lot of people use
microphones for all kinds of purposes
however today I'm going to give you guys
a few tips on how to use your microphone
to get the absolute best results one of
the most important tips in using a
microphone is to use it properly
so some microphones such as this blue
Yeti here or what is known as a side
address microphone and what that means
is that you need are meant to talk into
it from the side like I'm doing right
now as opposed to doing something like
this talking into the top sure you'll
still be able to hear the audio quality
but as you guys can hopefully tell it's
going to be much much better when you
use it properly as a site address
microphone another tip is to speak
fairly close to the microphone so you
don't actually have to be like right on
top of it that's not going to quite
sound like that great but have a fairly
short distance between you and the
microphone and this is good for a couple
of different reasons for the main thing
is is it allows you to cut out a lot of
the background noise because you're
going to be really up and close to the
microphone and you're going to be
speaking hopefully fairly with a decent
volume it's going to allow you to turn
the overall volume of the microphone
down thereby letting you cut out a lot
of the background noise maybe it's going
to be computers or anything else that's
around you and help kind of cut that
down in addition some microphones have
what is known as recording modes now
again using this blue Yeti as an example
it has four stereo cardioid
omnidirectional and bi-directional
these modes are made to help you get the
right sound in any situation so for
example cardioid which is what I'm using
right now is great for doing voiceovers
podcasts etc so as you can see here I'm
talking straight into the mic there
should be nothing else there's no one
around me and nothing outside do you
want to record this it's going to help
kind of filter out some of the
background noise likewise if I want go
with stereo perhaps if I was doing a
band or something I want to be able to
hear a lot from around the mic it would
do that as well so that's one key thing
although not all microphones do support
these modes if you do have some optional
modes definitely take a look at them
because they can absolutely help
increase your audio quality if you do a
lot of voiceover work like I'm doing
right here a pop filter may be very
helpful and what a pop filter is all
about is kind of helped even out some of
the harsh tones it can kind of pick up
on the audio that you wouldn't otherwise
normally be able to hear I do want to
stress this though a pop filter is
optional it's not going to dramatically
increase your audio quality at any rate
it's just going to help kind of smooth
it out if you're going to be doing a lot
of peas and you know hard sounds on the
microphone but especially if you're
doing other things
such as you know recording a band or
anything like that it's really not going
to be necessary anyway guys that's it
for my tips on how to properly use a USB
microphone so hopefully that you found
this helpful and it helped you improve
your audio quality by just doing a
couple simple things like speaking a
little bit closer to the microphone and
making sure that you are actually
speaking into it properly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
