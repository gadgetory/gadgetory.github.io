here with a review of text now so you've
probably heard of it it's an app that
allows you to call and text with your
own dedicated number harro they now also
have phone service if you're able to
stay on Wi-Fi most of the time the text
now HAP is actually a pretty good deal
however odds are you probably also have
a standard phone plan with minutes
texting data and all that kind of stuff
since I absolutely love paying tons and
tons of money for my phone service which
is not true at all
when Tech's now offered to let me borrow
a review unit to test the service out I
definitely figured it was worth a shot
so at its core text now allows you to do
everything else that you would with a
normal plan so you get texting minutes
data all that kind of fun stuff the real
hook here is that it's cheap as in
really cheap so you have three plans to
choose from tall Grande and venti and
yeah don't ask me exactly why they're
named after coffee but just just go with
it the base plan comes in at $19 a month
however the sweet spot in my opinion is
the grande at $27 with it you get a
gigabyte of data 1250 minutes along with
unlimited texting and incoming calls to
put that in perspective on AT&amp;amp;T you get
250 minutes and no data at all for that
same price so it sounds solid on paper
but is it actually any good for data
coverage texts now uses the Sprint 3G
and LTE network so the last time I use
sprint was back in the WiMAX days it was
definitely pretty rough then how old
were after using text now for the last
couple weeks coverage was solid and
those LTE speeds in particular were way
faster than they used to be however it
definitely does pay if you're going to
be checking it out to see how sprint
coverage is in your area like the text
now app all of your calls and texts
automatically go through Wi-Fi when it's
available and obviously when you're out
and about you can still use the Sprint
3G and LTE network because you're always
using either data or Wi-Fi to make calls
the actual call quality itself is really
solid and texts are really texty and of
course since it's 2013 there are no
contracts to sign which is always nice
to see so that means that you do have
full freedom to switch to change to
cancel your plan do whatever you want as
far as the phones themselves go they've
got a decent selection including the
galaxy s3 which is what I use to make
this review they've also got a Black
Friday sale going on right now - with
$20 off all their devices and if you
want to
different phone for example something
just a little bit newer you can also
activate your own Sprint Android phone
onto text now and it'll work just fine
so it really comes down to what you want
to use overall I'm impressed as long as
you have decent sprint service in your
area it's a killer deal especially with
the ability to transfer your calls and
texts over via Wi-Fi when you're home I
also want to give a big shout out to
Derek from text now for going the extra
mile and getting a Galaxy s3 with a full
year of free text now service to give
away to one of you guys just leave a
comment on this video letting us know
you want to win and definitely go follow
text now over on Twitter and Facebook
give them some love for hooking you guys
up with this awesome giveaway now
unfortunately it is only open if you
live in the United States since well the
phone would only work in the I state
anyway but good luck anyway guys
hopefully you enjoyed this video and I
will catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
