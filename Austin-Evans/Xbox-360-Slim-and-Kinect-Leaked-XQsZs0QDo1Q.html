the Xbox 360 slim just got leaked as
well as the filename for project natal
guys I'm go ahead and start with natal
it's not a huge deal but the new name
will be Kinect and no it's not spelled
Kinect
it suppose a little bit differently um
not a big deal we don't actually know a
whole lot of details about it just
besides the new name which does sound
pretty cool but it looks like they will
announce both the Xbox 360 slim and
connect later on tonight or tomorrow and
there in the next couple days right
before 83 but guys the big news is Xbox
360 slim looks like it is confirmed
now how we know this is that there was
an ad leaked I'm just bad like a 10
second ad I'll have it linked in the
description you guys will watch it for
yourself I mean it's a very short ad
basically I believe it's in Italian no
quote me on that though but it basically
shows Xbox 360 slim and a couple of
features so guys take a look at the
picture it is a pretty interesting
console you know a lot of people said
Xbox 360 slim you know didn't think
you'd be no vastly change but it is kind
of it looks a lot more angular it's got
a lot more you know straight lines all
over the place it doesn't look a fair
bit thinner although I wouldn't know
it's not a huge difference
um but guys there are some more it looks
like it will have a 250 gigabyte hard
drive built-in so that's that's really
good news
go ahead and get bumped up and also it
looks like it will have Wi-Fi finally
so guys looks like they said it will be
Wi-Fi will be built in so no more
spending all kinds of you know half the
price the console to buy a Wi-Fi adapter
I mean that was ridiculous
and of course it will work with Kinect
so guys not a huge update I just want to
let you guys know we will probably be
getting more details I'll make another
video tomorrow once we get the full
details price all what kind of stuff but
for now guys I just want to let you know
that both of these look really cool and
yeah anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
