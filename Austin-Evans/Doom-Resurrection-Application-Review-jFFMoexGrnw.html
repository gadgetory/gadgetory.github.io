hey guys what is up it's Duncan and stay
I've got a full application review on a
pretty popular application called doom
resurrection it's a really unique
first-person shooter it just came out
just about a week ago or so and I've
been playing a lot and I gotta say I'm
pretty impressed it's got some very very
unique controls up graphics are just
excellent and in general is very
polished in a very unique game I won't
go ahead get into it so let's get this
one started
okay so doom is a really cool
first-person shooter now when you start
playing it you know you think of
different things but the first thing
that definitely comes to my mind are the
controls if you look at other
first-person shooters on the iphone and
ipod touch they're okay but they're all
flawed pretty much and basically just
because the controls are bad because you
think with an iphone touchscreen there's
only so many things you can do obviously
you got as many buttons you want on the
thing but there's no actual feedback on
that there are a few ways around it you
can use touchscreen some games use
touchscreen to aim and stuff some use
the accelerometer to tilt and everything
that's good but still it's not as good
as having a couple of joysticks or
something in your hand well doom really
does a good job of just forgetting that
in it that's it pretty uniquely to
basically in Doom if you look at
obviously there's lots of different
control the different control buttons
such as changing guns pausing reloading
getting into cover firing all that kind
of stuff but the controls themselves are
very simple you see you do not control
your you're walking you're on a fixed
path he walks by himself all you
basically do is aim and shoot it's a
very unique sort of thing because I mean
obviously you like to move around by
yourself but it's kind of odd when you
know you're like walking down now we'll
say it's not it's very fluid it's not
like he just walks walks walks walks
walks like I mean he'll go wrong ways
and come back it's all very scripted it
actually makes four it really does it
help the story because every time you go
up to door and this and this and then
this happens and it's very cool because
it it really gives the game a feel that
it was actually really scripted nicely
and you get the full experience
basically the controls that you
generally will have to do is that you
can basically to tilt the accelerometer
you will have to I will say this and
it's kind of a pet peeve of mine when
you first open the game the controls are
inverted you can go ahead I definitely
know this is at least what I did going
there too
the pause menu and uninvite them because
I just can't stand converted controls
but you basically use the accelerometer
to aim which works quite nicely and
while it is on a fixed pass at you as
you as you turn a name it does your your
head doesn't move quite nicely so it's
it's not bad and then you basically just
shoot um that's your that's what you
usually do now there's some monsters
that will toss flames at you or you get
into gun fights with and then you can
use the cover button the cut button is
actually quite nice um now usually you
think cover you know you get behind
something but the way that this is
scripted it's quite cool you hit the
cover button and you'll always be
whenever you find enemies you always be
near some cover so basically you will
pull back behind a beam some fence
whatever you'll pull back and then they
will start shooting at you or they will
sort of throwing stuff at you and
basically you fire back at them now the
button kind of does multitask if you're
up against like something they like
would shoot at you for example then it
will usually pull you back into cover if
you're if you're something that's
throwing something at you then use it to
dodge it's quite cool there are also
some interesting things like such as
when some of the larger zombies when
they grab you you shake your device to
get them to get off you get off you
which is it's pretty cool anyway let it
go ahead and get into the story really
briefly I don't want to spoil anything
basically you are a marine it's in the
it's in the future sometime in the
future and you're a marine who is this
is basically like this this company has
taken over I haven't taken over but
they're so advanced they've got so much
money they're basically they just better
just basically the rulers I mean and
basically what it is is they hair on
Mars and this is the whole game is on
well not the whole game but the game
starts on Mars and basically what it is
is that they have been experimenting
with teleportation somehow they've got
zombies and monsters and they've got
this whole thing straight up it's
basically down to you to try to figure
out what's going on and save the day
since four
simple but the story is quite good um
now that's one thing a lot of action and
you know a lot of these type of games
kind of can get little soft on the story
to kind of like well I don't that didn't
make any sense or that's kind of dumb
this one is very nicely nicely done it
does have a lot to do with the way that
your movements are scripted you know at
first if somebody had told me that the
movements were scripted I'll be probably
kind of leery of the game but the way it
works it's actually quite nice it works
smoothly and I enjoy it so basically the
way it works is you just go you just go
through the levels and now it not the
way it's scripted it's not like you're
constantly moving you guys do this is
this I mean it you don't have for it you
can't pick where you go I mean you you
are moving on a pretty linear path but
doesn't the levels are well they're big
you generally will walk through them
going around and up and everything it's
a very unique experience now I know you
guys probably thinking of games sort of
like this that probably like a long time
ago it's it's really unique it's kind of
hard for me to explain but it does work
now I will say that I because whether
it's because of the way that it's
scripted or not the graphics are really
really nice um now I say that sounds
like it seems like i say this quite
often but the graphics are probably the
best first-person shooter graphics have
seen um there's no a lot of times you'll
see like sort of flat animations like
let's say it's going to be a pillar
that's like ridged or whatever and in
real life you would see obviously it
would be ridged but in the game it kind
of gets compressed into light just like
straight up and down like smooth there
really aren't it's really none of that
in this all the textures are nice and no
textured it's everything is 3d it's not
like you know you got like these flat
ugly animations whatever everything
looks very nice um you know this is
these are really good controls probably
in between playstation one and
playstation 2 in my opinion and
definitely approaching the PSP and
remember guys this is for just the
normal ipod and iphone this is the mean
obviously it works for the 3gs but this
is not even a maid for the 3gs yet this
is just on
anybody's iphone so that really gets me
excited for what the 3gs can run anyway
I'm not I don't want to go this go into
this too deep i just want to give you
guys a what you i think you know i will
say it is ten dollars and that is quite
expensive but you know I am NOT I this
is a great game for ten dollars the the
level of replay value is not that great
old say just because you're on one pass
not like you get different things but
the game is quite long there are eight
levels and each level will take you a
good a good while to complete and then
the difficulty is not that bad but I
mean it's fairly good and between the
scripted which I know I've said this
before I would say one time it works it
really does it just works I mean I much
prefer this compared to the the really
weak controls on most other I mean
basically the only reason you to use the
touchscreen is to fire and usually I
mean you have your other buttons but
usually you just used fire and then you
use the accelerometer to tilt and that's
just but all you have to worry about and
because it's scripted you get it you got
some really good scenes like like you
know y'all's and you'll turn around
there's zombies like right on top of you
or this or that and it really works um
so guys if you like first-person
shooters um you know if you I recommend
check it out you might not want to pay
two dollars and I can understand it's a
good game definitely uh but you know ten
dollars a lot of money so consider it um
I like it I don't think it's going down
in pricing time soon it's a fairly new
and it's I think it's maybe like 12th or
something on the top leaderboard but
guys definitely a really cool app check
it out I'm really enjoying it it's
probably the best first-person shooter
available on the iphone ipod touch hey
guys be sure to go check out seizure
calm we've got all kinds of iphone and
itouch news jailbreak tutorials and lots
of really good app reviews edition be
