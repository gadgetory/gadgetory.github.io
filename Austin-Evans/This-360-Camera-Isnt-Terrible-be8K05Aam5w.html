whether you like it or not
make sure you might be used to standard
boring 2d video like this but with the
Ricoh theta s you have a camera that
fits in your pockets I can shoot full
360 video so there are a lot of 360
cameras on the market what I like about
the theta is that knowledge of the shoot
greats builds at least in theory but
it's small stuff like the Year 360 while
the great camera only works with a
single phone it's also a lot harder to
carry in your pocket so inside the box
the first thing we get is the actual
camera itself you know this kind of
reminds me of one of those old flip
cameras only difference is instead of
having one camera it actually has two so
no matter how you hold it you're always
in one of the cameras view so it's got
this nice soft touch material we have a
button up on front as well as a few
things on the side turn off Wi-Fi switch
between photo and video mode as well as
just turning on and off the camera on
bottom of the just standard tripod
thread as well as USB and HDMI so in
theory you can actually do livestream
with the theta however you have to plug
it in probably nightly be super useful
inside it's rocking eight gigabytes of
internal memory but there's no microSD
expansion so that means that while there
not a ton of space especially
considering stills are only 14 megapixel
in the video with 1080p you should be
able to get a fair bit onto the camera
but before we get too far into that we
get the wonderful Quick Start Guide
which does not look quick at all and we
also have a pouch so since this is a 360
camera it actually is important to keep
those lenses clean most compact cameras
will have some sort of like lens
covering or whatever but these are big
really wide-angle cameras so it actually
probably makes sense to keep it in the
pouch so the first step is to download
the app so that's actually one of the
nice things about the theta is that
while the gear 360 only works with a few
modern Samsung phones this should in
theory work with most everything oh wow
that looks like a thing okay we have
video so what do I do here this guy up
what is that image synthesizing I just
take a 360 photos myself okay well um
that's uh that's a thing that's
definitely an amazing shot um but still
looks really nice though there's no
artifacts or anything I'm sure if you
look close enough you can figure out
where it's stitched but today she looks
really nice
alright so with the live preview I can
get a good look of what I'm gonna get on
the phone which is super weird but when
ready 3 2 1 it's like the greatest show
denoise ever so once we actually get it
on the phone we can just swipe around
and see that's wow that's a little bit
disturbing um oh my gosh whoa wait a
second you can zoom it all the way out
to a sphere Oh interesting that's
actually really cool so honestly the
stills are kind of one of the cooler
parts of this camera but there is a
video mode as well we should be able to
see how amazing the world looks in full
360 video or how crunchy and low
resolution it is but probably amazing
right probably no this is bad I mean
sure I'm watching it on my phone and
it's only a 1080p image that's being
stretched for the full 360 frame but
pretty much usable here if you guys want
a full 360 video I'll be able to see a
bunch of samples from this there will be
a link in the description over on
Facebook which actually do a really good
job of supporting the 360 video but it
first minute it's not that so it's one
thing to use the fade in the office but
the real world test is the real world
something I really like about the theta
is just how portable it is so it'll
easily fit in a pocket and when you're
ready to actually take a shot hit the
power button and done I'm sure like we
didn't look like nerds or anything at
all there I really appreciate just how
quick it is to be able to transfer stuff
and turn on so those pictures we just
took I can pretty much immediately bring
it over to my phone and once it's copied
a little bit a little bit of hand action
there you can see it didn't quite
perfectly stitch it so I think one of
the things you have to kind of get used
to is holding it maybe just a little bit
lower so if those dual 12 megapixel
cameras we're getting a 14 point 4
megapixel stitched file and it looks
really nice even with the sort of I
would say pretty pretty harsh done in a
greens you can see above the building is
a little bit too Slone out but honestly
this is not bad-looking at all and if
you really want to sort of get the exact
shot that you want you do have full
manual control so it might just be
sitting on a bench right now however
where I'm actually doing is recording a
360 video so the quality isn't amazing
so yes you can be able to kind of look
around and get the full 360 experience
if you're watching this in 360 however
the issue is is that it's just not that
high resolution it works it's definitely
a cool effect but honestly I feel like
this still looks a lot better than the
video
however it does take some getting used
to so what I like about meseta is just
how easy it is to use it turns on
quickly
you just have a quick shot you can
transfer it to your smartphone and see
it there or of course a to a computer
edit it whatever you want to do now the
image quality I think is a lot better
than the video quality however if you
want to get 360 video a try especially
360 stills the theta is worth a look so
what do you guys think about 360
definitely be sure to let me know what
you think in the comments below and I
will catch you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
