full series showing you how to create
your channel how to make videos how to
get them to use all that kind of stuff
so in Part C we're going to talk about
making the videos themselves of course
you even watched part two I recommend
going ahead and doing that we covered
how to decide what kind of videos you
want to make making your channel name
and looking ahead and creating a channel
layout so now that is if you have all
that down we're ready to go ahead and
begin making your videos quarters that's
that's the whole reason you're here so I
can't exactly just say you make a video
this way that way I can give you some
tips on what kind of equipment and do
some don't small that kind of stuff so
let's cover some of the big do's and
don'ts so one of the big things that a
lot of that get some people into trouble
is copyright so guys copyright you know
it could be music all kinds of different
stuff can really come back to bite you
whether it's immediately or later so
although obviously there's you know the
standard stuff you know you don't want
to be using music so for example you
know maybe like Metallica you don't need
to be using the song from them or
something if you do need to use music I
didn't have a link in the description
check it out it's incompetent that's
what I get all my music from he makes
fantastic free royalty-free music all
you do is just put a link maybe two back
in the credits of the video or in the
description to him just saying that he
made it and then you can use the music
however you want so guys it's fantastic
I highly recommend go ahead and check
that out if you do need music
but copyright is farther than that dope
really to you know to explain how it
works if you did not create it so for
example this video I created obviously
because it's just me in Barbican or so I
own the copyright to it so that's one
thing that's totally fine now
if you have permission to use it so for
example that's the incompetent music he
made it but he's giving you permission
as long as you give it you know the
proper credit so that's something else
that is okay now guys there's also
something called fair use and this is
where it gets really you know really
shady so sometimes you can use
copyrighted content in videos and it's
under fair use so take for example a
video game review obviously you don't
you didn't create the video game and
you can't really you know you say that
you own it but if you're doing it for
review purposes that is considered fair
use and YouTube is 100% fun with that um
now where it's not it's for example when
you're doing all video game walkthrough
that is where it's not because you're
just showing people how to get through
it you know actually reviewing it so
guys there's a fine line and it's kind
of hard you know to say whether what's
good and what's bad but guys in general
if you did not create it or it's not for
reviewing purchases or something like
that you probably should not be using it
one of the biggest things that will help
you on YouTube is if you are a really
good speaker so what that means is that
you need to be able to be confident and
you need to keep away from the arms and
ears and stuff like that so for example
I say guys way too much it's just kind
of something I do I say that in real
life as well as videos and that's
something I really should learn I've
been trying to cut down on and stuff
like that will really help you if you
know that you you see what your
weaknesses are so you see that maybe say
on too much if you can concentrate on
that and you know stop saying mom and
her and stuff and just continue to speak
that will really help you out and the
other thing is if you really need to be
confident so for example right now I'm
staring at a camera lens and I'm talking
just as if it was a person you really do
need to be able to do that because most
of the time you're gonna be by yourself
or you're not really gonna you know
obviously you're not gonna be seeing you
know YouTube you're just looking at a
camera so you really need to get past
that you really need to understand that
you're actually talking to you know this
is there gonna be a full video but you
need to be confident you can stand like
what you know what you're doing so I
mean that's which one would you prefer
listen to me who I'm obviously keeping
eye contact with the camera I'm you know
speaking you know relatively well not
you know saying a bunch of arms nerves
or you know if you're doing something
like this like stuff like that is
obviously really gonna not help you make
your videos sure you may get some views
but people are going to watch the video
they're not gonna go I'm gonna want to
subscribe they're not gonna wanna ever
watch any of your videos again because
of like no like I doesn't know what he's
talking about so guys if you're a good
speaker if you're good natural you know
good speaker course ooh they'll start
saying I start messing up my own speech
but if you're good at speaking if you
know what you're doing you sound
confident and if you're okay with
talking in front of a camera then you
will go really far it really will help
you out one really great piece of advice
I can give you guys is the
do not need to be afraid to fail so for
example for all I know this series might
not be very good you guys might not be
learning anything and it might be a
total fail I guess look I'm going to
take a chance because for all I know it
could be very good and I might have
millions of people watching it tomorrow
you never know so guys don't be afraid
to fail if you don't know maybe maybe a
video is not going to be as funny as you
thought or whatever it happens all the
time so don't worry about it you know
every single video isn't like a life of
death situation you know so if we make a
video people aren't really liking it
that's okay for all you know the next
video which you might be unsure about
might be fantastic people will love it
and you know you took a chance and it
paid off ok guys so now that you have up
doing some general tips let's go ahead
and begin with what kind of stuff you
will need to make your videos so the
first thing is that you are going to
need a camera so guys this might be
likely will already have a camera that
will work so you know if you have a
digital camera almost all of them have
some kind of movie mode you don't
necessarily need you know a really
expensive high-definition camera because
while video quality is important you
know the video content what what you're
saying how you say it all that kind of
stuff is more important than opinio
quality so I mean just because you have
maybe you have a really expensive
high-definition camera on the other hand
does not mean that you're going to make
fantastic videos so if you already have
a camera that's great you might want to
go ahead and invest in maybe a cheaper
high-definition camera so for example
all my videos were shot on the same you
exactly CG 10 which currently can be
found for just about 120 to 130 dollars
so that's the very cheap camera but it
does give me good video quality and it's
a really decent camera so guys go ahead
whatever you do if you already have a
camera that's great or if you go ahead
and spend new $100 $200 whatever on a
new camera that's just fine too
now for something that depends on what
kind of videos you make is your lighting
so for example when I'm talking to the
camera right now I obviously want a lot
of light on me I want you guys be able
to see so I have quite a few lights so
above me I have three pretty powerful
lights to go ahead and illuminate to the
left to the right into the top of me
then I have a 150 watt flood lamp
straight on my face which just kind of
gets a little bit annoying after a while
but it does really light up the video
and really lets you see more so guys I'm
going to show you what the difference
with no light with a little bit of
lighting with my full light so guys this
is what it looks like with no lights on
I'll have it just my window open it's
kind of an overcast day so as you can
see it works but it's not very good
quality now I have my top three lights
on this is the way I used to make videos
and while it's pretty bitching you guys
can see me pretty well I hope but still
it's not quite better so there you go
guys this is just a break thing lighting
is usually very important you don't ask
there I have to have a huge lighting rig
I mean sometimes maybe just like a
couple of lamps or whatever you happen
to have around well a lot of times give
you good lighting but it is really
important for most videos now guys but
you have all the hardware if it's just
one last thing and it is a computer I'm
sure most of you guys do have a computer
obviously you're watching YouTube right
now so the thing is though is that you
will need to be able to be capable of
video editing now pretty much any
computer can video eight it but it
depends on what kind of camera you have
and everything and how powerful the
computer is at how well it will it so
guys there's not a magic number there's
not like what we need this computer or
that computer a lot of computers will
work and they wor just fine if you have
a newer computer it definitely will help
you out especially if you're editing
high-definition video like I do
so guys trust me when I say if you have
a more powerful computer it will really
will help you out when you're editing
videos but as long as your computer can
do it without you know pausing and
freezing and I'm taking you a couple
hours to do that you should be okay okay
guys that's it for my setup video about
the do's and don'ts of creating your
videos as well as some general tips and
what kind of equipment you should use
that force guys this is what equipment I
use now of course you do not make this a
lot of times you might need less
sometimes you might be more for example
you might have to need a green screen or
maybe you might not need lighting maybe
you do string casts or something like
that
so guys this is just kind of general
stuff that you might want to consider
whether or not you need any well guys
definitely stay tuned episode 3 will be
coming soon thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
