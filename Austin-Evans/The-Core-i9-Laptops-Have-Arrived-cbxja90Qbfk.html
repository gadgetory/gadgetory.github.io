laptops I have some good news for you
so Intel recently invited me out to
their event in San Francisco where they
showed off a wide range of new chips
including not only Intel processors that
have built in AMD dedicated graphics but
we're also going to be getting new
laptop chips across the board including
a brand new six core core i-9 option for
laptops so let's start with the very
first Intel processor that has dedicated
AMD graphics that are actually built
inside the chip or by its short name of
the eighth generation Intel Core
processors with Radeon rx Vega graphics
because you know that rolls off the
tongue so the CPU side of things isn't
all that exciting you're getting a quad
core cable a base CPU that at least on
the core i7 can boost up to 4.2
gigahertz what really makes this special
is the idea that you're getting a pretty
much dedicated Radeon graphics card
that's actually going to be paired
inside that same chef so this is going
to be a custom Vega implementation with
between 20 or 24 ciues depending on if
you go with Core i5 or Core i7 they had
a couple laptops available to demo the
HP Spectre x-360 which looks very
similar to the Envy x-360 we recently
took a look at running rising mobile as
well as the Dell XPS 15 two and one now
these are fairly thin unlike laptops now
they do have 15-inch displays when you
consider that they have the CPU and the
GPU all inside a 65 watt TDP they don't
have to be all that thick and they don't
need to have any kind of crazy cooling
it's all going to be on one chip which
means that for a lot of these things
they can actually be pretty close to
ultrabooks and of course being much much
more powerful no we'll have to wait
until I actually get one of these
laptops into test but if you do want to
sneak peek at the performance I recently
did do a video on the new Hades Canyon
and tail nook which was going to be a
little bit more powerful does have that
same chip inside there were a ton of
other processors announced as well so on
the mainstream side the u series
processors that go on a ton of ultra
books are going to be getting Irish Plus
graphics so while these are going to be
almost definitely found in things like
the next generation 13-inch MacBook
it's going to be really nice to be able
to have a fairly thin and small laptop
they can have not only quad-core
processors but also pretty decent
integrated graphics
nothing crazy certainly not going to
touch the Radeon stuff but it should be
a nice step forward what's really
exciting though are the brand new gaming
top chefs so these are the h-series
processors and at 45 watts it's what you
find in pretty much any gaming laptop as
well as some workstations so there's a
big change across the board first of all
the core i5 are basically being bumped
up to what you used to be able to get us
a core i7 so there's still going to be
quad core but they now have hyper
threading so if you have a older
generation Core i7 the low ends now is
going to be roughly equivalent the real
sweet spot though are going to be the
brand-new eighth generation Core i7
which is just like the desktop are
moving from four cores to six cores and
yes having six cores in the gaming
laptop is going to be awesome especially
considering that they keep that same 45
watt TDP it's literally just more free
performance the only no place you lose
out here is with clock speed so with the
base core i7 8750 h when you're
completely maxing it out with all six
cores the base clock is only going to be
two point two gigahertz however it can
boost all the way up to 4.2 gigahertz
and I assume that'll be a lot closer to
that for the most parts now if you step
up to the higher end for i7 8850 h these
numbers are a lot that guy is going to
be able to run at two points a skier
Hertz base or four point three Pierre
Hertz boost on top of that that 8850 H
does have some slight overclocking
capabilities so the depending on whether
the laptop om will actually allow you to
do it or not it can in theory be boosted
by another 400 megahertz what I'm gonna
excited to get my hands on though is
that brand new Intel Core i nine laptop
check so this is essentially built on
what you're getting on the core i7 with
the six core design but cranks up
everything to 11 the I 989 50 HK has
that same six core hyper threaded design
as the i7 however it bumps up the clock
speeds to 2.9 gigahertz bays and
especially with their new velocity boost
which will allow an even higher turbo
clock assuming that you're going to be
fairly cool on the processor you can get
up to four point eight gigahertz out of
the core I nine even better is that it's
going to be overclockable so I feel like
it's going to be only a matter of time
before we start seeing laptops with a
six core 5 gigahertz plus processor
until had a few of these quinine systems
set up and to be fair they were all very
very thick but a lot of that is because
they all had a gtx canadian side which
as you will probably know is nice
they're going to be the easiest thing to
cool go over it you don't actually need
dual power supplies for the core I 9 as
it is still going to be a 45 watt chip
at least until you start overclocking
all these processors should be going on
sale pretty shortly but I've got to say
I am really excited for the new i7s and
I 9 having six cores and a laptop is
going to be a legit game-changer I'm
curious which of these processors do you
think will make it into your next laptop
let me know in the comments below and I
will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
