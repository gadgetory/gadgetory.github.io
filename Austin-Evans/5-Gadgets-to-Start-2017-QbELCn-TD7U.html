with five cool tickets that won't break
the bank
I'm going to start with we have the
latest in cutting-edge mobile VR
technology Google daydream so this
really is an evolution of what you would
find with Google cardboard and one the
main reasons to make this different so
it has the controller which is one of
the big differences between this and
cardboard but we'll get to that in a
second you know gonna say this actually
looks pretty nice so it's all the sort
of soft touch fabric material one of the
things with VR headsets is that they can
get kind of uncomfortable after a while
and get hot and sweaty and especially if
it's heavy it's got a really kind of way
on you but this actually is pretty nice
so one of the downsides to using
daydream is that it is not as widely
compatible as cardboard which works on
pretty much everything so with a dream
you need to use a few specific phones
and the main ones were that are out
right now are the pixel phones so future
guys definitely the future um all right
so I can actually aim with the
controller that's cool all right so now
the Google photos this is a panorama I
took in San Diego and you know what that
is she looks pretty cool whoa
alright just do you toward 2016 you know
the reasons this is so good 360 video is
cool but when you have to take that and
kind of stretch it all the way around
you it becomes very difficult to
actually be able to get something it's a
high enough resolution you're talking
about something like probably 8k if not
12 K to really get the full resolution
all around you or something like this
I'm watching on what's essentially looks
like a giant big screen in front of me
oh that's cool so I'm here on the page
to download Need for Speed and as I look
around I'm actually sitting in a garage
so that's kind of cool so I can actually
reach down VR and pick up the daydream
controller it's not perfectly one-to-one
like five is but that's what she really
cool I mean once you're in the game it
looks nice I guess I just it's really
hard for me to take a racing game
seriously without good controls and this
is kind of goofy some other things with
the daydream controller it doesn't feel
like it's really that well-suited for an
experience like this it works and
honestly it works better than it really
should for a racing game but I think
this is gonna be this would be a lot
better suit if I actually had a proper
controller
I think daydream might
be my favorite mobile VR setup so for
$80 assuming you have a daydream
compatible phone like a pixel this is a
pretty cool gift to start out with it's
not as good as a full VR setup but this
is also a lot cheaper and a lot smaller
next we have the Kingston MobileLite
Wireless Pro and pick shoutout to
Kingston for sponsoring this video so
this little guy actually does a lot so
for starters we have 64 gigabytes of
storage built in so when you pair it via
Wi-Fi to your phone you can use it to
dump all kinds of data pictures videos
all that kind of stuff there's also an
SD card reader as well as a full USB
port
now that port does double duty first of
all you can plug something like a flash
drive in to expand the capacity or you
can pull your phone in because this
doubles as a backup battery so to get
this guy up and running all you do is
connect to the Wi-Fi network and then
download the MobileLite app yeah there
we go 58 point 2 gigabytes free as one
of my most treasured possessions in life
this photo of Ralphy has to be backed up
in as many places as possible and the
first place is my mobile light you can
also do full backups from your phone so
for example I could dump my entire
camera roll over here
contact calendar all that kind of stuff
well it's nice to have this stuff backed
up on the cloud you should always have
multiple copies of anything is really
important and something that this is
easy enough to carry around with you
everywhere now as far as gifts go I
honestly think this is probably one of
the best things on the list this is the
Fujifilm Instax Mini 90 so what you're
getting here is essentially a new-age
Polaroid so it's a film camera that will
immediately print your shots out yes
this looks so cool man like ah I'm gonna
say I really like the look of this thing
so Fuji does make a cheaper version of
the Instax but it looks a little more
like a toy it's all plastic
whereas this looks properly retro or I'm
back you're not gonna find a lot so you
have a couple of buttons to change your
mode turn on and off things like the
flash and you also have an actual
optical viewfinder even though this is a
film camera we do have a rechargeable
battery but once we get this in
we just need to load the film I mean we
all had digital cameras we're all used
to be able to take a million pictures or
pick the best one but there's something
special about you get one shot if you
waste it that's gone so I feel like it
almost kind of forces you to be a better
photographer even if you've never used a
film camera before this is super easy so
all you do is take this guy
lined up on the back of the camera there
we go
God there's something so satisfying
about a physical picture ooh but that
actually is pretty good that looks
pretty good
that looks like Ken right there this is
actually work I don't actually know if
this trick works I've always seen people
do it I don't believe it works this is
not the most practical camera in the
world but it is a lot of fun knowing
that you have that pressure to make sure
you get the shot right and be able to
actually get a physical version of that
shot almost immediately it's not some
amazing new concept but I've got to say
this is way more fun than I thought it
was going to be next we have the
chromecast ultra so if you guys been
watching the channel for a while or you
know follow technology at all you know
that the chromecast is kind of a big
deal and this is the latest version
which supports not only 4k but also HDR
so this is not any kind of massive
difference between previous chromecast's
what you're getting here really is just
a heart at first glance it's really
difficult to tell the difference between
the ultra and the normal chromecast and
in actual use it's also going to be
pretty difficult because it's basically
the same thing the main advantage here
really is the idea of getting a fairly
inexpensive 4k streaming box or well
puck I guess is a better term so what
you have a chromecast hooked up to your
TV it's a pretty seamless experience so
you connect it to your Wi-Fi and once
you do you can pretty much stream from
any device this chromecast compatible
and these days there are a lot so most
apps have chromecast support so things
like YouTube things like Netflix you can
stream right to your TV and honestly I
should for chromecast to most sort of
Smart TV interfaces if you're still
rocking a 1080p TV the normal chromecast
is fine however if you plan on upgrading
your video game for 2017 the chromecast
ultra is worth a look if you're looking
for something a little bit more on the
stocking stuffer side of things then we
have power tabs so these are kind of
interesting they are one-time use mobile
chargers for smartphones so not only do
you have one with a lightning cable but
you can also pick it up for micro USB
and at about $5 each this can actually
really come in handy so I think for the
most part you're going to find these
things and like vending machines and
that sort of stuff but if you're in a
pinch and you really need a quick charge
there's not a lot to this guy Wow
that is actually no disposable battery
might sound like a bad idea but this is
very basic so it's got sort of a
cardboard shell and the lightning cable
is very very simple however considering
that these are all recyclable it does
make sense so the charge we should just
be able to plug it into the Lightning
port and there we go charging so with
about a thousand milliamp hours it might
not give you a full charge in fact it
definitely won't but in a quick pinch
you need a little bit of extra juice
this could be a serious life saver as
always all the links you guys need will
be in the description of this video you
should also go check out a video from my
friends over at Kingston where they
check out some of the best photography
tips anyway guys thank you so much for
watching and I will catch you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
