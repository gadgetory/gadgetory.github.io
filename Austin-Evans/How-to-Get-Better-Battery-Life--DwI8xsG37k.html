we rely on more and more gadgets phones
and iPods and have left at the mercy of
the batteries everyone can attest being
stranded with a dead battery at least
once all it takes is to forget to charge
up your favorite device and it never
fails a few hours later you'll find it
dead today let me show you a very simple
way to increase your battery life by
calibrating all you need to do is drain
your battery all the way down until your
device shuts off then simply plug it in
and allow it to fully charge that's it
by doing this you've calibrated your
battery how this works is very simple
all rechargeable batteries have a sensor
that reports back to the device what the
percentage of battery remaining is
however batteries are in a constant
state of change as far as the amount of
charge they contain by recalibrating the
minimum and maximum charge level the
battery can hold this will result in a
much more accurate battery reading for
it to be most effective you should do
this at least once a month so that's it
a very simple way to ensure you get the
maximum battery life possible for any
device with rechargeable batteries if
