am today with a was a new application
review and this one is this is one of my
personal favorites for for my iPod and
it is called gallon I'm sure most of you
will have heard of it before there is a
lite version in the App Store and this
is the paid version and I've I said I've
said I'll say it again this is
definitely one of if not my favorite
application it is so unique and it's got
such good gameplay and it's got so many
just great things going for it it's
almost any time I pick up my ipod I've
got I've got to play it it's that great
okay the first flood goes I'll just run
you through gelik on the way it works is
it's like it's a really unique game
basically what you are is you have
planets it's it's when you part of
everything you have a whole row of
planets and basically you start out with
dependent it it depends on how many
actually start out with and the modes
and stuff but basically there's planets
all around you and usually your
objective is is there is one mode that's
different but almost all the time is to
basically to get rid of your opponents
and by doing that what you do is there
are a lot of plants around and you send
your you send your spaceship sight I
suppose to to each of the different
plants and every planet the you'll and
we plant it that's grey is not it's not
taken it'll have a little number on it
and your your planets all will have
numbers on it which is how many troops
you have there and basically you just
dry you just touch them and drag it over
and you'll send all your troops over to
the whichever plan you want and then
basically what it'll do is once like
let's say there's a planet witness says
ten well you well if you send eleven
troops over there you'll have it and you
have one troop sitting there and what it
is is that they're different sized
planets and they're all all the planets
hackney different I mean you could have
a giant one that will needs three and
you have a small and needs to be FD I
mean it's
it's totally random but basically what
you need to do is you need to grab
planets to uh and when you put more
troops on a planet they regenerate so
let's say you send 50 to a planet and it
takes 20 well after a minute or whatever
you'll have all yours grown back and
keep I'll keep rising um and basically
the object of the game is to take out
your opponents and they will be having
the same advantages and everything
there's a couple of different modes one
of which I'll explain a little bit later
but okay the main modes are classic
which that is in the light version it's
basically just really basic simple
there's you versus one other computer
opponent and basically it's just
fighting and now I will say that's the
best version that's available in the
light version so and it's the light
version is basically is really simple
all it is just the classic mode but I
mean I would definitely I mean that
that's almost fun enough where you don't
even need to buy coke on but you
definitely you get so hooked because
there's a lot of cool things anyway so
there's classic mode there's stealth
mode stealth mode is uh basically in
classic mode you can see what what's
your opponents like like like if you
have how many ever troops you can see
how many they have and where where is in
stealth mode you cannot see them and
basically it's just you've got you just
see a planet it could have ten example
hundred you don't know until you attack
it then there is vacuum which vacuums a
little different there you have no
opponent what is is that depending on
what level there's ten different
difficulty levels
how much level you have you start out in
the empty field and you have your
hundred troops on in your main planet
basically you have five minutes three
minutes two minutes whatever depending
on the mode to take every single planet
and it that's actually a lot of fun
it'll-it'll can teach you go can teach
you how to how to expand and how to you
know you know get big planets first and
this is this this next there is beast
beast is the most difficult mode in gal
con um beast is basically you can't see
them and
a I don't actually know you can't see
how many troops they have but I've got
imagine they have a lot more than you it
is extremely difficult and once you get
once you get playing Galco a lot you'll
definitely find that that's the mode you
could come back to then there's three
way which is basically you versus on a
computer versus a computer and you it's
no teams or anything it's just everyone
and then which is fun because you know
you wanna you don't want to necessarily
just go up against one and then the best
the best part of this game is the online
play that is it is really really cool
and I mean you play against computers is
nice but when you start playing it is
actually really really awesome and then
with the latest update because the way
the net games work is it a format for
everything is just uh up to four up to
four in one game and basically it's just
you know just free-for-all just go
everything
no special rules or anything but the way
and you can't see how many troops they
have but then the new update is two on
two
so basically you can go and you can have
a partner and then you and your partner
are up against and uh two other partners
and that really adds and this was the
recent update maybe all week ago that
really adds a really fun thing because
then you have to think okay well I can
take this but if I don't protect my
partner all this stuff it's a lot of fun
so anyway that was pretty long but I
gotta say the gameplay is awesome uh
I've personally never seen anything even
close to gokon you will you will just
absolutely love I mean it's unique it's
fun it's got good graphics not amazing
or anything but you for this kind of
game mean awesome 3d graphics are it's
just not it's just not what you need
it's just uh I mean I just got no I'm
just keep raining LaVette but the
gameplay is just so much fun when you
mean you take the planets you it
I just got the gallic on right now is
$3.00 but there's a light version and I
would definitely definitely recommend if
you never played for go try it now it
just kind of will it's kind of uh you
know you have you can play it as many
times as you want it's just classic mode
definitely it go try it it's not nearly
as fun as the full version with the net
play and everything but it's still a lot
of fun there's also in the full version
I'm just gonna skipping around trying to
remember all because it's a pretty
full-featured there's also local so like
let's say you and a buddy or we both
have iPods iPhones or whatever you can
play together there's no two players on
one device but the way it works if that
really would kind of be a little
confusing because you have all fingers
all front and get it all over the place
that really wouldn't work too well but
you can if you have a friend like nearby
or whatever you can play it and then
there's also rankings you uh depend on
how you win and lose you also or
everyone is ranked and let me tell you
there's some really tough tough things
um when you plan it there's also some
pretty good music and sound effects but
you probably you probably will apply
just turn down the music well I don't
know that's what I do because noise
people when you playing games and stuff
but he's got good music and got some
good sound effects one uh there's also
one really cool feature is there's a
colorblind mode because the way it works
is that your a color there's all a lot
of different colors yeah in the normal
mode anyway there's all kinds of
different colors and for if you're
colorblind or whatever that would really
really mess you up so that's something
pretty unique I've I've only seen it
maybe a couple of other applications in
the App Store so that's that's a cool
feature gal con is like I said one of my
absolute favorite applications just I
mean period I mean it is it is so much
fun there are so many different things
you can do
I mean it's every time you open it up
it's it's you're gonna have a new field
gonna have new everything so it's it's a
really a good challenge in between the
difficulty levels and then that game
everything
you will never be like okay I beat it
I'm done I mean it's it's it's it's it's
just really cool I would definitely
recommend absolutely go out and get the
lite version and then if you like lite
version and I'm sure I'm sure you will
because it's it's just a lot of fun go
for it it's it's three dollars right now
it has been five dollars in the past so
I don't know if it's gonna go up or
whatever but yeah I definitely highly
highly recommend gal con be sure to
check out centric comm for the latest
app reviews and iPhone and iPod Touch
