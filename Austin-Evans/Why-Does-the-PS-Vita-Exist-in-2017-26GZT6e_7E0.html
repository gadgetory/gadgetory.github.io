PlayStation Vita and against all odds it
still exists in 2017 but why so let's
take a look to see what you get if you
buy one of these today now this is a
Japanese model Vita however it doesn't
really matter since they're all region
free and plus you know it helps that
Japan gets all the cool colors anyway so
this is the newer 2000 model of the Vita
and because of that it has a few
different tweaks including a giant power
cable it also comes with a micro USB
cable as the original Vida came with
this weird proprietary Sony charger
whereas this guy should work with a to
say anything what I really want to see
though is the Vita itself and that is
orange Wow that's when they say neon
orange they heard not kitty so in United
States they pretty much only sold the
Vita in black I know there were some
white special editions but the orange
actually looks pretty cool I have to
admit for a console that came out in
2012 the Vita actually has some pretty
cool features and one of the biggest
ones was the 5 inch touchscreen which
definitely was a huge upgrade over
something like the 3d X from the time it
also had a revolutionary feature of dual
analog sticks that might not sound
impressive today but compared to its
predecessor the PSP which only had a
single analog stick this brought the
Vita much more in line with what you
would expect out of a portable
playstation flip it over to the back and
you'll find a secondary touchpad so this
is very similar to what you would find
on the PlayStation 4 Dual Shock so some
games would actually allow you to Nelly
touch from the front but also touch from
the back it was actually a really cool
idea back in the day so we are up
running with the Vita and the first
thing that jumps out to me is the
interface it actually is aged pretty
well so it kind of looks like a
smartphone that you can scroll through
different pages so I go over to get your
multitasking I just swipe it away if you
don't want anymore
it's actually a pretty slick way of
doing things you've got basically
everything you would expect to see here
so not only is the web browser and the
PlayStation Store but you can also do
things like activate camera and while
the cameras are maybe not the most
amazing thing in the world they're kind
of usable this might not seem like the
best front-facing camera in the world
but it's useful for more than just a
quick selfie so the PlayStation Vita
supported AR games and it was kind of
ahead of its time in a lot of ways so
sure today things like Pokemon go or
completely standard but back then and
having something like that that could
run on a portable like the PS Vita was
kind of cool inside the Vita actually
had pretty decent specs for today so it
has a quad core arm a 9 processor 512
megabytes of memory
and a 5-inch display with a resolution
of 960 by 540 for the only downside was
that the screen was actually has slight
downgrade from the original vida model
which came with an OLED display compared
to IPS on the newer 2000 models there
are other advantages such as a smaller
comes more colors has that micro USB
port but as far as pure screen quality
goes the original model is actually
better compared to the 3ds though the
Vita had a huge technical advantage not
only was it much much faster but had a
far better screen and even though it was
the better console in a lot of ways it
did not sell anywhere near as well with
the Vita topping out around 15 million
sales whereas the 3ds has sold over 65
million units and Counting though there
were a lot of reasons for this one of
the big ones being of course that the
game library was much stronger on the
3ds we'll talk a lot more about that in
a second but Sony also made some very
questionable decisions with the Vita one
of the biggest problems with the Vita
was the pricing on a memory you are
forced to buy proprietary PS Vita memory
cards which were really expensive we're
talking well over $100 for a 64 gigabyte
card but the biggest problem with the PS
Vita today is simply the fact that
smartphone success in a world well
basically everyone has one of these in
their pockets having a dedicated game
console to carry around just doesn't
make as much sense as it used to make
sure they're definitely a lot of games
on the Vita that are higher quality than
what you can find on Android or iOS but
the fact remains that there are a lot of
very good very easy play games on a
device that you're already carrying it
really does make something like this a
much harder sell the Vita is in a weird
spot in 2017 so it's technically not
dead you can still buy these brand new
today however Sony support for it has
definitely been dwindling as things like
PlayStation now are currently in the
middle of being phased out however the
important part with any game console are
the e the Vita was by far the biggest
success in Japan but there were a fair
few games were released here in the West
such as tearaway however odds are if
you're playing a Vita in 2017 you're
going to be playing some of these and if
your name is Kimberly doe you're
definitely playing this one if you're
not why pool and though there are other
games such as tearaway I think this is
one of the best examples of a game that
really does a good job of taking
advantage of both the rear touchpad as
well as the touchscreen how's this
really cool so the ability to actually
use that touchpad in a way that's not
just gimmicky right this does a great
job of showing off the potential of the
Vita but unless you are really hard for
about the games that are available for
it it just doesn't make sense
I think the switch has shown that
there's still
plenty of interest in a portable console
then in 2017 the Vita is definitely a
hard sell but what do you guys think let
me know in the comments below and I will
catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
