with an unboxing of the brand new iPhone
7 so this is a 7 in black cover this
year it also does come in jet black
however jet black not easy to find also
wow that was like a satisfying rip okay
well there's not a phone here so we've
got welcome to iPhone this is how to do
things
we got Apple stickers that's of course
the most important thing well I'm really
here for is the actual iPhone 7 itself
this is the same you know I've got to
say the matte black finish actually
looks pretty nice
so unlike the jet black which is super
glossy it looks good in pictures and
when you actually see it in person
however it gets full scratches and gets
dirty really easily whereas this I feel
like it's going to actually last a
little bit longer also I like the
stealthier look of the all-black versus
the space grady last year we have the
standard wall adapter one thing i wish
that they would actually update is this
stupid power brick so pretty much all
phones these days have some kind of
quick charging you can even use an iPad
charger to charge newer iPhones much
quicker than this stupid thing and we
also have an adapter so the reason you
need an adapter is because the iPhone 7
as you may or may not have heard a
hundred million times already does not
have a headphone jack you want us into
traditional headphones you got to use
this adapter and plug it in here because
you know coverage also included in the
box are lightning ear pods they're one
of the few in ear headphones that
actually fit really well in my ears I
don't like some of the ones with the
rubber tips feel like they get
uncomfortable after a little while so
I'm curious to see how these Lightning
gear pods actually sounds last but not
least we have a standard a lightning the
USB cable syncing charging all that kind
of stuff screens already dirty literally
this thing got pulled right out of box
it's already completely coated in
fingerprints as far as the actual
differences between this and the
previous iPhone there's not a lot on the
outside so we do have a bigger camera
hump here the camera has been improved
thankfully I will say the antenna lines
with a lot cleaner than they ever did on
the 6 and 6s but honestly this is this
is pretty similar whoa
that home button feels crazy well I'd
like it feels like I'm pressing the
whole bottom of the phone down so
basically instead of a traditional home
button the 7 and 7 plus now have what's
essentially it's just a flat piece of
glass a little bit of a vibrator
motor behind it it's sort of an
interesting feel and there we go
hi I'm you have new voice amplified so
you actually pulled down you feel like
the phone actually vibrate a little bit
it feels like it actually hits the
bottom of the screen and bounces that's
such a kind of cool hey Austin but the
iPhone 7 I want to know can it make it
Android fanboy turns an Apple fanboy oh
that's a big one
um I mean I literally just got it so
it's hard to say that much right now but
there's really nothing that's
revolutionary here it's an iPhone just a
little bit better a little bit faster
the same thing every year if you're
already hardcore into Android this is
probably I gotta change your mind and
your experience how much of a loss is it
to have no headphone jack I'm not really
sure yet on one hand I do use a lot of
Bluetooth whether I'm in the car or less
new speakers however they're definitely
times where one just to throw some
headphones in my phone and listen to
music the adapter definitely helps and
I'll try to keep it around but I'm not
really sure just yet well the lifespan
of the Lightning port decrease since
it's used both for charging and
listening to music that's not crazy at
all
so a couple months ago the Lightning
port on my iPhone 6s plus started to die
I've to be very careful how I insert
anything otherwise it just won't charge
will connect so yeah that's absolutely
something I'd worry about can I swim
with the iPhone 7 and how waterproof is
it actually that is an excellent
question that I want to find out soon so
in theory there ip67 certified which
means that you can take them in up to a
meter of water for 30 minutes however
can handle swimming probably are they
still using a dual-core processor in the
iPhone 7 no they've actually upgraded to
a quad-core Apple a 10 fusion chip now
I'm curious to see how that performs so
you should definitely stay tuned I'll be
doing speed comparison soon how they
improved the Apple logo stickers we've
got the new Apple retina HD ultra 4k
white stickers now they're the exact
same
so what do you guys think about the
iPhone 7 let me know in the comments
below and devily be sure to subscribe to
the channel there are more videos on
this guy coming soon so the iPhone 7 has
actually dropped a mechanical keyboard
