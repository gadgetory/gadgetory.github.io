the video going over a pair of new game
consoles we're about to see so on one
hand we have a new even slimmer ps3 and
on the other hand we have a new even
bigger 3ds Sony released a slim ps3 a
couple years ago and it looks like
they're now about to release an even
smaller and slimmer version so this
one's late thanks to Brazil who when
they were going through all the
regulatory information somehow I lose
all of these pictures of the new unit it
seems to have lost a slot loading
blu-ray drive instead just like on the
PlayStation 2 slim you want to be able
to insert discs from the top taking a
look around you can see it's a pretty
major overhaul in my opinion it looks a
little bit like a mix between the
original fat ps3 and the newer slim
version if you take a look at the model
numbers that were late it looks like
there will be three new versions of the
ps3 for starters there's going to be a
16 gigabyte model there's also going to
be a 250 gigabyte model and a 500
gigabyte model my best guess would be
that the 16 gigabyte version will be
going up against the 4 gigabyte Xbox and
I'll probably be pretty cheap somewhere
between 150 and 200 dollars and of
course the 250 gig and 500 gig versions
will be powered by hard drives and most
like will be coming in somewhere between
250 and 300 dollars now this hasn't been
officially confirmed by Sony yet however
in my opinion it looks pretty legit so
definitely keep an eye out for an
announcement soon moving on Nintendo was
also announced today and new 3ds XL as
you probably guessed from the name this
is an extra large version of the current
3ds the 3ds XL sports a four point nine
inch top display which is nearly as big
as the Vita screen now on top of that
also has a 4.2 inch lower display all
the features from the 3ds are coming
right along to the 3ds XL so that means
you're going to have three cameras a top
3d display as well as of course
compatibility with all the 3ds and the
DS games probably the biggest downside
is the fact that there's still no second
circle pad now of course you will be
able to pick up a new Circle Pad Pro
accessory so I've already reviewed it
for the original 3ds however there will
be a new version made for the larger 3ds
XL and well that's all fine and great
but it's a larger accessory it takes up
a lot of room and to be honest there's
no reason why a Nintendo could not have
just integrated this onto the 3ds I mean
it's bigger there's more room it's kind
of disappointing beyond that
the 3ds XL looks to be pretty solid
he'll be going on sale in North America
on August 19th for the price of $200 and
for that you'll be able to pick up
either a red or a blue version and it
will come with a four gigabyte SD card
I'm curious to know what do you guys
think are you interested in the new
super slim ps3 or how about the new
super-large 3ds personally I'm going to
be picking up both for review however
I'm a little bit more excited for the
3ds as it looks like with a larger
screen it can actually make the 3d a lot
better on the other hand the ps3 looks
nice as well but overall it looks more
just like a new cheaper version than
anything that's really all that
spectacular but again definitely very
curious to know what you guys think so
definitely let me know in the comments
below anyway guys if you enjoyed this
video definitely be sure to leave it a
thumbs up and if you're interested in
more videos like this including reviews
of both the ps3 and the 3ds XL be sure
