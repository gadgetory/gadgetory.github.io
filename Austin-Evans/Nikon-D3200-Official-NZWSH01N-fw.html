here with a video going over the new
Nikon d3200 now there are a lot of major
improvements in this camera including
eight more megapixels expanded video
performance as well as a much better
screen so let's take a look the heart of
the D 3200 is a 24 megapixel CMOS sensor
this is the same sense of this in some
Sony NEX cameras and should give some
awesome image quality probably even
surpassing with V 50-100 and D 7000 on
top of that just based on megapixel
count alone this is the second highest
camera in the Nikon range only below the
d800 speaking of the higher-end Nikon
DSLRs this sports the same xp3 processor
from the d800 as well as the d4 unless
you give it some really good performance
it also helps the ISO is this camera is
now capable of going up to 6400 ISO with
expandable up to 12,000 800 I've been
using the D 3100 for over a year now and
in fact that's the camera that I'm
filming on right now and probably some
of the most exciting things has to do
with the video mode so now you can
support up to 1080p at 30 frames per
second or as the d 31 handle was capped
at 24 frames at 720p it's also capable
of going all the way up to 60 frames per
second another improvement is that the D
3200 can go up to 20 minutes of
recording at a time as opposed to 10 now
this one of my pet peeves about the D
3100 is that every 10 minutes I've got
to stop the camera start it again it's
just kind of a bit of a pain however
with the D 3200 it can go up to 20
minutes which isn't half bad on top of
that pulling one of my favorite bits is
it now has a microphone input you can go
ahead and hook up any kind of stereo mic
to the D 3200 and it will work no
problem we've also tweaked the body a
little bit so the grip is slightly
redesigned also I don't think it's going
to be that big of a difference but it's
a little bit different they've also
changed the live view so instead of
having a little toggle instead you have
a live view button on the back of the
camera and the record button for video
is up top personally I really like the
way the D 3100 the D 5100 have done it
so I'm not entirely sure if I'm going to
like this change but hey it's worth a
shot
another major improvement is the screen
so the D 3100 definitely does not have
the best screen in the world it's very
low resolution and not that easy to read
outdoors
however the D 3200 now has a new 921,000
dot LCD which is about four times the
pixel density of the D 3100
unfortunately it doesn't tilt or swivel
or anything like that however it still
is a nice upgrade a new optional feature
is a Wi-Fi dongle seeing connect this to
your D 3200 it will allow you to pair it
with an Android phone at launch or an
iOS device when the autumn wants the app
launches and what this will allow you to
do is control
camera from your device so for example
you have your Android phone you could
focus you could take a look at the live
view you can take pictures video all
that kind of stuff straight from your
device on top of that you can also take
a picture on your nikon send it over to
your Android or iOS smartphone then go
put some Instagram filters or something
on it tweet it and do whatever you want
now this is just an accessory so it's
net built into the D 3200 it's gotta run
you about 60 bucks however I definitely
think it's gonna be worth it for me I
just imagine be able to pull my phone
out just the focus make sure the framing
white balance all that kind of stuff is
right straight for my phone to have to
constantly get up check my shot which is
something I do a lot with my D 3100 the
camera will be on sale just a couple of
weeks so sometime in mid May will go on
sale for $600 for body only and $700
with the 1855 kit lens I love my D 3100
but I cannot wait to get my hands on D
3200 most of these just because of the
video mode so having a microphone input
a better screen and of course being able
to get a little bit better 1080p as well
720p video is gonna be awesome for me on
top of that though having 24 megapixels
and a camera that cost around 600 bucks
is nothing to laugh at at all anyway
guys if you enjoyed this video
definitely be sure to leave it a thumbs
up and if you're interested in more
videos on the D 3200 as soon as I get my
hands on it definitely sure to subscribe
