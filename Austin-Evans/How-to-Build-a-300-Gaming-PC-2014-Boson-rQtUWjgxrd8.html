here at the tutorial showing you how to
build my latest gaming PC build the
boson building the boson is a great way
to learn how to get into building pcs as
it doesn't get much easier than this get
a decent sized workspace grab yourself a
Phillips screwdriver and you're ready to
jump right in start by unscrewing the
thumb screws on the back of the case two
on each side pop off the rear side panel
as well as the one up front and you'll
have full access to the case it comes
with a fear a few things already
installed and wired like the band's
front panel connectors as well as the
power supply but we do have to do some
prep work before installing the parts
unwrap the power cable and hardware from
inside the case and inside the bag of
hardware pull out six of these small
brass standoffs these will go in the top
two points on the case and the four
holes directly below just screw them and
finger tight until you've got all six in
this is how we'll install a motherboard
a bit later on before we do though let's
prepare the board it's inside a static
resistant bag so be gentle when we're
moving it try not to touch the actual
circuit board as you can and set it down
on top of the motherboard box while we
work on it it can be a bit intimidating
but there are only a few things you need
to focus on in the center you'll find a
gray processor socket which is where
we'll be installing the APU off to the
side of that are the DEM slots for
installing the ram wedged behind the
DIMM slots is the 20+4 pin connector
which is the main power for the
motherboard from the power supply up in
the corner of the board is the four pin
CPU power connector which is also
connected to the power supply right
below the processor socket are a pair of
SATA ports for connecting hard drives or
SSDs on the bottom right of the board
you'll find a series of small gold pen
these are for wiring up all of the front
panel connectors last but definitely not
least is the PCI Express slot which runs
across the middle of the board
this is where you install the graphics
card now grab your APU in this case the
app 15350 inside you'll find the APU
itself as well as the heatsink with fan
already installed gently take the Athlon
out of its plastic making sure you only
handle it by the edges around back
you'll see lots of little pins these are
fragile and bending one is going to
cause you a
your headache come back over to the
socket on the motherboard and pull back
the retention arm if you look closely
there's a small gold arrow on the edge
of the APU this lines up with a matching
arrow on the socket to show you which
way everything should be aligned simply
drop the Athlon into the socket it
should rest easily in place without
putting any pressure on it there's not
much more to it than that
just push the retention arm back down
until it clicks into place and you got
your a few installed next we've got the
heatsink if you flip it over you'll see
the pre applied thermal paste also
included in the box is the mounting
hardware as for this socket you've got
to use a slightly different install
method than usual slide the pegs through
the two holes on each corner of the
motherboard socket and then firmly place
the heatsink on to the APU using the
pegs as guides this will spread the
thermal paste so wiggling the heatsink
around just a bit isn't a bad idea take
the other half of the mounting hardware
and clip both pieces onto the pegs
making sure the heatsink is properly
aligned now grab the 4 pin connector
from the fan and plug it into the CPU
fan header on the motherboard a notch
will only let you plug it in one way
there you go the APU is ready to go the
next step is installing the RAM which in
this case is I singled them of Crucial
Ballistix poor memory this is simple to
do just look for a notch about
two-thirds of the way along the gold
pins on the bottom this lines up with a
corresponding notch on the motherboard
just slide it into place until both
clips snap and that's it
before installing them by the board
you'll need to pop in the i/o shield
that it comes with make sure you line
this up with the two round ports on top
and pop it into place this could be a
bit of a pain so feel free to use them
force to make sure it snaps in now it's
time to start installing hardware in our
case flip the case on its side and lower
the assembled motherboard onto the
standoffs we installed earlier making
sure that the ports line up with the i/o
shield and that all the standoffs are
visible through the screw holes on the
board at this point go back to the bag
of hardware that came with the case and
pull out six of these larger screws it's
as simple as lightly screwing the board
in one by one starting on one corner and
then going to the opposite corner and
working your way around double-checking
everything is lined up properly along
the way once everything is in and
looking good come back around and
tighten each screw down to make sure the
board is nice and secure next up we've
got to install our hard drive it's
simple enough to do for this build slide
it into one of the free 3.5 inch bays up
front until the screw holes line up with
the mounts in the case using the same
type of screws we use to install the
motherboard screw the hard drive in with
two screws on each side make sure these
are fairly tight to keep any vibrations
to a minimum we also need to install our
graphics card this is a low profile
single slot card which is super easy to
get up and running come around in the
back of the case and you'll need to pull
out the top PCI cover you'll have to
bend it backward to pop it out so be
careful then just line up the graphics
card with the open PCI cover and
corresponding slot on the motherboard
giving it just enough pressure to clip
into place using yet another screw like
for the hard drive and motherboard
attach the metal graphics card bracket
and you've got everything in the case
now comes the fun part
wiring first up grab the large 20+4 pin
lead from the power supply this goes
into the connector on the motherboard
behind the memory and can be a bit stiff
don't be afraid to give it a little
force to click it into place you should
also see a four plus four pen cable just
pop these apart as we only need a single
four pin for the build this goes in on
the top left of the motherboard again
just push it in until it clicks into
place next you should find these long
thin cables which are for powering SATA
devices they're not on one end so they
only go in one way but one of these is
the left connector on your hard drive
unlike most cables it won't click into
place so just make sure it's fully
seated finally you'll see a couple of
these larger molas cables from the power
supply the front 120mm your fan has a
normal three pin cable however the
motherboard only has two fan headers so
instead connect it using the molex lead
while we're at it we can connect the
rear fan which attaches directly to the
four pin connector on the motherboard
next up we have the bundle of cables
from the front panel these aren't
difficult but they can be a bit annoying
to deal with start with the USB cable
which has a single pin knocked out to
make sure you can't put it in backwards
plug it into the you
the blind connector on the bottom of the
motherboard next grab the cable with the
AC 97 and HD audio labels these are for
your audio jacks so ignore the AC 97
lead and plug the HD audio in on the
bottom left corner of the board again
there's a missing pin on the connector
so it only goes in one way
you'll also see a few smaller cables
these are for things like the power
button and front LEDs and go into the
white connectors on the bottom right of
the motherboard which marks what goes
where it's best to work from the bottom
up keeping in mind that the colored
wires are positive and the white wires
are negative don't worry too much about
getting something wrong here worst case
we have to double check the connections
come back to the bag of hardware you got
with the case and grab your case speaker
this is optional but by plugging it in
besides your front panel connectors
you'll be able to hear a warning tone if
something goes wrong which can be
helpful for troubleshooting problems
later on the last thing we got to wire
up is the hard drive using a SATA data
cable that comes with the motherboard
plug one end into the SATA port on the
board they only go in one way and will
click into place then run the other end
to the hard drive and snap it in it's as
easy as that
now it's time to fire the boson up and
make sure everything works plug the
power cable into the back of the supply
and hit the power button it should come
right to life if not double check that
the power supply is on and that all of
your wiring is correct you should see
all the fans in the system spinning and
video on your monitor it will likely ask
you to insert boot media just restart
the PC and hit the Delete key to enter
the BIOS here you should see some info
on the APU memory and clock speeds if
everything looks good here we're almost
done
turn the boson back off unplug it and
now it's time to do a little cable
management grab some cable ties and tidy
up as much of the wiring as you can all
that's left now is to install Windows
it's straightforward if you need a
tutorial you can check out my 2014 build
guide where I go over it all the things
like drivers congratulations you've
built yourself a gaming computer if you
