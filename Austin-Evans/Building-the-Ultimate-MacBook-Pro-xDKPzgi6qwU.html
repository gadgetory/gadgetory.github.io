building the ultimate 13-inch MacBook
Pro and huge shout out to LastPass for
sponsoring this video so you might be
wondering why we're using the 30 inch
macbook as opposed to a 15 inch and
we're trying to build the ultimate
laptop but a lot of it actually comes
down to this so this is a line dock and
inside what we're finding here is not
only an additional battery but
additional storage additional ports
that's all meant for the 13-inch so this
guy started out as an IndieGoGo and it's
just starting to ship but inside what
we're going to find is something that
actually looks a lot like a MacBook so
the idea here is to give you a bunch of
the functionality that you would
normally expect on for example older Mac
books with you know more than 4 ports so
there's going to be a ton of ports that
are going to be added including USB see
we've got 2 SP 3.0 on this side SD card
reader as well as on the other side
we've got HDMI mini DisplayPort 1/3 USB
3 as well as one more USB type-c so it's
basically the same size the MacBook so
if I sort of stack it on top
I've got here's a little bit of a
sandwich actually how does this connect
oh wait Oh first thing I thought they
forgot to put anything else in the box I
think they're taking a subtle hint at
the lack of dongles needed with this
particular product there's also an
available USB see magnetic module so if
we open this guy up we're going to find
is well what looks like a little USB
adapter but the whole thing is going to
be magnetic now supposedly this is going
to support full USB see capability so
stuff like data transfer video and
everything like that but I've had some
questionable luck with these in the past
so maybe I'll try one of the ports on
the side oh ok maybe the back port just
doesn't work so immediately get charging
and we also have a 256 gig SSD ok so
there are different versions of the line
dock available say for example if you
don't want so much storage but the idea
here is that if you've got this sort of
giant jock thing that goes with the
MacBook you're going to be getting
battery extra ports SSD the whole sort
of package well this looks a little bit
goofy right now inside what we're
getting is not only that SSD which is
optional you can go all the way up to a
one terabyte SSD or not even opt for one
in the first place but on top of that
all of these line docks have 25,000
milliamp hour batteries inside so it's
going to be able to charge at a full 100
Watts more than
for any MacBook and in theory could
given you basically double the battery
life now the line doc is going to
essentially double the thickness of our
MacBook and as we all know thicker is
better when it comes to building the
ultimate stupid I mean ultimate MacBook
not stupid
I meant ultimate so that's where some
protection for a MacBook comes in one of
the only real issues I've noticed with
the line dog is that since it's not
actually connected to the MacBook
besides with a cable it actually doesn't
really matter what you actually do to it
just as long as you have it connected
via USB C so that's where this comes in
a very important keyboard protector that
also very helpfully reminds you of all
the wonderful keyboard shortcuts that I
totally don't know at all but of course
protection is incredibly important you
never know when a sudden gust of wind
could blow your mac book out of window
and you need to make sure it survives
well that's where this comes in this
giant case that supposedly helps so
really how it's supposed to go on it
just looks so weird oh I need to click
it until it did that noise now it looks
much better okay that looks a little
more like it if I pull it up hey there
we go we've got some real protection for
our ultimate macbook excellence now all
you need is some protection for your
digital life thanks to the LastPass no I
didn't just include a case so I could
get a great segue over its to protecting
your digital life with LastPass what I
love about LastPass is that it's
something I've been paying for myself
way before they ever decide to sponsor
the channel and that's for good reason
it is absolutely the best way I've ever
found to keep your passwords safe now as
we all know or at least as we all should
know is a terrible idea to use the same
password across several sites if any of
them get hacked or compromised you're
going to deal with the very real
potential of someone being able to hack
into other sites based on just using the
same password that you used over and
over and over again
LastPass take security seriously not
only do they do all the encryption of
your passwords on your device so you
don't have to worry about things being
unprotected sitting on their server
somewhere but on top of that if you lose
your password that's it
LastPass has no ability to be able to
unlock your vault or to do anything to
sort of open up your passwords and that
might sound like a bad thing but in
reality that means that not even
LastPass can get access to your data and
I think
that is a very very good thing if you're
not using a password manager to not only
generate unique passwords for every
single site you visit but also to keep
them all safe and secure behind a solid
vault then the LastPass is absolutely
what you need and of course if you guys
want to check it out and help support
the channel the link will be in the
description there's free and paid
versions but regardless protect yourself
online and download LastPass now of
course when it comes to building the
ultimate MacBook a single display is not
going to be enough so that's where the
LG 5k ultra-fine comes in
so they single Thunderbolt 3 cable we're
going to be able to not only get that
full 5k video signal but we're also
going to be getting three USB C ports on
the monitor and we're going to be
getting an 87 watt charge from the
monitor into the macbook which is
helpful especially when we have the
light dock which you can also charge the
macbook so we should be good on power
now this is starting to look a little
bit ridiculous however is by no means
ultimate just yet which is where this
comes in a laptop vertical dock for two
laptops so with this we can drop the
macbook in as well as the line dock at
the same time the next step we have a
keyboard so this is going to be the Das
Keyboard ultimate which not only is
going to be able to take advantage of
some of the USB ports on the line dock
but it's also going to give us a fully
mechanical keyboard that is meant to be
used on Mac we also have the Logitech MX
master 2's so this guy's going to be
using bluetooth and now we're getting a
little bit closer however even this is
still not going to be anywhere near
enough ports for the ultimate MacBook
which is where the Cal digit ts3 plus
comes in this is going to be a fundable
3 dock which is going to be giving us
extra functionality and well to be
totally honest even more ports that
we're probably not going to actually use
all right that's actually not going to
be too crazy so what we're getting with
this is none like a bunch more USB ports
we're also going to be getting a second
Thunderbolt 3 port so we can daisy chain
with the monitor but we're also going to
be getting some other stuff that even
the line dock doesn't include such as
Ethernet another SD card reader if we
want to do two at the same look I just
wanted to stock my figure to be cool
don't judge me I just thought it'd be
really ridiculous so we need to plug in
the Thunderbolt 3 cable from the
computer it's going to go into the dock
and then we're going to plug the
Thunderbolt 3 cable from the monitor
also into the dock and then actually we
can do is we can plug the line dock
into the USB type-c cable on the dock oh
hey wait okay hang on okay that looks
good so if I close the MacBook up we
should have everything on one display
there we go and then and set it right
here I have my mouse of my keyboard so
you guys might have caught a little
video I did recently trying to game on a
Mac and in doing so I bought this
external GPU from gigabyte which is
actually going to be really tiny and yet
does connect over Thunderbolt 3 so I get
a couple more cables going here so with
our final Thunderbolt 3 cable which will
be plugged directly into the MacBook
we're going to have a full Radeon rx 580
now when you've clicked on this video I
promised you the altar MacBook what I've
actually delivered is a really really
bad idea
and so it is time to fully test the
ultimate 13-inch MacBook Pro now they
get the ultimate performance because of
course this is the ultimate setup we
also have a secondary display this time
eight 1080p 144 Hertz panel which is
going to be plugged directly into the
GPU because you know of course the last
thing we want is some kind of
performance bottleneck and it all
technically works
nothing is crashed nothing has stopped
working yet so for tonight decided not
to work on us and instead of
reinstalling the entire game trying
again
next we have rocket League which I will
have you know it works completely
perfectly on the ultimate MacBook with
no issues at all basically I know we're
playing 1080p high and which shouldn't
be a really big surprise with that Rx
580 we have plenty of horsepower even
considering that we are running a
dual-core CPU and at the same time even
though it doesn't really matter we also
have a 5k monitor and like actually how
many ports do we have nine ten eleven
twelve USB ports three four five six
seven USB C ports one additional
Thunderbolt port plus two more that are
free on the MacBook to HDMI ports we
have a display port we have a mini
display port and then we also have three
more display ports on our GPU ethernet
optical audio headphone jack and we have
a twenty five thousand milliamp hour
battery and a 2 or 56 gig SSD and a full
rx 580 external GPU oh and I forgot to
mention there are also three extra USB C
ports on the back of the Thunderbolt
displaying for a great total of 10 so
hopefully you guys found build in the
Olson MacBook Pro to be very informative
very useful when you're with your own
macbook building projects what is it
just me who does this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
