tour now this has been a pretty
requested video and I thought about just
doing a normal video and you know doing
it all editing and all that kind of
stuff and like you know what let's just
go ahead pull the camcorder out and just
walk you guys around so well hey give
you guys a quick tour of my office setup
now the first and most important part of
my office is this dog now he is
basically a piece of furniture mr. dog
do you have anything to say for yourself
he's always gonna be here yes
alright anyway so yes there's a dog in
here alright so I'm gonna go ahead walk
over since my desk is kind of a cooler
thing and yes I've got an awful chair
and I've got pretty crappy furniture so
yeah just yeah alright so here is my
computer I have several videos not
previously it is a custom-built computer
I built a few months ago for i7 2670 50
we've got like 4 terabytes actually I
just posted a video today of installing
the second hard drive in there but I
yeah great computer I love it and yeah
over here we do have myiasis 23 inch
monitor I like this quite a bit it
actually is really nice it's got IPS
technology so like I can all fit was on
I'd show you guys it's got great viewing
angles all that kind of stuff up here
you guys will find the webcam I use for
d3 live this is a logitech c310 some
reason the camera doesn't want focus but
that's cool obeah is the logitech c310
it's pretty good webcam and of course
i've reviewed that um I basically
reviewed everything I own so we'll
reviewed for food alright so got my
Logitech mouse and keyboard these are
very very cheap I think it got both of
them for $20 I've been shot I plan on
getting nicer stuff but to be honest
like 20 bucks I mean the keyboard is
fine and mouse is fine and I've really
got no problems over here we do have my
blue Yeti microphone what can I say it's
a great microphone I use it sometimes
for videos most of the time I use it
when I'm actually like filming a video
in front of my computer obviously
atwater so pretty well they're over here
I've got my headphones now I've got a
kind of funny story I won't tell the
whole thing but yeah these are some
basically really cheap headphones I
think
he's up like 20 bucks like two or three
years ago and I bought these I liked
them then I upgraded to some nice
headphones and the past couple years I
have upgraded several times to very nice
headphones but without fail they break
or they they start sounding bad or
something goes wrong with them and I
always come back to these Sony's so for
20 bucks see whether these are the envy
RV 150 I gotta say these are probably I
produce these headphones more than
anything else I know they don't sound
amazing but for 20 bucks they're great
and yeah when newer and better stuff
breaks I go back to these over here I'll
pull this a little closer to you guys
here this is my camera it's in full
attack mode here we do have this is a
Nikon d3100 yeah I've done videos like
is it I've done pretty much videos on
all of this individual stuff so you guys
can feel free to check my channel later
but yeah D 3100 I do have a can icon 50
millimeter 1.8 G lens I do have the lens
hood right here and up top for my audio
if I spin around here you guys will find
a zoom h1 this is what I've been using
I've only got this recently I haven't
really been using it lot but the past
couple videos I have used the zoom h1
and I'm pretty impressed now I've got
this is basically my full set up here so
it's much more mobile before I was
trying to use the Nikon with the blue
Yeti and you know just kind of think the
audio and post and you know that works
okay but when I actually need to not
record right here on the desk the zoom
h1 is fantastic um that's gonna be about
it I've got a surge protector and lots
of messy cabling and all that kind of
good stuff and I got my drawer which I
have all kinds of junk in so I think you
guys care about that over here we have
the banhammer cube this is what I stood
on during the three live and when I
banned someone from the chat I make a
lot of fun and just say bands so that's
that's awesome
coming around to the back side here we
have it's just I'm sure you guys all
have one of these just a bunch of random
cables and stuff I have my hello you
guys can see my GG mouth and etched it
in there I played a lot of Starcraft in
one day I was like you know we need a GG
and there was just like
some cables micro SD adapter here's a
cool thing I got at CES last year it's a
what trust show you guys here is a looks
like a poker chip but it's actually a
USB Drive so forget that from Verizon
pretty cool little bit of swag but yeah
ah down here I do have the entire box
set of 90 of books I actually just got
this pretty recently nothing too
spectacular but that is kind of cool and
guys like a dollar - here is my camera
bag I'll try to be brief we're not gem
Thank You brief I don't care all right
so let's see yeah I can do this so this
is just my camera bags where I keep all
my stuff for my camera obviously I
usually actually I keep the camera out
most of the time because I'm always
filming but yeah so there's not a whole
lot in here except some orange I've got
a lens some chargers batteries all that
kind of boring stuff that you guys
probably don't care about at all so said
in here without dropping it and breaking
everything um over here I've got a can
of compressed air which I was using to
clean my computer here's an Xbox 360
that's like a Mad Catz I actually I used
to have an Xbox and it broke but I used
this actually a lot for when I want to
play a game on my computer this will
plug in via USB and for example test
drive unlimited - I've been playing that
lately she's with that here is my
ancient Sony alarm clock which I think
this thing's about as old as I am yet
it's been on five like forever and yeah
I use it and it's awesome
alright here is the closet from the
office I wouldn't open that out because
I just got boxes and junk in there again
there's another dog how does maybe it's
the same one oh no Sam are you the same
dogs before all right then oh now you're
gonna look up over here I do have my
Epson Alice believe this is a workforce
635 this printer fax copy scan does all
that kind of stuff now let's say it's
just uh a printer down here is the fun
stuff so this is where all of my videos
and whatnot that's where I keep them so
I'm not gonna take every single thing
out one by one but I give you guys a
brief overview as envelope has like some
CPUs and
hard drive a couple of things I just
don't want laying around oh here's
something cool here is my very first
digital camera oh yeah look at that
three point one megapixel five times
digital zoom yeah oh yeah of course I
remember how to open this up we'd have a
whopping double-a batteries whoo I had
like 128 megabytes pick this up here had
like 128 megabytes SD card in there
so yeah cameras in like 2003 or 2004 put
that back in there you guys to see some
actually listen with my sunlight there's
a lot of stuff in here is my D s lots of
game boys I love game boys palm pixi all
that kind of good stuff moving down a
little bit here we have a PlayStation 2
a Gamecube there's a Super Nintendo in
the back there's also a Nintendo 64 back
behind the Playstations
had two Playstations cuz I got one for
free and hey I like free PlayStation
Sega Genesis iPod Touch 2nd generation
which is like awesome and I have a
seriously product the coolest one you
guys have ever seen a Motorola cute it's
green and doesn't work it's awesome
isn't it in batteries because everyone
needs batteries down here I've got a
Ataris clone system I can pull this out
this is my cr-48 which unfortunately the
hinge is like starting to break so I put
it out because I like when I have
something nice I don't want it to break
so soon so the hinge start getting a
little loose I'm like put that up right
now before it breaks totally so I've got
that here's my xbox 360 I told this for
many times but it broke and I paid a lot
of money for it and trade stuff in and
that was a nightmare but yeah broken
PlayStation I mean Xbox to keep around
one of these days I probably like a
demolition do or something but whatever
I've got a couple spindles of CDs what
we have here Ubuntu and yeah it's just
us I keep like all like my DVDs and CDs
for I go sawing os's
here's my Audio Technica which I'm not
currently using but uh there's the
things there's the bass thing to the Wii
there's a Sega Dreamcast and then here
is of course
everyd chasm of this gigantic pile of
cables
so yeah that's gonna be about it they're
moving along we do have my video set up
so this is my tripod and then here my
lighting or here is my lighting I use
proper grammar here I actually I usually
keep this stuff done but I had just
gotten everything cleaned up a little
bit so I figured I'd put it up but yeah
I've got my umbrella lights had two
large lights and I usually set them
except one like here one there and I
recorded my videos well I thought that
cheer up that's ugly I use that so yes
actually you guys probably find this
angle pretty pretty common once a little
bit more something like this but yeah
that's usually the way I film the videos
and coming over here to the almost last
thing you will see an ancient TV with a
hmm VHS oh yeah now before you guys
laugh at me and say that I'm a noob I
actually use this because I'm usually
playing one of these older consoles and
you really don't I mean they work okay
on HD TVs but to be honest I really
prefer to use an old TV and again this
one's pretty ancient but it works just
fine for playing your PlayStation and
Sega Genesis and all that kind of good
stuff down here is kind of junk there's
a bunch of old cell phones you know like
there's an old Nokia some controllers
there's a broken laptop which is awesome
just probably book and some other things
down there so yeah guys I think that's
gonna be about it I don't think I missed
anything so yeah this has been an office
tour of course as any geek will tell you
it's a work in progress I need to get
some nicer furniture and more stuff and
all that kind of good stuff but to be
honest I'm pretty proud of what I have I
taken me years and years to get it all
set up
but I'm pretty happy with it anyway guys
that's gonna be about it you guys have
any questions or come on know like if I
didn't go into detail been anything feel
free to leave it in the comments and
yeah I'll do my best answer so anyway
guys thanks for watching haven't did
that one in a while</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
