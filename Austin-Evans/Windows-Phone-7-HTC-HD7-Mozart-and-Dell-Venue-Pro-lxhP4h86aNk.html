first look at several new windows phone
7 devices so of course Microsoft this
morning has announced a ton of new
devices so i'll go ahead and cover three
of them here for you today so the first
one is going to be the HTC hd7 which is
very similar to the previous hd2 only
the fact that it has a few key upgrades
namely windows phone seven so if you
didn't know the hd2 was a very very
solid piece of hardware you know the
main problem was they did run the
previous version of Microsoft's
operating system however now that's been
update to Windows Phone 7 as well as it
has a few minor tweaks such as a little
bit different button placement a few
minor tweaks around the phone as well as
a bump to 720p video recording it
definitely looks like a very very solid
upgrade now you just go ahead and run
over the specs really quickly here it
does have a 4.3 inch display with a
resolution of 800 x 480 a 1 gigahertz
Qualcomm Snapdragon processor 576
megabytes of RAM a 5 megapixel camera
with dual-led flash and of course
windows phone 7 so this one looks really
solid I was always a big fan of the hd2
but now that it has windows phone 7 as
well as a few minor upgrades it
definitely does look very impressive now
let's go ahead and take a look at the
HTC 7 mozart so this is one of the more
higher end phones and you can definitely
tell why when you take a look at it so
to start off with it does have a 3.7
inch display as well as a 1 gigahertz
Snapdragon processor 576 megabytes of
RAM as well as 8 gigabytes it in
on-board storage and a 720p camera
however it definitely does look a little
bit better than the other one especially
considering that it does have an
aluminum unibody design now personally I
really like the look of it it looks very
very modern definitely what you would
expect to see in a windows phone 7
device in addition it also does have a
3.7 inch display which while a bit
smaller than a lot of the other windows
phone 7 devices I definitely do think
that's a nice sweet spot that's
definitely a good place for a screen to
be one of the more impor
and things about the Mozart is that it
does have an 8 megapixel camera with a
xenon flash which is definitely
something you're not going to be able to
see in many other cell phones now let's
take a look at what my personal favorite
device was that was announced today
which is the dell venue pro now this one
was previously known as the dell
lightning i'm not really true fond of
venue pro name however there's no doubt
that the phone itself is very very solid
looking so it does have a four point one
inch AMOLED display however the really
interesting thing is the form factor it
is a portrait porting slider all right
now this is not something you really
ever see with the phone with that big of
a screen and I'm really interested to
see how it does work out in the real
world now it will be of course exclusive
to tmobile at the beginning however
doesn't you know that doesn't say
anything about it may be coming to AT&amp;amp;T
or some other carrier later on as far as
aspects go it does have a 1 gigahertz
Snapdragon processor as well as a 5
megapixel camera now this is pretty much
all of the phones really that have been
announced today have been bad very
similar specs so the major
differentiating factor definitely is
going to be the design as well as the
form factor and I think the venue pro
definitely has something going for it
now ok guys so that's it for my first
look at all the new windows phone 7
devices for tmobile so HTC hd7 but that
looks pretty good in my opinion I'm glad
they finally did update the hd2 although
I don't think it's going to be you know
the best about Windows Phone 7 device
definitely not a bad one at all the HTC
7 mozart however definitely does look
very cool i'm really liking the design
of it it looks very solid and of course
with that 3.7 inch display it's going to
be a little bit smaller but it should be
felt sort of a premium niche for the HTC
phones however my pic absolutely is
going to be the dell venue pro i think
that it's going to be hard to be as far
as just the the mix of the 4.1 inch
AMOLED display as well as the very very
unique form factor considering that all
these homes have very similar specs of
course it really is going to come down
to what kind of design what kind of form
factor you like in
case I definitely think that in my
opinion the knot has to go to the venue
pro anyway guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
