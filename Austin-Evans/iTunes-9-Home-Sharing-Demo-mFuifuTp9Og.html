today I'm going to be giving you guys a
little demonstration of how home sharing
works in itunes nine so you can see your
I'm on my Windows PC running Windows 7
and over on over just a little ways away
from me i have my ibook which obviously
is running mac so what I'm going to show
you guys how home sharing works some of
the problems you might have but also
what I think my what I think and all
kind of stuff anyway let's get this
started
so obviously the first thing you need to
do is have two computers or at least two
computers running itunes nine now the
next thing is you they all need to be
connected to the same network whether
it's Wi-Fi or they're all plugged in or
whatever they all need to be connected
to the same you can't have you know
reconnect somebody has to be the same
network okay and once you have everybody
running itunes nine that then you need
to have the computers also sign in to
the same account itunes account so
basically you know you just have to do
all that now normally you should be
ready to go right now but I had a little
bit problem I'm probably you guys might
or might not but go ahead and let you
guys know what I had was a wanted me to
authorize computers to play music and
you know that kind of and it wouldn't
let me do anything so what I ended up
having to do it was basically grabbed a
flash drive copied over a original eyes
tune song you know that has
copy-protection had to cop put it on a
flash drive go to my Mac plug it in try
to open it and then it prompts you for
your password and sign in and authorize
the computer after I did that is no
problem but just want you know give you
guys a heads up at my hatch end of doing
that anyway so once you do that and
everything if you see here on the Left
says users music which is the just the
generic password I mean the password the
name of my mac so basically this would
be home sharing but once you have a
hooked up when both computers are on I
have to do is click it give it just a
second to load and it's like really
quite nice you'll basically be able to
not only copy music from one to the
other you can also listen to it which
it's pretty cool now I'm gonna do in
this reverse I don't have much music on
that I have a lot of my music on here
but it's still not bad you can see here
that I can listen to any of these songs
like I said only have like what 50 songs
on here or whatever but got my songs in
here now if i want to bring one over and
obviously this works either way so I'm
just can grab this song i just
downloaded and i'll have to is hit
import and it's actually surprisingly
fast
maybe takes 10 seconds it's it's pretty
fast it's a lot easier than having to
mess with the you know flash drives or
CES or DVDs or whatever just as long as
I hope the same network obviously
depending on what network you have to
change but in general pretty fast and
pretty handy hey guys that was that's it
that was just a quick demonstration of
home sharing in itunes nine i like it
i'm glad they finally did it and yeah
and obviously it works between a pc in a
mac or a mac in the mac or whatever kind
of combination you've got but yeah let's
just bet it guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
