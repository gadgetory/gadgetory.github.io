look at the new Android 2.3 update also
known as Gingerbread so Gingerbread
brings a lot of new things to Android
does the OS in general and let me go
ahead and go over a few of my favorites
so the first thing is that the UI has
been overhauled now this is not the
entire it's not been you know totally
overhauled and totally changed that's
coming later however it is been tweaked
quite a bit and in my eye it looked
quite a bit better you know the colors
are more consistent and generally just
looks like a nice or more pleasant
operating system to use another big
thing is that they've actually went
ahead and made it a lot more friendly to
games so if you're you know wanting to
play a game especially for your
developer basically the operating system
allows you to make much much better
games it's a lot more optimized for you
know whatever game that you would like
to do which is definitely gonna be great
they've also improved the keyboard and
the copy and paste so of course you know
as always the Android keyboard has been
ok not amazing but not awful well they
had definitely improved it they've added
you know more spacing they they've got
the layout just a little bit better and
in addition they've also went ahead and
added copy and paste in War One Touch
Ward selection again this doesn't look
quite as good as what you might find on
the iPhone of the iPod Touch however
it's not the biggest deal in the world
and it's absolutely great that they are
improving it now continuing on they've
also went ahead and increase the power
management so of course most people who
you know you if you have an Android
phone you definitely want to go ahead
and have some kind of task manager well
now there's something kind of similar
built and we're actually will show you
what is taking up the most battery so
perhaps it's the display perhaps it's
you know one of your ass whatever it is
it will go ahead and actually break it
down for you and show you what is taking
up the most battery and what isn't so it
definitely should help you kind of
understand you know why your batteries
not lasting as long as you like so it
doesn't like a very very useful thing
now one thing that I think is going to
be really really good in this new
Android 2.3 update is NFC also known as
near-field communication
basically this will allow your Android
phone to serve is almost like dual just
all kinds of
for example you go ahead and use it as a
credit card once you know people start
rolling that out so you should set your
phone near a little scanner and you can
go ahead and pay for things but in
addition to that you can also go ahead
and transfer data you can do all kinds
of things and this is already built into
Android 2.3 so that's about it there are
several other improvements and
everything I'm not gonna go ahead get
into everything but overall I am very
very impressed with Android 2.3 and now
of course this is gonna be slowly start
rolling out to a lot of phones and of
course the Google Nexus S will be the
first phone to release with this so
definitely looking forward to getting my
hands on Android 2.3 and give you guys a
more thorough review anyway guys thanks
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
