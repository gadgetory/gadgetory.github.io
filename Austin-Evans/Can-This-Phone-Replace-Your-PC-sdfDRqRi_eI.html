further on hey guys Austin and this is a
phone or is it a computer or I see both
so this is the HP Elite x3 if you guys
saw my cool phones of 2016 video I did
this is one of the phones I was really
excited to check out however it is
taking a long time to actually go on
sale maybe the biggest phone box of all
time actually why is this so big so this
is a Windows 10 phone however instead of
just being an ordinary Windows Phone so
first of all we have the actual HP elite
extra itself and as you can see this is
a very big phone they also have the dock
which is really heavy what's so this is
a USBC dock so what you do is you drop
your phone on this guy so round back we
have USB type-c
a couple of USB 3 ports a full-size
DisplayPort and Ethernet the idea is is
that this is a phone that you take
around all day of course it does all the
normal phone things when you get home
you drop it on the dock and it
essentially replaces your computer so
something interesting is in addition to
this dock there's also an option that is
essentially turns this phone into a
laptop they're actually doing some
really cool stuff here which is
interesting given that Windows Phone is
maybe not the most popular that's ever
been so fair warning on this guy it does
not come cheap although it does come
with some very stylish earbuds now
continuing on because I've got imagine
to sit yeah as a couple things left a
pile of paperwork on the dock which
apparently they gave me two of
everything in case I was unsure of how
to use a dock what else is in here so we
have a dock for the dock oh why there's
these are the exact same except one has
a larger cut out how dare you um there's
another one wait but this was the same
oh wait wait says on the inside it isn't
inside so this is for the phone this is
for the phone with a case and this is
for the phone with a flip cover case I
totally didn't need to read the
instructions to find that out and we
also have a mysterious black box here I
swear if this is going to be another
adapter for the stupid dog
it's another doctor now it's time for
the real test does this crazy doc
actually work so right now I have a
plugged in so it's powering the phone
however I want to actually see what we
can do here so first of all we have a
keyboard now plug this right into the
back of it I also have a mouse
actually I'm curious can I use keyboard
and mouse without anything else oh I
have a cursor all right guy that's kind
of cool the scroll wheel works
edge this is the world's weirdest
desktop ever so everything's plugged
into the dock now if I drop the phone on
they see a welcome screen I don't know
do I hello all right so now that I'm
Alyce is on the display okay so now if I
want the phone is a touch pad so even
though this is a Windows 10 device it
does not actually run full Windows 10
it's still running the phone Edition so
not all apps are going to work so we've
got the full desktop version of YouTube
can you actually watch a video like this
yeah there we go
you almost feels like I'm using like a
Chromebook or something it's a little
bit slower than like a proper computer
but it works I mean scrolling is fairly
smooth there's maybe a touch of latency
but really I mean for normal sort of
like web browsing it seems to be fine
so much we can do here so even though
this is not a full Windows 10 device you
can still do some cool stuff hey guys
this is Austin that totally works I can
actually see something like word being a
really solid use of this right so if you
don't want to travel with a lot of extra
gear and while the apps are not quite as
well full-featured as I would like movie
star basic stuff like web browsing and
we can go through and alt tab and the
idea of using one device to do
everything in your life is really cool I
see a lot of potential in something like
this in a few years as things get more
polished but for today it's not quite
there don't judge me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
