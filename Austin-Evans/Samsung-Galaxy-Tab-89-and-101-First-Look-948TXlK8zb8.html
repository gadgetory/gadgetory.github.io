latest tablets the Samsung Galaxy Tab
8.9 and 10.1 to start with let's take a
look at the Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.9 which
features a one gigahertz dual-core
processor in Android 3.0 honeycomb the
operating system is slightly customized
with Samsung's TouchWiz interface which
changes some of the styling along with
the new mini apps tray in additional
widgets as the name implies it features
an 8.9 inch display with a resolution of
1280 by 800 which is quite impressive
for the size you'll also find a 3
megapixel rear facing camera with
autofocus and flash as well as AI
front-facing 2-megapixel camera the
tablet will ship in 16 and 32 gigabyte
capacities for 469 and 569 dollars
respectively making them very
competitive especially when you consider
that they both have microSD card slots
for expansion next we have the Samsung
Galaxy Tab 10.1 which has been slightly
redesigned from the version announced
last month it features the same
processor from the 8.9 as well as
honeycomb in the same pair of cameras
where it differs is with larger 10.1
inch screen which also has a resolution
of 1280 by 800 you'll pay a slight
premium at 499 and 599 for 16 and 32
gigabyte models however that's still
quite reasonable both tablets are also
eight point six millimeters thin making
the Galaxy Tab line even thinner than
the iPad 2 so that's it personally I'm
very impressed with what Samsung
announced as both models of the Galaxy
Tab are competitively priced and offered
very impressive features and thinness
while pricing for the 3G models wasn't
announced you can expect to see both of
these tablets available this summer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
