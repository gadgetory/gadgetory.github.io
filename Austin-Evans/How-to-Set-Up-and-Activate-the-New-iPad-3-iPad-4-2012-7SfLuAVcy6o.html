Orioles showing you how you can set up
an activate your brand new iPad so this
is the new iPad the third generation the
2012 model whatever you want to call
this the latest model with that Retina
display it's very easy to set up however
you guys need any help I'm right here
let's go ahead and jump right on in so
the first step is once you get it out of
the packaging go ahead and find the
button that is on the top right it's
going just hold it for just one second
or so it should start to boot up alright
so once you're ready to begin go ahead
and slide the set up now you can go
ahead and pick your language so if you
haven't need a different language than
what it's automatically picked you can
go ahead and change to that but my case
go ahead and leave it alone next it says
we'll go ahead and pick our country
again it's already got United States set
for me so go ahead skip that and now the
next thing is location services so
basically if you enable it allows you
the iPad to find your location so some
apps will you know use your location if
you want normally I will go ahead and
recommend enabling it but you know it's
entirely up to you so I'm go ahead and
hit next next thing I do is we're going
to need to connect to our Wi-Fi network
so this is very simple go ahead and
connect to mine real quick here
I do want to mention this we do not have
a Wi-Fi network you can go ahead and
plug your iPad in via USB to iTunes and
allow it to set up that way however if
you have a Wi-Fi network it's much
easier to do it this way so next we'll
go ahead go ahead and allow it to
activate the iPad I'd say that you can
take up to three minutes but obviously
it took about four seconds so you know
of course your time will vary there next
up go ahead and set up your iPad so if
you already have a previous iPad or
indeed any kind of eye device you can go
ahead and allow it to store from either
an iTunes or an iCloud backup however if
you want to start fresh and I generally
I recommend to do that go ahead and just
have setup as new iPad ready and click
Next next we go ahead and sign in with
an Apple ID so again if you've ever used
iTunes an iPhone iPod Touch iMac pretty
much you're going to have an Apple ID so
if you had it
Gwen sign in you can download all your
apps and whatnot but if you this is your
first Apple product you can go ahead and
create it free Apple ID now go ahead and
sign in with mine I'll be right back now
the next step is to set up iCloud now
again this is optional you don't have to
use it however I definitely recommend to
so for example if you have pictures you
can take a picture on your iPhone you
can sync to your iPod your iPad your Mac
or whatever so I definitely recommend
using iCloud although of course it is
optional but might as well use it you
can also change for the backup
settings so if you do use iCloud you can
simply back up your iPad so all your
data can just be backed up every time or
you can go ahead and back it up to your
computer course the choice is yours but
again and go ahead and let iCloud handle
all that now here's a great option
called Find My iPad so let's say you
lose your iPad or stolen or whatever
happens you can go ahead and be able to
ping it on a map especially if it has
GPS you will be able to find it and you
have a much better chance of finding it
or getting it back if it's stolen or
whatever so definitely recommend go
ahead and use it although again all
these are definitely very optional but
it really there's no reason not to use
that next up we have Siri dictation so
what this allows you to do is you go
ahead and tap on the microphone button
on the keyboard you can simply speak and
it will you know type it all out for you
so you know you can use it I definitely
recommend to do that next step is
diagnostic and usage now on the other
hand I definitely don't recommend to do
this this is totally optional basically
if there's any crashes or whatnot on
your iPad it will send the day to Apple
but personally I would rather then not
have that so click Next to here and next
we go ahead and register it with your
Apple ID so we'll go ahead and do that
next all right so we're all done here
we're all set up go ahead and click
start using iPad and we're here so we
can go ahead and start swiping through
our home screens using our apps and all
that kind of great stuff if you're
interested in seeing more videos on the
new iPad be sure to hit this playlist
and of course if you enjoyed this video
definitely be sure to give it a thumbs
