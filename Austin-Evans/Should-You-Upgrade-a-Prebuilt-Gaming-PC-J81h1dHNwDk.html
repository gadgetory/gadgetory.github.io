find out can you buy a cheap computer
and turn into a gaming PC so this is
what we've got this is the dell inspiron
i 3650 obviously none of these
accessories are really meant for gaming
but inside we have the computer itself
now well this is a desktop one of the
things that kind of jumped out to me
about it is actually a really unusual
shape inside this guy is walking an
Intel Core i three 6180 gigabytes of RAM
and a one terabyte hard drive it's
actually really not bad the biggest
thing holding it back from gaming are
the integrated graphics that's where
this comes in this is the new AMD rx 460
what makes the 460 an interesting
upgrade for a system like this is the
low power requirements so because it's
only a 75 watt card that means it's able
to pull all of its power straight from
the PCI slot which with the system like
this with a fairly low end power supply
makes a big difference so open this up
and inside will see this a little bit of
an unusual sort of layout so basically
we have the hard drive in the optical
drive which are mounted vertically in
the case that actually is not a big deal
for us because that still lives room for
a graphics card below ok you know what I
gotta say I had really low expectations
for a pre-built system like this and
strolling the graphics card is really
easy all you do is line up with a slot
make sure that clicks all the way into
place then swing them out the latch to
hold it into place and you're good to go
so now let's find out
did this single upgrade turn our boring
desktop into a gaming PC to start with I
tried a few games using the integrated
graphics in the core i3 it wasn't pretty
GTA 5 just really isn't playable even
when you turn settings down to normal at
720p
we're consistently getting frame rates
that dip well below 20 frames per second
install the RX 460 however and there is
a huge difference we're able to bump the
settings up to 1080p on high and we're
getting around 60 frames per second
moving to dota 2 we're getting a game
that's a lot more friendly to integrated
graphics so the core i3 is able to run
it on the very lowest settings at 720p
however we are getting around 60 FPS
install the graphics card though and
you're going to see a big difference so
at a DP at max settings you're gonna get
around 90 frames per second rocket
League is another game that's fairly
easy to run and we are able to get it
playable on the core i3 now mind you we
do have to turn the settings down to
720p and performance however we are able
to get a fairly stable 30fps
move over to the RX 460 we're getting
much smoother 90 frames per second and
that's what the settings turned up to
high at 1080p shadow of mordor is a fun
game but it's a lot more demanding and
the i3 really struggles here even with
low settings at 720p it frequently dips
to around 15 fps during the action
surprise surprise move up to the RX 460
we're able to bump the settings up to
high at 1080p and we're still getting
around 50 to 60 fps as cool as well this
is it doesn't make a ton of sense to buy
a pre-built system and then upgrade it
to make it a gaming PC if you're willing
to build it yourself you can get a very
similar level of performance for a lot
cheaper however if you already have a
desktop at home that could use an
upgrade or even an older gaming PC that
just needs a little bit more graphics
horsepower for $120 the RX 4 60s I
should really solid card</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
