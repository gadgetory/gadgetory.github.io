I'm here with a pretty cool new
application called existentialism I
really you know this is actually a
pretty unique game um it's very very
simple there's not a whole lot of extras
or anything of that but the base concept
is very cool and to be honest I think
it's quite good so let's just get into
trading this now I definitely recommend
that you take this tutorial first this
is the hole there's not a whole lot of
anything there's no options or anything
it's just tutorial start game and resume
game very very simple I definitely
highly recommend taking the tutorial
first just because it can be quite
complicated but let's just go I'll get
into it that's it new game and let's go
ahead just go ahead and get into easy
and let's just quite and start a new one
okay so as you can see now I'm gonna
probably pretty terrible at trying to
explain this as you can see you have a
bunch of different like you see these
all of the bricks orange now let me
pause do say this is a really nicely
paced like puzzle game somewhat like I
know it's quite unique um uh sometimes I
usually don't like puzzle games like
well high-intensity to go boom ooh this
one's really nice the case there's no
timer there's no anything you could take
an hour for it for each so it's really
quite good um I will say before it began
because I know I like to feel these
things there is a light version of this
in the App Store you guys go ahead
definitely if you think about getting a
definitely to get light version because
that will help you out a lot and
figuring it out but like I said
definitely definitely take the tutorial
anyway okay so as you can see here there
are a bunch of different patterns you
see that there's like black mix I've no
idea
split and you see there's the full white
so basically what your object is is to
just mix just to get all of the
difference so let's just make the
patterns just there's one there's two
and there's
three so let's just go ahead and go one
two three and there we go you see one
appears that always happens to make sure
that you don't have to do it okay so now
let's say here um how old would we give
this one so you go one two three and
then you see this one two three easy
this is really quite simple
let's do one more now you go through
here now now you can see you see this
one I hear that one right there
those are circular so you can't mix
those as normally as you can so now what
you do is you go that's that I'm gonna
fill this one right and then you get the
well I can't okay actually you know I'm
bad at this wow that was fail okay let's
go ahead and a medium one now now you
can see it's quite quite bigger and now
you have all these different colors or
anything so now I'll say you know I'm
sorry I'm just not very good at
explaining I probably best if I just
show you guys so you see I've got a
purple one purple black u-shaped thing a
red black and shaped thing and orange
there we go I've got this one and this
one and I see or do I have a no no okay
so now you can mix and match colors so
let's say okay give me a minute to find
one here um okay so if there's a black
square one there's a black and white no
as if I can find a red a red white one
but of course I don't say mine and but
the really cool thing is about this game
is it's a lot of fun you can play at
your own pace it's not if you do the
okay time or everything you can take
this out play as much as you want and
you can go ahead and share it off and
you can come right back to where you
were but the resume game so I let me at
least find a couple more before I before
I go so you know so we got I'm probably
that president a million I'm not here
and it's gotta be fall come on is
everyone um I'm kind of slow with this
game so okay here we go that now let me
show you and then sometimes you will get
stuck that's where you hit this you can
add piece because definitely I've I
spent like a long time stirring like
there's no way out you just have to hit
that anyway I don't want to drag this
out too long it's just a very very cool
game
it is currently $0.99 next door and it
is on sale there is a new Odette Camille
this is a new day comes out the price is
going to be up so guys I definitely
recommend check out if you like these
kind of puzzle games check out the lite
version
um this is 99 cents you do get quite a
bit more the buzz game the game the
light version is mostly just limited to
light version there's not a whole lot
else you can play through a couple of
the easy and you can play through a
little bit of the missions on missions
but the full games but I don't know I
really like the game it's a little it's
not fully polished I don't know it's a
there I found a couple spelling errors
you can see this background here is
kinda just a generic Photoshop
background but and there's just not a
whole lot options or anything like that
which I mean does it doesn't matter that
have to be but they just makes it a
little bit better
anyway that's just about it I like the
game I definitely do play quite a bit
when I'm when I can think about it and
today I asked you spit it thanks for
