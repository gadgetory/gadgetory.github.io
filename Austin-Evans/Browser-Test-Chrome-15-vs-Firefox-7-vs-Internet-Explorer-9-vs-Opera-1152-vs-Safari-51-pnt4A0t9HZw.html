series of browser tests this time going
over chrome 15 Firefox 7 Internet
Explorer 9 opera 11.5 and Safari 5.1
before we begin let me explain LeWitt
about my testing procedure all browsers
are fully updates or the latest non-beta
release and all were tested multiple
times with no additional options enabled
such as hardware acceleration each test
was run multiple time on the same
Windows 7 computer the first test is
peacekeeper this is a great overall
benchmark of browser performance and one
of my personal favorites for testing
browsers as usual opera does very well
here with Chrome right behind it and the
rest of the pack falling behind next up
we have the dromio javascript suite this
is a good indicator of how well a
browser handles sites such as Gmail
chrome dominates this test with Firefox
and the others quite far behind moving
on is the particle acceleration demo
which helps determine how well browser
handles graphically intense html5 work
Firefox and Internet Explorer flattened
everything else on paper however I will
note that I got a smooth 60 frames per
second on all the browsers except Safari
next is the html5 test as the name
suggests this measures how well each
browser adheres to the latest web
standards here chrome does the best
however all of the browsers with the
exception of Internet Explorer do a very
good job lastly we have the memory test
each browser was loaded up with these
same five tabs containing popular sites
such as Hulu and I measured the memory
usage very surprisingly Safari went from
being the worst by far last time to
easily winning this one opera and
Firefox do quite well within Explorer
and chrome being much more memory hungry
as it's been for the past year or so all
five of these browsers are competent to
the point where the numbers don't matter
as much as the individual features you
might need however there are some clear
winners this time it's a tie between the
excellent new Firefox 7 and the standby
chrome 15 if you enjoyed this video be
