Technology
oh okay so the world might not be quite
ready for tablet man luckily there are
five other choices that are almost as
cool
coming in at number five we have
something you've probably been hearing a
lot about lately 4k so even though it's
a big buzzword being slapped on lots of
TVs and cameras right now 4k is simply a
resolution your typical TV is 1080p
however 4k just means that there are
four times as many pixels at a
resolution of 3840 by 2160 this allows
four times as much detail to be captured
by a camera or displayed on your TV
which is definitely a good thing but the
downside has been price these things
have been expensive this time a year ago
a 4k TV would run you twenty thousand
dollars but today you can go on Amazon
and buy one for less than 700 not only
that but at CES this year we also saw
some different types of ultra-high
definition TVs including curved models
all of this is great
but unless you're a Hollywood studio
actually recording anything in 4k has
been crazy expensive panasonic recently
showed off their GH 4 which will be
capable of shooting 4k video and a nice
and small package for a lot less than
the $10,000 plus of most 4k cameras Sony
also showed off a 4k handy cam that
somewhere between a pro and consumer
camcorder for $2000 and you might
already have a 4k camera if you have a
Galaxy Note 3
believe me 4k is coming at number 4 we
have something just a little different
electric cars now this isn't strictly
new tech as the first electric car
actually came out in the 80s the 1880s
that is while cars have definitely
evolved in the last hundred or so years
at one point electric cars like this
we're much more popular than the
gasoline-powered counterparts
while that probably won't change
tomorrow electric cars are definitely
making a comeback and they're loaded
with lots of cool technology take the
new BMW i3 for example not only is it
made mostly of carbon fiber but inside
you'll find a 170 horsepower electric
motor good for over 100 miles on a
charge the Tesla Model S looks a lot
like a normal car from the outside but
powering it is a few thousand of these
guys essentially the same batteries as
you would find in your phone or laptop
while they're still a bit impractical
especially when you consider range and
I'll let your car is easily one of the
coolest bits of new tech that you can
buy today coming in at number three or
all
the new ways to gain after the Xbox one
and ps4 dropped late last year and with
PC gaming at an all-time high the
feature is looking very bright for
gaming on the console side Sony just
showed off PlayStation now a way to
strain ps3 games on a Vita ps4 or even a
TV or phone since it's relying on your
internet connection there's almost no
limit to where Sony could bring this and
they even have plans on adding some ps1
and ps2 games to the mix taking a
slightly different approach is razor
with this monster of a gaming PC
codenamed project Christine this takes
all the normal parts in the computer and
makes them modular so that swapping in a
new piece of hardware is as simple as
plugging it in somewhere in the middle
or steam machines valve is pushing these
as an alternative to a console and
they're essentially tiny little pcs made
specifically for gaming they come with a
crazy-looking new controller as well
that drop standard sticks for
touch-sensitive whatever you call these
pretty much regardless of what kind of
gamer you are 2014 looks like a killer
year at number two is wearable tech in
the last few years we've seen huge
explosions and smartphones and tablets
but now a few very big companies are
making bets that wearables are going to
be the next big thing Google is one of
the first out with class a very
expensive pair of glasses with
essentially a phone built in there's a
screen and the ability to run apps as
well as snap pictures using the
integrated camera if glasses aren't your
thing pet will have arguably the best
SmartWatch out there already and the new
pebble steel aims to step it up a notch
where options like the Galaxy gear fall
short and basic areas like battery life
the pebble lasts for quite a while and
boasts a new app store to make it more
useful in its own right and that's not
even starting to go into what hasn't
come out yet including the Apple iWatch
so wearables are definitely something to
keep an eye on this year
and at number one we have the one and
only oculus rift so this is a slightly
different type of wearable but it's
absolutely the thing that I am most
excited for this year oculus rift is a
virtual reality headset that really does
bring you inside the game the latest
Crystal Cove prototype shown at CES this
year combines a high-definition screen
with full motion tracking when you put
the headset on it allows you to look all
around the game world which works
incredibly well
I have a more in-depth video on oculus
rift and I'll have that linked in the
description but this is really the first
time that virtual reality has made sense
major companies like valve have already
begun supporting the rift with games
like half-life and Team Fortress and CCP
the guys behind EVE Online have Eve
Valkyrie which looks to be the first
major game to be designed specifically
for the oculus rift out of all the
advancements in gaming I really do
believe that oculus rift and VR are one
of the biggest changes that we've seen a
long time and really makes me excited
for the future but what do you guys
think what's some of the big cool
awesome new tech for 2014 that you guys
are excited about doesn't be sure to let
me know what you think in the comments
below also I want to give a big
shout-out to audible for making this
