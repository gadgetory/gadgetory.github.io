around a lot in the past two years as
people are leaving it in droves in
heading to Firefox Chrome and the other
browsers and while Internet Explorer 8
certainly is much better than its
predecessors it still likes far behind
in a lot of areas first we will begin
with the SunSpider JavaScript test as
this graph shows it wasn't even close as
Opera 10.5 finish to test over 10 times
faster it doesn't get any better when it
comes to the drill Mayo test either as
Internet Explorer 8 couldn't even
complete it using both the Celtic canes
JavaScript test and the v8 benchmark ie
8 just barely lagged alone but of course
JavaScript isn't everything using acid 3
which is less of a test of outright
speed than the other tests in an
explorer 8 fared quite poorly as well it
also finished way behind the other
browsers and the Peacekeeper test which
focuses on many many aspects of a
browser's performance and there's a
better general test while faster than
Internet Explorer 7 as you can tell fast
and internet explorer 8 don't go
together very well
it does get somewhat better when you
look at boot up times as you can see in
a1 start starting the browser after it's
already been opened
ie is faster than Firefox and opera but
when it comes to cold starts again it's
dead last memory usage is it strong suit
but even then it's solidly outclassed by
Firefox
that's really disappointing considering
that Internet Explorer is built into
Windows to a level that the others just
can't match luckily numbers aren't
everything using Internet Explorer isn't
nearly as bad as in previous versions as
long as you can keep away from loading
up with a million toolbars Aero glass is
nicely integrated into the top of the
browser and you can quickly and easily
customize the look of the browser to
make it nice and streamlined looking
it also features several nice features
such as in private browsing which as
with the other browsers won't save your
history when you're in that mode one
very nice feature of Internet Explorer 8
is support for accelerators accelerators
allow you to do different things with
highlighted text such as map it
translate it email it and more it's a
very useful feature that I certainly
wouldn't mind using in more browsers
overall Internet Explorer isn't as
terrible as you might think
for sure it's slower than say Chrome but
not to the point that the numbers make
it out to be
it lacks a lot of the special features
such as individual tap handling robust
add-on support an outright speed that
the other browsers have however and
security continues to be a major problem
while it's not the joke that it used to
be there's no doubt that you can do much
better so Internet Explorer it's a
fifth-place now feel free to go back to
the main video via the annotation on
your screen to see how the rest of the
browsers did
