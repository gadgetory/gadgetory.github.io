today I'm here with the full rundown of
the iphone OS 4.0 vent it just finished
up literally guys less than five minutes
ago so i'm going to go ahead and run you
guys through everything we know guys I'm
excited this so much new stuff has come
out multitasking really cool basically
Xbox Live some really interesting ads
that actually look like basically apps I
mean guys lotter a lot of really cool
and stuff also a little bit of bad news
too but i'll go ahead and get all that
in just a second anyway let's get this
one started ok guys so excuse me like i
said just finished up just like no more
than a couple minutes ago so i got my
computer here but let's go ahead and go
over the number one thing that i was
definitely looking for which is
multitasking it goes excellent basically
multi testing works in a lot of
different ways depending on what app you
want it's not going to be the standard
multitasking or basically just back runs
on there's lots of different kinds of
multitasking for example like Pandora
uses a multitasking uses just music so
basically it just lets you stream the
audio the app itself really isn't
running but the audio that the app would
use is there's also a lot of different
ones like gps apps canal you know like
wizard let's say you you know you have
your iphone in the car and you're
driving the gps can be running in the
background and basically just say turn
left or whatever but you can still be
doing other things and then there it is
of course just straight up for multi
tasking which allows that to be fully
running but they weren't quite clear
which app can and can't do that so but
it looks very very good when you do that
multi tasking a small dot comes up from
the bottom and each icon is of what
games you running so it really really
looks solid the next thing is actually
fast app switching which is sort of in
with the multitasking but not really
basically it allows a nap
to let's say you're playing a game which
is using up most of the iphone or ipod
touches memory well it can't be back
rounded but it can basically put like a
bookmark where it is you exit out of it
and it still shows there and then when
you come back to it it very very quickly
it comes right back to where it was it's
not full multitasking but for games that
really leverage the full hardware of the
iphone or ipod touch it's a really good
idea now the next one is a few smaller
things that i'll go ahead and cover them
real quickly I books is coming to the
iphone and ipod touch okay so that's
nothing amazing basically it's just like
I books on ipad but it's not too bad
okay so the next thing is something
actually could nobody really expected
but basically now there are folders in
the iphone OS no not folders like you
would think folders for your apps
basically what you do is on your home
screen but basically let's say you want
to make a folder when you take one of
your apps and you push it on top of the
other it drops in a folder screen and
then you can drop as many different
actors you want in there and then
basically it will actually have the app
icon will actually have the like
thumbnails of the facts that are inside
of it and the thumbnail um doesn't look
look amazing of course if you've been
jailbroken you've had something kind of
similar before it does look pretty nice
and definite looks really well
implemented all you have to do is click
it and then a drop down menu comes up
and then you can look in and see all the
apps click it it opens up pretty cool
I'm over on the subject of the home
screen let's go ahead and talk about
something that most people expected now
you can change the wallpaper or if we
saw this on the iPad and this is
probably the number one thing that makes
people jailbreak but now you have full
control over what kind of backgrounds
you want on your home screen course it's
not still not as good as you know
actually making custom icons everything
like on winterboard with your jailbroken
but it's a little pretty nice touch okay
so the next picture is the mail app it's
been redesigned and with some pretty
cool features the most important thing
definitely is that it's unified so all
your mail accounts all go into a single
mailbox as well
you have additional exchange support and
a lot of other really cool things that
people can wait for personally I mean
it's to me it still looks the same and
I'm not going to really use it that much
I don't exactly have a blog email
accounts or anything but a lot of people
do and I was going to be very helpful so
now guys this is probably one of
actually the surprising things that were
the biggest basically there is now going
to be a game center there the game
center summon up basically it's like
xbox live the iphone you have its full
multi player so all your games can be
hooked up into multiplayer you can join
lobbies you can text to friends you can
get achievements it really looks solid
now we haven't tried this out yet of
obviously but from the demo it looks
really really cool and I can't wait till
games start implementing achievements
and everything in there and I don't know
what they're going to call it even
points hopefully something cool by that
it looks really really solid well the
guys go down to the last couple things
one kind of nice thing is that the
iphone OS four point oh now supports
bluetooth now it only supports the
devices who had that have bluetooth
which is like the ipod touch 3rd
generation second generation iphone 3gs
you know on the ones that have bluetooth
but now you can hook up a bluetooth
keyboard very similarly to how you do it
with the ipad type away works great now
the last major feature is i add terrible
name i I doesn't go on top of everything
but I add actually is a really cool
concept basically applet is running
their own advertising and basically you
can really for all intents and purposes
create an app so like let's say you're
browsing on like a nap or something in
the app and you see the ad when you
click it it basically launches a full
app I mean you can go ahead and go watch
videos of like sick that going to show
you I store in nike and several others
but like the toy store going with my
favorite so basically inside that is
really interesting I mean you can go
watch videos you can like download luck
up the home screen love background you
can go even like show like download the
toy store apps you can like luck hit it
and they'll open
like a list of theaters around your area
I mean it's really really cool and then
thing is I mean it's just an ad it looks
like a really like in depth like app but
it's actually an ad so I mean I think
this looks really cool and it's as much
as it looks like a nap everything it is
of course just totally strained like
actually downloading or anything you
just click on it and everything pops up
of course if you're on maybe the slower
connection out there going to be how
it's going to work its might get slow or
whatever but of course you know we don't
know everything yet but actually I'm
surprised I ad looks really cool i mean
you know i'll actually would like
probably want to click on ass to see
that kind of stuff i mean it's a full
deal now we get to the full of bad side
iphone OS four point oh is going to be
fully supported on the ipod touch 3rd
generation and the ipod and iphone thrus
yes so they will get and multitasking
they will get everything unfortunately
if you have an iphone 3g or an ipod
touch 2nd generation you do get a lot of
the features in four point oh but you do
not get multitasking along with some
other unspecified features we don't
really know what that means so that's a
real big downside if you have an iphone
3g and ipod touch 2nd generation you can
go ahead and update to 4.0 but you're
not going to get a lot of the really
cool features like multitasking so
that's that's that's kind of bad i'm
going to get worse a lot of people
expected it but the ipod touch 1st
generation and iphone 2g or the original
iphone neither of them are compatible
with four point oh so you know until
whatever your honor now 3.0 or 3.1 or
whatever you are on that's about the end
of the line unfortunately so today my
guys on whole of it i'm really excited
about iphone OS four point oh I'm kind
of pointed I can't update my ipod touch
to it or at least with full multitasking
but still it really really looks solid
and I'm looking forward to really using
it out Developer Preview ship today
sometime i'm not sure threat they might
be out already or they might come in
later the day and they say this summer
it will be I phone the West will be
downloadable for everybody moves nida
developer also iphone OS 4.0
they really can actually get into it
about the ipad this was all focused on
the iphone and ipod touch they did say
that iphone OS four point oh is coming
to the ipad this fall and so we can
expect multitasking everything like that
to come this fall but they didn't
actually get into specifics actually
never really show the ipad so we don't
know if maybe it gets more features
maybe it's less we really don't know but
anyway guys that is my full wrap up of
the iphone OS 4.0 ven really excited it
looks fantastic and yeah anyway guys if
you have any questions leave them in the
comments and i'll do my best to answer
them anyway thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
