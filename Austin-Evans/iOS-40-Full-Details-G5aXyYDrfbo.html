today I'm here with the full rundown of
the iPhone OS 4.0 event it just finished
up literally guys less than five minutes
ago so I'm gonna go ahead and run you
guys through everything we know guys I'm
excited this so much new stuff has come
out multitasking really cool basically
Xbox Live some really interesting ads
that actually look like basically apps I
mean guys lahter a lot of really cool in
this stuff also a little bit of bad news
too but I'll go ahead and get all that
in just a second anyway let's get this
one started
okay guys so excuse me like I said just
finished up just like no more than a
couple nights ago so I'll get my
computer here but let's go ahead and go
over the number one thing that I was
definitely looking for which is
multitasking he goes excellent basically
multi testing works in a lot of
different ways depending on what app you
want it's not going to be the standard
multitasking or basically just back runs
there's lots of different kinds of
multitasking for example like Pandora
uses a multitasking that uses just music
so basically it just lets you string the
audio the app itself really isn't
running but the audio that the app would
use is there's also a lot of different
ones like GPS apps canal you know like
wizard let's say you you know you have
your iPhone in the car and you're
driving the GPS can be running in the
background and basically just say turn
left or whatever but you can still be
doing other things and then there it is
of course just straight up full multi
tasking which allows the app to be fully
running but they weren't quite clear
which app can and can't do that so but
it looks very very good when you do that
multi tasking a small dock comes up from
the bottom and each icon is of what
games you're running so it really really
looks solid the next thing is actually
fast app switching which is sort of in
with the multitasking but not really
basically it allows an app
let's say you're playing a game which is
using up most of the iPhone or iPod
Touches memory well it can't be
backgrounded but it can basically put
like a bookmark where it is you exit out
of it and it still shows there and then
when you come back to it very very
quickly it comes right back to where it
was it's not full multitasking but for
games that really leverage the full
Hardware of the iPhone or iPod Touch
it's a really good idea now the next one
is a few smaller things that I'll go
ahead and cover them real quickly iBooks
is coming to the iPhone and iPod Touch
okay so that's nothing amazing basically
just like iBooks on iPad but it's not
too bad okay so the next thing is
something actually could nobody really
expected but basically now there are
folders in the iPhone OS no not folders
like you would think folders for your
apps basically what you do is on your
home screen
but basically let's say you want to make
a folder when you take one of your apps
and you push it on top of the other it
drops in a folder screen and then you
can drop as many different apps as you
want in there and then basically it will
actually have the app icon will actually
have the like thumbnails of the apps
that are inside of it and the thumbnail
doesn't look amazing and unfortunately
if you've been jailbroken you've had
something kind of similar before it does
look pretty nice and definitely looks
really well implemented all you have to
do is click it and then a drop down menu
comes up and then you can look in and
see all the apps click it it opens up
pretty cool while we're on the subject
of the homescreen let's go ahead and
talk about something that most people
expected now you can change the
wallpaper or if we saw this on the iPad
and this is probably the number one
thing that makes people jailbreak but
now you have full control over what kind
of background you want on your home
screen
cause it's not still not as good as you
know actually making custom icons
everything like on little bored with
your jailbroken it's still a pretty nice
touch okay so the next feature is the
mail app it's been redesigned and with
some pretty cool features the most
important thing definitely is that it's
unified so all your mail accounts all go
into a single mail
as well as you have additional exchange
support and a lot of other really cool
things that people have been waiting for
personally I mean this to me it still
it's the same and I'm not gonna really
use it that much I don't exactly have a
lot of email accounts or anything but a
lot of people do and that's gonna be
very helpful so now guys this is
probably one of actually the surprising
things that were the biggest basically
there is now going to be a game center
there the game center something up
basically it's like Xbox Live the iPhone
you have its full multi players so all
your games can be hooked up into
multiplayer you can join lobbies you can
text to friends you can get achievements
it really looks solid now we haven't
tried this out yet of obviously but from
the demo it looks really really cool and
I can't wait till games start
implementing achievements and everything
in there and I don't know what they're
gonna call achievement points play
something cool by that it looks really
really solid well the guys so down to
the last couple things one kind of nice
thing is that the iPhone OS 4.0 now
supports bluetooth now it only supports
the Bisons who had that have Bluetooth
which is like the iPod Touch 3rd
generation second generation iPhone 3GS
you know the ones that have bluetooth
but now you can hook up a Bluetooth
keyboard very similarly to how you do it
with the iPad type away works great now
the last major feature is I add terrible
name I I doesn't go on top of everything
but I add actually there's a really cool
concept basically Apple is running their
own advertising and basically you can
really for all intents and purposes
create an app so like let's say you're
browsing on like an app or something in
the app and you see the ad when you
click it it basically launches a full
app I mean you can go ahead and go watch
videos of like say exactly showed boy
store in Nike and several others but
like the toy store going with my
favorite so basically inside that is
really interesting I mean you can go
watch videos you can like download lock
up the home screen love background you
can go even like show like download the
toy store apps if you like like hit it
and they'll open
like a list of theaters around your area
I mean it's really really cool and the
thing is I mean it's just an ad it looks
like a really like in-depth like app but
it's actually an ad so I mean I think
this looks really cool and it's as much
as it looks like an app everything it is
of course just totally strained it's not
actually downloading or anything you
just click on it and everything pops up
of course if you're on maybe a slower
connection I don't know only they're
going to be how it's gonna work it's
might get slow or whatever but of course
you know we don't know everything yet
but actually I'm surprised I add looks
really cool I mean you know I'll
actually would like probably want to
click on ass to see that kind of stuff I
mean it's a full deal now we get to the
sort of bad side
iPhone OS 4.0 is going to be fully
supported on the iPod Touch 3rd
generation and the iPod and iPhone 3GS
so they will get a multitasking they
will get everything unfortunately if you
have an iPhone 3G or an iPod Touch 2nd
generation you do get a lot of the
features in 4.0 but you do not get
multitasking along with some other
unspecified features we don't know I
know what that means so that's a real
big downside if you have an iPhone 3G an
iPod Touch 2nd generation you can go
ahead and update to 4.0 but you're not
going to get a lot of the really cool
features like multitasking so that's
that's that's kind of bad I'm gonna get
worse a lot of people expected it but
the iPod Touch first generation and
iPhone 2g or the original iPhone neither
of them are compatible with 4.0 so you
know until whatever you're on are now
3.0 or 3.1 or whatever you are on that's
about the end of the line unfortunately
so today night guys
on the whole of it I'm really excited
about iPhone OS 4.0 I'm kind of pointed
I can't update my iPod touch to it or at
least what for with full multitasking
but still it really really looks solid
and I'm looking forward to really using
it out Developer Preview shipped today
sometime I'm not sure they might be out
already or they might come in later in
the day and they say this summer it will
be I phone the West will be downloadable
for everybody who's not a developer also
iPhone OS 4.0
they really didn't actually get into it
about the iPad this was all focused on
the iPhone and iPod Touch they did say
that iPhone OS 4.0 is coming to the iPad
this fall and so we can expect you
multitasking everything like that to
come this fall but they didn't actually
get into specific section never really
show the iPad so we don't know if maybe
it gets more features maybe it's less we
really don't know anyway guys that is my
full wrap-up of the iPhone OS 4.0 event
real excited it looks fantastic and yeah
anyway guys if you have any questions
leave them in the comments and I'll do
my best to answer them anyway thanks for
