the review of the brand new iPad 4 with
new more powerful specs a lightning port
an upgraded front-facing camera is it
worth it judging from the tons of
comments I got on my unboxing it's clear
that Apple didn't do a great job letting
people know there actually is a new iPad
over on their site the iPad 3 has
disappeared in fact it's hard to tell
there's anything new unless you go to
the tech specs to see the a 6 X
processor take a look at the iPad 4 and
you'll have a hard time telling it apart
from the iPad 3 the only physical
difference is a lightning port on bottom
instead of the older 30-pin connector in
fact the iPad 4 is practically identical
so if you've ever seen or owned an iPad
3 you'll know exactly what you're
getting here the nine point seven inch
Retina display is still among the best
screens on any device and the tablet is
fairly large and heavy especially when
you compare it to the iPad Mini the
design is mostly carried over from the
iPad 2 and compared to the latest crop
of Apple devices it feels a bit out of
date the biggest change here is internal
pairing the iPad 4 is a new Apple a6x
system-on-a-chip you'll find a dual core
design clocked at 1.4 gigahertz along
with much improved quad core graphics
the iPad 3 was almost a downgrade in
terms of speed but everything is
considerably faster with this version
games like Need for Speed Most Wanted to
take full advantage of the Retina
display and look fantastic just going
through iOS and surfing the web is
faster and smoother which is a big plus
but simply this is what should have
shipped in the iPad 3 there were a few
minor changes as the front-facing camera
has been upgraded to 1.2 megapixels
which is a fair bit better for video
chatting the cellular version now
supports sprint in the US and LTE on
carriers in the UK beyond that what you
have here is a very minor refresh of the
iPad 3 battery life is the same at
around 10 hours iOS 6 is identical and
it works with all the same apps as every
other iPad it's as simple as this if you
already own an iPad 3 there's really no
reason to upgrade for everyone else the
iPad 4 remains one of the best tablets
out there right now with the iPad Mini
however I find it hard to recommend the
full sized iPad the mini feels like a
better tablet in most areas not even
considering the nearly $200 price
difference that said if you really like
the larger size and Retina display the
iPad 4 is hard to be if you enjoyed
don't forget to hit up that like button
and feel free to check out the unboxing
here anyway guys I will catch you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
