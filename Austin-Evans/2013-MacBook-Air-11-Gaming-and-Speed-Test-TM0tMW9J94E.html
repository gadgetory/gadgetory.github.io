here with the speed test and look at the
gaming performance of the 2013 MacBook
Air 11 inch its
outfitted with a dual core Core i7 4650
you eight gigabytes of RAM and a 128
gigabyte SSD where the 2012 model has
the same specs but with the last
generation Core i5 to start we'll be
doing a boot test to see how fast the
new air powers up it's always been quick
to boot but thanks to a much faster PCIe
based SSD the MacBook Air only needs
11.5 seconds to fire up which is about
two seconds faster than the last
generation waking from sleep is also
faster now with the newer air on the
right and the 2012 model on the left
there's practically no delay between
opening the lid and being ready to go to
get a better idea of exactly how fast
the drive is abusing Blackmagic speed
test for write speeds the 2012 air
averaged around 220 megabytes per second
where the 2013 model pulled around 315
Meg's per second read speeds are even
more impressive with the older model
topping out around 420 Meg's per second
with the new air pulling in over 700
megabytes per second making one of the
fastest SSDs I've ever tested period
since I do a lot of video production I
loaded up a copy of Adobe Premiere CC on
the new MacBook Air with 8 gigabytes of
RAM and a snappy SSD editing videos runs
quite smoothly and with a one-minute
1080p h.264 export the air needed 4
minutes and 11 seconds not really very
fast but roughly on par with the last
generation i7 model as far as the
graphics and gaming performance go let's
start with Cinebench both laptops are
running integrated Intel graphics the
2012 model has HD 4000 where the 2013
model has HD 5000 graphics while there
isn't a massive difference in
performance in the benchmark the newer
model pulls in a score of 24 point 9
frames per second where the older
version comes in in nineteen point seven
for a demo of real world gaming I loaded
up a copy of Minecraft and turn the
settings all the way up the full screen
resolution of 1366 by 768 it's perfectly
playable even while flying around in
creative mode delivering anywhere
between 25 and 40 frames per second in
normal gameplay I had no problems with
the air except that it does get fairly
warm while playing but never enough to
be a real issue the 2013 MacBook Air is
a definite improvement with a
faster SSD significantly improved
graphics and roughly the same CPU
horsepower while delivering a huge
battery life improvement what do you
think of the MacBook Air it's a nearly
perfect laptop for me but definitely be
sure to let me know what you think in
