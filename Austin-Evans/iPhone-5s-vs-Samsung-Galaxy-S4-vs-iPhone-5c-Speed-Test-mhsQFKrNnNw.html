here with the speed test of the brand
new iPhone 5s and 5c against the galaxy
s4 to start with we have Geekbench 3
this is a CPU benchmark and it also
gives us some interesting info on the
specs both the iPhone 5c and 5s are
rockin dual core 1.3 gigahertz
processors with 1 gigabyte of RAM for
the Galaxy s4 has a 1.9 gigahertz
quad-core CPU with 2 gigabytes of memory
just looking at pure specs is misleading
as the iPhone 5s is an absolute
powerhouse with a single threaded score
of over double the galaxy s4 and even
with 2 fewer cores it still wins out
over all the iPhone 5c does decently to
basically splitting the difference
between the two phones next we have
SunSpider which is another similar test
that takes the browser into
consideration here it's even more
obvious that the new iPhones are packing
some serious firepower
with the iPhone 5s pulling in a score of
418 milliseconds followed by the 5c with
seven hundred and eleven and finally the
galaxy s4 with 1058 milliseconds
moving on to gaming benchmarks we have
3dmark unlimited while this has a lot to
do with the gaming horsepower of the
phones the GPU is used constantly to
make sure the phone stays smooth so a
good score means a lot here the iPhone
5c falls behind quite a bit with the
galaxy s4 putting in a good showing
however the iPhone 5s is still clearly
on top another very heavy graphics test
is the t-rex HD benchmark inside GFX
bench again the iPhone 5c delivers only
decent performance where the galaxy s4
has plenty of power to run that big
screen and the iPhone 5s continues to
dominate with seriously impressive
performance while the 5c and galaxy s4
are good the Apple a7 inside the iPhone
5s is nothing short of Awesome anyway
thank you so much for watching if you
enjoyed definitely be sure to check out
my iPhone 5c giveaway which is going on
right now
anyway guys that will catch you next
