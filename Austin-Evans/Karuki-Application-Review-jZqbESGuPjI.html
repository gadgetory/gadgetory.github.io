stay I'm here with an application view
on a but quiet Paul kruky you know this
is a very unique app and I'm can get
right into it there's a head of play
options in high scores etc there's
continued bunch go ahead and start a new
game i do recommend take the how to play
although you'll in your backseat okay so
basically yeah so you see it's
definitely a very cool art style now i'm
going to try to explain it and then get
into the game basically what you do is
you see how the little cruiser thing
basically bounce it around you got to
make it hit all these gems and there's
gonna be you see a little blue thing
it's following it yeah catch those and
you get to the end so I'm go ahead and
get into this basically draw lines very
cool there you go and now there's
different obstacles I guess which column
um yeah they can I kill you in stuff
she's private fine one just a second I
usually hit him my sim and basically
he's really fun you draw lines and you
can still move on okay don't let go
basically see I'm catching all of these
got all these gems pump it up I see yeah
that was one basically if you hit those
and then there you go now once you get
to the thing she's going to top oh boy
you see that little thing is floating
around that little kill me nice and
their fall out of it ok so anyway okay
um but yeah this is that the whole game
I mean it's a really simple thing that
I'm loving it I mean it's so a dating um
it first it's kind of difficult to take
it used to I mean I'm night and
completely used to get so unfollow of it
um let's see here by can just follow at
least
by that it it's got some nice music um
definitely very I just love this art
style I mean it's a lot of fun to you
know really just just just look at these
graphics mean I'm a big fan of when
Latics like this are done nicely because
that's one thing i don't like about like
a lot of iphone apps and stuff is they
have good graphics but the thing is it's
like it's like xbox ha all right coming
it's like xbox graphics still like tried
their water down to the icon did it just
doesn't look right the games like this
you can tell or custom made for iphone
and so you know you just kind of look
better mmm try life tighter yeah I glad
just died so basically guys that's just
bad air that's what I'm scared yes
anyway guys that's just about it um
kooky I believe this is a 99-cent app in
the app store right now a lot of fun
it's kind of challenging but it's a lot
of fun just the graphics and just the
gameplay it's just cool ah take my word
for it I guess yeah I doesn't recommend
check it out a pretty flat hey guys
