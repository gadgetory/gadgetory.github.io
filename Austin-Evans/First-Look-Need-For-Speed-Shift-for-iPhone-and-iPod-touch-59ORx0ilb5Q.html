today I'm here with a first look at a
really really promising new game Need
for Speed shift now a lot of you guys
probably flat played the first need for
speed for iPhone and iPod I liked it it
was okay but it just wasn't anywhere
near as good as real racing which in my
opinion has been the best racing game
for the iPhone and iPod touch hands down
well there's competition now and it's
pretty good competition I got to say so
yeah let's just roll through a few of
the really cool things about Need for
Speed Shift and yeah tell you guys what
I think about it okay so let's go ahead
and start with the car customization
obviously Need for Speed is all about
customizing racing you know having fun
it's a bit of an arcade style so you
know let's go ahead and just show you a
quick let's go ahead and go and you can
see here real quickly that you can buy
cars
now I'm fairly early into the game so I
only have the one car it's okay I guess
not show but I have one the rx-8 but as
you can see they're all fully license
you see there's a golf so you have a an
Evo you having a WRX yeah I mean you
have a Nissan 378 goes all the way over
just go over here goes all the way up to
like the m3 GT it's very cool and it's
pretty cool okay I guess that makes
sense okay so now let's go ahead you can
see this is my customized rx-8 can I
show you it's pretty robust
customization let's go ahead and let's
do the visual operates so you can go
through a lot of different things
let's go like okay I guess we show like
color so we can go ahead and change the
color and now we can go ahead and go
into free mode and you see here this
gorgeous backdrop and we can go into
free mode here and take a look at the
car and this is a perfect opportunity to
show these graphics are just awesome
let's go ahead and zoom in
show you I mean these are really things
I'm really tempted to say almost
PlayStation 2 graphics not quite but
very close and I think it beats Real
Racing which is honestly fantastic my
opinion so there's other upgrades but
don't want to go ahead and Bowl you guys
too long
there's wheels you can do wings and
there's also body kits so that's pretty
cool and then really quickly we can just
go ahead and show you there's
performance upgrades which are pretty
arcade style
there's nitrous and it's pretty simple
you just hit you know you just get stage
1 etc etc and the same goes for tires
let's see here there's top speed
acceleration tires and suspension all of
them are very generic you just click it
stage 1 stage 2
nothing really all that exciting and
it's it's very arcade style but it's
pretty cool and it's nice you can go
ahead and customize your car and true
Need for Speed ok so before we get into
arrays long as you really quickly
mention that there is also on
multiplayer and there over Bluetooth or
Wi-Fi so that's a cool thing I have not
tested it I can't say anything about it
but it is on here and so that's always
great let's go ahead and jump right in
to a quick race ok
so let's pick we can pick a different
thing but let's just go ahead and just
do the standard let's go and do it it's
very cool um you'll see the loading
screens aren't bad but if pretty it's a
pretty cool game in the sense that the
tilt controls work pretty well
the gameplay is good and the graphics
are really good I'll show you what I
mean it's still arcade style but pretty
good ok so we have a couple different
modes
okay so you think you the controls are
pretty good not too bad mmm the damage
do too good
okay so the controls really simple the
gas is automated your it's gonna be full
throttle constantly but the brake is all
you and the tilt controls are also all
you okay so actually let me go out to
the outside view here it's about four
let me show you jerk it real fast now
can I get keep make sure you stay in
camera range but if you jur go fast you
get it's pretty cool drift unzipping
different there we go so hold it that's
pretty cool um there's some also cool
things there's like let's yeah well
that's nice Jeff thanks so there's a
couple other things here you'll see the
person you see we have a racing line
which is really handy because there's
different things there's auto break so
if you want on easy you've pretty much
all you have to do is just tilt
there's also I'm playing on intermediate
where I have to I have to you know hit
the brakes and it doesn't turn or
anything for me but it's pretty solid um
you can go all the way up to you know
manual shifting which you just take a
finger and flick up and down I've tried
it and it works decently but it gets a
little bit too much to on one screen to
happen you know be hitting the brakes
and and shifting everything okay guys so
that is my first look at Need for Speed
Shift currently it is $9.99 in the App
Store and that's a little steep but if
there's a game that's worth 10 bucks
this is definitely it it's really solid
I haven't played through it all the way
yet so I wouldn't I can't
wholeheartedly recommend it but from
what I've played so far it's really
solid a lot of fun graphics
I think beat real racing and I'm a huge
fan of real racing so you know I mean
this might this is probably gonna be the
new benchmark in iPhone and iPod Touch
racing games pretty highly recommended
guy
stay tuned I will likely have a full
review on it later on
but first impressions very solid the
racing is solid the graphics can't say
enough I mean and you see this is
actually my custom car they use in the
in the splash screen and it's just it's
really cool and I've never been a too
big of a fan of Need for Speed I
personally don't like this game on the
Xbox 360 but for on iPhone and iPod it
looks really solid so guys might wanna
go ahead and check this one out it is
currently $10 in the App Store and looks
to be very very cool anyway guys thanks
