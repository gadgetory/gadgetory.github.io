live so guys for the fourth episode we
will be talking about a topic that a lot
of you guys are wondering about should
you jailbreak iOS four okay guys so this
kind of splits off into a lot of
categories obviously iOS all beyond
second the third and the third
generation ipod touch is one of the
iphone 3g 3gs and the iphone 4 okay
because there were a lot of questions
whether you even should jailbreak
actually is a question I had last week
at last lynx d3 live um so guys it comes
down to a lot of depending on what you
like to do so of course iOS four if you
did not already comes with a lot of big
features that will be really helpful on
it comes with multitasking for the not
for the iphone 3g in the ipod touch 2nd
generation value gets that internet but
comes with multitasking allows you to
change your background and also comes
with a lot of smaller features such as
the game center so you can go ahead and
do online gaming with your friends a lot
and a lot of more such as I ads which
that's not really something you would
really want to care about but there are
a lot of upgrades in iOS four it's a big
upgrade there are a lot of really cool
things in it but guys the main thing is
I mean obviously I always force gonna be
free for everyone so if you can give you
probably should there's not a whole
duration a lot of reason to stay on 33
point 03 don't want whatever but the
main thing is should you jailbreak it
now guys before you ask yes it is
possible to jailbreak on in fact I have
on my ipod touch right now it is
jailbroken on iOS for now guys currently
today now of course my change here in
the next day two days a week you know if
stuff happens fast but currently today
you can only jailbreak on the ipod touch
2nd generation an iphone 3g the main
reason to do that is to go ahead and
enable a lot of the features that you
get on iOS four then guys what that
means is that in iOS four if you have an
ipod touch 2nd generation or iphone 3g
you do not get a lot of cool features so
for example multi texting you don't get
it you don't get background changing you
don't get even a battery percentage icon
so guys that is the one of the major
regions to jailbreak if you have one of
those two devices because really easily
and simply with redsnow you can go ahead
and just check a couple of boxes and it
will let you multitask
and we'll let you do ahead and put the
backgrounds on behind your home screen
guys this is works great I know apple
says you know the hardware isn't there
that's that's totally wrong I have an
ipod touch 2nd generation and it works
just fine with multitasking flipping
through apps I mean visitor the force
there's a slight slowdown because it's
totally worth to go ahead and do it
because if you have one of those two
devices I mean it shouldn't even be a
question absolutely jailbreak it okay
now guys when if you have you know an
ipod touch 3rd generation and iphone 3gs
from iphone 4 well then it kind of
depends now a lot of people i know are
kind of intimidated by jailbreaking and
you know that's understandable I mean
especially in the early days it was
really easy to break it or too young
just to totally kill your device and
you'll bet Melissa cure a lot of people
I don't know a lot of people got burned
you know totally killing their devices
and stuff but guys today jailbreaking is
very safe and it's very easy I mean you
know take for example spirit the last
Jarrett that came out guys you plug it
in you click a button 30 minutes later
your ipod or iphone jailbroken or ipad
simple as that okay guys so it's
jailbreaking that it's not always that
easy sometimes for example redsnow it
takes it just a little bit more effort
but generally guys you can't jailbreak
if it takes more than 52 minutes to
jailbreak i mean guys that that's almost
unheard of okay guys a lot of things
that why you would you break there are a
lot of perks so for example you
obviously get cydia and that is
basically like your new app store you
obviously do have your original apps
work but now you have it a cydia app
store where you can download all kinds
of apps that apple for whatever reason
doesn't want you to have so guys this
really wide range me do you already have
jailbroken before you know all about
cydia but if you don't i'll give you
just a really brief thing so guys some
of the things you can get are even get
like winterboard which allows for really
full custom a customization you can
change your icons all that kind of stuff
you know before iOS four we had you know
people had been able to backgrounds for
a very long time so you know we've had
stuff like that so a lot of the stuff
that Apple didn't want to or wasn't
ready to give city we'll go ahead and
let you have immediately because there
are a lot more things such as themes um
tweaks and what as much like tweaks I
mean really you can tweak almost
anything through cydia I mean you can
have you know crazy battery
cons I mean you can even have you know
different like home screen you have news
on your home screen I mean guys there
are a lot of customization available
through cydia you can also get emulators
for game for example so you play like
you're super nintendo on your ipod touch
stuff like that which really really
makes it good but on the other hand
though not everybody needs to you know
so for example you know maybe you're
just you know you just have you know
just make calls on your iphone four for
example you just wanna know down the
internet and you know maybe just
multitasking me that's fine so guys I
mean not everybody with iOS four
beforehand I pretty much recommended
that anybody should jailbreak but with
iowa's for it's not for everybody now I
mean still for me I off quite show break
always just because I like to be able to
be open eyes do whatever I want with my
device but for a lot of people you
really don't need to I mean it's not a
big deal and Joe biking doesn't hurt
anything I mean you know sometimes you
might have a small problem all takes
guys plated itunes click restore get
back to where you started no harm done
ok guys so it really it's not that big
of a deal so guys it's really a hard
question i mean if you have an ipod
touch 2nd generation or an iphone 3g
guys it goes without saying absolutely
jailbreak I mean just purely for getting
the features of the newer models if you
just want to but for that never touch
city in 10 guys you would be justified
but guys even with any device really
that will be able to be jailbroken and
of course none of the other devices are
jailbroken this second they are they
will have it you know in the next two
days week two weeks month is I will be
working on but guys really i do
recommend you jailbreak if you really
want to be able to do everything that
your ipod or iphone is capable of so
yeah guys I mean that's just kind of
help you out I know I get a ton of
questions every day about you know
whether I should jailbreak or not you
know questions problems a lot cut stuff
so if we're going to make a video on d3
lat cut explain a little bit about what
jailbreaking does some of the pros and
cons to hopefully help you guys out ok
guys so 0 as always in the second
segment of d3 live i'll be taking live
skype calls all this is done live in
front of blog TV we've got a bunch of
people in here so that's why i take some
calls so let's go ahead and answer one
hello Devon are you there yeah I should
eat
HTC evo 4g arriving for and why um I
think I think iphone 4 I mean I like
Android I think HTC evo 4g is a really
solid phone but I think bang the iphone
is just a better overall package I mean
iOS four is really solid and we finally
have multitasking I mean it's hands-down
the most polished OS pretty much any add
anything um in not to mention I kind of
like the fact that everyone has a
smaller screen is a higher resolution
screens a higher quality screen but one
of my bigger problems like GC Ito is
that it's so big I mean I thought seen
why I've used one it is really i mean
it's usable but it's almost too big you
know I think I phones about the right
size for phone and you know that's just
kind of my personal opinion but yeah so
if I did order the front facing camera
what's the different um well I know the
front facing camera on the HTC evo 4g is
just a standard to know like a point
three megapixel webcam I believe I'm not
Harmison sure but I know it's not really
high quality I'm think from what I've
seen of the video from the iphone 4
front-facing camera seems to be a little
bit better soon see I mean it's almost
similar to like the original iphone rear
camera so i think i haven't i had
actually seen the iphone 4 i'm actually
you know had one so i don't know for
sure but for one I've seen it looks like
it probably has a better front-facing
camera but I it's kinda hard to say but
yeah so the design do you like I can for
better or for HTC iphone I mean I like
the way that I mean it's it's a really
thin phone it's I mean of course i got i
am saying this because i never actually
seen one obviously it's not out yet but
if wanna sing the design looks really
solid I mean not to say that I don't
like that HTC you a 4g i mean you know i
keep keep saying the iphones better I
mean I do like HTC evo 4g if i was going
to have to buy a phone this second i
couldn't get the iphone i probably would
get it but i just don't think that the
addition of 4g and android is enough to
just overtake the just
thing that I phones for get is gonna be
you know thank you hey thanks for the
call okay let's go ahead and take
another call here hello Ben are you
there oh yeah this is ipod touch oh hey
what do you think of project connect for
the xbox 360 do you think it's worth it
or why are you gonna get it and why
that's a great question um you know when
we was when it back one was called natal
and it shows a lot of the demos I was
really impressed with it I thought it
was going to be a really cool thing to
be able to not use you know controllers
or anything I thought that was gonna be
really cool but now that seemed more of
it and seeing extra some of the games
and seeing the price tag $150 is I mean
that's half the price the xbox as is but
the more I said you know I'm not really
convinced that it's going to be or if it
I think it has potential I think that it
could be really impressive but for right
now for the games I've been seeing I
just don't think it's quite gonna be
worth it I think maybe here and you know
six months a year right maybe we see
like Call of Duty or some more like
hardcore Xbox gains that you know these
like we kind of things we see some like
standard like many years of war or some
kind of you know normal xbox game that
you know I might like to play in the
first place and it just so happens work
with connect then I might want to have
to take a look at but I just don't see
myself buying spending 150 dollars by
connect when it really it just it just
doesn't seem to be a really big thing i
don't know i mean what do you think oh
I'll actually have an xbox like I
couldn't get it but um do you think the
Fiesta move would be a little better
than it because it's a lot cheaper well
actually the PS move okay it's fifty
dollars for the main controller and but
the thing with the PS move is that the
kinect you just buy one you know and
that's it the PS move you need a
controller the neck main controller you
sometimes need the sub controller and
then you need a playstation i ah no
matter what so if you were wanting to
get up see i'm gonna i'm going to get
them numbers on here i think if you were
trying to get a sub controller a main
and the PSI is probably going to run you
not much less than the connect but on
the other hand it does look more
advanced but again on that really huge
fan of any I mean the wiimotes pretty
decent but i'm not really i mean i'm not
really into the PS move or connect or
even the way I mean I'm just I just I
don't know I think that motion controls
everything are getting their they're
getting better but I really think before
it really gets huge I think they'll
probably be the next you know and I like
the PlayStation 4 my xbox 720 and you
know the wii HD the next generation of
consoles i think is really when the move
and motion control is going to come
through so right now honestly i'm
probably not going to buy any of these
new motion controls maybe once i see
some big games coming out for them but
until then i probably gonna just wait it
out so let force that's just my opinion
you know okay thanks to the call yep
thanks okay let's take one more call
here hello Justin are you there yeah I'm
Eric hey what's your question man I wish
I thought from 8-3 so far on III yeah
well I think Microsoft kind of surprise
everybody with the xbox 360 slim I mean
it did get late to the night before but
I think the xbox is pretty solid they
showed quite a few good games Gears of
War looks great you know a lot of the
games look pretty cool but Sony did a
pretty decent job they practically just
showed games and games and games games
which quite a few of them looks pretty
good but I think Nintendo really was the
one made III awesome in my opinion I
think you know showing the 3ds was great
and they just kept showing I mean it's
like every 2-3 minutes they show a big
new game a big new gain and all the
games looks really cool so I think III
was really cool this year and I think I
think Nintendo did the best job I think
they all did a pretty decent job but I
think Nintendo between showing the 3ds
and showing just all these really
impressive looking games I think for a
Nintendo did the best so right I agree
mm-hmm oh hey thanks good call man yeah
you too
heizak well um actually yeah let's go
ahead take one more call here a little
bit more time here hello Austin are you
there yope hey which question man oh I
have two questions you prefer
playstation or xbox I started my first
my first video game system was mine was
the original PlayStation I loved it I
didn't get a playstation 2 for a while
but i still like PlayStation a lot but I
never gotten PlayStation 3 i've played
xbox for a long time and to be honest
I'm kind of more into xbox was right now
I mean if this was like you know the
original PlayStation and stuff I'd
probably pick that but today I like the
xbox 360 I mean it is just it's just a
really solid thing gains or there's tons
of games for their cheap they tend to be
cheaper you know when you get used and
you know when they go on sale and stuff
the games tend to be cheaper on the
playstation 3 i'm starting on the xbox
and they I'm not just I'm just kind of
harmful to the Xbox myself alrighty if
my next question is what is your
favorite ipod touch case you know i'm
actually that's one of the only things
about like the ipod touch iphone that i
really don't pay too much attention to i
I mean I've I never really buy you know
the you know the expense of cases I mean
I might be spin I've got make up three
or four cases over like you know a year
and a half of having my ipod touch um
currently I actually have this case
right here which I don't even know the
name of um if I was buying a case though
right now I probably would be the speck
pixel candy candy shell see I don't know
the names of these the candy shell the
probably does look pretty cool but be
honest i am not an expert in any way on
the cases but yeah all right thank you
