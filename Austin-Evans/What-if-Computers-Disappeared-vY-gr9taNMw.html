happen if computers just stopped working
first of all you definitely wouldn't be
watching this video as it lives inside
Google's massive server farms which are
entirely made up of computers and don't
think you could cheat by using a tablet
or phone either these absolutely
counters computers in fact there are
computers and a lot of things that we
use on a daily basis which I went over
in this video right here it would be
very very difficult to spend an entire
day without interacting with any kind of
computer at all now it might seem
ridiculous to think about desktops
around the world just suddenly vanishing
but it's not entirely far-fetched
an EMP blast from a nuclear detonation
or major solar storm could easily knock
out computers on a massive scale a solar
flare back in 1859 was strong enough to
knock out telegraph lines and even shock
the operators if an event like that were
to happen again today it would also do
massive damage to things like the
electrical grid however for this video
let's just assume that all the computers
are knocked out right about now so it
wouldn't take long for the power to go
out either without computers to manage
power plants most of the world will be
plunged into darkness within just a few
hours hopefully you've stocked up on
normal batteries as these are some of
the few power sources that would keep
working
traditional lithium-ion rechargeable
batteries like in almost all modern
electronics Rolland tiny computers to
handle charging and are essentially
useless now some over electronics like
radios and CRT TVs would still
technically be working however unless
you have an older generator with tons of
fuel good luck powering them let's get
out here so if you're like me and have a
car built in the last 30 years or so
you're not going anywhere modern cars
have dozens of computers to run
everything from the dashboard to fuel
injection most of these wouldn't keep
you from driving down the street but if
something major like the engine control
unit fails you're at a plug if you have
an old muscle car you'll be one of the
few who could still hit the road
although good luck trying to make it
very far on a single tank of gas you
wouldn't have much luck with other forms
of transportation either today
commercial planes are almost entirely
run on autopilot and many trains don't
even need people to operate without
computers these are also basically
useless another area that's entirely
reliant on computers today our
communications things like cell towers
and telephone networks
these things will go down almost
immediately some older radios would
still be functioning but for the most
part the world would be thrown back into
the dark ages
alright so this is getting a little
depressing so there would be benefits to
living in a world without computers I
mean we all get to spend more time
outside right well yeah because we
really wouldn't have a choice according
to the EMP Commission up to 90% of the
population of the United States would be
in serious danger after only a year with
no electricity
it's easy to forget just how much
information is stored on computers it's
scary to think about but a huge amount
of our memories are stored entirely
online now flip the switch to turn off
computers and all of this is gone I used
to live right here so earlier this year
a fire burned down my entire apartment
building and with it went all of my data
so sure might be digital might just be a
series of ones and zeros the makeup the
pictures and the videos however that
doesn't mean it's any less real now
imagine this and a massive scale across
all of human knowledge whose last time
you printed out a Google search over 90%
of the world's data has been created in
just the last couple years
meaning vast amounts of medical and
research records would simply vanish
Wikipedia is the world's largest
encyclopedia with over 4 million
articles just in English and to print
them all out would require over a
thousand huge volumes not very likely
you might not think about it but we
really do rely on computers for almost
everything however that doesn't mean we
couldn't go back to the way things were
before well sort of if you lived in a
place with geothermal power plants like
Iceland it wouldn't be a stretch to live
a perfectly happy and comfortable life
without computers the rest of the world
would have a harder time adjusting but
eventually everything would settle down
computers are absolutely one of
mankind's greatest achievements and it's
hard to imagine an event that will wipe
every single one out however we're also
very reliant on them for our daily lives
without any real backup plan if and when
something goes wrong it usually does
anyway I've got to give a big shout-out
to Backblaze for making this video
possible bank blaze is the best way to
keep your files backed up and secure it
works for both PC and Mac and
to access all of your data from a web
browser using an app for iOS or Android
and they'll even overnight you a hard
drive loaded with all of your files like
I talked about earlier losing your data
really really hurts
now I had a backup however it was in my
closet which really didn't do me much
good if I was using bag blaze I would
still have all of my information safe
and sound it's super straightforward for
five dollars a month you get unlimited
backups per computer so click the link
in the description to go over to
Backblaze comm slash austin and get
yourself a free two week trial again
that's back blaze comm slash Austin so
go check it out and make sure data is
safe anyway guys thank you so much for
watching and I will catch you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
