showing you how to get Iowa side
features today on your normal iOS 4
device so of course there's a lot of new
things in iOS 5 a lot of features and
whatnot but the great thing is a lot of
these are already available in one form
or another on your current devices so
maybe you don't have access to the beta
you're not a developer or maybe you are
but you just don't want to have to deal
with some really glitchy and beta
firmware this is a great way to do it
so the first thing I'm going to show you
guys is mobile notifier now this is a
jailbreak tweak and you will find a
couple of these or jailbreak tweaks some
of these are just actually can find the
app store but this is a jailbreak tweak
which is very very similar to the
standard notification center that you'll
find in iOS 5 so in fact by a lot my
device you'll see here that I have miss
notification so I can just tap on that
and see that was mentioned on Twitter
it's not quite the same and in fact i
unlock here for example if i had a push
notification come in right now you would
see that it would just pop up up top it
is very similar to a notification center
again it's not 100% perfect but if
you're just wanting notifications right
now on iOS 4 this is a great way to go
another nice thing in iOS 5 is the
ability to take pictures from the
lockscreen as well as use the up poly
button to take pictures from the camera
app well if you download the city tweet
camera buttons you can do the exact same
thing so if we lock the thing around
click here and then from the lock screen
if we hold the power the up arrow button
it will go ahead and launch the camera
app in addition while we're in the
camera app all you do is hit the volume
button to take a picture this is
customizable so if you like you can have
that too you know turn on or off HDR
mode you can use either the volume
buttons in addition you can also use it
to do video there's quite a few
different things you can do so this is
really quite a handy tweak another big
feature in iOS 5 is iMessages and well
there's no way to give the app itself on
iOS 4 you can use some other app to does
something similar so one way you might
want go is text free that's basically an
app to allow you to send texts for free
another way is kick now kick is very
similar to the way I messages work so if
we want back out here so you can add
anyone up to has the kik app is
available on several platforms if you
have them added up and you can go ahead
and just send the messages so if I want
to send the message hi back to quick you
know you can absolutely do that
moving on we have Wi-Fi sync now of
course in iOS 5 you can now wirelessly
sync with iTunes as well as with iCloud
and there is a somewhat decent way to do
this in iOS 4 now the app is called
Wi-Fi sync and I'll go ahead and launch
it on however there are a couple of
issues with this but one it does not
support the iPhone 4 or the iPod Touch
4th generation as you guys can see here
you have it it'll say unrecognized
device that's certainly a negative and
on top of that it is ten dollars in the
city of stores so this is definitely not
for everyone but if you just have to
have Wi-Fi sync with iTunes you
certainly can use this in the iOS 5
camera app you can do some limited photo
editing and of course while that's nice
to have it pre built in that's really
simple to go ahead and just download the
free app Photoshop Express from the App
Store you'll allow you to do some of the
basically the same thing so just take a
picture really quickly here so I just
kind of take a picture off to the side
here so an awesome picture of my desk we
can hop over here
and we want to select this one so you
can do a lot of the same things so for
example if I want to crop I can do a
little bit of cropping just get rid of
that that's if you want to do that you
can do quite a few different things
rotating flipping you can do a little
bit of the exposure and whatnot so this
is a really simple app and if you want
go ahead and use this right now it's
going to basically do the exact same
thing some time you built into your
camera app it's gonna be close enough
moving on we have Remember The Milk
now just like cake this is not going to
be the exact app that you will find on
iOS 5 but it will do about the same
thing so what remember the milk does is
allows you to add lots of tasks and
whatnot and it will let you know like
for example I need to go get the milk
various different things like that and
what it'll allow you to do is it will
notify you when what time you need to do
whatever and you can run through all of
it pretty simply so it's pretty cool I
don't really particularly have a whole
lot of use for this I kind of just do
whatever whenever which I'm sure a lot
of you guys are the same way but if
you're looking for an app that's kind of
equivalent to reminders on iOS 4 this is
a great way to go another feature in iOS
ID it's not quite as well-known is a
private browsing mode so while there are
plenty of apps in the App Store below
you to browse without leaving all kinds
of history on your device one of the
what best ways I'd like to do is go
ahead and go into City and download
covert I'll sort of go ahead and show
you guys it's really simple here so if I
want to activate the private browsing
mode I can just go ahead and pull up a
new tab and click the new private
browsing mode
I jump back in you see that the the
entire interface is a little bit darker
and now it's not going to be saving any
cookies history anything like this now
this is a free app in City and this is
just great to have in general anyway
guys that's it so of course it didn't go
over all apps some of the apps such as
instapaper would have been nice to have
but at any rate hopefully you found this
helpful and if you do want go ahead and
take a look in the description of this
video i'll have where you find all these
acts and everything like that anyway
