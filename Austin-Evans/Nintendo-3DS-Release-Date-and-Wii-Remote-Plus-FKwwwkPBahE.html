the Wii Remote Plus as well as the
release date pricing and quite few
really interesting details about the
Nintendo 3ds so I have to excuse me if I
don't look quite normal
it's very very light here right now and
in fact Nintendo just finished up their
conference over in Japan so this one
just take a look at what all they
announced so the first thing not really
that big a deal is that they have
redesigned the Wii Remote so I'm sure as
many of you guys know there's an
accessory where you go ahead and plug it
into the back is that called the Wii
MotionPlus
well pretty much all the only change is
that now it is going to be integrated
into the Wii console itself or whether
the Wii Remote so not a huge deal and in
fact we do actually have an exact date
of when this is going to be coming out
but again not that big a deal now what
is a big deal is all the new information
we have on the Nintendo 3ds so actually
they announced quite a few really unique
and interesting things but first let's
go ahead and just talk about what I'm
sure most of you guys are interested in
which is pricing and release date so the
release date is going to be February
2011 for Japan and March 2011 for the US
as well as Europe so yeah not that great
of news that was pretty much the kind of
you know far out talk about what we
were expecting personally I was hoping
that we would maybe see this year but
not that big a deal now as far as
pricing goes but I didn't actually
announce what the price would be for
Europe in the United States however it's
going to be roughly in US dollars it's
gonna be roughly about three hundred
dollars in Japan personally I think it
might be just a little bit less than
that perhaps around 250 eighty three
hundred dollars so it's tonight we're
gonna have to wait a little bit longer
to see exactly the price is gonna be but
it is going to be quite a bit more than
what you might find a ds4 today I'm now
just going to go on to some of the
really cool and unique features of the
3ds so one of them and this is one kind
of got me pretty pretty excited wasn't
expecting it is that it is actually
going to have a Virtual Console very
similar to the Wii which will be able to
play Nintendo Game Boy games so I do
want to clarify this is not going to
it's not going to have like the Diaz
where a cartridge but instead you're
going to go ahead and download these
games I'm sure for how many ever Wii
Points or whatever they just have to
call them so this is definitely really
cool news I'm really glad that there are
bringing some of the gameboy games back
and that's a really interesting feature
is that the 3s is actually going to
support me so if you don't know what
mieze are basically if you've ever
played the way you know you create this
customizable characters will the 3ds is
going to have these but it's actually
going to be improved a little bit
especially if you actually go ahead and
with the three BS take a picture of
yourself and then it will create a weave
or rather on me for you personally not a
huge deal I mean yeah they're kind of
fun to play with like on the way they're
fun to play with for a few minutes I'm
sure it'll be kind of nice to have your
own custom avatar and if assuming it's
fairly accurate you take a picture of
yourself that's pretty cool so guys
that's pretty much it there's a few of
those things the 3ds is including that
the 3ds watch them come with a 2
gigabyte SD card pre-installed um but
yes that's pretty much it anyway guys
I'm really pretty excited to know that
you know the 3ds is gonna be able to
support Game Boy games and then it does
look pretty much the same the final
design is practically exactly what we've
seen so they and you know change it up
like they did before the DES not really
all that excited that we're gonna have
to wait until February from Japan and
March for the United States and Europe
but and not that big a deal so got
anyway guys definitely leave your
thoughts in the comments what are you
thinking are you looking forward to the
3ds now we have a release date and
somewhat of a price so yeah anyway guys
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
