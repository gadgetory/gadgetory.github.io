Google+ now this is basically Google's
answer to facebook it is a fully
integrated social network and it's
actually pretty cool now i will say
right up front does not this is still in
beta so they're definitely things that i
need to work out lots of bugs and
whatnot but I'm not only gonna hold that
against them of course this is still
fairly new but the core of it is really
solid let me give you guys a little
overview of it as soon as you guys can
see here this is kind of the main page
so you guys can see there's a lot of
stuff for example you can do hangouts a
lock on stuff but let me kind of explain
it to you one by one so the first thing
is your string now this is basically
like your wall so you can you post
status updates or whatever so if I can
say this is a status I can spell it
right and so yeah you can do that and
also add photos you can add videos links
and locations so you know very similar
to Facebook and another thing is you can
actually add exactly who you want to
share it with so by default it will show
both friends but if I click add more
people you can add people from different
circles and I'll explain what circles
aren't just a little bit so you but you
can customize exactly who these statuses
go out to or you can just make it public
which works pretty well so if i want to
just click that it'll pop up and one
thing i have noticed is that it is very
very cool as far as how this works when
you post a status it will it will
automatically update like for example
like one of your friends is on it will
show up absolutely immediately i was on
a call with somebody and they literally
salt within a second it was very very
impressive so moving down here you guys
can see some of the things that i'll be
just be using fills a example going to
pegu pool which i don't agree with
google at all but you guys can see here
some of the things so i can go do his
profile or just hover over it and say
that we're friends and if i wanted to i
could change his circle or change him in
my circle or whatever i'm liking also
plus one which is basically like thumbs
up on facebook very simple but you know
not a big deal you can also comment and
share as you guys can see here I've
already done that so a couple of things
so if i scroll down here for example is
what a video looks like if someone
shares it here's a photo in fact i'll
take this photo for an example the
photos are actually not bad now the
problem is it's not the best browser in
the world but if i want to i can add a
photo here i can add a tag or i can
actually go ahead and view the photo
details Jason see here is taken
an iphone for all the kinds of
information which is actually really
pretty handy so let's get out of this so
this is generally the how the wall works
but let me give you guys a little
example of circles now circles are kind
of like creating groups of people that
you want so for example you can have
groups for friends unless I want to
share something with my friends I can
have something that goes through
specifically family just general people
acquaintances people I'm following it's
a little bit complicated but you could
pretty much do whatever you want so they
actually create a new circle here so
taking Phil's example I'm going to call
it gooble I'm they're actually going to
use that word again but so here we go so
this is a new one so let's say I want to
add a couple people so I add nick and
i'll add Phil so as you guys can see
here now if I go ahead and take a look
at this now I can just send an update to
these guys or make sure they see
something specific or not and if i want
i can just delete the circle too and
it's got some cool animations it'll kind
of roll off the screen which is I think
it's kind of neat moving on there's also
a very cool feature called sparks now
this is almost like an RSS feed for the
Internet so for example if I want to add
something I've already actually add a
couple sparks so for example I can see
anything about nikon say anything about
youtube or if i will go on to go into
sports i can add something like oh i
don't know i could add iphone iphone 5
rather i can add spark it'll
automatically show all the kinds of fake
information that's definitely not real
about the iphone 5s if you guys look up
at the top of the screen you'll find
that the new dart title bars actually
use so if you guys don't have google
plus you'll probably notice that on
google com there's now a black bar as
opposed to the standard looking one well
there is a reason for this so for
example if I want to share on files on
my gmail I could just click on this and
it's across pretty much all Google
things so I could just click on this and
send an update straight from pretty much
any website it's almost like having a
extension connected into your browser in
addition you can also take a look at
notifications so if anybody you know
Plus Ones your post or anything like
that you can definitely do it from there
now one of the learn things i do want to
show you guys and actually won't give
you a full demo in this video is
hangouts now hangouts is very similar to
allowing you to use like skype video
chat in the on your browser either
I began I don't want to get too in-depth
into that I've already made a separate
video on that so if you guys are
interested in that definitely go ahead
and be sure to hit the annotation on the
screen right now anyway guys that's it
from a review of Google+ so they're
definitely some pros and cons I mean on
the really good side I love hangouts
absolutely fantastic feature circles
works really nicely i like having really
fine grained control with who i share
what with and everything and also if
you're already big into google if you're
already having you gmail and android and
you really invested in the Google
ecosystem then it's going to be really
simple for you to get up and running
very simply and easily with Google+ on
the other hand though it's not quite
perfect so for example it's definitely
very buggy and glitchy right now and
since it's in beta I really won't hold
that against them I'm sure most of the
time most of the things that need to be
fixed will definitely be fixed by the
time the Google+ is released over
there's also some core functionality
this is just flat-out missing so for
example there is no way to send messages
so you know private message anything
like that it's just not there right now
and of course technically you know you
could gmail or use Gmail or email or
something like that but what's one extra
step that you really shouldn't have to
have there should be some kind of
messaging system even if it's gmail
built into google plus I think they
really should do that but on the whole
of it I am impressed with Google+ I
definitely will be using it for quite a
while but I think one of the biggest
things is just the people if they can
get the people on there and they can
work out some of those core
functionality I absolutely will have no
issues whatsoever recommending Google+
to you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
