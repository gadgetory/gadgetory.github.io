PC for five hundred dollars say hello to
the photon hey guys this is Austin and
today I'm here with my latest build the
photon with a budget of $500 you're
looking at a PC that can handle games at
1080p without breaking a sweat
run it through the 3d market firestrike
benchmark which is a good general test
of a gaming PC's performance and here
the photon stacks up nicely against some
of my other builds take a look at
battlefield 4 and we've got a solid 48
frames per second running on high at
1080p jump over to Metro last light a
game that's not only fun but also
incredibly demanding and here we're able
to run things on normal at 46 FPS with
BioShock Infinite things can be bumped
up to very high settings and still get a
nice and smooth
54 frames per second if you like racing
games grid 2 is a fun choice and the
photon handles it nicely on Ultra at 43
FPS and because I know you guys are
going to ask I did try running watchdogs
on the photon so I was able to get
running decently on medium settings at
1080p our are seeing some pretty decent
stuttering which unfortunately have seen
on basically all versions of the PC
right now so for more in-depth
benchmarking gonna wait until wheelies
see some patches or some driver updates
to kind of address that but it is
playable on the photon now let's take a
closer look at all the parts that make
up the photon starting with the case
which is the new Corsair spec oh one
this is a full sized ATX chassis with a
big window along with the front LED fan
as a corsair case it's nice and easy to
work in and about the only thing I wish
it had was a second exhaust fan but
that's an easy enough upgrade for the
processor the photon is using an AMD
athlon x4 760 K it delivers a quad core
design clocked at up to four point one
gigahertz which is a good fit for 1080p
gaming I have lost track of how many
budget gaming PC's I've built using at
Long's as their rock-solid CPUs they can
even be overclocked on the graphics side
we've got a Sapphire Radeon r7 260x this
is a great card with support for things
like AMD's mantle and trueaudio
along with two gigabytes of memory which
is getting more and more important these
days take a look at the motherboard and
we've got an MSI a 78 M II 35 this is
another one
I go to choices that accepts up to 16
gigabytes of RAM has both USB 3.0 and
SATA 3 along the support for Kaveri for
storage we've got what in my opinion is
the best hard drive for a gaming PC
build the Western Digital caviar black
with one terabyte of capacity this is
the next best thing to an SSD and it's
going to cost you a lot less on the
memory side the photon uses 8 gigabytes
of Crucial Ballistix sport ram clocked
at 1600 megahertz this is great stuff
for gaming and since it comes in a
single dam you can always add another to
bump up memory to 60 gigabytes later on
I feel like a broken record here is I've
only used these things a million times
before but for the power supply we have
the corsair CX 430 these are a great
choice there now I'm going to be
reliable and efficient but they also
give you plenty of power to handle the
system as is as well as with some
additional upgrades later on put it all
together and the photon is a killer
gaming PC that doesn't break the bank
even though the photon is around $500 as
of recording this video things change
all the time so we'll have up-to-date
links of everything I talked about in
the description of this video over on my
website so definitely go check that out
