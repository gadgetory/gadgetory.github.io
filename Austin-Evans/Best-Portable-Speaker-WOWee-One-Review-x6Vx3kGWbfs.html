wowie one gel audio speaker now this is
a really cool product
I've actually got was able to get this
at CES I've been using it ever since I
got back and I've got to say there are a
lot of things I really love about this
but before we get into the audio quality
and a lot coming good stuff let me just
give you guys a quick tour first thing
size-wise it's pretty small I'm going
just take my ipod touch a second on top
it would I would taste about about two
iPhones thick a little bit on the bulky
side but for a speaker no big deal at
all definitely very pocketable
as far as the design goes it's very
clean and very simple which is
definitely something I look for you know
it's it's it's not anything fancy or
whatever but I definitely don't mind
that at all on it's really nicely built
well I guess as I say it's really nice
and understated it does have Chrome on
it which is kind of the opposite of
understated but it's a really clean and
nice looking design this is the this is
the black one you can get in white and
perhaps ago a couple of other different
colors I don't know if the top of my
head you guys of course can check it in
the link in the description anyway it's
like I said very simple on the only
really things that you'll find oh yeah
one thing I do want to mention is it
just has a speaker grille right here
probably one of my only negatives and
that's not a major negative but do be
careful this definitely feels like if
you you know something this was in your
bag you could probably break that
speaker grille of course that's you know
speaker grilles are like that a lot
anyway but I'm just be careful because
that does seem a little bit flimsy um go
ahead and just show you guys up at the
end here this is all that the port's not
anything are there's a mini USB for
charging you know pretty
self-explanatory this does have a
rechargeable battery then you have a
three-and-a-half millimeter audio in and
one really cool thing about this is it
actually does double as the on and off
so what you do is just take the include
three-and-a-half millimeter and just
plug it in and it turns it on which is a
really cool feature I like that you're
not gonna accidentally leave this on or
leave this off as soon as you unplug it
shuts off and you're good to go okay so
now I'm over my destiny you guys a demo
of the audio quality and now before we
do begin I do want to explain one thing
this is a different this is just not a
speaker like you would normally expect
what this actually uses is it use gel so
if you guys take a look on the bottom it
actually is it feels like kind of a
really tacky
sort of rubber but what actually is this
gel and what that does is it takes the
sound that it creates in the speaker and
transfers it to whatever it's sitting on
so web guy here is against the wall I'm
holding it up obviously it's not gonna
stick to the wall but um and I'm holding
against the wall just so you guys can
hear how it reverberates with the wall
it's pretty impressive so let's just go
ahead and start the song again so there
you go guys this is the WoW a one now I
know I'm starting to sound like a broken
record here but this thing sounds
awesome you know the volume is really
loud I mean for example when I had this
at CES you know that was getting a demo
of it and CES very very loud very very
crowded this thing was I mean really
really really that which is awesome for
something this small same thing goes for
the bass the bass is really really deep
you do not expect to see bass as
something like this and obviously
actually you technically don't get bass
you have to relies on putting it on some
sort of surface but you know that's
actually kind of what part of the Charma
but you actually you're able to use
various different surfaces you know it's
not not everything's gonna work quite
that great but you know just experiment
around you just put it on a table I mean
it'll work no matter what but the you
know just kind of to experiment a little
bit you'll definitely get some even
better sound so anyway guys that's about
it I do want to mention there are a
couple of negatives this is not going to
sound great for everything you know what
this really shines in is bed music with
a big beat and with big bass that's what
it really shines out so for example
dubstep it works perfect for dubstep
metal that works pretty well well pretty
much any music that it's got anything
like a big beep with big bass it's gonna
sound good on this some of the music's a
little bit softer a little bit you know
not not quite so much bass everything
it sounds decent but you know that's
that's not what it really this is just
you know this is made for something you
can put in your pocket take to like a
party or something you know hook it up
to your iPhone you know go crank some
really good music and you know it
easily enough to fill up a nice-sized
room no problem at all so guys if you're
interested you go ahead and check this
out I have a link in the description
it's a bit pricey it's about $80 but for
what you get I wouldn't complain by that
whatsoever anyway guys do want to give a
huge thanks to the folks over at Wow he
for providing this to me for free to
review really really cool product and I
definitely recommend guys go check it
out really awesome sound anyway guys
