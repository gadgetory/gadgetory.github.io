computer you may find compatibility
issues with the following parts list
today mu with the latest in my computer
build series today focusing on a
computer that is focused on serious
1080p gaming performance at the nine
hundred dollar price point to begin with
we will be using the Intel Core i5 2500
kcp you don't let the i5 branding fool
you this is a serious performer for
gaming is a quad-core processor clocked
at three point three gigahertz however
just like 2,600 k you can easily
overclock it to 4 gigahertz and above
for 220 dollars will be a great core for
your build for a motherboard we will be
using a gigabyte GA z68 XP ud3 is a z68
board to feature support for Intel's
quick response SSD caching se23 and USB
3 ports as well as virtue for switching
between the CPU graphics in your
dedicated card at 140 dollars this will
work great for our build moving on to
the graphics card we have the sapphire
radeon 6870 this should be able to play
nearly any game available today maxed at
1080p without a problem and also
features a pair of DVI ports along with
display port an HDMI couple with a free
copy of deus ex it will work great for
155 dollars after rebate for memory will
be using eight good bites of g.skill
ripjaws ram quad at 1600 megahertz the
heat sinks aren't overly large and $45
it's a great deal for plenty of RAM to
run your build storage is taken care of
with a one terabyte samsung spinpoint f3
hard drive and an ocz vertex 60gb bite
salt state drive you have two options
you can either use the quick response
SSD caching feature to automatically
speed up your most used files on the one
terabyte drive or simply install windows
and your favorite apps on the SSD either
way all your storage will be taken care
of for 120 dollars while a DVD burner is
hardly necessary these days it will
still help install windows in any disk
based media you have so we'll be using a
samsung cd/dvd burner for twenty dollars
for the case there is the cooler master
half 9-12 well certainly not an
expensive case it offers a lot of solid
features including plenty of room for
installing additional fans easy access
to the filters for cleaning room for
lots of hard drives graphics cards as
well as a cage for installing a pair of
2.5 inch hard drives on the bottom of
the case my main bill is than a half
9-12 and i highly recommend it for sixty
dollars the power supply for the build
is a thermaltake tr2 600 watt supply
snap modular it will deliver enough
power for your built including
overclocking the cpu with head room to
spare for $55 last but not least we have
a new copy of windows 7 home premium
64-bit if you want you can install
another version of Windows or Linux but
otherwise this will run $100 so overall
how do we do as of September 8 2011 on
newegg com the entire bill will run 889
dot 90 cents for this price you'll be
getting a rock-solid gaming rig for
under nine hundred dollars it should be
capable of playing all the big games
that are coming out this year do keep in
mind that prices are always fluctuating
so feel free to customize the bill to
your own liking if you found this
helpful definitely be sure to leave a
like rating and if you want to be
notified when I post a new video be sure
