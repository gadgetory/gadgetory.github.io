with the video going over the ipad 3
that's about that time it's going to be
released here pretty soon so let's go
what all we know the first thing is I
expect it will have a Retina display of
course if you guys remember when the
iphone 4 came out and it had the retina
display it's going to be very similar on
the ipad 3 so it's going to have the
exact same size but the pixel density is
going to be much much higher to give you
guys an idea of what I mean the iPad won
an ipad 2 both had a resolution of 1024
x 768 now that means how many pixels are
in the display and how many pixels means
you know of course how sharp how clear
all that kind of stuff however with a
retina iPad 3 you'll have a much larger
display of 2048 pixels x 1536 this is
downright enormous and just to give you
guys a good idea of how detailed this
will be full 1080p content will easily
fit inside the ipad 3 just display of
course with that many pixels to push the
ipad 3 is going to need a lot of
horsepower and this should be supplied
by the apple a6 processor based on the
iOS 5.1 beta it looks like the ipad 3
will have a quad-core cpu which should
give it plenty of power of course quad
core cpus are coming in several other
phones and tablets with of course the
Tegra 3 already shipping the asuste
transformer prime so this really isn't a
big surprise to me at all they're also
should be a version of the ipad 3 which
comes with 4G LTE support now this isn't
really a major surprise pretty much any
new phone or tablet it's not going to be
coming out just with 3g it's kind of old
it's 2012 and pretty much anything new
that's going to be coming out should
have 4G LTE support so you can
definitely look for that on the ipad 3
as far as what the ipad 3 will look like
we don't have a really complete picture
however based on some late cases it
looks like it will be fairly similar to
the ipad 2 as you can see here if these
are legit the ipad 3 routes going to be
very similar to the ipad 2 looks pretty
perhaps about a millimeter or so thicker
but overall everything looks to be very
similar all you know the ports and the
buttons and the cameras and wine are
going to be in the same place and
roughly the same size so finally when
i'm going to see this ipad 3 well
according to bloomberg and several other
sources it looks like the ipad 3 is
already in production and headed for an
early March release so using a little
guesswork based on this it seems like
the apple event announcing the ipad 3
will probably be in the late februari or
early march and the ipad 3 itself will
go on sale and early to mid March prices
are likely to remain the same however I
do expect the ipad 2 will continue
be produced and probably get a hundred
dollar price cuts so you have a
four-hundred-dollar ipad 2 and then you
can move up to the 500 ipad 3 i'm very
curious to know what do you guys think
about all this do you currently have an
ipad you want to upgrade you have some
other kind of tablet or you just curious
about what the new ipad is going to be
all about doesn't be sure to leave all
your thoughts in the comments section
