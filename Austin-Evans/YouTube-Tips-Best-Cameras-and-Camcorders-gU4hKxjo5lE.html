video on the best camcorders and cameras
for use on YouTube now this is gonna be
a collaboration with my good friend
Marcus you guys probably know him from
the mkbhd YouTube channel and today
we're going to be going over not only
the cameras and camcorders that are best
suited for YouTube in addition some
general tips on how to use them the can
fix a series of camcorders have always
been very popular on YouTube and our
choice is going to be the hf r 20 now
with this you get full 1080p video quick
capability which while not entirely
necessary a lot of times 720p is going
to be just fine for YouTube it's very
nice to have the option that you can go
ahead and bump it up to 1080p if you
like you also do have a microphone input
again very important if you're recording
YouTube videos well the standard inboard
mic is not going to be particularly
terrible having the option to install
something that's going to be much much
better is always great always nice to
have expandability options with kamcord
cameras camcorders or indeed anything
like that
now on top of that it does have eight
gigabytes of storage built in and on top
of that you get two SDXC card slots so
while that eight gigs is going to be
probably just fine for most filming if
you need more you can install it to more
car SD cards and really expand the
storage out as much as you need so
storage definitely will not be an issue
with this camcorder it does have a
touchscreen um personally I'm not a big
fan of the touchscreen typically I just
like to use the the physical controls
however it is nice from time to time to
be able to use that touchscreen just for
really simple inputs alright so a great
tip when you're looking for camcorders
especially when you're choosing one to
buy is optical versus digital zoom
you're going to want to lean towards
optical over digital optical zoom is
actually the physical movement of the
lens element on the camera itself to
zoom in on the image while digital zoom
is literally just moving in on the
actual picture so it tends to have a
worse quality image zoom so if you can
always get the one with the higher
amount of optical zoom that'll be more
versatile and if you see something with
something like a thousand times digital
zoom that's nothing much to be impressed
about because that's all in the software
well the best parts of having a
camcorder is the fact that we'll have
auto focus that's something a lot of
DSLR is lack and what this will allow
you to do is of course keep your subject
always in focus now with a DSLR you're
going to be constantly manually focusing
and trying to keep everything perfectly
in shot and that can be kind of
difficult however with the camcorder it
will do it all automatically however
when you are picking up a camp
there's one thing you should look for
and what is the minimum focus distance
and this may or may not be an issue for
you but for example if you're going to
be doing a lot of macro shots perhaps
you're going to have it really close to
products on your desk if you're
reviewing something or you're doing your
nature shots or whatever if you're doing
going to have the key are very up and
close to whatever your subject is just
make sure that the camera does have a
decent macro mode will be able to focus
fairly closely so there's an entirely
different category of cameras cameras if
you will that can be used to create
videos and they can also double as your
still camera and these are DSLRs
disallows are actually getting more
popular on YouTube for the youtubers who
actually want the most amount of control
over the type of video that you get so
DSLRs are mainly made in terms of a
consumer budget for Canon and Nikon and
one of my favorite cameras of all time
is the Canon t2i and what I'm going to
recommend as a DSLR for YouTube is a
Canon t3i which brings not only a
similar budget but a much more vast
video features it's more video centered
if you will so you get the articulating
LCD screen you get more audio controls
and if things like that a better body
so overall the Canon t3i is a great
choice for those of you who like Canon
rely on Canon and really want to use a
DSLR for your video work on YouTube one
of the most important things to keep an
eye on when you're filming with the DSLR
is your shutter speed in your ISO now
shutter speed is simply how fast the
shutter is opening and closing now this
seems very simple and it is typically
you're going to want if you're shooting
at 30 frames per second video going to
be wanting to have it at one sixtieth of
a second I don't mean that would be able
to open and close that causing any
problems with your video now in most
cases that's going to be the ideal
situation if you're going to have the
maximum amount of lighting it's going to
let everything else and the best way
course sometimes you may want to kind of
affect and change it around a little bit
for example if you're shooting dark you
may want turn down a little bit or if
you're doing your action photography you
may want to turn up a little bit but
generally you want to have it at one
sixtieth of a second now another thing
is ISO now ISO is kind of like the
digital gain on video so if you ever go
into Photoshop you know you manually
turn the brightness and up and down
that's kind of like what it is on the
camera so everything is going to be
default kind of dark and as you turn the
ISO up it will brighten the image up now
again when shooting this video you want
to keep this as low as
possible if you want to increase you
know the brightness or whatever you want
to do that in other ways of an ISO
however in certain situations you may
want to bump your ISO up some most DSLRs
today do have a pretty robust ISO
feature where you can turn it up fairly
high without having a lot of graininess
or noise in your image but again ISO
you'll typically want to have this as
low as possible so another thing that
you can change within the camera itself
on a DSLR is the aperture so if you can
imagine the iris in the back of the
camera say this is the most open it can
be the aperture when control in the
camcorder f-22 would be sort of the
smallest aperture and F's a 1.8 would be
the most open the more open the aperture
is the more light you're going to get
and the more bright the image will
appear and it also creates a shallow
depth of field so it's more blurry when
I reach out here or back there when the
aperture is all the way closed or not
all the way closed but almost all the
way close say f10 or f11 or 20 you're
going to have a much lower amount of
light getting in but much more in focus
so that removes selective focus but you
do get much more in focus if you do
prefer to have that anyway guys that's
it for our video on the best cameras
camcorders and tips on how to use both
however that's not everything we have a
full part 2 video where you guys can
check out on Marcus's channel where we
go over some microphones some lighting
as well as some good video editor so
definitely go check that out if you're
interested in his videos definitely be
sure to go subscribe
