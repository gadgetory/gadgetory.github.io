you how to jailbreak your iphone ipod
touch or ipad unlace 4.3 point2 firmware
so before we begin there are a few
things that do want to mention this is a
little bit more complicated than usual
however I will definitely be here to
walk you guys through it so first of all
we are going to be using redsnow the
latest version and now this is available
for both windows and mac obviously i'm
going to be giving you guys the tutorial
using Windows 7 however this will work
the exact same way with one small
exception on the Mac OS and I'll show
you guys exactly what all I mean just
one second now there are a couple of
other things i do want to mention for
one this is going to support most of the
devices on 4.3 point2 and of course it's
going to be an untethered jailbreak
which is what we want there's a previous
version it was tethered however this is
fully untethered meaning you can turn
off your device as much as you like
without any issues so this supports the
iphone 3gs the ipod touch 3rd generation
the ipod touch 4th generation and the
ipad 1 this does not support the ipad 2
for the time being it also does not
currently support the iphone for now the
iphone 4 bit is a little bit of a little
bit of a problem however that will be
probably changing the next day or so so
definitely keep an eye out on the screen
I'll put an annotation up as soon as
iphone 4 is good to go so to do the
jailbreak we're going to need two things
we're going to need the redsnow file
obviously the jailbreak I'll have that
in the link in the description you can
download it from there now also had the
I you also need the 4.3 point2 ipsw i'll
have another link in the description
there's a good chance that you might
already have it on your computer if you
already updated to 4.3 point2 so if you
have that it's no big deal otherwise
I'll have also have it download so just
edit the link in the description for
that now if you are on Windows Vista or
Windows 7 you're going to have one
additional step if you're on Windows XP
or any version of Mac you can skip this
bed so you need to come to the redsnow
file or right-click it and come down to
properties now you come over to the
compatibility tab and click run this
program in compatibility mode the
windows XP service pack 3 now service
pack 3 is not available feel free to try
something else something like Windows XP
or Windows 2000 something like that it
should work but again if you're only on
vista and seven if you're on Windows XP
or something early to no big deal now
you've done that coming into the
privilege level and click run this
program as administrator and apply and
we're going to be good to go so once
you've got redsnow all set up open it up
I'm going to click click yes here and
here we go so now we have the option now
at this point we're going to need to
select our ipsw so we'll go ahead and
click browse of course I have it on my
desktop but like I said after you do
that tutorial just move it around to
your desktop or do whatever you like and
click Next so you'll prepare the
jailbreak data for just a moment I'm
going to give it just meant to patch the
colonel and while it's doing this I do
want to mention one thing if you need to
all obviously be on 4.3 point2 already
if you're on four point three point one
or something this will not update your
device so obviously there's not really
any major reason to update to 4.3 point2
but of course you want to be on the
latest or you accidentally updated or
whatever reason this tutorial is right
here to help you out okay so once it's
done a little going to be a few options
here number one thing install cydia that
is the jailbreak app store definitely
what you want to do you can ignore
custom bundle not a big deal but one
thing that you probably will want to
enable is allow boot animation so what
this will do is pre install it where you
can animate a install an animated boot
logos which is very cool if you have an
ipod touch you can enable battery
percentage i definitely recommend that
and these other two options are really
not going to be needed for us so we can
click Next and now we need to put our
device into dfu mode now before we enter
DFU mode there is one quick step that we
need to do now this is not a hundred
percent necessary but I highly recommend
it it is to plug in your device my mind
is going to be an ipod touch 4th
generation and i'll show you guys im
just freshly restored because i was on a
previous from are you don't you guys
don't have to restore but phones from
4.3 point to plug your ipod iphone ipad
whatever it is into the computer and let
itunes fully sing now that will back all
your data or contacts all that kind of
good stuff so that after the jailbreak
if anything goes wrong and hopefully
nothing should but if anything does go
wrong you will be covered so you won't
have any worries but of course this
should not cause any data loss this is
just a little precautionary measure so
plug your device in and we have to plug
we need to shut it off so just hold the
power button for a second and slide to
power off and give it just a minute I'll
just sit here with you guys for a second
to just make sure that the screen is off
there goes you see the pinwheel there
so once the screen is totally off we can
continue so let me drag this over to the
side so I can you guys a little side by
side view here so what we're going to
need to do is hold the power button for
about three seconds I'm going to hold
the power and the home for 10 release
the power and continue holding the home
button until it gets us the all clear
that's what that's the method of going
into dfu mode very simple I will walk
you through it as well as you can follow
the instructions when you jailbreak for
yourself using redsnow so going to click
next and hold the corner for three
seconds now we're going to go ahead and
now hold the home and the power for 10
seconds so hopefully you guys can be
able to see their get this all in the
shot wait for it and there we go we can
release the power button and continue
holding the home button so 15 seconds
usually takes like five but just go
ahead and continue holding it until
redsnow gives you the all-clear so it's
going to when does it kind of pop up but
that's not a big deal so just give that
a second all right so we can let go of
that for once somebody's in Windows
decide to install a driver while we were
doing that so as you guys can see here
it's going through says gentle
downloading jailbreak data so this will
take just a few minutes so just sit back
be patient and I'll be back as soon as
this is all done alright so just
finished up so if we open up our device
everything should look exactly the same
but if we scroll down to the last page
you guys will now see city installed if
we open this up it'll just say yeah
print file system all that kind of stuff
actually needs to connect Wi-Fi but I
will do all that later but anyway guys
as you guys can see city is installed
everything works you can get all your
cool jailbreak mods themes tweaks and
all that kind of good stuff on 4.3
point2 now anyway if you found this
video helpful be sure to subscribe I do
lots of other jailbreak related videos
and we'll just kind of tech stuff in
general so you found this helpful be
sure to subscribe and you will be
notified with all my new content</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
