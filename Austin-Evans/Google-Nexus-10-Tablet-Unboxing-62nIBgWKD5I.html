here with an unboxing of the brand new
Google Nexus 10 with Android 4.2 a $400
price tag and a Retina display crushing
300 PPI screen let's take a look first
step is to get into the box by sliding
up the Nexus cover there are two small
seals but a knife makes quick work of
them now we just need to pop the lid off
and we have the Nexus 10 itself but
let's set it aside for a second included
is a micro USB cable for charging and
syncing a USB charger which comes with
an adapter for whatever country you live
in and you also get a Quick Start Guide
warranty info time for the good stuff
the Nexus 10 itself you get a bit of
protective plastic but that disappears
the quick peel one look at the tablet
and you'll see a bar some from the Nexus
7 with a minimal design fire it up and
you'll see the 10 inch display with a
resolution of 2560 by 1600 quite a bit
better at least on paper than even the
iPad for taking a look around you'll see
on the left side a micro USB port and
headphone jack on the right side is an
HDMI port for connecting the Nexus to a
TV and on the top left edge is your
sleepweight button and volume rocker up
front you'll see the 1.9 megapixel
front-facing camera and around back as a
five megapixel shooter capable of 1080p
video and the LED flash the rear is made
out of a soft touch plastic and
immediately out of the box as a
fingerprint magnet it feels a bit cheap
honestly I think the Nexus 7 did a
better job here you'll find a removable
piece around the camera which isn't too
useful right now but soon there will be
covers the uses to attach rounding out
the tablet you'll find a pair of
front-facing speakers which just makes
sense along with a hidden notification
LED on the bottom of the screen Android
4.2 is similar to the Nexus 7 just
stretched out for the 10 inch screen
I'll do testing soon but at first glance
everything seems to be nice and smooth
so there you have it my unboxing of the
Google Nexus 10 if you're interested you
can check out more Nexus 10 videos here
and I also have a samsung go so you know
to giveaway going on right now don't
forget to hit that like button if you
enjoyed and I will catch you guys next
