I'm here with the next in my series of
must-haves City application videos and I
fell it well but there's new actually
this one is fairly notes probably maybe
2-3 weeks old but it's a pretty cool and
called boss paper basically what this
allows you to do is set a wallpaper or a
series of wallpapers to show up on your
home screen and they will continuously
change and everything however you set
very cool on definitely critical
application i recommend most you guys
you know let's check it out so yeah
let's get doesn't start ok so boss paper
I'm cutting out all you had to do is
just search for it it's in the bigboss
repo just you know search for BOTS
papers pretty simple so basically once
you open it and phosphate Mabel anything
now you can download specific image
packs boss paper um now they'll be like
fantasy wilderness um you know just
different ones and you can make your own
so let's just go ahead and open it up
here then that's just the ones that i
have so yeah you can do individual
pictures i don't actually have any on
here so now you can go into doc images
this is pretty cool i will say that
usually you will probably want it's kind
of customizable you don't have to um
some things will kind of look a little
odd with this because it destroys the
background of it um if you want if it
looks a little odd you might want to
just disable your theme um it's working
okay for me so i'm not going to i'm
using the Ilia mean or blue mine I don't
hide set thing right now so it's okay
but uh so sometimes you might want to
disable the theme and then you can
change dots and stuff it's all about
customization right and then there's
books then there's color select which is
if you want like red then change screen
etc etc now there's transitions this is
definitely a very cool thing so let's
say now this is the transition so I wish
man click little thing so kind of funny
but you can do the different things like
you just test and you say like this is
in basically those were your things
on your on your uh sorry I look that was
the pictures that are going across your
boss paper and you're going to see so
you know you can definitely just
experiment with that i'm not going to
mask fit and then there's a lot of
different things that can change the cal
path to change how fast like you want it
to go every like 30 seconds for every 10
or whatever she kinda pins out the line
cranked up a little bit and then there's
just lots of different things but
basically that's it um so once you're
done just hit home button and here we go
so you see here I have just one of the
generic ones but now if you watch for
just a few seconds you see there you go
changes definitely a very cool thing of
course it's not for everybody um you
know and you see you can add your own
pictures and do all that kind of stuff i
like it just because it really doesn't
seem to be that much of a resource drain
um I mean I really can't notice that big
of a difference I mean you still scroll
through fine and everything um it's
definitely really cool application
recommend guys check it out boss paper
I'm totally free get in big boss repo
test it out a lot of different things
you can you know edit and mess around
with the options and just cut it figured
out not to mention you can download
packs and even add your own pictures
alright guys that's just bet it just a
real quick video showing you this
