got some of the coolest gaming tech
under $50 to start with we have the NES
30 and the SNES 30 now these are
Bluetooth controllers that happen to
bear just a little bit of a resemblance
to a certain classic Nintendo console
the cool thing about this is that it
supports iOS Android Windows Mac for
machining in fact examples are iPhone i
touch ipad Samsung Note 2 Galaxy series
android pad personal favorite Windows XP
Vista Windows 7 Windows 8 cetera oh wow
that uh that looks like a Super Nintendo
controller instead of having a wire we
have just a micro USB port so if you
want charge this guy you can but
otherwise you do everything over
Bluetooth you know I gotta say like they
really nailed the feel of this like the
buttons are even like concave and convex
effect actually it's a little bit more
placated in the original after Super
Nintendo was too new for you there's
also an nes option wow that's actually
kind of cool so you just kind of post
your phone up right here get that
Bluetooth action there shoot kind of
nice come on come on no no no ah
all right let's look at the control it
was good it was there's a little bit of
user error now if you're not down with
phone gaming you can also pick up these
wireless adapters for the original NES
and SNES men yes as I was done son
wirelessly next up is something you
usually don't find for $50 an actual
projector there's not even a brand name
on this it literally just says LED
projector so even though the actual
resolution of this is 320 by 240 you can
plug in pretty much anything HDMI and
will be able to display it so if you
don't have something new with HDMI such
as an SNES you could plug it in with
this guy although this definitely looks
broken
cut some nuts oh there is a built-in UI
if you want to load media on to the
projector itself but it's pretty
painfully slow you can scale the display
up to 60 inches and it's actually not
terrible it is a bit on the dim side but
for 50 dollars it's hard to complain the
biggest raw bag is that 320 by 240
resolution for older games this actually
isn't that big of a problem but connect
something newer over HDMI and text
quickly becomes a blurry mess it's a
little bit better when you're watching
video but this definitely isn't team
Krispy approved this absolutely won't
hold up to a higher end projector
this portable and cheap but really isn't
much to complain about the setup is dead
simple especially for retro gaming it
works surprisingly well on the PC gaming
side I've got you covered too so for
fifty dollars you can get either a
gaming mouse or mechanical keyboard so
this is the Razer DeathAdder Mouse and
for under $50 well you don't get a lot
you get a mouse
the Death Adder has been around for a
few years but there's really not much to
complain about it has a 6400 dpi sensor
and that grip is no joke this is a
really ergonomic Mouse unlike most Razer
products the led treatment is a little
more subtle although there is a full RGB
option if you'd like to go just a bit
above the $50 budget so this is the red
dragon kumara keyboard and not only is
it mechanical for less than 50 dollars
but it's also got LEDs the switches are
supposedly cherry green equivalents and
they feel solid unless you're a serious
mechanical keyboard fan you'd be
hard-pressed to notice a big difference
in quality it also has red backlighting
which you can adjust it's definitely
more on the gamer side as far as well
let's go especially with that font but
once you get used to a backlit keyboard
it's hard to go back for $40 this is a
great upgrade over a cheaper membrane
keyboard and of course no gaming setup
is complete without fallout monopoly no
no no easy to play God for you as always
