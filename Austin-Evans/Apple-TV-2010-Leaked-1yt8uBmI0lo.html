you better get rid of that Apple TV this
the google just blew you a the water
okay I take it back hey guys so we just
got a lot of news on the next Apple TV
and from what we hear it's actually
going to be pretty impressive so in
gadget got a full leak on let someone
tipped them off about it and then they
talk to one of their Apple sources who
confirmed it so it looks pretty solid
engadget usually doesn't help didn't get
it's usually pretty dead-on anyway guys
so this is actually I like this a lot
basically the next Apple TV one sign up
one sense is going to be an iphone
without a screen to choke up to your TV
so basically what we've heard is that
it's going to be basically you take very
similar to the iphone 4 I can force you
ever the next iPhone is going to have
very similar it's going to have 16 gigs
of stores just like on in it's going to
have the same apple a4 processor and
it's also going to be very similar in
size guys it's not going to be you know
like an apple TV like a normal set top
box literally guys it's going to be
about the size of an iphone I imagine
don't be just a little bit bigger it'll
probably still very small on the only
ports that are going to be on it is just
a power port and you can also go ahead
and hook it up i'm sure hdmi out or some
sort of video out on how they might have
a dongle where you plug in it to one and
then you might have three different
things on the other side we don't know
that yet but any rate it's going to be
very very small very similarly to the
Google TV Apple TV will be running the
iphone OS which makes sense considering
that it should be running almost just
identical iphone hardware um now you
might be wondering oh wait a minute why
doesn't this you know I iphone hardware
that's gonna be able to handle you know
high definition video well apparently it
is they said that it will run full 1080p
video no problem which that's actually
pretty impressive considering that you
know it's just based on the phone notnot
ton most phones are getting to where
they can run you know so 20 p video but
not 1080p so that's that's pretty
impressive now the next thing and this
is this could be potentially
big is that they're going to be putting
a lot of emphasis on cloud storage which
I think they're going to have to
consider gets only got 16 gigabytes um
basically what they're saying is that
they're really going to try to bundle in
with the new cloud storage and of course
we don't know exactly what that means if
you know you have to do it with mobileme
if you know when you buy that happy TV
you get a few gigs free we don't have
any idea how it's going to work but you
know of course that we've seen that they
built that enormous data center and you
know they've been talking a lot about
you know moving everything to the cloud
more like online data storage so we'll
just have to see how that plays out now
of course considering that it is running
the iphone the West there's a pretty
good chance they will go ahead and be
able to run iphone apps person larly to
how the google TV can run android apps
that don't rely on things such as the
accelerometer or other things that you
obviously couldn't do with your TV now
this is not confirmed this is just
speculation but it does make sense I
mean if it's running the iphone OS it
very least you by expected we will see
some apple TV specific apps you might
not be able to take me on pandora and
other apps like that that are specially
made for you know the iphone / butts
considering it's running the iphone OS i
really find it difficult to play that we
would never have any apps on it at all
so guys that's you know a rundown of
everything now here guys I think this
has got to be the clincher now
engagement was very firm about this so I
mean personally I don't I wouldn't
believe that they hadn't been so far
about it but they had so on they say
that the price will be ninety nine
dollars on that's that's pretty good
guys that's pretty good i'm not gonna
lie i mean you consider it's got
basically the full specs of an iphone
you know it's going to be running of
course you know the full apple a4
processor is going to have 16 gigabytes
of storage it's also going to be a lot
guy that much there's probably I mean I
phone sighs maybe a little bit taller
maybe just a little bit bigger but I
mean nothing compared to know what
you've seen you know like a Apple TV
that you would go by today see you guys
that's all we know about the Apple TV it
looks really solid guys ninety nine
dollars is the main thing that I'm
taking away from
this I mean that's a really really solid
price point and I mean considering that
you're going to be getting basically
full iphone hardware on the should be
capable running apps maybe not all the
iphone app supports but it lays apple TV
specific apps you'll be having the full
a4 processor which should be able to do
code 1080p video and somehow going to
get a cloud-based storage maybe that's
what I make them money maybe they'll
give you the hardware for super cheap
and then make pay a lot for the
cloud-based storage we don't know but
guys I gotta admit the Apple TV looks
really really solid</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
