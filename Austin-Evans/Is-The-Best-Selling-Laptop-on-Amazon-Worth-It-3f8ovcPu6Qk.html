took a look at this the $350 Acer Aspire
a 15 which just so happens to be the
best-selling laptop on Amazon but for
350 bucks what are you actually getting
but first glance it doesn't look all
that special so 350 dollars you're
getting plastic on plastic with a side
of plastic nowhere is this more obvious
than the screen which flexes well a lot
with just a little bit of pressure
however if you can look past a few of
these smaller nitpicks
you'll find that this is actually a
surprisingly solid laptop what really
makes this guy stand out is the level of
specs and features that you're getting
for the price so inside you're getting a
seventh generation Intel Core i3 7100
you processor four gigabytes of RAM as
well as a one terabyte hard drive
definitely the slowest part is going to
be the hard drive it's 2018 and you know
SSDs are a thing however what really
helps to save this laptop is the core i3
this is going to be a lot more powerful
than pretty much any other laptop in
this price point luckily it's really
easy to upgrade this guy so remove three
screws on the bottom of the laptop you
get access to now your hard drive but
also to your memory as well as to
install a full m2 SSD and it just so
happens that I have an m2 SSD right here
so for like forty five dollars you can
get this eight eight a hundred twenty
eight gig drive which once you install
into this is going to make a huge
difference if you've never installed an
m2 drive before it's about as easy as it
gets so remove this single screw from
the bottom and then all these do is line
it up with the slot make sure it's fully
inserted and then we take that same
screw and use it to hold it into place
now well 128 gig drive might not sound
too impressive the idea here is that
this is going to be enough to install
Windows as well as a few games and apps
but you still have your full one
terabyte hard drive which means that
you're gonna have over a terabyte of
capacity inside the laptop and if you
want to get even crazier you can remove
the optical drive to install yet another
Drive inside I said the word drive a lot
but hopefully you get the idea something
else I was able to pick up for just over
$40.00 is another four gigabytes of RAM
now this is okay as is but especially if
you want to get into anything like
gaming or just want more than four gigs
of ram for like you know six or seven
chrome tabs this is gonna be really
helpful and again super simple to
upgrade you can literally do all this
stuff in like 10 minutes and so with
that we have eight gigabytes of RAM a
120 gig SSD
and an upgraded 440 dollar laptop but is
it actually any good with these upgrades
we're ready for a bit of gaming and
starting out we have csgo
now with integrated intel graphics you
should expect a ton I should really turn
my volume down so running on low
settings at 900 P we're actually getting
solid frame rates so we're anywhere
between 50 to 80 frames per seconds now
it's not going to be a perfect csgo
experience but this is not a bad little
gaming laptop next up we have fortnight
now this is the game that actually
scales pretty well to lower end hardware
here at 720p on low settings we are
getting between 30 to 40 frames per
second so don't get me wrong this is not
a gaming PC go over especially with that
core i3 in that dual channel memory it's
not going to be too bad as long as you
keep your expectations in check some
lighter titles are definitely going to
be playable I've actually got to say I
don't really ever play Fortnight but
this does really scale nicely I mean
yeah we're getting 35 40 frames per
second here but on such a low-end laptop
it's not bad at all
next up we have rocket League another
game that traditionally runs pretty well
on low-end hardware and here at 900p on
performance settings we're getting
anywhere between 40 to 50 frames per
second it's not bad which I know I keep
saying but when you consider just how
cheap this laptop is even with the
upgrades
I'm impressed it how much it doesn't
suck this laptop is definitely useful
for more than just gaming though so it's
rocking a 15.6 inch 1080p panel now it
is going to be TN so you're going to be
sacrificing some color and especially
some viewing angles but when you
consider that this guy cost $350 stock
the screen is much much better than you
usually get I can't tell you how many
laptops that looked at that cost much
more than this with much much worse
screens something you don't exactly see
on laptops very often these days is an
optical drive but this does have it in
addition to a USB 2.0 port but more
importantly on this side we're going to
be getting two more USB threes HDMI
weirdly enough there's a VGA port but
then you get Ethernet as well as a USB
type-c the keyboard is classic Acer so
that's a good thing for the most part
you're getting a pretty standard layout
with a couple of odd additions but you
do get the number Rho and 4-3 and $50
it's pretty impressive that actually
does have a backlight it's not a super
bright backlight but again that's not
something you usually find at a budget
laptop you're also going to be getting a
Windows
Trackpad it's pretty solid you're
getting full support for the multi-touch
gestures and thankfully like all of
these precision track pads it does
actually track much much more accurately
than a lot of the third-party options
it's almost like there's a lot of things
on this laptop they're shared with much
more expensive options
I sense a trend here battery life is
going to be pretty solid so especially
thanks to that core i3 inside you should
expect somewhere in the neighborhood of
about eight hours of light use on a
charge if you upgrade with an SSD and
install windows on it that's probably
going to make things even better so for
three and fifty dollars is the Acer
Aspire 815 worth it I've got to say it
totally is I see why everyone on Amazon
is buying these now I will say though
that if you do pick one up I think it is
well worth it to spend a little bit of
extra money to upgrade with an SSD and
more memory but regardless if you're
wanting to pick up a cheap laptop this
is a solid option and as always links to
this as well as the upgrades I used for
it will be in the description anyway
guys thank you so much for watching and
I will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
