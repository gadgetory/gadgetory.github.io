the video going over the new iphone so
yeah we've been hearing about a new
iphone ever since the iphone 4s came out
over now that we're getting fairly close
to the launch we got a lot of new
information so let's just jump right on
in the biggest feature on the new iphone
is going to be a 4-inch display now as
i'm sure most of you guys know the
current iphone 4s has the exact same 3.5
inch size display as the original iphone
from 2007 go back in two thousand seven
a 3.5 inch display was pretty massive
these days 4.7 inches is pretty much
becoming the norm and a lot of phones
are even over 5 inches according to 925
Matt the next iPhone will have a 3.9 5
inch display with resolution of 11 36 x
640 now that's a very rude resolution
and the kind of a weird screen size but
actually does make a lot of sense if you
do the math with this equates to is an
extra row of icons so basically this
will be the exact same width screen all
would be is they would be adding a
little bit to the top to make it a
little bit taller so for example the
aspect ratio would be a little bit more
like 16 by 9 AK widescreen what you're
watching on your on youtube right now it
also have the same pixel density in
width meaning that any app is currently
working on the iphone will easily be
able to be brought over with just a
little bit of letterboxing iOS 6 is also
going to be designed for the new iphone
with an additional row of icons on the
very top of the screen as well as some
various different tweaks as far as
making the different applications better
work with the larger display the
hardware the iphone is also likely going
to be totally redesigned so there are
all kinds of different rumors and
speculation on what it could look like
so some people have said it's going to
look like the macbook air and kind of
have a taper others say it's going to be
all curved and all kinds of stuff
honestly i'm not really going to take a
lot of speculation on what exactly it's
going to look like hopefully it's gonna
be a little bit thinner I definitely do
believe that will be totally different
from our current iPhone but beyond that
who knows internally I expected to come
with an apple a6 dual-core processor and
while quad-core is definitely an option
I really don't see this happening for
one most iOS apps barely take advantage
of two cores much less for on top of
that the right shows some really awesome
dual core parts right now such as what
you find in the ATT version of the HTC
One X which I just reviewed so internal
I expect it to be very similar probably
going to be clutch around 1.5 gigahertz
it'll also be packed with a nice GPU and
a full gigabyte of RAM I think LTE is
definitely going to be a given on the
new iphone so put
all carriers around the world right now
or either working on their LTE network
or at least have it one plan in the
future and since you know of course LTE
gives you some awesome awesome speeds I
would be extremely extremely surprised
if we do not see LTE on the new iphone I
wouldn't be surprised to see the new
iphone come with the same 8-megapixel
camera from the iphone 4s well they're
definitely some better cameras coming
with 10 and 12 megapixels and wider
apertures but overall I still think the
iphone 4s has one of the best cameras
out there and while they may tweak you a
little bit for the new iphone overall i
wouldn't expect any major changes here
it would also be nice if Apple improves
the front facing camera mother iphone
now I'll share the current FaceTime vga
camera is not terrible we wouldn't be so
bad to get a 1.3 megapixel camera maybe
with like 720p video I mean come on it
would cost like an extra 50 Cent's i'll
pay an extra 50 Cent's like if you
charge me two hundred dollars and fifty
cents for the upgrade front-facing
camera i will pay that Apple flow yeah
or you can just not charge me extra
fifty cents that's okay too the new
iphone will most likely come out in
september-october so of course the
iphone 4s was announced last october i
think at that time frame is kind of the
new yearly tradition where Apple is
going to release a new iphone also you
guys have probably heard me say the name
the new iphone quite a few times during
this video sent just because of some
random placeholder name that's actually
what I expect it will be called of
course with the new iPad which you know
I still called the ipad 3 but Apple
officially calls it the new iPad and I
would be pretty surprised if they do not
call the new iphone the new iphone see
how that works anyway guys I'm very
curious to know what do you think about
the new iphone sure live you guys are
going to have some great opinions on
whether you think it's amazing or
terrible because I don't think anything
can be the middle it's got to be amazing
you're terrible anyway guys we have any
thoughts or comments feel free to leave
