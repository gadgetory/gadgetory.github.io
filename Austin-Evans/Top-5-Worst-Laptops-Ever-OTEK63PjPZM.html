an interesting question what is the
worst laptop ever so of course there are
lots of ways to be a bad laptop so you
could have a bad track pad screen
keyboard price battery life lots and
lots of things can make and otherwise
good laptop not so good but to be the
worst laptop ever well that one got me
thinking going over the last 25 years of
laptops throw a lot of them that stand
out so some of these are way too
expensive some of these are way too big
and heavy and some of these just
flat-out don't work so let's go over the
top 5 worst laptops ever starting off at
number 5 we have the Apple Macintosh
portable from 1989 now it might seem
weird to include the grandfather of the
modern-day MacBook in the worst laptops
ever but take one look at this one and I
think you'll agree with me the big issue
here was that the Macintosh portable
well it was the Macintosh portable as
this thing was over 16 pounds and well
over 4 inches thick
now of course inside it was actually
fairly decent for the time it has a 16
megahertz motorola processor and one
megabyte of RAM however all that didn't
help it from being absolutely massive as
it was basically a normal Mac from the
time kind of cramped into a portable
form factor another major problem is
that it's powered by a lead acid battery
the same kind of battery you'll find in
your car now this didn't work too well
for a laptop is if you ever actually
depleted the battery to 0%
it was totally dead to make it even
worse if you tried to plug it in and use
it just off the AC adapter it wasn't
powerful enough to actually run the then
pretty powerful hardware so a couple all
this with the giant $6,500 price tag and
the Mac portable really wasn't so
portable after all at number four we
have the IBM ThinkPad trans note from
2001 now the big problem with this one
was actually that it was way ahead of
its time so on one hand you had what was
basically a normal laptop so you had a
Pentium 3 processor windows 98 and
actually a fairly impressive 10.4 inch
touchscreen where I ran into issues is
the pin really wasn't all that
comfortable to use as it was much larger
than a normal sized pin and on top of
that when you ran out of ink you
actually had to buy the ink cartridges
straight from IBM on top of that the
entire thing was absolutely massive and
with a $3,000 price tag it didn't last
too long at number three we had the Sony
Vaio P from 2009 now this was back when
netbooks were really big so I imagine
Sony engineers said hey look we can do
way
better than that and by better they
meant way smaller the screen itself
wasn't bad it was an 8 inch display with
a resolution of 1600 by 768 which
actually is better than some 7 inch and
8 inch tablets today however where it
came into problems was the fact that the
Intel Atom processor that was powering
it was way too weak to actually handle
that resolution and on top of that that
resolution was really really small with
Windows XP on an 8 inch display it was
very hard to see much of anything that
you were doing on top of that it had a
tiny little keyboard and absolutely no
trackpad or touchscreen so all the
navigation you did was with a little
tiny nub in the middle of the keyboard
combine this with a 900 Allah price and
it didn't last too long although funnily
enough you can actually still find them
brand new on Amazon at number 2 we have
the zenith mini sport from 1989 now this
was actually a great idea and again
something that was ahead of its time
basically this was one of the various
first Ultra portables now of course
taking a look at it today it really
wasn't all that ultra portable but
compared to laptops of the time
especially like the Macintosh portable
it was actually a lot smaller when it
ran into problems was the fact that it
relies on two inch floppy disks now if
you never heard of these before there's
a good reason they absolutely flopped
and it costing over $8 per floppy was
way way too much money for people to
spend so because of this it was very
difficult to get any kind of programs or
in fact do a whole lot of anything on
this laptop the operating system was
also saved on a ram disk which meant
that if the battery ever went out you
had to go into the BIOS and reset it up
to be even able to boot the computer
combined all this with a $2,800 price
tag and it's no wonder that we don't
hear about Zenith anymore coming in at
number one our 2004 to 2006 Dell laptops
now there are actually a lot of laptops
4,000,000 in fact and the reason why
they get number one is because they
exploded back in 2006 at Japanese
business man's Dell laptop actually
burst into flames in the middle of a
conference room the internet lit up with
stories about Dell laptops lighting on
fire and because of this Dell was forced
to recall over 4 million of their
laptops in the end the Dell laptops
which actually caught on fire and could
actually hurt and/or kill you take the
top prize in the worst laptop of all
time anyway that's about it if you
enjoyed definitely be sure to check out
my what to expect on the upcoming
Samsung Galaxy s4 and if you enjoyed be
sure to leave this video a thumbs up and
subscribe anyway guys I will catch you
next time
