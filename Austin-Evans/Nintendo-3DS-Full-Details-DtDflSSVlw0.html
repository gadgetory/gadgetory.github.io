just finished up guys and I gotta say
they did a fantastic job probably the
best keynotes I've ever seen they were
it was only about an hour and 15 minutes
but man guys they will crammed full of
huge announcements they have all sorts
of big games they have everything from a
Zelda game they have a new Donkey Kong
game to have Goldeneye they have I mean
guys they were just the new Metroid game
there was even a new mickey mouse game
guys they were just loading it full of
some pretty cool-looking games but guys
undoubtedly the star of the show was the
Nintendo 3ds yes guys it is the Nintendo
3ds um so guys I'm gonna go ahead and
tell you about it if you've heard a lot
of the rumors that most of them were
true actually made a video just a little
while ago almost all that stuff ended up
coming true but there's some more really
cool things guys the first thing and one
of the more surprising things was that
the three yes does not have one camera
it does not have two cameras guys the
3ds has three cameras so cuz I'll be
showing you guys my DSi here it kind of
to give you guys a good sense of what
looks like I will also be showing
pictures as well so guys um so you see
the DSi obviously it has one camera on
the outside well with the 3ds it has two
cameras the reason for this is it takes
3d pictures yeah guys that is actually
really impressive it's one of the first
cameras that I know if actually you can
go ahead and buy and take 3d pictures so
along the bottom you as you guys can see
in this picture here there are two
little cameras we don't know exactly how
big of a bag of resolution and how all
it will work but it does look like it
will take 3d pictures which you can
obviously view on your 3ds I'm so guys
looking at the outside of design it is
pretty impressive I mean it's very sleek
and smooth it looks like it's going to
be a little bit bigger than the standard
DS and it does it is very similar in the
fact that you know it opens and closes
and it does have two screens
let's guys let's go ahead and open up my
DSi and just trying to talk a little bit
about how this works guys there are a
lot of things going on on the 3ds now
the top screen is wide screen is a 3.5
inch 3d display so the bottom screen
stays the same but this one probably
will come out to bat like this as you
see in this picture here but guys it has
got a really kind of well guys I'm not
hugely a big fan of the new kind of
design as far as the colors the inside
looks a little bit busy to be honest but
I'll go ahead and run you guys through
it there are quite a few new things so
guys the first thing is the top is
mostly the same it does have a camera
above the 3d screen kind of like a
webcam almost and then on the on the
right side there's a little switch and
basically what you can do is you can
turn up and down the 3d effect so you
can turn it all the way off or you can
turn it all the way up I guess that's
just you know for people who might not
be able to you know watch 3d and I get a
little sick or something so that's to
have a nice thing now moving down to the
bottom guys there are quite a few new
things it actually looks a little bit
busy to my taste but you know whatever
so guys coming through the left you will
still have your d-pad power button is no
longer there but the main thing is there
is now an analog stick guys this one
looks to be like a pretty decent sized
one
so guys you can go ahead and just like I
hope they don't run into the same
problems that the PSP had with only one
analog stick but it's not that big a
deal one thing I did know though is that
the analog stick is right above the
d-pad so it might be a little awkward it
doesn't like you can use both of them at
the same time for you're trying to walk
and you know use one to strafe and one
to walk or something like that just kind
of something I noticed you know the
buttons on the right side are just the
same you go ahead and you have your X
your Y your a and your B all the buttons
from the standard DS have come over I'm
guys I have it's the touch feels a
little bit odd on it is the same about
the same size but now that her buttons
beneath it so guys it's it looks a
little bit almost like the original yet
you know the touch screen is very raised
and it's very contoured it's a big step
away from the standard D s and the DSi
what they look like guys so there is a
lot more they have a lot more controls
in addition to the buttons there are
emotion controls so just the standard
which you find like an iPod Touch or an
iPhone but there's also a gyroscope so
it should be very very precise and go
ahead and move it left to right up and
down walk around with
and we'll be able to sense all that it's
very impressive guys another thing is
that it is fully compatible with these
games as I'm sure you everyone has said
this and it's not a big surprise but yes
guys all your DS games should work 100%
fine so guys I'm kind of jumping back
and forth here it just finished up you
know another cool thing is that it will
be able to on the screen you will be
able to watch 3d movies
so guys you actually you know instead of
spending you know thousands of dollars
on these you know brand-new 3d TVs you
go ahead and buy yourself a 3ds watch
that watch it on your you know your
small screen you'll be hundreds good
it's really pretty cool so guys now
probably one of the most impressive
things I thought were the graphics guys
the graphics are just as good as we
hoped
you know the resolution of course we
don't know the exact specs the
resolution on the screen didn't look
back great and I'm sure it's a bump up
but it doesn't it didn't look super high
definition but guys the graphics did
look really good I would say just based
off the Kid Icarus video game that they
showed it looked on par with the Wii I
mean that's pretty impressive so guys it
is really really really cool so guys
that's most of it you know they didn't
talk about there are going to be a ton
of games for it
they showed I mean talked about
everything from Metal Gear there's going
to be Resident Evil there's going to be
Assassin's Creed guys that are gonna
have millions of gains on this thing but
unfortunately some of the bigger things
the price and release date were not
mentioned at all so guys we don't know
when it will be out we don't know how
much will be once they do release it so
guys it's a little bit of a
disappointment but if you know if you're
expecting like the Xbox yesterday that
you know it'll be on sale tomorrow
doesn't look like it's gonna happen
looks like I'm guessing probably October
or November before it's going to be
released and hopefully for maybe a
little bit more than the current DSi XL
but guys that's total speculation we
don't know all we do know for sure is
that we'll be out before March of next
year so guys you know take that as you
will we don't know exactly when it will
be out but yeah so guys that's my full
round down of the Nintendo 3ds
it looks really
really cool you know I'm not a huge fan
of how it looks
I think the buttons look a little too
busy and I'm afraid it might be a little
bit dang bit too big I mean I know the
DSi is pretty big as is and it looks
even bigger than that so guys I'm not a
hundred percent soul on it but man
looking at the 3d graphics both and in
the gameplay all everything looks really
solid yeah guys I'm liking it so anyway
guys I will be sure to subscribe if you
haven't already I will be doing lots
more videos about the 3ds as we get more
information in addition to all sorts of
other tech stuff so yeah hey guys thanks
