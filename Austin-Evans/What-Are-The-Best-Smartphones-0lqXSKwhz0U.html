here with my favorite smartphones so I
get asked about this all the time people
want to know is the HTC one better than
galaxy s4 why should they switch from an
iPhone what has the best camera etc etc
etc and while for 100% sure there is no
such thing as a perfect phone what might
be great for me you might be terrible
for you but overall there are a lot of
phones that are actually really really
good to start with we have the Samsung
Galaxy Note 2 now the first thing you've
got to know about this phone is that it
is massive I can't tell you how many
times people came up to me in public and
asked is that an actual phone now the
thing is yes it is big it does have a
5.5 inch screen which is much much
bigger than even something like a galaxy
s4 and HTC One and way way bigger than
anything on the iPhone however there are
advantages to having a really big screen
for starters of course you have a lot
more screen real estate for movies and
music and productivity all that kind of
stuff it is kind of nice being able to
watch for example a YouTube video on
that massive screen the main reason it's
on this list though is because of the
battery life but simply it is absolutely
awesome and probably one of the best
phones I've ever tested so even under
the longest days where I'm just
constantly on the phone taking pictures
tweeting going to email even playing
games I still was never able to actually
kill the note to in a single day now
that is not something I've been able to
say about any other phone out there so
if you really need the phone then it
only has a nice big screen it also has a
massive battery that can last you easily
through a full day of use definitely
check out the Galaxy Note 2 next up we
have the LG Nexus 4 now this is another
phone that are reviewed late last year
and in fact if you want any more
information about any of the phones I'm
talking about I've done more in-depth
videos on them also you can check out
the annotations as well as the links in
the description but the Nexus 4 is kind
of special for a couple reasons
for starters since it is a Nexus device
that means it gets all of its updates
straight from Google now that means a
couple things for starters you're going
to be using pure unscanned version of
Android which means that you don't have
to worry about having like some kind of
iffy skin which can definitely come on
some of these phones as well as you're
going to be getting updates straight
from Google so you're always going to be
on the cutting edge of Android on top of
that it's actually a very cheap phone
you can actually pick it up for only
$300 off contract and compare that to
something like the galaxy s4 which is
over double the price off contract and
the Nexus 4 is a really really solid
deal next up we have the Apple iPhone 5
now the apples always done a fantastic
job of making phones I mean obviously
the iPhone is pretty popular if you
hadn't noticed in the iPhone 5 is no
exception so for starters the design and
build quality are absolutely top-notch I
mean just spend a couple minutes playing
with the iPhone 5 and you'll feel just
how nicely designed it is a little tiny
machined edges the glass as well as the
aluminum kind of all wrapped up together
it's actually a very nice phone to use
and a very nice phone to actually hold
although of course most people are prod
just going to take this beautiful design
throw a $2 case on it and call it a day
but regardless is definitely very nicely
designed on top of that also does have
other good features including a very
impressive camera not quite up to par
with some of the other cameras I'm going
to be talking about some of the other
phones here in a minute but still a very
good 8 megapixel camera with both stills
as well as video and of course it is
running iOS so a lot of people use it
obviously and for the most part it's a
solid operating system sure there are
some issues here and there and is
getting just a little bit outdated
however iOS 7 should be coming out here
very soon and with the rumors are true
should actually be doing a lot to kind
of improve the way the iPhone looks and
feels so put all this together and what
you get is a very very solid package
moving on we have the Samsung Galaxy s4
now there are a couple reasons why you
want to go with this over something else
so for starters it is running the latest
version of Android but it does have
TouchWiz on top which adds tons of new
features to the phone so some of them
are definitely gimmicky however they're
just so many different cool things that
you can actually do with the phone the
more likely there's at least a couple
things that you'll be using yourself so
for example you can actually take your
hand and wave it over the screen without
actually touching it to take a call you
can run multiple apps on the screen at
one time you can take pictures or video
with both the rear and front facing
camera at the same time the list goes on
and on and on it also has an
awesome-looking 5 inch 1080p screen
however since it is made of plastic that
does mean that it doesn't feel quite as
nice is something that the HTC One of
the iPhone 5 however on the flip side
you can remove the back panel just swap
out the battery as well as atom micro
d card now probably my favorite features
of the galaxy s4 is actually the camera
it's got a 13 megapixel shooter and it
takes awesome pictures so for a phone
especially they're nice and rich and
detailed brings in lots of color and
there's even a decent amount of depth of
field so for a phone when it's really
really impressive and overall the galaxy
s4 as a phone is a very very good choice
for pretty much anybody last but not
least we have the HTC One now this is a
fantastic Android smartphone in fact I
like it so much that I went out and
bought myself one so there are a few
reasons why I'd recommend someone to
pick up the HTC One for starters it has
some fantastic build quality so like I
was saying with the iPhone 5 it's not a
big deal if you just throw a case on
your phone however of course being able
to be totally made out of aluminum
definitely does help with drops and that
kind of stuff but for the most part the
HTC One just feels nice to hold it's got
a little bit of a contour on the back so
it fits well in your hand and because it
is made out of metal it really just does
feel a little bit nicer than pretty much
any other phone that I've ever tried
it's also got boomsound now I know that
sounds like some really dumb marketing
gimmick but it actually is really legit
so basically what boom sound is is a
pair of front-facing speakers on the
obviously front of the phone now this
makes a really big difference and
actually surprisingly it's probably one
of my favorite features of the phone is
it actually sounds good it's loud enough
to fill an entire room with some pretty
decently loud music as well as actually
giving you some good bass and of course
with two speakers you actually get a
little bit of a stereo effect which is
kind of nice for watching videos
especially movies and stuff it actually
sounds really impressive the camera is
also good so it has a four ultrapixel
camera which basically are the same
thing as normal megapixels however each
pixel is just a little bit bigger
allowing it to pull in a lot more light
so thanks to that as well as the optical
image stabilization again a bunch of
geeky jerk and that you probably don't
need to care about but the main point is
this thing takes some really nice lower
light pictures so of course that's
always been a really big disadvantage of
using a phone camera is as soon as the
lights go down it kind of gets dark he
just takes awful pictures out of the HTC
One actually does a really good job of
keeping up put it all together with what
is probably the best screen on a phone
out there as well as cool little
features like being able to actually
control your TV straight from the phone
and overall the HTC One is
totally an awesome phone that would
really recommend it basically anybody
honorable mentions go to the BlackBerry
z10 which well really doesn't quite
match up to the phones I talked about
here today is still a pretty decent
phone especially if you're coming from a
current BlackBerry as well as the Nokia
Lumia 920 which is a bit of a brick of a
phone I will give it that however if you
do want to use Windows Phone it's a
pretty solid phone to go with and it
does have a fantastic 8 megapixel camera
so now it's your turn if you're going to
buy a smart phone today and you had to
use it over the next couple years what
would you pay definitely be sure to let
me know what you think in the comments
