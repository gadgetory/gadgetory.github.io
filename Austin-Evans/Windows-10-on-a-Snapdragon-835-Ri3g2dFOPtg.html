Google pixel - one of the most advanced
smartphones on sale today and it's
powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835
processor now this laptop beside me is
also powered by that same mobile
processor and that actually is kind of a
big deal
you guys might remember the original
Microsoft Surface now it was powered by
Windows RT a specific version of Windows
8 that was meant to run on ARM
processors which are typically found in
your phone now there are some advantages
here mostly with battery life but also
some smaller things like being able to
have quicker standby time however the
biggest issue was was that it didn't run
normal Windows apps which as you guys
might know it's kind of important for a
Windows computer now yes you could run
stuff in the Windows Store but well no
one wants to do that however on the
surface this looks to be a much better
execution of that whole idea and yes I
said surface that was a bad joke wasn't
it so this is the HP Envy x2 the very
first and the next generation of Windows
PCs that are going to be powered by
Snapdragon processors and what makes
these interesting is they actually do
run Windows apps which is very important
although it is with some caveats
but with promises of 20 plus hours of
battery life it might be worth the
trade-off take a look at the specs and
it's going to look a little bit
different so it's powered by that
Snapdragon 835 and it's backed up with
four gigs of RAM and 128 gigs of storage
you know the almost identical spec that
you would find on a smartphone what
makes this kind of interesting is that
even though it is in a tablet form
factor a lot of these Snapdragon PCs are
going to be full-fledged laptops but
because it's being powered by a phone
processor as you can imagine it's going
to be a little bit thinner a little bit
quieter or well a lot quieter than
pretty much any other laptop out there
and so we see how to navigate the
Windows Start screen which is useful as
well as a bit of foam
well the real store this show is the
laptop and wow that's super super thin
wow that actually looks pretty cool so
this is very similar to something like
the surface and the idea that for which
everything is going to be in the tablet
section but it does come with a keyboard
which should be right
so this is a little bit of a different
design so it's almost more like a case
for the laptop which just happens to
have your keyboard as well as the
trackpad but when you actually put the
whole thing together snaps on here and
then I think we can just pull it back
yeah so we get a an adjustable kickstand
and yeah that uh that kind of looks like
a surface also included is going to be a
stylus again kind of similar to the
surface although the surface sectioning
you think comes with the stylus anymore
but as you expect or something like this
it is going to be a full touchscreen
device and that looks again exactly like
the surface last but not least you're
also going to be getting the power cable
which thankfully is going to be USB C
sorry not last but not least there's
also a USB see the USB a dongle does
this actually haven't USB ports that
would be a no okay so this PC is going
to be a little bit different from most
no again the Snapdragon PCs will be
available in normal sort of laptop form
factors now once you actually get into
Windows you'll find it well it looks
exactly like Windows 10 now it does have
some limitations because it is using a
Snapdragon processor but on the other
hand one of the big advantages here is
that we actually do have built in LTE so
if I slide a SIM card in here what we're
getting here is essentially well exactly
what you would expect with your smart
phone that is because the Snapdragon 835
has LTE and all the radios and stuff
built in it's as simple as adding a
couple antenna putting a SIM card slot
and you have a PC that in theory can be
completely connected all the time at
least when it comes to initial
impressions the performance is pretty
good on this guy just normal day-to-day
stuff feels snappy this guy's ships
running Windows 10s now that's fine but
I think pretty much everyone is going to
want to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro which
is going to allow you to run third-party
apps that are from outside the Windows
Store now the issue here is though while
this will run most apps it's not going
to run everything it needs to be at the
very least in x86 app so no 64-bit stuff
and as far as driver support essentially
doesn't support standard Windows drivers
you do need to get specific arm drivers
which at this point are basically
non-existent however for most games most
apps most programs they're at least
going to work somewhat on here out of
the box benchmarking the NV is going to
be a little bit difficult so while it
will run standard Windows
that are x86-based such as Geekbench for
the issue is running it in a
compatibility mode now it means that it
will work but you're not going to be
getting that full performance and you
can see that in numbers so take a look
at the scores compared to a Snapdragon
835 phone which is running on native
code you're seeing that you're getting a
little bit less than half the standard
performance it's fine but you do notice
a slowdown but keep in mind that that's
running in the x86 compatibility mode
basically the lowest performance option
that you can get on this computer if an
app such as Geekbench is recompiled with
Snapdragon in mind you're probably going
to be getting much more similar
performance though what you actually get
on android however all that being said
you have to keep in mind that while it's
not gonna be crazy high-end you're
getting pretty decent specs here I mean
that's Snapdragon 835 is going to give
you eight cores four gigs of ram it's no
slouch one area this is really
noticeable is when it comes to browsers
so Microsoft edge is natively compiled
to work specifically on Snapdragon
processors so you're on the web
everything feels snappy it feels pretty
much one-to-one like it would on your
phone or pretty much any other laptop
however download a third-party browser
such as Chrome or opera and things are
noticeably slower rather quick
JavaScript benchmark like octane 2.0 and
you can see that edge absolutely
destroys the opera's performance now
part of that is of course due to the
fact that there's some slight
differences between how edge and opera
perform but running in that
compatibility mode while it will get an
app to actually run on this guy really
does mean it's going to take a big hit
to the performance for me the difference
is enough that I would rather use edge
over any kind of third-party browser
think even beyond the benchmarks you're
really gonna get something that is going
to be nosily slower when you do install
something like Chrome or opera that just
wasn't designed with this in mind it
works but just not very fast but we do
have the compatibility mode for a reason
and in theory games will work although
the idea of how well they work is
probably a little bit questionable when
you consider that this is a phone
processor running an emulator for
Windows apps that is yeah let's just try
it first up I want to give csgo a try as
a slightly older game it has the best
chance of actually being able to run on
such a low-end processor again I say
low-end I mean obviously you can play
some pretty nice-looking games on
Android but Windows is a little bit more
challenging your graphics hardware does
not support all the features needed to
run this game okay not a great start
try something else hey okay so next we
have a rocket League and this is a games
that again should in theory be able to
be run on some sort of Snapdragon Class
hardware now the main question though is
how the actual GP drivers are going to
work because I mean this looks like
normal well that's slow it's like slow
rocket League might work though I'm not
really entirely clear on how Microsoft
is getting an x86 Windows app to run
natively on an ARM processor so it seems
like they're doing something to be able
to actually maybe in elated or I don't
know if it's some kind of like
hypervisor or something but this
actually looks like it might work
no what's interesting to me is the idea
that that's totally gonna go in great
good job guys
what's really interesting to me is the
idea that this is definitely something
that can be improved with software
obviously there's going to be a limit on
what a processor like the snapback and
it's capable of but the idea is I'm
actually playing a proper PC game here
fully through emulation or whatever
they're doing to actually make it work
is impressive
although maybe not the greatest
experience in the world next I want to
try a game that actually should run on
Snapdragon the Windows 10 edition of
Minecraft now the big difference between
this and the steam games I was trying
earlier is the idea that the steam games
well they were just never meant to run
this kind of hardware whereas this is
something that actually I believe has
actually been optimized to run an ARM
processor if it hasn't I can't tell
because the performance is pretty much
on point to be fair I don't think anyone
is going to pick up a Snapdragon Power
PC with the intent of turning it into a
gaming computer now there are a few
things to keep in mind first of all this
is the very first system that shipping
so there's almost certainly going to be
some more optimization and the idea this
is going to be a pretty small
lightweight system that is able to
actually do all this emulation is
impressive
however that being said even in standard
apps the performance just isn't as good
as it should be you can definitely tell
the difference between a native app and
something that's going to be emulated
it's good but there's more work to be
done there are definitely some
advantages with going with a Snapdragon
PC though one of the easiest ones to
spot is going into sleep so with an
Intel system usually takes a few seconds
between when you close the lid wait for
it to go to sleep open it up whereas
with this it's like a phone you hit the
power button it goes to sleep hit it
again it wakes up it's much much faster
having built-in LTE is nice as well I
think that's going to be a huge selling
point for a ton of people and all
Snapdragon PCs this as well as some of
the laptops are going
have it ready so what I need to do is
drop a SIM card in and it's going to be
up and running and it's nice to people
they'll be always connected between LTE
and Wi-Fi now that being said I'm
actually not a huge fan of the MVX twos
design in particular for me the tablet
stuff it's nice but it's not that much
smaller than just a normal 13-inch
laptop but thankfully there are going to
be Snapdragon laptops as well probably
the biggest selling point is going to be
the battery life so HP claims up to 22
hours of use on a charge or a thousand
hours of connected standby which for a
PC is totally crazy
now this mostly thanks to the idea that
the Snapdragon processor is usually
found in phones and I mean even
something that's going to be this small
is going to give you a much much larger
battery than any phone will however all
that being said I haven't tested it yet
so I don't know exactly how long it's
going to last but if it gets anywhere
close to those numbers it is going to be
a game-changer a Snapdragon PC makes a
lot of sense for someone who wants an
always connected computer that can run
Windows apps I'll be it a little bit
slowly and has solid battery life now
with the HP Envy x2 it's a good system
but for me it's hard to justify the
thousand dollar price tag it was someone
in the neighborhood of like seven or
eight hundred dollars I think I would be
fine with it but considering that it's
going to be a little bit not optimized
right now it's very expensive and it
doesn't even have the Snapdragon 845 yet
which I'm sure is going to be coming
soon it's kind of hard to recommend that
being said I think there's a lot of
potential and Snapdragon PC's so what do
you guys think let me know in the
comments below I will catch you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
