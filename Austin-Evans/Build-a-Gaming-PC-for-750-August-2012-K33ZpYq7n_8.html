the video going over a 750 dollar gaming
PC so recently I've done a couple videos
so for example today $500 bill which
will allow you to play pretty much any
game you want on medium to high settings
for only about 500 bucks and I've also
done a full tutorial on how to put that
computer together indeed pretty much any
other PC that you want to build
however today we're going to be doing
something just a little bit more
high-end at $750 to kick our build off
we're going to be using an Intel Core i5
2500 K this is one of my favorite CPUs
for gaming is not only is it a quad-core
chip but it's also highly overclockable
so the stock it's gonna come in at about
three point three gigahertz however it
is no problem at all to overclock it to
well over 4 gigahertz which is gonna
give you tons of power for running
pretty much any game you throw at it
while the i5 35 70 K is definitely not a
bad choice I still do prefer the 2500 K
as for the money you really just can't
beat it for about $200 a great start for
a build for CPU cooler we're gonna be
using the cooler master hyper 212 plus
now I've used this in a lot of my gaming
builds in fact I've got one in the
computer right behind me here and the
major reason is is that for the price
you really can't beat it
and when using a processor like the core
i5 which is really overclockable you
have to have some way of dissipating all
that heat and i find the hyper 212 plus
is a great way to go for only about
twenty-five dollars for a graphics card
we're going to be using an EVGA gtx 560
superclocked and while the new gtx 660
are going to be coming out soon that
does not mean anything bad as the 560 is
still an awesome card especially now
that the price has been cut as this is
an overclocked card that means you're
going to have plenty of performance to
handle pretty much any game you throw at
it including battlefield 3 with one
gigabyte of gddr5 memory it's not the
most but it's going to be plenty if
you're only going to be gaming on a
single 1080p monitor but have $50 an
excellent way to go for the motherboard
we're going to be using a gigabyte gaz
77 d3h now I will admit I'm kind of
partial to gigabyte motherboards I use
them myself and most of my builds and
for the most part I find that for the
price they give you plenty of
performance and plenty of features on
top of that they also do come with dual
BIOS which can really be a major life
saver and on top of that you're going to
find quite a few USB 3 ports SATA 3 and
even comes with an M SATA port as this
is a z77 board you have full capability
for overclocking with your 2500 K and if
you decide to upgrade to Ivy Bridge it
will handle that no problem as well
$120 I highly recommend this motherboard
for memory we're going to be using 8
gigabytes of p and whine option
this is the same step that I recently
included in my $500 gaming build well
it's not fancier especial or anything
like that it is a gigabytes of memory
quote to 1333 megahertz so while it's
not going to be amazing or spectacular
have fire or flames or anything cool
it's gonna get the job done it's also
going to be really nice and cheap and
only about $35 for a hard drive we're
going to be using a 500 gigabyte Western
Digital caviar black now the caviar
black is pretty much the standard gaming
harddrive out there
sure you can save a few dollars by
getting something slower but it's really
not going to be worth it now if you need
more storage you can bump this up to a
one terabyte or even a tutor about
caviar black but for this bill we're
just going to be using the 500 gigabyte
version which is going to run you about
$85 for a power supply we're going to be
using the corsair CX 600 with 600 watts
of capacity this is going to be more
than enough to handle the build
including overclocking your graphics
card your cpu as well as just handling
extra hard drives and all that kind of
stuff you'd like to put in there since
it is corsair it means you're going to
get some solid quality and for about $60
it's going to be well worth it for a
case we're going to be using the antique
300 this is another one of those parts
that i'm a really big fan of i think
that's a solid buy for the price and it
has all the features and all of
flexibility and all the kind of good
stuff that you're looking for in a case
if you guys wanted more I of course I
did use it in the $500 build so if you
guys want to follow that tutorial you'll
see that all the cable mint and all that
stuff is going to be the exact same
overall though really saw a case for
about $55 for an optical drive we're
going to be using the sony DVD burner a
little optional if you want to skip it
by all means feel free however in
general I do like to including builds
it's not really going to cost you a
whole lot and it gives you some more
flexibility as far as installing windows
or various different programs however if
you want to ditch it or you want to
upgrade to a blu-ray player by all means
feel free otherwise though this will run
you about $18.00 lastly you may want to
consider picking up a copy of Windows 7
home premium now I didn't do that in
this build is I think that it's probably
a better idea to just wait for Windows 8
however if you don't want to wait you
just want to get an operating system
right now or are you just not a big fan
of Windows 8 meanwhile consider adding
it on and it'll be about a hundred
dollars so you guys have it an awesome
seven hundred dollar gaming build now do
keep in mind the prices are constantly
fluctuating so you may wanna check the
links in the description of this video
to see what the current prices are now
but overall this is gonna be a really
awesome build if you guys want a full
tutorial on how to put together a gaming
PC definitely be sure to check out the
link beside me right now anyway guys I
hope you enjoyed this video and if you
did definitely
should leave this video a thumbs up if
