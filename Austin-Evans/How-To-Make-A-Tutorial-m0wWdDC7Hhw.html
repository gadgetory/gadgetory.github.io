you how to make a tutorial so I'm a
couple of years on YouTube I've made a
lot of tutorials I've shown you how to
Jailbreak showing you different things
about computers about video games you
name it if it's really detect I've
probably done it so the other day when I
got a request on Facebook to do a
tutorial showing you guys how I make
mine I figured that'd be a great idea I
know a lot of you guys are just getting
into youtube so you guys actually have
really successful channels and what I
decided to do was give you a tips
video kinda give you some helpful
pointers if you're deciding to create a
channel you already have one on how to
make a good tutorial one of the biggest
things you will learn when making the
tutorial is that you have to be
confident people are not going to want
to listen to you if you don't sound like
you know what you're doing so one of the
biggest things is when you're doing a
tutorial you absolutely need to know
what you're doing it on that seems
really obvious but if it's just
something that like some programs you
found in the internet and you want to
show all your friends go hey guys this
is the way to do it that's fine but you
need to know what you're doing with it
so in the middle of a tutorial there
should never be a thang time where you
find a new feature and go oh oh and
there's this I mean don't worry it will
happen you know there's always going to
be you mean you're never going to find
some Pacific things that you know
absolutely everything in and out
sometimes you might be able to but you
just need to be able to make sure and
convey to the audience that you know
what you're talking about and that
you're very very confident so this is a
little something that I found it just
takes practice you're not going to get
on it overnight but if you can sound
confident you can make sure that
everyone understands that you know what
you're talking about
then you will go a long way something
else you will learn really quickly is
that it is okay to fail believe me for
every minute or two of footage that you
see on my channel there's probably 10 15
20 minutes of failed footage so whether
there is a technical difficulty maybe
the camera is out of focus with the
audio didn't sound right or perhaps I
just plugged up my line it's absolutely
okay to fail what you just need to do is
continue on YouTube rerecord you need to
just cut that bit out you do it in
editing but don't be afraid you're never
going to go ahead and just get a perfect
tutorial just right off the bat I mean I
guess it's possible but it's not very
likely so if you make mistake if you
miss say a name or anything like that
sometimes it might be okay to just gloss
over it and you just go like if I say
I'm gonna make a tutorial I mean a
tutorial or a little stuff that is not a
big deal but if you make a big mistake
if you
call something wrong name or something
really big and obvious don't worry about
just stop the camera restart it or you
can edit it out or however you want to
do it but and just really do it it's not
a big deal
and moving away from the general stuff
and talking more about the specifics one
of the biggest things is your equipment
now equipments definitely going to vary
sometimes you may just need a camera
sometimes you're going to need a
computer screencasting sometimes you're
gonna need to do voiceovers there's a
lot of different types but in general
you don't really have to worry about
your equipment that much the most
important thing is you if you're
entertained to watch if you sound like
you know what you're talking about
that's going to go a long way you know
that's a really great thing I like to
tell people is let's say you have a ten
thousand dollar high-definition you're
just an amazing camera you have just
best equipment in the world but if
you're stuttering if you don't sound
like you know what you're talking about
that's not going to be a very good video
on the other hand if you really know
what you're talking about if you're an
expert in your you pay Craig fantastic
video but you film it on a cell phone
for two thousand two guess what even
though the video looks junk the audio
everything people are still more going
to still rather going to listen to you
than if you had you know all the best
equipment but you didn't know what
you're talking about so the number one
thing you need to pay attention to is
you but of course having nice equipment
does help so a couple things I can help
you with so the first thing is a
microphone so this is what I started out
with this is a rock band microphone of
course the game rock band you could sing
into it and whatnot and this is what I
use to record my videos at the very
beginning now it's not very good the
audio quality is really really bad in
that you can watched in my first videos
to find that out but it really didn't
matter too much because I was able to
get the content get the practice all
that kind of stuff so most of the time
you're going to need to record your
voice sometimes you can get away with
you know doing a tutorial without
talking but most of the time you're
going to need to record so you need to
find some kind of external microphone
preps like a USB mic you might have a
mic built into your computer or your
phone or whatever but awnser you'll be
able to find a mic somehow in some way
now another thing that might come in
handy is a camera now again sometimes
you might not need this for example if
you're doing a screencast you might not
need it or for example if you have a
webcam and you're just going to be
talking to a webcam yeah absolutely wart
but a lot of times having a camera will
really help now again the type of camera
and everything is not super super
important no it's nice sure to have a
DSLR or you have some really nice
camcorder you can absolutely get by on
your
perhaps your cellphone camera we're
talking about something a little kind of
small like this I mean it's cost about a
hundred dollars or so
she's high-definition video I used it
for about a year so you know one of the
biggest things I just want to get to you
guys is that the equipment is not that
important what's really important is you
you know you're speaking well and that
you're giving people really useful and
helpful advice okay so now that you know
the basic do you have your equipment set
up and you have the general idea of how
you need to speak and be confident and
whatnot now you need to go ahead and get
edited your video now hopefully that
this is not always necessary sometimes
you can just skip over the editing a lot
of times for a simple tutorial just film
it you're done filming it just upload
straight to YouTube no problem however a
lot of times especially with more
advanced tutorials it certainly helps if
you know a little bit about editing how
to do it now there are a lot of
different kinds of video editors
available and when you're first getting
started I recommend just using something
basic so if you're on a Mac I'm movies
going to work just fine in fact iMovie
said really solid Edgar even if you're
you know fairly advanced and if you're
on Windows Windows Live Movie Maker ZAR
going to be a good shot and that's about
all you really need to go ahead and get
a nice tutorial put up on YouTube and do
the whole deal so you guys have any
questions any comments definitely be
sure to leave them in the comment
section below I would be more than happy
to help you any of you guys have you
need any help but until next time guys I
will catch you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
