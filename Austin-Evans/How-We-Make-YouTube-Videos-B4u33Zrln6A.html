we spend a lot of time trying to make
our videos as crispy as possible but
this is a look at how we actually do
that whenever people ask me what I do
for a living
the first thing I usually tell them is I
work for a youtuber because I feel like
in some cases people will just straight
up say they're a youtuber but I don't
think that necessarily describes what I
do so this is a red epic w with the
fujinon 19 and 90 that we're currently
renting but we're probably gonna end up
getting before the end of the year so we
mainly shoot red well we shoot red
because it makes Ken happy that's why we
shoot red you know I wasn't really
brought up upon like kind of learning
all this stuff so it is kind of learn as
we go sort of thing but I think from
when I started to now I think we've
we've we've gotten you know we covered a
decent amount of ground you know
figuring that stuff out there like how
can you handle a camera like that and
not be scared like that's what insurance
is for it's called not Ken's problem of
you know I think that's what it's called
I think it's it's one thing to say
I manned a camera and I shoot the videos
but I think it goes a lot further than
that there's a lot of kind of little
bits of directing that I have to do on
part of the writing that you do and like
the bullet points that you make for
yourself because the first part is about
like what is a Bitcoin I think that a
lot is gonna be fairly straightforward
up and to the point where I'm actually
explaining like how to use it
so at that point I'll finish explaining
what the blockchain is and then I'll
start talking about mining so maybe
that's a point where we cut sit at the
table and have like a couple PCs sitting
there so I can say like oh look these
are what your typical use and I'll hit a
little bit on like a stress and that
kind of stuff so the fun part of today
is that usually we would have well
pretty much an entire day to actually
shoot something like this but because we
have to shoot this and we're shooting
this BTS video that you guys are
watching now and then we have to another
video in like two hours that keep moving
take three with less yes the first day I
was here it was just kind of out to see
the space and to kind of say hi to
everyone
exact n had gotten the job he had come
back to school being like hey I'm gonna
graduate with a job unlike the rest of
you art majors so over the next couple
months I started working with you guys
to kind of refine the lighting setup a
little bit I'm using just really what
you already had just to kind of refine
everything make a little more polished
okay so we've been reporting 4045 okay
so this is a little bit of a harder
video I think for me it was difficult to
actually explain Bitcoin well it's kind
of a complicated subject so the next
incredibly important part of any video
is bringing the footage to Jimmy where
he will actually make it not terrible
and cut out my hour and a half of
mistakes so when I was in college I
played a game called crypt of the
necrodancer and I was like I want to
make a game review for this so I did and
I used iMovie and I recorded everything
with the voice memos app on the iPhone
and it sounded so bad
hello hi I'm back I returned we're gonna
be talking about video games today
instead of movies so then I was like I
switch to premiere I built my gaming PC
and that was really tough to use it was
like really slow and took like literally
six hours export sometimes so I export a
video and then go to class and then
notice a mistake and be like uh and then
I would go back and react sport at all
and just fix everything and then I
downloaded final cut over the like next
summer and it was insanely bad oh hi
it's not you a video yay Wes you have
Meg reader though
thank us the first QA was kind of tough
because I kind of had an idea of what
your videos were but the first QA was
just totally different and there's a lot
of extra little things that when to that
that I like had no idea about and it was
my first week so I was like oh I don't
know any of this God Dave yeah well
grant there's two minutes at the
beginning you gotta keep in yeah so the
six minute Q&amp;amp;A and Ozzy answered some
really good questions and you'll get a
lot of Ken too and even a little bit of
me you know between the four of us that
are in this office we all have very
specific tasks and usually were you know
zoned in on those and we can't exactly
you know be bothered you know doing the
little things like taking out the trash
so we have three cameras here there's
the first episode that sour a angle we
have another episode that's our B angle
and we have an F s5 that's sitting up
from the ceiling that's our C angle wes
is actually Manning the camera right now
has done awesome color work to make sure
that all three cameras match so shooting
log basically means that you're getting
the most amount of range out of the
camera possible so you're getting all
the the stops of light all the range of
light that you can possibly get and
that's great because then it gives you a
bunch of options in post but it also
allows you to basically make the most
cinematic looking images and the benefit
of shooting log and then just applying
the what's that I made is we can get the
benefit of log getting all that range
all that nice color and then by slapping
a wet on that I have from testing the
cameras with the different lenses it's
kind of the best of both worlds you get
really quick color and it's just one
extra step and pose he's gonna slap it
on you're good to go because we have so
many videos to make and so a little time
to actually make them a tool like Final
Cut is a huge part of our workflow so
it's like the only thing I've ever
really used so I'm just sewing used to
it now that I don't there's nothing I
would really change I really like that
we were able to save the Luntz
as presets so I can just type in the
camera name instead of going through our
massive list of all the different
lengths we have this is so much faster
and more convenient I like that a lot
what is one
about your job you wish you a change oh
I would have a 30th floor office and
look down on everyone you want the
actual answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
