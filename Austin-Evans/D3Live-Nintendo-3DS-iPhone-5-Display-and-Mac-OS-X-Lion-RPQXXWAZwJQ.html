talking about the Nintendo 3ds release
in Japan a possible new screen for the
iphone 5 and apples release of the
developer copy of OS 10 lion yesterday
in Japan the Nintendo 3ds was officially
released now before this was released
there have been a lot of people
questioning they're like oh the 3d is
going to give you headaches it's going
to be too chunky battery like this that
this that but overall a lot of the first
impressions are very good one of the
biggest topics of course the 3ds screen
has not been a big of an issue as a lot
of people fought so the 3d effects
almost across the board people have been
really impressed with of course you're
not familiar the 3ds is one of the first
device is shipping with a glasses-free
glasses-free 3d display which allows you
to view full 3d content games as well as
movies and pictures at a later date all
on the display and general people didn't
really impressed with it of course it's
not going to be perfect and I'm sure
that they're always going to be some
improvements but it seems to be working
really quite nicely and with the slider
you can actually adjust it so it's
getting a little too intense for you if
it's a little too 3d you can always turn
that down some other things about the
console as well as far as you know the
durability and all that kind of stuff
also seem to be doing really quite
nicely people have really been enjoying
the 3ds scores the three years while it
launched last yesterday in Japan they
will be available around the rest of the
world come light March a possible new
part the iPhone 5 has been found on a
chinese resellers website the new part
shows that the iphone 5 should be
getting a much larger display indeed
what looks very close to be an
edge-to-edge glass and that this is
something that people have been talking
about for quite a while but I've really
wished that you know Apple would
increase the size of the display while
not increasing the size of the device so
while there are no specifics as far as
the exact size of the display the most
part it looks like it's probably a 3.7
inch probably a four-point-oh inch
display I know this will be really nice
as like I said you get the full-size of
the nice display there's no real issues
in my opinion with the 3.5 inches on the
current iphone ipod touch it's a nice de
size but a lot of the other android
phones and a variety of you know the big
competitors are really amping it up you
know getting 4 inch 4.3 4.5 inch
displays so i think this makes a lot of
sense of apple can make this display
bigger with actually
the phone bigger earlier this week apple
and have some brand new MacBook Pros
alongside the developer preview for Mac
os10 lion now OS 10.7 lion is going to
be the next generation of mac operating
system and it looks like it's got some
really nice improvements so probably the
biggest thing is you'll find is that
there is a lot of iOS and lion for
example there is a new launch pad
feature that allows you to scroll
through your various applications just
like on iOS and neither are even folders
on top of that you also have some new
kinetic scrolling which is I'm a big fan
of of course you're not familiar with
kinetic scrolling on the iphone ipod
touch and ipad when you should go to the
bottom of page it kind of bounces a
little bit depending on how fast or slow
you scroll and this is actually going to
be implemented into OS 10 lion and then
there are also various other UI
improvements and etc etc however light
is definitely looking going to be really
solid now if you're interested you can
get at the Developer Preview right now
you do have to pay about a hundred
dollars to get at the developer preview
I'm however that does include that you
will get a free copy of line once it
comes out otherwise for the rest of us
we will probably be ready to a little
bit later in the year to get the full
version of lion as always with the
second half of d3 live I'm will be
taking live questions so all episodes of
deep-sea diver found in front of live
audience we've got well over 50 people
in the room right now so let's just go
and take a couple of questions okay do I
think the iphone five will have a 6
megapixel camera as far as that I'm not
really entirely sure the current camera
on the iPhone 4 is really pretty good
and it's only 5 megapixels um a lot of
other cameras do have like you know 8
megapixel even like 10 megapixel cameras
however something that you know I've
always try to say is make pickles aren't
everything I'm just because you got a
lot of high megapixel count does not
necessarily mean all that much pictures
can still look really bad I mean for
example you know like some 3 megapixel
cameras look even better than you know 8
megapixel camera so as far as what's
going to be I had no idea I would guess
it would probably be either 5 or maybe a
bump 28 but we'll just have to see about
that Duncan is cool s will the Nintendo
3ds have a Retina display no it won't
the 3ds is going to just have a I don't
actually remember the resolution but
it's not a really super high resolution
display the major thing about the 3ds is
it's a 3d display and which means it
actually they're double the pixels that
you can actually see one pic one set
pixels for your left eye one for your
right eye it's come complicated and get
I don't even pretend to understand it
fully but you know it's not going to be
technically retina display but should be
looking decent bit nicer than the
current des hommes how much will a 3ds
game cost 3ds games will be about a
little bit more expensive than the
current d s so in the United States they
typically seem to be going for about
forty dollars usually you know that the
DS games were going from anywhere from
30 to 35 so it's not a huge dump of
course though if you're looking for
something like on iphone ipod touch
where you're getting your like ten
dollars the max you definitely have to
pay more than that so yeah most games
seem like they're going to be around the
forty dollar mark i will just kind of
see how that goes as time goes on do I
think the iphone five will be jailbroken
within a few months typically that's
what happens yeah of course you know
every every device is newer you know
like for example an ipod touch 2nd
generation came out that took forever to
jailbreak on the other hand when the
ipad came out it was jailbroken that
night so it really just cracks you
depends on what the dev team has what
Apple is fixed and all that kind of
stuff but i would definitely guess with
if you give a like a two or three month
time frame the iphone five will
definitely be jailbroken between then
