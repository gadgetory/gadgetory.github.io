what is up guys it's BT back here again
well this is something new that I'm
going to start a new series it's gonna
be about how I use the equipment that I
review so I'm going to be showing maybe
a short story
maybe instructional usage of them based
on feedback from you guys and based on
what I think will look cool so just a
cool little series I'm going to start
let me know what you guys think I'm
starting off with the j-bird
x3 fit now I've had a lot of comments
about this a lot of questions how do I
get them to fit they fall out I'm going
to show you guys my setup for the j-bird
X threes and how I got them to stay
every single time throughout my whole
workout maybe I have to touch a month or
twice but that's about it so I'm going
to show you guys let's get into the
video okay so I see a lot of people not
using the X fit in my gym online the
people are not using the X fit it's an
ingenious design and I don't know why
people don't use this it keeps the court
off the back your neck so when you're
turning or doing jumps your cords not
bouncing all over the place and it's
loosening up your headphones out of your
ears so this is the first step in
getting the great fit the X fit now you
don't want them to be too tight on the
back of your head because if you turn
you're going to rip them out as you see
here it's kind of slacked in the back
that's where you want it next up let's
talk about the ear tips now a lot a lot
of people are going to small you have to
think these are wireless headphones so
they need some way to stay in your ear
in the one way they do that is by the
ear tip expanding in your ear and
creating a seal and keeping it in place
so if they're too small or if they fit
just right you're doing it wrong you
have to have them a little bit bigger
you want to choose the next biggest size
than you think you need and that is the
size you should go with I'm telling you
guys and if that doesn't work for you
guys then go with the
phone tips that's the next best thing
same thing applies go with the larger
size and you guys will be a-ok
so next up let's talk about the wings
now you want them to fit snugly into
your ear this in part needs to go into
the little crevice in your ear you don't
want it to create a bend in your ear
like I'm going to demonstrate here you
don't want it to bend and catapult out
right it's going to catapult out of
position and that's what you don't want
so find a size that fits great for you
that's not going to be bending you want
it to be almost flat in your ear next up
let's talk about the my sound app and
the settings that I use for the sound
profile I use so I like a lot of bass
and I like a lot of vocals clear vocals
so what I do is I pick the bring the
bass profile that's already standard on
the phone and then I just bring up the
mids like so the minutes are going to
control the vocals so you're going to
get it in your face vocals and you're
going to have bass as well and the
treble is going to roll off the highs so
it's very focused on the low and mid in
but I really like this profile so here
it is guys the final product me shaking
my head and them not moving at all
you see I'm moving my jaw around they
are not moving I'm trying my best it's
not working so I hope you guys have
enjoyed this instructional video on the
j-bird X threes again the series is
going to be called how I use them or how
I use it if you guys have any
suggestions on what I should name this
series let me know in the comments below
for now thank you guys for watching
don't forget to Like comment share and

more content like this I'm really
excited for this series I'm going to try
to push my creative boundaries so stay
tuned see what I have planned alright
