with another review today we have the H
dot ear or here
Sony wireless headphones now I was
really hyped when the announces and I
saw them I think was at CES and I said I
have to try them and so when they came
out gotta get them so I got them tried
them out and I'm here to tell you guys
my thoughts on them on whether you
should buy them or not now let's start
off with the design the comfort you know
I'm all about the comfort and these
deliver on that aspect they're very
comfortable the foam keeps its shape
it feels very premium it has a matte
finish on the outside of the product
which is really really nice I was really
surprised by just the level of quality
and the level of aesthetics that they
really put into these headphones are
really really nice they have a leather
top right here which is really nice as
well and the band is constructed really
really well as well so as you can see
can stretch it's not one piece like
other headphones it has this band in the
middle right here which is it's a metal
kind of band and it gives it that
stretchiness which will keep it from
breaking if you ever you know put in
your bag and forget and sit on it
whatever so it's really nice they come
with these folding ear cups which are
really nice as well these are good for
storing it into the case and as you see
here you can just throw them in there
throw them into your bag or gym bag or
if you're on the go if you're traveling
if you travel a lot they will be
protected I had no problems I didn't
have to worry about these in my gym bag
at all now let's talk about the controls
and the tools are actually really really
nice and sony has their own little
system that nobody else really does but
let's start off with they have the
normal power button noise cancelling and
they have a USB port input for the 3.5
millimeter jack and the mic on this side
and also
- now they have the up and down for
volume but what Sony does that no other
company does is they have a dedicated
button for forward rewind press play and
accepting calls so I really really like
this feature it takes some getting used
to there's a learning curve if you're
used to hitting the volume up and down
or hitting three times the middle button
but what I do like is that this gets rid
of let's say you hit the button try to
hit it three times but sometimes I end
up hitting it two times and it just
fours instead of going backwards a track
maybe it pauses a song sometimes so
that's something I run into in this
control right here really gets rid of
that and I really appreciate that and I
feel like more companies should probably
do that I know it's a little bit more
complicated and there's more buttons to
deal with but I feel like it's worth it
just for functionality let's talk about
the sound the sound on these is just
okay I was expecting a lot more from the
older Bluetooth headphones that I had
used before they just weren't as boomy
they weren't as fun as other headphones
they sounded almost like a 50-dollar
headphone to me and that was kind of
disappointing but the bass is the best
part of these headphones I'll tell you
that much so you won't be disappointed
with the base but the mids which are the
vocals are okay they seem really low and
the highest seem really low as well so
there's not that when you get the the
highest I would explain it as like
syllables like a drawing or drum hits
assemble and you hear that that's that's
a high so when it hits those it doesn't
really doesn't give you that like that
resonating tone it just kind of comes
and goes that's the best way to explain
it
and the mids as well the vocals it just
sounds lackluster the Sony's just don't
get that loud and the volume is not that
loud and that's really disappointing it
almost feels like any one or two more
bars of
sound of volume I really was expecting a
lot from these and they kind of failed
on the sound aspect but I'll get to Maia
theory later on that next up let's talk
about the noise cancelling and remember
that theory I was just saying like two
seconds ago my theory is that they put
in so much technology so much money into
the technology and the research and
trying to get the active
noise-cancelling up to low standards
that I feel like the sound quality
suffered and I feel like a lot of
companies have this little problem
whether it's beads or bows a lot of the
research and the money goes into the
noise cancelling because I mean they are
noise cancelling headphones but the
sound will suffer because not much much
money can be thrown into it they can't
throw all this amazing technology in and
then give us amazing sound so they kind
of have to say okay we're going to give
you amazing noise cancelling and okay
sound and that is what happens these
noise cancel really really well you will
not be disappointed with the noise
cancelling and almost I want to say
they're up there with the Bose and what
they do better than the Bose they do
better with clearing out people's voices
now I was very surprised because Bose
when you put them on you can hear people
talking around you you can only hear
sounds that are going like this oh so
you might hear the first couple of
clicks from my my snapping and then
after that Bose will cancel it the these
do that and they do the voices but when
let's say the snapping these don't clear
out as much and it takes a little bit
longer for it to get rid of it and
that's where I feel like those wins but
these are really really good if you're
in a gym or on a plane or a if you edit
just study at Starbucks then these are
for you these are going to be better
than the Bose in that aspect you will
not be disappointed alright so next up
now that we've talked about all those
things let's talk about the 3.5
millimeter jack now this is another plus
another Pro for these when you plug in
the 3.5 jack the noise-canceling still
works it just uses less battery some
headphones I'm plugging that 3.5 jack
that's it no more noise canceling you
just got regular headphones and that's
it but that's not what you buy it for so
I'm really glad that they added that the
battery life on this was amazing
I actually got more than what they were
advertising they advertise 20 hours and
I got 25 hours with these that's
incredible so if you're on a long flight
this will hold you over and then some I
use them all week didn't have to charge
them I still haven't charged them since
I got them honestly and that's just a
test to how well the battery works in
these so you will not be disappointed if
you have if you're on long flights these
are for you too so with all that being
said do I recommend these headphones the
eight year wireless headphones yes and
no yes if you're going to be in
environments where there's going to be a
lot of voices a lot of people talking
these do really well but if you're going
just for strictly noise canceling maybe
you're on a plane things like that then
you want to go with the Bose because the
sound is a little bit better on the bows
and the bass everything is better on on
their end but like again your bindings
for the noise cancelling at this point
so you will not be disappointed
good job Sony on catching up to Bose
they did or they like closed the gap
that you saying bolted on Bose and now
they're up there with Bose and I think
it's in the next generation I think
these might be the go to noise canceling
headphones over the Bose if Bose doesn't
up their game so hopefully this will
create some competition for Bose and
really really force them to put in even
more technology and sound and I cannot
wait for that so guys thank you for
watching be boy bt I will see you guys
