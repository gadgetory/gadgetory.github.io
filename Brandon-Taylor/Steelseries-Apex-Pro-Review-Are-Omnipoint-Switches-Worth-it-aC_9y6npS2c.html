the review of the SteelSeries apex pro
full-sized keyboard now this costs a lot
of commotion at copy text because they
have these omni point adjustable
switches that's right you can adjust the
actuation point of these switches via
the software but this new technology
comes at a price of $200 for the
full-size and a hundred and eighty
dollars for the tkl whoo so today I'm
going to be going over whether the apex
Pro is worth your hard earned cash or if
you're better off just sticking with
some good old Cherry MX switches
starting off with what's in the box
you're going to get the keyboard with
this series 5000 aircraft-grade aluminum
on the back it's got a non detachable
cord and this thing is thick okay now
you can like funnel this three different
ways out the back of the keyboard which
is kind of nice but I would have liked
to have seen a detachable cord on the
cable itself it's got two different USBs
one is for the actual keyboard and then
when is for the USB pass-through which
you'll find on the left side of the
keyboard
so what this can do is it can actually
interact with your computer so say you
want to plug in your mouse straight to
there you don't want it to go through
the back of your computer and you don't
have enough room it's cool to kind of
just have those two right there and you
can just use it that way
I do wish that the cable was a little
bit longer for my desk and for my
position of my computer it's kind of too
far away I had to use a USB extender to
actually use this keyboard also on the
back of the keyboard you'll find three
keyboard feet at the front of the
keyboard and you'll find two kickstands
at the back so you can have it at two
different levels I would have liked to
seen a three level stand like ducky does
and the keyboard feet aren't that great
this keyboard kind of slides around on
my wooden desk a lot so keep that in
mind I kind of wish that they made them
a little bit more grippier the keyboard
itself has RGB of course and it's got a
open casing allowing the RGB to shine
out but I didn't find the RGB to be too
impressive I don't know it just isn't
that bright to me so the good thing
about a full-size keyboard is that you
get that scroll wheel back for
multimedia because I'm a he
huge music listener and like when I'm
playing games and stuff like that I'll
hiding up my music when I'm really
feeling it in game so I really like
having that scroll wheel there over like
a 60% keyboard they've also added in a
green at the top of the keyboard as well
and this is where you can see like
you're actuation what songs are playing
your profiles your volume and that's a
really nice touch you can also change
the logo from the SteelSeries logo to
any upload that you want so you can take
a picture and just upload it to your
keyboard and it'll actually show a
little picture of it on the top so if
you have a logo like a B T or whatever
it is that you have you just put it up
top and it will show on your keyboard
which is kind of cool to use the
multimedia Keys there's no multimedia
Keys like there's no skip track pause
and anything like that there's only that
one button if you and it kind of acts
like a phone so if you tap it once it's
gonna pause and play the song if you hit
it three times it's going to go
backwards if you hit it two times so
gonna go forward and if you hold it it
will show the menu with all the
dropdowns
so the key caps themselves are abs and I
was a little bit disappointed for $200
these are to just shine after a couple
of days I mean I'm already looking at my
keyboard and it's not looking pretty so
I wish they would have added some more
quality key caps into the keyboard so
now onto the main selling point of this
keyboard which is those omni points
switches they've got a point seven
millisecond response time compared to a
five millisecond on the fastest Cherry
MX speed silver so a huge difference
there right in response time they've
also got a actuation point of 0.4
millimeters on the lowest setting which
is a 1 to a 10 setting which is a three
point six millimeter actuation point so
let's say your gamer you want to switch
to something faster you can do the point
four if you're a typist and you want
something that you know will definitely
you won't mess up and get a lot of
errors on you can increase the actuation
as well so a lot of adjustability there
with the key switch and that can be
awesome for a lot of people out there
and let me tell you I definitely notice
a difference when I switch to that point
four millimeters I do wish that in the
software there were somewhere to like
show you what actuation you actually
like best
there's only kind of like a 1 through 10
system and it doesn't really tell you
what actuation point you're at so I
think that in a future update they
should add that in the point four
millimeter actuation
is the fastest on the market but this
fast always mean good I mean me
personally in game like let's say I took
my mind off the keyboard for a second I
would actually start veering off to the
left or right in game and it kept
happening I thought something was like
wrong with my mouse so you really have
to be cautious and like really get used
to the actuation of this keyboard now
you can definitely tell a difference
with that point four millimeters it is
blazing fast okay when you're in game
and you want to go a certain way you can
go a certain way how much it actually
helps your gameplay that's another story
I don't think that it affects your
gameplay that much you know I think it's
more dependent on your mouse your mouse
switches that'd be cool if they made
some omni point switches for your mouse
right but for your keyboard I feel like
that's kind of secondary and I feel like
once you become comfortable with your
setup I feel like that trumps a point
four millimeter switch I highly highly
doubt that somebody is getting killed
over a point four millimeter actuation
versus a one point two millimeter
actuation I don't think it happens I
think it comes down to like game sense
and things like that maybe if you had a
game like osoo or something like that
where you use your keyboard that might
actually help in that game but for
first-person shooters I don't really see
this being a huge deal but anyways guys
let's drop a sound test for you guys
right about now
the actual actuation force needed to
press down the key is 45 grams which is
the same as a cherry MX speed silver
also guys the stabilizers are actually
pretty good they're decent let's drop a
sound test for you guys so you guys can
hear what I'm talking about so in the
software you'll be able to make macros
you'll be able to change the RGB the
brightness all that good stuff and the
actuation switches also to be mentioned
the Omni point switches are only on the
main keyboard outside of that like the
function Rose the numpads the arrow keys
all of those are their red switches so
keep that in mind you're not getting it
for the whole keyboard so don't be
surprised when you open it up or you try
to change your key caps and you see that
they're different for me
I don't know why wouldn't they just go
all the way and change all of them maybe
somebody might need to use the function
role really really fast why not give
people the option of having the whole
keyboard be Omni point switches it kind
of seems like you're trying to save
money on the production I don't know who
knows you can also change the switches
individually so let's say you want to
have your WASD be a different actuation
than the rest of your keyboard you can
do that as well so a lot of different
combinations and cool things that you
can do with the software I don't know it
just seems a little bit gimmicky to me
to be honest with you for $200 this is I
don't know I'd rather act
$200 I like what their I like what
they're doing with the keyboard I like
where they're going but I think it kind
kind of it's kind of gimmicky in a way
because people have been succeeding with
mechanical keyboards for so long I would
like okay hear me out I would like for
them to like chain be able to change
like where the tactile bump is now that
would be dope on like a tactile switch
if they could do that that would be
pretty dope and groundbreaking
this right here to me it's semi
groundbreaking so you came here wanting
to know whether this is worth it over
some Cherry MX switches I don't think so
I think you're better off sticking with
your current keyboard I think it'll do
just fine once you get used to it it's
more about your game sense and the way
you play and getting used to your setup
and just becoming comfortable with what
you have I think that it's becoming so
negligible right that point four
millimeters will not really help you in
game especially if you're heavy-handed
you're also paying that first adapters
tax for the being one of the first
people to get it so you're paying that
$200 for the full-size that just hurts
man that just hurts that's too ducky one
two Minnie's guys whoa Oh No
personally I would wait and see if they
can develop this technology more like I
said maybe make a tactile version where
like you can change where it kind of the
bump is now that would be brown breaking
that is still serious if you're watching
this that would be groundbreaking all
right guys so that is going to do it for
my review of the steel series apex pro
keyboard I hope you guys have enjoyed
