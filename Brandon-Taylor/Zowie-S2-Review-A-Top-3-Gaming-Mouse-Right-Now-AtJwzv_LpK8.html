to bring you guys a new review on the
Davina s2 a brand new mouth shape from
the king of my shapes Zoe now I've had
the pleasure of using this Mouse for the
past couple weeks and I've been blown
away by its performance and shape if you
guys love this ow f K or Z a series or
just want to see what the S 2 is all
about stick around because I'll be going
over the design and the amazing features
of this Mouse and who I think it will be
best for now first let's talk about the
design of this Mouse it leaves the
normal Zowie black in the past that is
how it usually goes with and now it
comes in a powder blue and pink to bring
awareness to women in eSports and not
only that guys I'm telling you guys the
new wave the new vibey stuff is gonna
leave the RGB behind and be going with
fully colored peripherals I saw somebody
in the comments of my EC 2 B video
shameless plug saying that they thought
the coding was weird at first but after
a while they couldn't live without it
and I couldn't have said it better
myself when you first get this Mouse you
might think it might be a little bit
weird but trust me guys give it a little
bit of time because after a while this
thing sticks to your hand like glue and
you start to realize that it actually
does help you aim better now the scroll
wheel and side buttons are colored white
the scroll wheel is nice and defined and
it's also clickable as a fifth mouse
button so in overwatch let's say I have
my voice chat bound to that fifth button
to make it easy to press and also guys
the side buttons leave nothing to be
desired they're very clicky to say the
least
let me give you a sound test of the side
buttons right now I love it Zoe I love
it very nice it feels a little bit
different than the EC to be and they're
a little bit smaller but they still feel
amazing it goes with that nice light
small compact size of this mouse very
nicely since now he has always put their
mouse one in two on the actual shell as
one piece people have complained and
they used to complain a lot that the
clicks were too stiff on certain lines
of their mice like the FK series well
let me tell you guys that
is a thing of the past because these
things are damn near perfect yeah I said
it
there's no break-in period or hoping
that we loosen up over time they just
come perfect ass is so let me drop a
sound test for you guys right about now
here are the mouse one and two very nice
very nice I'm loving I'm loving it let
me put it back up there you go guys
again amazing Mouse one into some of the
best in the business right now actually
prefer the mouse one and two on the
Zowie compared to the Logitech G pro
Wireless that's how much I like these
clicks now this time they actually used
a better rubber cord this time around
and in my opinion it won't give you as
much feedback on your mouse even if you
have no Mouse bungee so you're gonna
just have this laying all over your desk
you can do that as well the cable is
also geniusly angled up to keep the cord
from dragging right where the mouse
meets the cord because this is where you
would feel most Mouse dragging while
using a mouse and the reason why you
would need a mouse bungee with most mice
is to keep it from lagging and having
that slack to be on the mouse pad so
it's nice that they follow that and
they've angled it up so it stays off
your mouse pad this Howie has always
been known for making plug-and-play mice
that all the professionals use if you
watch like a csgo match most people like
80 to 90% of them are gonna be using a
Sally Mouse and even if they are
sponsored by Logitech it's kind of funny
to see I always give myself a laugh that
I like the G lettering right here on
their on their Jersey and then they were
using the Sally Mouse it's pretty funny
so this leads me to my next set of
features we're on the bottom side you'll
find that dpi gesture which allows you
to switch between 400 800 1600 and 3200
dpi a lot of people ask me what dpi I
use personally I Rock 1600 dpi with a
3-game since in overwatch on the other
side you're gonna have the pulling rate
adjuster which allows you to switch
between 125 Hertz 500 Hertz and a
thousand Hertz I love that they just put
both of these on the bottom of the mouse
it just makes it super simple to bring
around with you to like a friends house
or land without the need of like
installing a separate application to
have your Mouse work and to get all your
settings back also on the bottom they
these two gigantic mouse feet probably
the best stock mouse feet in the mouse
game to date I mean name a company with
better mouse feet I'll wait
No okay so now let's talk about the
shape and the fit of this mouse and who
it is for the shape can be palm grip but
it's not ideal in my opinion because
it's got that slope it's got a nice hump
at the back making it perfect for claw
grip and the length of the mouse is
actually short enough to where if you
want a fingertip grip this mouse you can
do that as well the shape is an absolute
dream though for claw and fingertip grip
users its ambidextrous which some people
say actually improve your aim because
your wrist is not angled to the right or
left myself personally I use a claw grip
fingertip grip hybrid and I find this
must be very very quick allowing me to
flick and lock on opponents with my mind
Mouse connection you guys remember that
from the AC to be video well if you
don't what are you doing go watch the
video
shameless plug number two so for
reference my hand is nineteen by eight
point five centimeters and this mouse is
perfect for me if you have a hand size
that a smaller girl with s two if you
have a hand size bigger than me I think
you're going to want to look at it s1
unless you really really like small mice
and you're a dedicated fingertip gamer
that really loves like a small mouse to
just move around and stay out of the way
of your palm now overall just like its
brother the ec2 B this mouse is 3360
sensor which is the top of the Leiden
okay not to brag or anything but it's a
top-of-the-line right now there are no
spin outs there's no liftoff dissidents
hiccups just a very smooth gaming
experience throughout now whether you're
playing for night or over wash this
mouse will be definitely a great
alternative to the hard to come by
find a mouse right now and to be honest
with you guys this is actually in my top
three mice currently for me I'm not
gonna tell you what order they are I'm
gonna save that for another video but
this mouse the s2 it is in my top three
now so you guys were wondering where's
Joey why is it not in your top five it's
in there now so I guess so I guess I'll
have to be up there than that very very
soon guys alright and I'll be dropping a
video on that you know I will alright
guys so that is gonna do it for this
review thank you guys for watching if
you have any more questions about the s2
let me know down
though or if you just want to say hi
I'll be sure to answer you guys it has
been your boy BT don't forget to like
share comment and subscribe and I will
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
