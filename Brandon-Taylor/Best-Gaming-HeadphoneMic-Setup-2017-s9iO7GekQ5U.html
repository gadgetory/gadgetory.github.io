where's my heels dude what the hell oh I
need heels this isn't gonna work guys
any something
what is up guys is BT back here again
with another review today I'm gonna help
you guys step up your gaming sound
quality I mean with give me headphones
being lackluster and overpriced what are
we to do to get great sound for our
gaming because really gaming does Drive
the emotions and the feelings behind the
game I mean I can still remember myself
I myself can remember all the songs from
the Final Fantasy games and the
satisfaction that comes along with
collecting all those coins in Mario
inside the Hedgehog so after my
disappointing run with gaming headsets
so I found myself looking for better
options and they needed to meet certain
criteria one it needs to be able to I
need to be able to wear them for a long
period of time to they need to have
great sound stage so that I can locate
enemies three create great emotion and
immersion into the game and four let me
communicate clearly with my teammates
and from my findings the best way to do
this is just to buy a standalone
headphone and buy a standalone mic so
today I'm gonna share with you guys my
findings of what I finally landed upon
and just gotten rid of every single
gaming headset that I have for this
setup okay so first let's talk about the
headphone sound quality and now you're
gonna want a pair of headphones that are
open back if you don't know what that is
it just allows sound to come from the
outside it's gonna leak a lot of sound
but it's also gonna give you a lot of
soundstage and it's gonna give you that
3d effect for your games because after
all you need to know where your enemies
are on the map and a good pair of
headphones that won't break the bank are
the Sennheiser 5 9 8 and these things
won't break the bank
you can find these for about 99 or 150
bucks not bad right sometimes they even
go lower than that now with open back
you will give away you will give up some
of that
boom eNOS but you will gain a lot of
that 3d soundstage where you can just
hear stuff like bullets flying past you
and all that stuff and with these
headphones that 5/9 aids you can
actually wear these for a long period of
time I these are the only pair of
headphones that have never fatigue me at
all like I can wear these and I can
forget that they're even there and
that's saying a lot
how do any headphone guys that I've ever
tried these are the best for comfort
hands down the flora material is nice
the headband is nice I've sat on these a
million times and they have just lasted
they've been through the grinder so
definitely I recommend these for gaming
these are my number ones for gaming so
now that we met the first three criteria
we need to actually find the fourth and
that is finding a great mic now for mic
choices I recommend getting one by blue
mic there's some bias in hyzer but they
can be pretty pricey so there are two
that I can recommend that I actually own
and that is the blue Yeti
and the snowball so the snowball comes
in at about $50 and the blue Yeti comes
in around $100 now both of these mics
sound very very similar I would only get
the blue Yeti might want to do maybe
voiceovers for your games or interviews
or if you're just making content but
otherwise the snowball will work out
just fine they sent a sound almost the
same I'm not gonna lie to you guys and
the great thing about this is you're not
gonna have a mic that's gonna be coming
around your face you could just put on
your desk anywhere that you want and it
still picks up your voice very very well
you know if you're there face palming
because your teammates aren't doing
their job you might hit your mic and
that might mess up things so it's nice
just having a little style of mic away
that just kind of makes you feel less
claustrophobic at the end of the day now
the beauty of this setup but having a
standalone setup is that although it may
be a little bit more expensive up front
this is about $150 and I feel like
that's a bargain but the beauty of it is
you can always upgrade later so let's
say you pick up a pair of headphones
that you really really like you want to
use them for gaming you think they sound
better than your old ones you can just
swap out your old headset and then put
in your new one right
to have the great mic there or if you
want upper you mic you can do that it
goes vice-versa but the thing is is just
flexibility with this setup and that's
something where when you have a gaming
headset
what's that headset or mic or whatever
you don't like it or you feel like it's
time to upgrade that whole thing is gone
hey and the sound quality isn't that
great right now the gaming I don't get
why gaming headsets aren't that great
right now they've been around for a long
time now another being Wireless like
something has to give in the gaming
headset realm I don't know what it is
yet maybe I'll dive into that more but
for now I'm kind of staying away from
because of my experience so let me know
what you guys use do you guys use a
gaming headset or do you guys actually
just go ahead and just buy a standalone
setup where you have your headphones and
your mic I know Zombie core I know you
do bro so and he's one of the guys that
just very just one of my subs that
advocates this kind of setup and I
totally agree with him this kind of
setup will beat any gaming headset any
day of the week alright so again let me
know what you guys use down the comments
below I'd love to hear what you guys
used as always like share comment and
subscribe on the video if you enjoyed it
and I will see you guys in the next
video and don't forget just keep it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
