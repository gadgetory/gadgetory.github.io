getting with another motivational
Monday's good to see you guys if you
guys were there last week thanks for
coming back really appreciate it let's
get started with the video now today I
want to talk about visualization now we
hear about this a lot and like maybe
exports or a lot of stuff help bugs or
things like that and for me it was kind
of like okay I'm just sitting here
thinking about what I want to happen
which I do and which I've always done
but something that's kind of taking it
to the next level and something that may
help some people who almost think it's
kind of ridiculous to do is to see
yourself go through a hard time where
maybe you're tempted to cheat on your
diet you know you go to that addiction
or food or shopping whatever you do that
you feel like you don't have control
over and you need more willpower in so
picture yourself in that situation in a
time where you might be tempted to cheat
on your diet for example now see
yourself and feel the emotions that go
along with it in your mind and I'll see
yourself choosing to go a different way
if you choose something more positive as
much as it seems hard in that moment in
your mind choose a different way and see
if that doesn't make you feel a little
bit better because what it does is is
it's going to put into your mind that
next time that happens okay what did I
visualize I saw that okay I was feeling
this way I saw myself doing this but I
chose to do something else that means
that that thing is possible you saw so
therefore it is possible for you to do
it and that's why visualizations are so
powerful is because over and over if you
keep doing this you know you may fail it
may not work the first time may not at
the same time but what if it works at
third time
it takes it takes a while to break out
these little mind patterns that we have
we're always visualizing something and
then we react to it and then we go out
and do the thing that we don't want to
do you know almost like we don't have
any control because it's a habit so in
your mind you have to see that situation
and see yourself acting in the way that
you want to act and knowing that hey I'm
going to be tempted in the future I
might not be that perfect person but you
know I need to go a different way and
choose something different in my mind so
then the next time you go through that
event it's going to come up in your mind
like all day I've been visualizing this
what did i do in that visualization oh
yeah I did this I called a friend I
cooked a meal a healthy meal I put away
my wallet when I want to go buy
something this is a technique that I use
all the time and it works to a tee I've
seen so much change with this see myself
go through a hard time and coming
through it in my mind that's way more
powerful than just thinking oh it's all
unicorns and flowers and running through
meadows and everything is going to be
great my lesson be great no wheat no
matter who you are what you're doing
there's always going to be some kind of
challenge in your life and that's what
you have to prepare for is the
challenges so go out smash your
challenges in your mind first and then
once they come to you smash those two in
real life alright guys so that has been
motivational Monday for the third row a
week in a row so thank you for tuning in
thank you guys for all the support more
videos to come I really hope you guys
have learned something this week i will
see you guys next Monday peas</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
