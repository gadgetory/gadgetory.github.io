again with another review today we're
gonna be taking a look at the SOL X Shop
headphones now the company reached out
to me wanting me to do a review on them
so I obliged why not I love trying new
headphones keep in mind guys that all
these opinions are my own they did not
sponsor or pay for this in any way so
let's see how they fare now these are
coming in at a hundred and fifty dollars
which is pretty competitive with what
we've been seeing lately on the true
Wireless market but the crazy thing is
the X shocks do a lot of things better
than what the competition is doing so
today I'm gonna be letting you guys know
about these interesting headphones so in
the box you're gonna get a pouch the
charging case the headphones two sets of
ear tips and a clip so you can clip it
to your keys or whatnot so first let's
start off with the silicon tips now they
look small don't get me wrong they look
very small they look like they're gonna
fall out but they actually do a really
good job of keeping these in your ear
now I do wish they were a little bit
bigger so they would block out and
isolate more noise but they are sports
earbuds keep in mind so that is
something where you want to hear your
outside surroundings when you're outside
running and things like that so these
are gonna be great for runners but if
you're in the gym and not so much and
while tolerable and the volume does get
really loud on these it's still like it
leaks a lot of noise almost like the
Bose so that's one thing I would add
with these is bigger silicone tips or
some foam tips to go with these and I
think they would be almost perfect for a
comfort because without even having
these big ear tips these stay in your
ears really really well they don't come
out at all I've never felt like they
were ever gonna fall out like I did with
the B&amp;amp;O v8 none of that these stayed in
for my complete workout so a very good
job on the comfort now let's talk about
this case now it is a little bit bigger
than what we've been seeing but that
added sighs they give you a lot of value
and by value they give you a three
thousand milliamp battery charger so
this can charge your phone up to one
time isn't that crazy
and also you're gonna get sixty hours of
battery life with this case Wow
what company do you know that is doing
that some are barely even getting eight
hours or twelve hours which is crazy
so they really want to make this worth
your while that if you are gonna be
carrying a charging case that you can
charge your phone as well as the
headphones making it a great value and I
think that's very very innovative from
them and that's something that I've
never seen from any company I don't know
why and nobody has thought of this idea
but Seoul has thought of it while the
case is a little bit on the bigger side
it does stay in your pants or your shirt
pocket or coat pocket very nicely and
it's very flat so you won't get in the
way as well
okay so let's talk about the sound now
now the sound was good it's not great
these do one thing really really well
and that is vocals
I love clarity and vocals and these do
that very well if you love vocals if you
listen to a lot of vocal intense music
like R&amp;amp;B rap rock these are gonna be
great for you they will give you emotion
through vocals but I did find it a
little bit thin on the bass so all you
bass head it's out there
you might be a little bit disappointed
but the one thing these also do really
well is to get very loud which I like so
if you're not gonna put a lot of bass in
at least they made the volume very high
no I've been listening to that new migos
album the culture - with these and
they've held up pretty nicely I did when
I switched over to a more bass ear
headphone notice the difference in the
song so maybe in the next version of
these headphones they want to add in a
little bit more bass on the bottom side
but then again that's all personal
preference right
another area where these really shine is
the call quality now it is super clear
it is almost like you are right next to
the person had no complaints with these
which is crazy and another thing these
do really well which I think should put
these in front of your list at the top
of your list when you're looking for
true wireless earbuds is these do not
have any lag they have bluetooth 4.2 and
these things when you watch youtube
videos when you're watching anything
when you're changing your songs there is
no delay how can a company that's just
coming to the market soul just destroy
bows Sony B&amp;amp;O all in this one category
and jaybird let's not forget j-bird
you're in that too they destroyed them
by coming to the market with no delay
and I've had no breakups with these even
in the gym crowded lots of people have
bluetooth headphones no interruptions
Wow
so if you're looking for a solid true
rellis earbud these are gonna be for you
and of course we already talked about
the battery life I mean 60 hours of
playback time total they've got to be
out of their mind
now each charge I was getting about four
hours of battery life playback and high
volume mid to high volume so very very
competitive and these really can compete
with some of these top top companies and
I think they are worth a shot
if you're looking for something that's
going to be solid you can't go wrong
with these in my opinion
while not perfect the ex shocks by Sol
do a lot of things right from the
external battery pack that's giving you
60 hours of playback plus you can charge
your phone one time that's just crazy
there's sweat and waterproof for those
of you big sweaters out there they have
really good clarity the only thing is
they are missing a little bit of bass
which I think a lot of the mainstream
music is going towards right now so if
they can just add in a little bit more
bass I think these things will be they
would be untouchable and let's not
forget that these things have no delay
been watching YouTube or videos or
within changing songs and to Sony both
and jaybird couldn't get it right but
somehow this company comes out of
nowhere Sol and does it right makes you
kind of think right where your money's
going to when you buy some of these true
riley's earbuds so so great job I love
the headphones I do think these are
worth $150 they give you enough value
here to justify the price and they just
work and a lot of Corrado's earbuds
right now aren't working so a great job
Sol thank you for sending me these
headphones and I just want to thank you
guys all for the support for the likes
on the videos and just stopping by and
supporting the channel I really
appreciate it more videos to come it's
been your boy bt saying</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
