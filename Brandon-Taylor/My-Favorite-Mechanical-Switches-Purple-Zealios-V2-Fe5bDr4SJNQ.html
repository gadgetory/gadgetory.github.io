favorite switches the purples illios
version two switches now we are all
familiar with each area Mac says the
kales the Gator on switches and the
various colors such as red brown blue
and even clear switches each with their
own unique feel some are linear some are
tactile and some are plain annoyingly
clicky now in my search for the perfect
switch I kept coming across the same
name Z Leo's earned the purple Gator ons
they promised me everything a brown is
and then some so went to zo PC done net
and they are a bit pricey at $1 per
switch so for my 65% match up all I had
to buy 70 switches which was $70 yikes
but that's the beauty of having a hot
swappable keyboard is that i can switch
in some of the best switches on the
market within seconds these also come in
a couple of different actuation forest
variants like a 62 gram a 65 gram and a
67 gram and if you have hold fingers a
78 gram variant now the 62 gram is the
closest to a brow so I recommend trying
that weight out first if you are going
to be checking these out for yourself I
went with something completely different
a sixty seven grams illios and these
things are exactly like the website
describes crisp and responsive there's a
tactile bump feeling at the very top
with more cushion at the bottom of the
key press now people might say these are
too heavy for gaming but one of my
favorite over odds pros turned apex god
mindo recently picked up a keyboard with
guess what sixty seven grams aleosis and
if they are good enough for him they are
good enough for me for gaming now it
took some time to get used to the
heaviness coming from a 55 grab
actuation force on the Cherry MX brown
switch but once I did there's no going
back guys when I use brown switches from
Gator on or Cherry MX I immediately miss
my
switches I love them for gaming because
when you press them you got getting that
feedback it's almost like you're you
know you you really feel the key presses
with these switches and I absolutely
love typing on them as well now when you
do get them they won't fit into your
house off a little keyboard like a G mm
K or a master op alt until you use a
fingernail cutter to cut off the extra
two plastic legs on them it's really
easy to do and it just takes like a
second all right so enough talking guys
let me drop a sound test for you guys
right now so you can experience some of
this amazingness for yourself of this
beautiful beautiful switch oh yeah I'm
calling it right now that might be my
favorite sound test of any switches I've
done on the channel so far I mean just
absolutely perfect if I did have one
negative thing to say about these
switches is that it will ruin every
other switch for you no other switch
will feel the same after you get these
all right guys that's gonna do it for
this video on my favorite switches let
me know if you guys are gonna pick some
up to try these out and I think after I
make this video they might sell out I
don't know I'm just warning you guys now
they are worth the asking price and then
some in my opinion so don't sleep on
these guys I'm telling you if you like
tactile switches try these zillio system
alright guys so that is gonna do it for
this video thank you guys for liking and
sharing my videos not just this one but
all the other ones and subscribing to me
supporting me all the kind words in the
comments I really appreciate all the
messages that I get from you guys
cheering me on the channel has just
grown so fast and it's all thanks to you
guys so thank you guys again
I will see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
