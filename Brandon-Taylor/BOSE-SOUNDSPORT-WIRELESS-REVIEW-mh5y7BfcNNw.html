because there's no other reviews on the
sound sport by those the wireless ones
but I have them you're in good hands
all right so who just say before us
starting this off that I had the
original sound sport the wired ones and
I love them they were my favorite
headphones for the longest time and then
they got a short in them and I just got
I went Wireless and I never looked back
I just never wanted it because the wire
ie bunch of a wireless you can't go back
to wire I mean come on like you know
especially weightlifting running like
just not having the core bounce or the
headphones rip out of your ears when
you're working out it's just it's so
much better so everybody has been
bugging Bose to make a wireless version
of those headphones and they listened
which is how we got these and keeping
with their theme as you see they have
the was it the stay stay here tips so
they're really comfortable so it's
pretty much exactly the same as the old
sound support ones and I will say that
these are the most comfortable wireless
headphones that you can buy period I've
tried them on tried to Jaber as I tried
Jaber freedom's the x2 is the ex ones
the power beats these are the most
comfortable things ever Wow
I mean you can put this in your ear let
me show you put this in your ear like
they just don't come out they don't come
out they don't irritate it your ear
canal is like having a jam in like foam
tips of the free bird with the freedoms
where the J Brand X tooth
and I was skeptical because look at how
how big the housing is on these and I
was skeptical I was like these are gonna
be heavy as all hell but they're really
not they're really light and honestly
like these sit outside the sit outside
your ear canal just outside but it's
enough to get like enough of a seal for
good music and that is amazing because
they stay in and you see well maybe not
let me try and put it all the way in
this time but there see nothing and they
haven't moved so the the comfort I would
say if comfort is your number one number
one thing go with these if well we'll
get to the rest let's stick to the we'll
stick to these for now now next we
talked about comfort a plus now we're
gonna go into the sound now with the
original sound sports and the wired ones
they had really good sound
honestly they have really good sound but
a lot of people complain they're too low
they're - there's not enough bass and
see with this tip right here it gets
more of a seal the other I don't have
the tips with the old ones these are the
stay here tip plus the old ones that
came with a sound sport they used to
just have just a little plug coming out
so this helps getting a get a seal and
the base on these I don't know they
increased it to they listened they
really did they listened to the
consumers and they put a lot of bass in
these like this is like perfect it's
perfect
it's honestly I can tell you guys the
bass is perfect it's it's accurate but
then a little that they added it like a
little bit more bass and all genres of
music I was listening to like Frank
Sinatra
the highs are great I listen to a lot of
EDM the EDM was really good the bass was
there the clarity is insane
and the way they said to have I got
active or an EQ thing that goes in with
these headphones that kind of like
adjust it on the go for you and you can
kind of tell like any genre of music
that I picked rap listen to rock listen
to you know like some Third Eye Blind
some sublime that was really good
Frank Sinatra I'll listen to my tiÃ«sto
Afrojack Kanye and all of them sounded
really good really really good now I
will say that the isolation is not that
great so these are going to be good for
people that like want to have them like
while you're running right like outside
or let's say you're doing like some
biking no signs I'm cycling and you need
to hear cars coming or you're doing some
housework whatever these let in sound
I'm gonna tell you that right now so if
you're looking if a sound isolation is
high up on your list these aren't for
you because when I was in the gym that
q- sound is really good on these but
when you're in the gym it's another
story because there's some weights
clanking around there's people talking
next to you they have the music in the
gym that's playing right over the top of
your music and all these three things
add up to the point where it kind of in
affects the sound quality you know like
all that good sound quality is kind of
washed away you know and it just becomes
average it sounds like almost like Apple
Apple headphones in the gym honestly
like that's how that's how much
isolation you're getting it's like you
might a lot of Apple iPhones you know
these it turns a plus headphone into
- Abby - all right so if Jim is your
primary and you know when the when a lot
of people when leaving the gym and it
got empty these were actually really the
sound quality went back up I can tell
you that right now so if you're working
on it at times that word like an idol
not a lot of people are in there or you
don't mind hear you like hearing that
your surroundings or whatever then these
are for you if you like isolation these
are not for you because you will be
disappointed and you know you're paying
$150 please headphones you want to make
sure you're getting the experience that
you want you know you want the good
sound quality you want to hear these and
these are workout headphone you know
it's made for an active lifestyle all
right so it's a little disappointing in
a way like you know this is kind of like
the sound sport issue from before the
wire version you know so it's a little
bit disappointing but if that okay with
you then by all means get these for me
though I'm having it makes them kind of
50/50 for me I like when you're by
yourself
these are so clear they every year every
genre it will just smash every John
ivenna so whatever you like these are
gonna sound good
when you step into the gym or you step
like anywhere else or out in the crowd
or whatever it kind of messes things up
I can't tell you that right now
and also to like if you're wearing I
know like a lot of bikers they have you
know their helmets so these are good if
you have like a helmet or whatever
because you stick out a lot it's not
gonna work I do a lot of cycling I do
like cycling
I like cycling class stuff so and I was
bouncing up and down side to side and
they didn't come out I never felt like
they were gonna come out so yeah the
accessories that it comes with the pouch
you know the tips they're all great
they're all high quality I really like
the pouch and everything the cable is
long so you don't have to worry about
you know like the j-bird quarters like
this long it's like come on man
you know so these are all positive
things and of course you know those the
quality is just good it's it's amazing
like that it feels like the the
materials feel really nice
you know like the it feels like a matte
black and also - let's talk about the
voice commands the voice commands it
tells you the name of the person that's
calling that's really cool I really like
that and when I put these on and I was
talking to my girlfriend she said that
these it sounded really clear like she
couldn't even tell I was on headphones
or her speaker or anything so that's a
very that's a positive next let's talk
about this remote now the remote has a
positive negative volume and a
scent pause 3 for skipping backwards two
presses for skipping forward Lisa on
iPhone and the buttons really they click
you hear that they click it's really
satisfying now the the up and down
buttons they're a little hard to press
not oh not that gets better over time
but that's something you know if if you
don't want to be pressing or you like to
go up and down with your bees like I
sometimes I could do like what
really feeling a song I like that click
up above I love it can be a little a bit
of a pain but this it's a satisfying
plate it really feels like quality you
know so I really enjoy that yeah so we
talked about the voice prompts those are
good tells you the percentages next and
finally but not least I want to talk
about this is the battery life these
last a long time
okay I think that I could probably get
through three to four workouts and I
work out probably - I work out six times
a week and I work out for two hours a
day now by the time I got home I was at
80% after a two-hour workout and I like
to blast my music that's one thing when
companies say oh six hours of music but
when you put the volume up what happens
two hours three hours right so these
actually I think they they last a long
time so let's say two hours went down to
80% so that means what five five
workouts and you won't have to worry
about charging these whereas like the
Jaybirds that's like one workout that I
was working out 30% by the time I'm done
without the clip so that's something
that take into consideration so I would
give these I've had to rate these I
think I would give these about a eight
and a half eight and a half for the
sound sports they're really comfortable
and the battery life is amazing top
notch
so if comfort and battery life are two
of the most important things these are
for you if isolation and like a sound
stage meaning you can hear like every
single note of every single instrument
these are not for you
all right so I hope this going to hope
this helps you guys make make a good
decision on these definitely if you
can't go to a bookstore and try them out
yeah I really like these and I'm right
now going to do a comparison on the
Jaybirds and sound sports right now
so I will see you guys the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
