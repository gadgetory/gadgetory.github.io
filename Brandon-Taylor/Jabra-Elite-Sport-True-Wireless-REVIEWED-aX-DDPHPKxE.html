what is up guys bTW back here again with
another review today we're going to be
looking at the first true wireless
headphones being reviewed on this
channel and that is the Jabra sports
elite true wireless headphones so today
let's find out do these sound good do
they stay in your ear because no we
don't want them to fall out and be
scrambling around for them and lose our
expensive pair of headphones right so do
they stay in your ear do they sound good
how's the call quality since it's going
to be back here instead of right here
all these things come into play and when
you have true router's headphones so
let's take a look so first let's start
off with the comfort and design now
these come with three foam tip sizes
they come with three silicone sizes and
you also come with three ring sizes now
first let's talk about these foam tips
now I felt that these weren't that great
and let me tell you why with comply tips
you're going to put them into your ear
they're going to form to your ear right
with these they have a plastic coating
which is smart because the sweat that
you're sweating while you're working out
is going to just roll off right you're
not going to get absorbed they're not
going to get nasty so this don't like
shape of plastics is going to be in your
ear and when it expands it expands all
the way so you're going to have that
dome in your ear so it's not as
comfortable as something that just forms
here ear and stays like that so I felt a
lot of pain with these and actually
switched over to the silicone tips now
the silicone tips were much better they
stay to my ear just the same but I did
notice a little bit less isolation with
these now the wings is where I have the
biggest problem and would least - the
most discomfort would be
phones now the wing would see if you
push the headphone into your ear and
then you twist and then the wing tips
goes up into your ear kind of like a
jaybird or bows or etc centers so that's
what happens but these the material is
very rigid so when you're pressing that
up volume button or when you pressing
the Add button these are going to hurt
it push it jabs those hooks into your
ear and it's not comfortable they really
need to rethink the gel that they're
using the rubber that they're using
whatever they're using to keep these in
your ear because it's just not
comfortable and they're already bulky as
it is
I never knocked them while working out
or anything like that but it would be
nice if the wings were a little bit
softer now these also come with a
charging case which is very nice very
sleek I like it
you put it into your pocket just the
same as you would like the air pods and
you carry it around but we'll get more
to that later in the battery section
next up let's talk about the sound now
these are out of the box they didn't
sound that great to me but after a while
like with some headphones the driver has
to get warmed up
once it gets warmed up they sound great
these are actually one of the best
sounding pairs of headphones that I've
tried recently so the minutes are great
the bass is great and like I always say
the emotion the emotion is there with
these the highs are a little bit rolled
back so if you're into like classical
music if you're just getting it for that
reason I would price straight away from
them but this is the kind of sound
profile that you want for these
headphones the bass is great with these
so bass heads out there you guys will be
taken care of and I'm one of them so now
I'm moving on to the battery life the
battery life is OK I mean with true
wireless headphones they seem to be
three hours onboard six using the case
so usually I never really have a problem
with the battery because my work out for
about two hours or less right after my
workout I throw them into the case
because I don't want to lose my
headphones and two it charges them so
why not just put them in there and that
was with making calls that was with
listening to music watching videos I got
three hours so good job I guess so let's
move on to the app now this app features
a vo2 test where you can find out your
max heart rate your fat burning and
cardio zones so this is great for people
just starting out in Fitness and I'm
always skeptical of people trying to do
gimmicks right and just get our money
but workouts in the app actually really
do kick your so kudos to Jabra for
putting together this package with the
headphones it also features the heart
rate monitor on the bottom side in your
ear so if you don't have a finished
tracker are already what you can do is
just get these and you have that to
track your workout which is the most
important unless you want unless you
want steps this is probably the best way
to track your heart rate you can also
just turn on the app switch it on go for
a run and calculate your calories burn
for a certain time it also shows you how
long it takes you to recover it just
shows you a lot of cool things that I
never really thought to think about so
guys if you're just starting out with
fitness these might be the ones to get
and you're in the market for some
headphones I say just go for it they
also feature this cool feature where it
allows the app to count your reps
these can count your reps so when you
don't fit ups or squat it'll count the
movement and that's really cool I would
never have thought to put that into a
headphone but why not some more features
and more innovation so then let's talk
about the call quality before we get out
of here
now these features two microphones on
each ear bud so whichever earbud is
getting more background noise it'll
switch over to the other one and that is
a really cool feature for those of you
that are on your phone all the time okay
now in conclusion do I think these are
gimmicky and do I think they're worth
your money
they're $250 I would say if you don't
have a finish tracker go ahead and get
these headphones but if you do have a
fitness tracker like a Fitbit or
something like that
just get some regular headphones because
it's kind of like buying more of the
same and it's wasting your money so kind
of to save yourself some money go out
and get a different pair if you already
have it but this is great if you're just
starting out with fitness and you don't
know where to start
Jabra has made a place for you to start
alright guys so that has been my time I
appreciate you guys so so much I
appreciate all the new subscribers and I
will see you guys in the next review
