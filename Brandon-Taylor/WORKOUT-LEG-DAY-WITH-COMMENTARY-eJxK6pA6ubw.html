commentary I got a new mic thought I'd
take it for a spin let me know what you
guys think of the sound in the comments
today we're going to get into some legs
today I started off with squats usually
we warm up with a five minute bike ride
on a bike ride machine and then we go
into our squats now today some tips that
I have for you is choose a bar placement
that works for you either high or low in
the past I've always done low and it
hurt my lower back a lot i'll get a big
back pump but my legs would never feel
like they were working so that has
really helped me try out both may be
back to back sets see what feels best
for you this has really helped me get
into that eight to ten repre knew that
size and it is really put a lot of size
onto my legs keeping the feet
shoulder-width apart you know everything
tight sucking your abs in getting air in
between sets these squats is a exercise
where you need to take big breaths
that's something that I've kind of
gotten away from and that I put back
into my workout now here this is an
amazing way to strengthen your squats do
10 reps at the bottom of the squat and
then 10 reps at the top of the squat
which is coming up right here this will
help you fix any kind of imbalances you
know we're all stronger in certain areas
than others so this kind of helps get
that strength up and see kind of what
era twit part of the squatter you
weakest that is at the top or your cause
is the more at the bottom your your
hamstrings so yeah that's a good way to
do it so next up we have sissy squats so
I do these on the assisted squat machine
as you see only my toes are on the
platform you don't need to go super low
on these just enough
to get your the the quad around the knee
to work you know and now we do another
ten moving the feet up a little bit as
you can see I'm not really going to low
because I feel like on these when you go
to low your lower back starts coming
into play and I really want to save my
lower back for other workouts in in this
work out so that that's why I kind of
like as you see I'm kind of wrapping out
and really just focusing on squeezing
pushing through my heels and making sure
i am getting that contraction in my legs
and those sissy squats really help with
that meet around your knee you know when
you're wearing shorts a problem I had
was I look like I didn't like work on my
legs because my the area around my knee
was so small so that has really helped
with that now next up we did leg
extensions we did 10 reps hold at the
top for five seconds and then another
five reps pretty self-explanatory on
that one and then we have to make do
since we don't have a reverse leg curl
machine we had to make do with the leg
extension machine and this one you just
want to focus on squeezing the hamstring
a lot of legs is just squeezing
squeezing as hard as you can that's
something that I've learned in something
that has been paying off for me lately
and now to finish off our legs we did a
giant super set so we did jumping lunges
10 reps and then we into straight into
jumping squats and then we did a rolling
ab workout now this is kind of strange
it was my first time doing this ab
workout but it really works it works the
upper and lower and as you'll see here
I'm going to get into it alone alright
so you don't put your hands above your
head
your legs kind of like a Tavi you want
to rock both sides now at the bottom
you're working that lower ab at the top
we're going to top of the abs and it
just feels great we did 10 of these and
in total we did three these three
exercises three times in a row with no
rest and you should be my life we're so
pumped you should be exhausted by the
end alright and that's going to conclude
this video thank you for watching I hope
you guys have learned something let me
know if you guys have any more questions
in the comments below and I will be sure
to answer you guys thank you so much for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
