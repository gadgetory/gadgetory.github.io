review of the ducky one too many pure
white edition the new colorway for the
ultra popular ducky one too many for me
the original ducky one too many was my
first step into the world of 60%
keyboards and there definitely was a
pain period of swapping from a full-size
keyboard to a 60% keyboard but after
going through so many 60% keyboards and
reviewing them since the ducky went to a
mini-review and then coming full circle
to this one I've come to appreciate a
lot of the features that the ducky went
to Minnie brought to the table so today
I'll be checking out their new pure
white edition and some of the
differences from the original ducky one
to many to the pure white version so
let's start off with what's in the box
as always guys in the box you'll get the
keyboard with that new powder blue Enter
key to go with that frosted white
keyboard bass and keys I think it looks
absolutely sick and it was a great
choice by ducky as always they have the
best taste in colorways also in the box
you'll get a white USBC cords some extra
powder blue key caps which I'm always a
fan of because it allows you to add some
flavour to your keyboard as soon as you
get it without waiting years for a
decent key cap set now it's also got a
key cap puller as well in there so if
you want to change them out to those
powder blue you can do that now on the
website I saw that they're actually
gonna have like randomized colors I got
the blue I'm not sure if they're gonna
have any other colors but I'll keep you
guys posted as for the base of the
keyboard it keeps that same size and
shape SEO the one but in the new
all-white two piece frame this looks
absolutely dobut if you're going for an
all-white set up the color of the mini
logo on the back is not powder blue
instead of red as well the USBC port is
on the left side as it was before and
it's also got those same four slim
keyboard feet that are super grippy it's
got the same three kickstand feet levels
like in the old version which I'm a huge
fan of if you guys watch that review I
usually use the highest stand and after
using other 60% keyboards I really
appreciate the ducky for that three
level system it really does make a
difference and getting your own best
personal keyboard height with some
keyboards you're just stuck with
whatever they give you another thing
that I like about ducky is how low the
front end is it just feels like it was
built for gaming as the bezel just stays
out of your way completely while gaming
and typing this time around though I
noticed that the keyboard seems to flex
less than the original black version I
know that they talked about making some
improvements to the base of the keyboard
and it feels like they made good on that
promise with this new pure white version
it also has dip switches on the back of
the keyboard to switch the windows
function and control keys around
all in all I'm a huge fan of the ducky 1
2 minis design now let's talk a little
bit about the key caps now they are the
same double shock seamless PBT and they
feel great but I love about ducky key
caps is they can easily be cleaned and
they don't retain any markings or color
so I have confidence in ducky and their
key caps that these will be no different
than what they've made in the past and
they'll last you for a long time it's
just on their track record on the
underside of the key caps they've got a
bunch of different default functions
like your volume arrow keys and things
like that they've also included the year
of the pig key cap for the spacebar and
it is more intricately designed this
time around over that old year of the
dog spacebar it's definitely more
detailed as you can see and I think it
looks absolutely sick ducky always knows
their space bars now the ducky
one-too-many comes in a bunch of
different Cherry MX versions just pick
your poison
I like tactiles some people like linear
so the switches that I went with were
the Cherry MX browns alright guys so I
know what you guys came here for you
guys came here for that sound test but
before I begin guys don't forget to time
stamp this in the comments saying here
is what you came for seriously somebody
always does it in any video that I post
so anyways guys let's drop the sound
test for you guys right now
cherry MX which is just hit differently
on a ducky keyboard and I know some of
you guys out there know what I'm talking
about the stabilizers are also
exceptionally good to me these are some
of the best out-of-the-box stabilizers
I've ever tried let's drop a sound test
for you guys right about now so as you
guys saw from the demonstration there's
barely any wobble and you can barely
hear any rattling if at all so yeah it
looks like we have a winner on our hands
here guys
so to swap through all the RGB mode all
you have to do is hold down the function
alt and T to cycle through the different
modes you can easily switch between
modes like rainbow breathing and many
more
FN plus jr l will speed up or decrease
the rate of the RGB holding F in all
caps lock will allow you to make two
different custom layers which you can
customize to your liking and change the
different colors so let's say you want
to match it with your setup and have an
all blue keyboard you can do that or you
want a half blue half red keyboard you
can do that and you can finally tune
this by hitting function Z X and C to
mess with the RGB settings and then
after that all you have to do is hit
caps lock left shift and then that will
end the customization now one thing that
I really took for granted after leaving
the ducky one-to-many was the ducky
macro system 2.0 it's the best in my
opinion while I do like that they did
add some volume buttons on the function
layer I still needed a little bit more
control over my music now function 1
through 6 will choose a profile then
from there you can configure the
function and function control layers so
there is more than enough layers to play
around with and they've got some
instructions in the manual for the
multimedia keys so I bind it like my
skip tracks my apposite play for when I
am streaming and they've also given you
the control over your Mouse from your
keyboard what as well as some games like
gamble and minesweeper on there for $100
this
by far is my favorite 60% keyboard is
lightweight for travel has great
stabilizers USBC great RGB modes and an
even greater macro system for 60%
keyboard this is still my absolute pick
especially for beginners and if you're
in the position where you have an old
ducky one too many a black version and
you might just want to change the
scenery this would be a great pickup for
you as well I guess the only negative I
could say about this is that they don't
offer a zillio switches on it which are
my favorite but Cherry MX will do for
now and I think that'll be enough for a
lot of people out there it's one of the
most popular mechanical switches for a
reason alright guys so that's gonna do
it for this review I hope you guys have
enjoyed this review it has been your boy

next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
