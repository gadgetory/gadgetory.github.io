is a review of the bear dynamic DT 990
pros this pair of headphones is becoming
increasingly popular in the gaming
community because of well ninja and
recently I've been seeing more and more
streamers wearing them so I wanted to
see what the hype was behind them are
they really good or is this just another
brand deal turned into a fad these
headphones are coming in at around 180
dollars and come in two different
versions the 80 ohm and a 250 ohm
version and I'll tell you guys which one
to use later on and why so let's go over
the design of these headphones they've
got that iconic black color with the
white grill inside that bear dynamic is
known for when you're wearing these
people are gonna know the ear cups
themselves are oval in shape and have
that sexy silver velour padding which
are very comfortable and surprisingly
they don't get that hot during extended
gaming sessions which is what we're all
looking for at the end of the day when
we're gaming the headband has a nice
clamping force on it so you won't be
snatching these off your head or when
you're just moving around from monitor
to monitor or during like an intense
battle these are gonna stay put now the
headband up top has faux leather that
can be replaced by just snapping it off
if it gets worn over time you've got
these wires coming down off the headband
into the ear cuff so be careful that you
don't catch these on anything or else
it'll be GG for these headphones the
cable is coiled and is not detachable
which I don't like because if something
happens it's another GG with replaceable
cables you can like just swap them out
if something goes wrong but here if this
goes out you're kind of done and I'm
just not a fan of that in 2019 we need
detachable cords it's got a regular
oxygen allowing you to plug it directly
into your computer sound card if need be
and it comes with a quarter inch adapter
to plug it into an amp overall the
lightness combined with a comfortable
headband and the ear cups make for an
enjoyable wearing experience overall so
let's talk a little bit about the sound
and the differences between the 80 ohm
and the 250 ohm so if you're going to be
plugging these straight into a source
like your phone or your computer then go
with the ATM
if you
an amp and just want a little bit less
Distortion go with the 250 ohm ohms is
the power needed to power the headphones
and most computers can't produce 250
ohms of power to these headphones which
is why you need an amp to boost the
signal I'll be dropping some cheap amp
options down below for you guys as well
as always I'm personally using the lakhs
GI p20 which is around $80 and it can
power these with no problem music-wise
though these are balanced studio
headphones with a slight emphasis on
treble which gives them that airiness
that translates to being a good stereo
gaming headset at times though the
trouble can be piercing I found it
happens but not too often these aren't
open-back headphones so there won't be a
lot of bass but there will be less
fatigue when wearing these because you
won't have that bass beating down on
your eardrums causing you to need to
like take a break from gaming these
sound average with most genres and music
and excel and musicality where there's
like a lot of instruments being played
like jazz and classical these are just
so-so for like rap and pop in my opinion
because of the lack of bass that's
associated with open-back headphones but
that kind of goes with the territory
when you're like dealing with an
open-back pair of headphones so that's
nothing new I found for gaming open-back
headphones like these are the best
you're going to hear explosions but
you're not going to feel them if that
makes sense it's not gonna be like a
razor or HyperX cloud or astral headset
out there but more of a subtle gaming
experience that you might have to get
used to if you're coming from a strictly
gaming headset background there's great
spatial awareness with these headphones
they aren't super wide when it comes to
soundstage but they are wide enough to
get the job done and then some I had no
problems placing my enemies in game and
destroying them so are these just a hype
train fad or are they actually good
gaming headphones and I have to say
these are very good headphones sprinkle
with a little bit of hype but that
doesn't change the fact that these are
still really good headphones you're
getting that great bear dynamic bill
construction with comfortable velour TAS
that don't get hot over time for one
hundred and eighty dollars they are a
great buy based off of those reasons
alone
but there are cheaper options out there
that will give you a similar experience
I feel alright guys that is gonna do it
