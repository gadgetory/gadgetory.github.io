review of the new matte-black Zoe s1 and
s2 now a lot of people love the Divina
s2 s myself included as it made its way
into my top three mouth video early this
year but there became an overwhelming
demand for a matte version as people
went as far as scrubbing off that glossy
coating I'm looking at you ready
no the glossy isn't my favorite but I
used the s2 because the shape was just
too good not to use so Zoe being the
amazing company that they are listened
to us as always and brought that classic
black color with a new matte black
coating to the s-1 and s2 series so
today I'll be going over my experience
with the new Zowie black matte S series
now big shout out to Zoe and a distinct
for sending me out this mouse for review
although all these opinions as always
guys are my own free to say whatever I
want so with all that being said let's
get into the review starting off with
what's in the box we get some extra
mouths feet in there which I haven't
seen another company do when I come to
think about it have you guys you also
get a sticker and of course the matte
black in all of its new matte black
sexiness the mouse weighs in at 86 grams
for the s2 and 92 grams for the s1
they've kept that same great
ambidextrous shape that's amazing for
claw grip users it's got that nice hump
in the back for your palm to rest on and
it's narrow at the front to kind of give
you that nice precise aim now the s2 is
gonna be free small to medium sized
hands out there or if you just like
small mice my hand size is 19
centimeters long by 8 point 5
centimeters wide and the s2 is my go-to
I'd say if your hands are on the bigger
side around 20 centimeters to 10
centimeters are bigger than the s1 would
be a better fit or if you like a mouse
to fill up most of your hands the s-1 is
gonna be for you
I personally perform best
smaller mine so I've always gone with
the s2 but the s-1 does fit my hand as
well the s-1 is almost like a final
Mouse but with a bigger hump in the back
for you claw grip users out there this
mouse is also great if you're a
fingertip grip user if your fingertip I
would go with the s2 you can use palm
grip but I'd recommend going with the
ec2 B as the hump in the back is
seemingly just made for claw grip and
your hand is gonna get fatigued by
laying it on that hump I must say guys
the zowie s2 is my daily reminder that
shape Trump's weight if you get a shape
that fits you and it feels natural
you'll be aiming down sights like none
other the new matte black coating feels
exceptional it has a very nice feel to
it if you try to slide your fingers on
the mouse buttons you'll feel some
resistance for sure now zowie has
definitely been working on their
coatings and this matte black is a
testament to that now all we need is
that matte fk2 with a 3360 sensors Aoi
pretty please don't know actually no I'm
dead serious can can we have that mouse
please it also keeps those two big
mouths feet as before some of the best
Mouse feet in the game currently that
are on their stock the core comes out at
an angle keeping the cord from dragging
on a mousepad
and it feels like the original Zoe
davina cord the cord doesn't drag too
much but I would still recommend using a
mouse bungee like a Zowie
Kumada until you paracord it the m1 and
the m2 on the mat s2 field great it's an
easy transition from any other mice that
you might be using currently the
switches they are using are the Hawaa no
switches which tend to be a little bit
stiffer but offer a more defined click
let's drop a sound test all right yeah
love it love it Zoe now let's do the
side buttons oh yeah so good there's
barely any travel on the side buns and
they are very easy to press I think they
kind of nailed it with the size of the
side buttons as well I mean what more
could you ask for the side buttons have
stayed glossy and it kind of like
reminds you where the side buttons are
as opposed to just
in on the side of the mouse which is
kind of nice the scrolling is nice and
defined not as harsh as some of the
others all you mice it feels like
they've reached kind of a great medium
with this mouse the DPI switch is on the
bottom of the mouse with the different
indicators for 400 800 1600 and 3200
also on the bottom there's another
button for the polling rate that also
controls up to ranges of 125 Hertz 500
Hertz and a thousand Hertz and for those
of you guys who don't know that just
controls the rate at which your computer
checks the connection of your mouse the
3360 sensor performs perfectly in game
no spin outs on my artisan zero my
artisan Radian or my artisan shooting
chi the Radian being one of the toughest
mouse pads from mice to track on so if
that sensor can track on that then it
can track on anything I kid you guys not
I try a lot of mice on the channel as
you guys know and I think I'll be
performing really really well with the
new Mouse and then I come back to the s2
and my aim just gets noticeably better
and as a clock reviews are out there and
sometimes actually hybrid over to a
fingertip grip when I want to like dial
in my tracking and stuff like that on a
target this mouse is perfect for that
I have yet to put my hands on another
Mouse that really really allows me
personally to do that and I know a lot
of you guys out there are claw grip or
some kind of hybrid and this is the
perfect hybrid Mouse I mean what's not
to love about this mouse if you are a
claw grip user or a fingertip grip user
and you haven't tried the s2 series yet
maybe because of that glossy coating
where the colors or whatever it was
now's your chance to make it right and
right that wrong and try one of my
favorite mice ever made the matte
coating feels exceptional it has great
weight distribution perfect 3360 sensor
that doesn't spin out on the craziest of
designer pass it's an easy
recommendation for me alright guys so
that is gonna do it for this review
