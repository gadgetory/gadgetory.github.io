with me eight o'clock in the morning
right now I'm on my way to work and you
will get to see everything alright guys
so today I'm going to be taking you
along for a full day of eating what I do
so for breakfast I actually do a break
fast so I break and I fast until about
12 30 so I'll just have a cup of coffee
this morning and that usually keeps a
more focused when I have food in the
morning I using it really sluggish my
work sucks I miss things so do it this
way I really found that I'm able to keep
my focus at work do a good job and also
to like when my time comes around like
I'm actually hungry you know I'm not
sitting there like off like trying to
force myself to force everything down
like I'm actually hungry and my eating
window since i get off at about
five-thirty and I work out and then I
don't get all I don't get home until
about 8 15 so that means of eating
another meal at about eight-thirty I
have a shake and then I have another
meal at about 830-9 so with that being
said like my eating windows pretty late
you know so people have the luxury of
just eating between maybe like eight and
six or whatever but I don't really have
that luxury since you know I'm not going
to be home all that often and I want to
eat right for the gem a huge meal
because it's just going to make me
sluggish so what I do is I just fast
until 12 and I move my eating window
back so i have about a nine hour ed
window and eight to nine hours and that
usually gets me pretty lean like I'm
already leaning out just in this first
week of doing this so definitely give it
a try if you can and see how it works
for you guys it works for me and I've
had a lot of success with it i was
skeptical at first because i had always
had a breakfast out of hollys has six
eggs bacon oatmeal all the all that
stuff and you know it's nice waking up
in the morning I haven't
but once you get to work what you gotta
do what you gotta do your sluggish you
know I don't care what you're doing so
test this out I'm going to take you guys
along I have to pick up my lunch from
safeway today so I'll take you guys
there with me or chipotle I don't know
I've been seeing a little bit more
results with the FitLife meals that I've
been getting from safeway so I'm going
to definitely i'm probably gonna stick
with that for now and pick up some rice
cakes and things like that so come along
with me today i'll show you what i do
for you know those are the people that
work and yeah see you it's fun size so
it doesn't count true story all right so
that big double piece of candy and you
saw from somebody's desk I headed out
had a bowl of candy bucket um so that
it's about twelve o'clock right now that
was my first thing to eat so I'm not
feeling too bad about it I'm gonna go
pick up a fit and healthy meal down the
street at safeway right now and I will
take you in there with me I got to pick
up some water to ever i'm a water bottle
for my branch chain amino acid so i have
to do that and what else don't have to
do that's pretty much it so i'm going to
show you what I get there and we're
going to make it and we're going to eat
it and have a good time and I'm
literally showing you guys everything
today and I want to explain the reason
why I did the twisting it's because you
know everybody gets down themselves and
they say oh man I can't resist I can't
do this that and you know I'm weak but
you really not I mean everybody does it
everybody goes through it you know just
minimize the
like the bad stuff that you eat you know
if you're gonna cheat don't go crazy
just have like a little little piece
whatever you know it's not gonna kill
you you know don't give up on the whole
thing you know that was the first thing
I have today I sell the horses day to
make this right make it the best day
that I can so just keep that mindset you
know and there's no way you're not going
to succeed and dieting I mean shit
happens but it's just about what's next
it's not about right now its neck so I'm
gonna show you guys what I really want
this is the true test right here me that
I have to ride past this on the way to
give my healthy meal fuck and we're here
all right so we're gonna move past the
chips
the beer
and what do you know
which one would you guys choose
i think i'm going to go with
I'm gonna go with a herb crusted chicken
no no I take that back to take that back
ok so I'm picking the one with the most
protein 48 grams as you see ya gonna go
with this one and get out of here
alright so here are my pew workout meals
right here the rice cakes caramel corn
gluten free there's the fun facts on
those yeah so I like to eat those right
before I do my workout because it gives
me a little it gives me energy
throughout and you know just gives me
carbs the sugar is going to be burned
off me it's three grams it's gonna be
burned off super quick you know it's no
problem so yeah so also i need to pick
up some water too so you need to find
those next arrowhead if you're watching
this I hate your water tastes like
somebody bathed in it so now go with
this a fresh drinking water all right I
have a chicken and some string beans and
some brown rice and beans 48 grams of
protein right there it's good not too
salty oh wait I'm filming this upside
down not too salty um a little bit of
flavor they're still good that's what I
need right now so oh yeah gonna keep
this real quick cuz I'm hungry it's
about twelve-thirty so yeah I'll be back
with you guys later you know I'm gonna
have to rice cakes too as well so
there's that all right
okay so if we have to film last night
but this is what i had last night two
pieces of flavor got chicken about 7
ounces the same thing when I have for
lunch a little extra so you guys leave a
bonus day and a half of evening
