another motivational Monday let's kick
some asses monday the story I want to
start off with is speeding and that's
what we're going to change today is your
speeding have as you been speeding this
week and I know it I'm just kidding so
we're going to talk about this analogy
and the situation is your driving 50
miles per hour in a 50 mile per hour
zone and now you're going into a 35 mile
per hour zone what's most likely going
to happen in that situation you're going
to go maybe 45 maybe 40 and nothing is
really gonna change you're going to
speed through now let's say there's a
cop monitoring this 35 mile-per-hour
zone hmm you're gonna go that 35 miles
per hours maybe 36 if you're if you're a
daredevil but odds are that's not going
to be the case and the same thing goes
with life but luckily you have your own
monitor and that's you you yeah I'm
talking to you and the way we can do
this is by asking ourselves the right
questions at night after our day is done
to monitor our progress a lot of people
don't do this or if they do they write
their goals as oh how did I feel today
how did I feel that I did on my diet and
you say well I feel pretty bad about it
i mean i still feel that I I still feel
like I haven't lost the weight etc etc
and most likely what's going to happen
is you're gonna focus on the feelings
you're going to feel bad and there
you're gonna quit what this question did
i do my best to stay on my diet does is
it get you thinking about the effort
necessary to finish this goal so you can
what i do is i write a list every night
did i do my best to stay on my diet did
i do my best
be the best husband/wife
boyfriend/girlfriend that you can be did
I do my best to save money did i do my
best to be the best worker coworker etc
etc and you want to rate yourself from
one to ten every night on a piece of
paper or on your phone your choice but I
like to write it down because it feels
more permanent so I write it down write
down my score and let's say I get myself
like a six then I started thinking about
me how could I to have stayed on my diet
may be making my lunch right instead of
going out or maybe knowing that I might
eat something bad later on in the day so
I kind of prepare for that and I have
something ready when I get home I can
just throwing a microwave and I don't
have to think of make it easy for myself
to succeed thinking about proactive ways
you can do things that is how we create
changing in our behaviors it doesn't
have to be just about your diet it could
be anything you want to change
confidence if you want to have more
self-esteem if you want to feel happier
like rate yourself did I do my best to
make myself happy today just saying that
say that right now and see how you feel
you're gonna feel way different than
thinking was I happy today and then
you're not really focused on the things
you could do tomorrow maybe right then
and there give it at home maybe watching
my favorite television show right now is
going to make me happy or listening to
my favorite music is going to make me
happy right now you can ride then in
there do the thing that will make you
happy and get that score up so much you
guys to do is for two weeks I want to
challenge you guys and it should be like
all the time with any behavior that you
want to change because we're always
changing we're all trying to get better
so this is a good way to monitor and
actually help you get those changes
going for yourself so I need this this
week I'm
going through some salary negotiations
and knowing my worth so it really is
just going to listen being like did I do
my best getting my self-esteem up my
confidence so I can go out there and get
the best because not only do I deserve
the best you guys deserve the best and I
want the best for you guys you know we
shouldn't be settling for less than that
in this life so go out there kill this
week i will see you guys next week thank
you guys for all the support and
watching the video if you guys liked the
video hit that thumbs up button I really
appreciate it subscribe if you haven't
already all those good things and I will
see you guys next week it's your boy BTW
