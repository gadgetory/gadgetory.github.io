with another review today I'm gonna be
looking at the WI 1000 X's by Sony now
you guys know that I am NOT a big fan of
Nick dance in fact I hate them
I don't think they're really worth it
they're supposed to add in all this
technology whether that's more battery
noise cancellation and nothing has ever
really quite delivered for me at least
so I'm always skeptical I almost didn't
want to review these because for that
reason but I decided to give them a
chance it is Sony and they've been kind
of killing it in the head phone game
lately so I wanted to check these out
and see what I could find let's kick
this review off with the comfort and
design aesthetically these look amazing
and they feel amazing on your neck and I
think it's due to having this leather on
the back side of the neck band it also
has this very nice rubber on the inside
which doesn't really tug it yourn and
the way these are really shaped they're
not gonna slide around on me like some
headphones like some other neck band
headphones that just like choke you you
know you get up from the bench and it's
just all on your neck and that's
something that I really appreciated
about these headphones so good job on
the aesthetics they have that black and
gunmetal and silver look to them that I
really enjoy about the latest Sony
headphones so really nice job there now
they come with some great accessories
which I really like I like that they
have a USB 2 3.5 millimeter
headphone cord they also have a airplane
adapter which is very nice they also
have a carrying case which you know a
big fan of I wish it was a hard case but
I mean what are you gonna do at least I
gave you something right and they also
give you a wide variety of shapes and
sizes and materials of foam tips and
silicone tips I found that the smaller
foam tips work the best for me they
almost feel like a like a silicone
plastic foam Hybrid which will last
longer than some comp like it's the one
that I did a video on but they're not as
comfortable and they don't form to ear
quite like the complex hip to do so you
give up longevity for comfort so and
they stayed in my ear pretty well
speaking of which let's talk about the
earbuds themselves now these actually
feel pretty good I like that they feel a
little bit hefty to give it a nice solid
quality feel you know you're paying $300
for these so they actually do feel very
nice and I like having them in my ear
they don't really slide out or fall out
a lot in the neck band as with the
stability now on the actual neck band
something that I really appreciate about
these is the power button the volume
button and the press play pause button
these are very easy to press when
skipping back or forwards and songs the
actual press play button when you tap it
three times or two times it actually
feels very nice in your hand and it
actually works I haven't missed tapped
this at all the volume buttons feel
great too something that I've never
really experienced with any neck band
earbud so good job Sony on the design of
these headphones now one thing that was
annoying me was the length of the actual
cord on the earbud now this was getting
wrapped around the neck band and then
the Airbus would tuck out of my ear but
wait Sony's already ahead of the game
they have this little crevice right here
would you just slide some of the cord in
and you can adjust it to how long you
want the cord length to be put in your
ears boom you're done so all in all I
really like the design of these
headphones the materials that they give
you all feel really nice and they just
screen quality so already on their way
to change my mind about neck bands all
right now moving on to the sound now
this is where I was very impressed these
probably are the best sounding ear buds
wirelessly that I've ever tried period
they sound amazing this neck band
actually has some power in it and it
powers these nine millimeter drivers
very nicely I was very surprised not
having to tinker with any of the
customizations of the app or making
different selling profiles just right
out of the box
these sounded great and that just want
to keep listening to music when I had
these on these are great for everything
there's just so much separation you can
hear it there's soundstage everywhere
it's just amazing I love listening to
acoustic stuff with a lot of
instrumentals do you guys like Odessa
I love Odessa if you like a desk write
down in the comments I love Odessa and
these sounded great I listened to their
new album all the way through and I just
could not get enough of these headphones
do I think they're worth $300 over like
something like a jaybird where you can
customize your headphones that depends
and I'll get to that later but yeah
these are gonna satisfy most people and
with the customizations in the app you
can adjust the sound profiles to
whatever you like it has a dsee
which bumps up your music from mp3
quality up into a lossless type file it
gains a lot of the the data back that
you're losing through getting that
smaller mp3 size or streaming or
anything like that so it's really nice
and my music actually does sound better
with these headphones on so all in all
the sounds I mean these are looking
pretty good so far the sound is good the
comfort and design is good the north's
cancellation now
this is something where Jay bird and
powerbeats and all of them cannot
compete they cannot compete because they
need that you can have the earbuds in
you can have the competitive and through
that you'll gain some isolation but with
these these actually will knock out a
lot of the sound and for some of you
guys that do bike riding these are gonna
be great because they have a wind
reduction setting in the app isn't that
cool I know a lot of you guys talk to me
about that like maybe you're running
outside or you're biking and you hear
that wind rushing by you and you're just
like man I can hear everything
especially with the Bose sound sport
Wireless I was getting a lot of
complaints about that so bikers these
could be for you now speaking of the app
I've already gone over this in my 1000
xm2 video but I just want to touch on
some of the things that like you know
you can customize how much ambient noise
you want to let in they have
customizations for taking into
consideration where you are whether
that's walking or you're in the gym on a
treadmill or whatever it listens to your
environment and it actually tailors your
sound to where you're at so it's not
very cool I like the technology in the
now the call quality these hands down
guys are the best for phone calls these
sound crystal-clear so if you're
somebody that is primarily gonna be
using these four calls this is where the
neckband comes into play where the
benefits of having this neck band you
get a better mic in here instead of
having just a little cheap thing on one
side of your earphone so call quality if
that's important to you guys definitely
look into getting these now the
connectivity the range is great I was
able to walk further than my Jaybirds so
that's another good thing they put a
good receiver you know all this space in
here great now the battery life is
something that really disappointed me
now for how big these are you know this
neck band is big why are they only
putting 10 hours in here
I don't get it this should be putting at
least 20 hours into these headphones at
this point right these are not gonna
last on a flight I just had a 16-hour
flight these will not last and that
needs to change and especially for how
big this is there's no reason why the
power bees three can have 12 hours of
battery life and they can't figure out
how to put ten hours of battery life in
here more than 10 hours I should say
what gives Sony what gives I just want
to know so that's something that's one
major complaint that I have about these
they charge kind of slow as well I
couldn't find any information on with a
quick charger nut but they do last for
the actual ten hours and once you do get
that full charge these are a beast you
will get that ten hours let's just say
that so do I think these are worth three
hundred dollars do I think the added
size having this on your neck is worth
the three hundred dollars double the
price of something similar compared to
something similar with no neck band
that's Wireless and that's a loaded
question but here at BT unplugged BT
gives you the real one I'm not gonna
beat around the bush and say oh well you
know that's up to you to decide I'm just
gonna tell you guys what I think I think
that if I were gonna get these if I was
gonna have a neck band and I wanted them
for travel I think I would just go up
and get the 1000 X M twos or some Bose
QC 35 s if I really wanted some noise
cancellation headphones because I don't
think having this neck band is worth
only 10 hours you're gonna need more
than that if you travel right okay so
let me tell you who these are for I
think these are gonna be for people that
are biking I think that's the best if
you're a biker if you do a lot of
outdoor activities and you want that
complete isolation
sound and you're commuting a lot maybe
just short commutes maybe on a train or
subway system these are gonna be great
and you need that added noise
cancellation to get rid of that sound
these are gonna be miles ahead of any
bozer j-bird out there right now with no
neck band so that's who these are for at
the end of the day what I spend $300 on
them as opposed to just getting some
over ears probably not probably now I'm
gonna be honest with you guys
probably not but they are a very good
headphone and if you are in the market
for this type of headphone they are
great is that fair I feel like that's
pretty fair alright guys so thank you
