with my dad beats X and my dead beats
studio to wireless yes yes I know it's
very sad times they were both some of my
favorite earbuds and headphones for the
gym and now they've fallen from grace
after about a year of use on the beats X
and about two years on the Beats Studio
wireless twos you know electronics don't
last forever at least not in this case
beats don't we all know no matter how
good they sound headphones will always
run the risk of electronics failing from
wear and tear shorts and the cords and
things like that I mean I paid a hundred
and fifty dollars for these bad boys
plus tax which isn't cheap and as I said
they only lasted me for about a year so
it got me thinking how much usage do you
have to get out of your headphones
before you get your money's worth or do
you need them to last forever until you
upgrade to really warrant the price I
mean usage also varies from person to
person I mean some people use them at
the gym and some only use them for home
and office usage with low wear and tear
so for me I'm a heavy user I use mine
24/7 with constant charging and the
batteries don't they don't charge as
well as when I first got them electronic
shorts may happen it's all relative in
my opinion of course we want them to
last forever but that in my experience
is not always the case so I posed this
question to you how long do your
headphones need to last for you to feel
like you got your money's worth are you
more likely to buy again from that
company if your headphones died but you
really like their product their
headphones because I'm struggling right
now rather to buy another pair of the
beats X or just move on to a more stable
brand let me know down below what I
should do and what you guys usually do
alright guys so that is gonna do it for
this video just a quick and short video
I just had this topic on my mind of
course both these headphones are broken
for me in the last two months so I'm
really disappointed in B
especially for the price so yeah what
can we do don't forget to Like share
comment and subscribe on this video for
more content like this and I'll see you
guys in the next video has been your boy
bTW saying peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
