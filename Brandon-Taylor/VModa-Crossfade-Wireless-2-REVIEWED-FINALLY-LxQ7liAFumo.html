with another review today I'm going to
be taking a look at a pair of headphones
you guys have been asking for for weeks
I know I know that I got some about two
weeks ago and I really wanted to take my
time with them and make sure that they
were all they could be because the
crossfade Wireless twos coming in about
$350 plus tax for the appx version so I
really want to make sure I could
wholeheartedly recommend these to you
guys before dropping that kind of dough
so let's start off with the comfort and
design one thing that I love about the
be modus is there is low-profile they
stick close your head they say out of
your way for workouts and everyday life
the build quality I'm used to a lot
better than the originals from the
breakable band to the ear cut the ear
cuffs clamped down to give you great
exhalation without being too
uncomfortable
I find that about two hours in though
that my jaw did get a little bit
fatigued also if you're like me and you
like to wear your headphones like this
with one ear cuff off it can get a
little uncomfortable sometimes and one
thing I always worry about with the
v-moda business metal band part right
here I always feel like it's going to
break or dent and you know how metals
Bend and they get a little crease and it
can't come out yeah that's no bueno so I
think they need to make that a little
bit thicker in the next design once they
do give you this great case we can store
these in they fold up in a different way
a lot smaller than the original v-moda
which is a nice touch if you like to
travel with these or if you plenty well
if you're just planning on taking them
around a lot and throwing them in your
bag I also love the charging courses
they provide it it's great the 3.5 no
meter cords braided and also very nice
everything in the package it just makes
it seem like it's worth of $350 so all
in all I loved the build quality is a
comfort and design team heads up and
they've also made the buttons on the
side of the headphones a lot better
before and a lot of people complained
that they felt cheap that is no more
he's so great so let's move on to the
sound around and the original cross
chain wireless I felt like it had good
sound but it felt like something was
lacking in the mids in the vocal
Department well looks like we've oh no
did watch my last review on them because
the stone has really improved on these
the mid sound great now these headphones
are super well balanced just enough
stuff in the bass vocals are clear and
forward and the highs are too harsh they
go with any genre from classic to rap to
heavy metal these will take down
anything you throw at them so I'm going
to go as far as to say that these are
the best sounding wireless cause you can
buy at a moment if you're looking purely
for sound quality without the noise
cancellation which does affect sound
quality quite a bit then look no further
so before we leave the sound route I do
want to say to you guys that these sound
great for movies it sounds like you have
a little IMAX theater on your head
whether it's guns or explosion or if you
want to watch la-la-land
it hey whatever floats your boat it
sounds great
okay now the battery life is rated at
about 14 hours which is a bit
disappointing
I know seeing as like companies like
Apple have theirs at 40 hours on the
sole of three is now both Sony are
offering 20 plus hours with noise
cancellation all in all the battery life
if you're a traveler is so if you're
just using their for everyday life I
think 14 hours is going to be enough
time and that's what I've gotten with
you so I can't tell you guys otherwise
now I know some of you guys on ask
about the call body now these sound
great no interruption the connectivity
was great I love wearing you to places
like the gym because it really gives me
a chance to bureau up people with a lot
of Bluetooth devices to see will sis
have an eruption so there being a break
up static things like that
none whatsoever the range on these is
great I work at a lab and we have this
big cold room that I go into sometimes
and just have so the wall is about let's
hand off a foot thick it's cold in there
and I wore these in there long my phone
was in the other side of lab and these
still transmitted sounds without any
breakups so if you're worried about
connection don't you don't have to Aziz
now in conclusion for $300 for getting
the apt X version of the Cross Wireless
tubes
this is speech I'm not going to lie and
at first I was playing it wants to pay
for $350 headphones with no noise
cancellation they have got to be out of
their mind but what I bought them and
add them in my hands and I saw the
package that they're offering they're
giving the best time quality the highest
material the newest technology for
wireless sound by the way ap txt just
increases the sound quality over
Bluetooth if you're just looking for
purely a excellent and sound quality you
don't care about noise cancellation thin
I will go as far as to say that these
are the best on the market these are the
best sounding head sources and get I'll
get these over the SOL freeze any day of
the week they just sound so much better
I'll love to see in the future for
v-moda to release some kind of North
cancellation version I mean the ear cups
and the clamping does provide a lot of
isolation enough but for travel I think
that if they were their release that
noise
version that they would be a hit they
wouldn't there would be no competition
on the market I don't know how much it
was selling for because they're selling
these for so much but a guy can dream so
b-mode if you're watching this come out
with the north cancellation version I
want to see what you guys can do sound
quality wise if you guys can keep the
same sound with grading with
cancellation that would be a great feat
all right guys - all in all I do
recommend these if you have the extra
cash and you love sound quality toward
these and yeah like share comment and
