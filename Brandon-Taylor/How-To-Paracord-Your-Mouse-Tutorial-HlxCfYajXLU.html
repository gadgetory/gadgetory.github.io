the highly requested tutorial on how to
pair recorder your mouse now a lot of
you guys saw in my artisan mousepad
video that my ABS too has changed it now
has a paracord on it now if you don't
know what a paracord does or what it is
it's this material that is very very
flexible it's very very soft and it
doesn't get in the way of your mouse and
makes your mouth feel like it's almost
Wireless so I know that it can be a
little bit intimidating opening your
mouth and putting a new cord in it
there's a lot of electronics going on in
there
so I want to make this as easy as
possible for you guys so that you can do
this on your own step-by-step you guys
ready let's jump into it I hope this is
why I did enough so you guys can see
everything but of course all you're
gonna need is your mouse you're going to
need your paracord and you are gonna
need your precision screwdriver and
these are like the ones that used to
like open your glasses and things like
that I believe the one that I'm using is
a 1.8 and I'm just using a flathead so
yeah you can just pick these up at the
store they're pretty cheap and you're
also gonna need a lighter because we're
gonna melt these black pieces right here
so yeah one tip that I have when you are
doing this when you're starting to
paracord this Mouse is when you take off
your hyper glass or your stock mouse
feet you only need to take off the back
one for the zowie mice but I think the
Logitech ones you have to take off to on
some of them or four on some of the old
zowie mice but what I want to say to you
guys my recommendation is don't rip like
this don't come across it and be really
forceful with it try to lift like that
like so because if you try to like rip
it begins to like fold the mouse feet
and we try to put the mouse feedback on
there it's not gonna be a pretty sight
and it's not gonna be a smooth ride for
you so yeah that's tip number one when
doing this all right I think this is all
we need
this one's a Philips it's a little bit
more grip there we go so yeah in the
Zowie is just one screw so that the
screw place it down right here and now
this shell should come off and voila so
now I'll leave this as is some of the
others all you mice I think like the s2
the ribbon is actually connected to the
top so usually when that happens I just
leave the ribbon going to the top I
don't really change it so next up we
have to take out the cord so the cord is
right here okay and it wraps around here
so pay attention to how this cord is
wrapping around all right so that
actually took a lot of force to get
those screws out right there but we're
just going to remove this top piece and
on the zowie s2 that piece is actually
connected to the top so like so
shimmy this out of here like so
there's your old cord you can save it
for later I don't know if you ever want
to keep this or maybe you want to switch
back for some reason maybe don't like
your paracord but uh I don't see that
happening so the first thing you want to
do
I went preparing your your cord is melt
this part so you want to use the blue
flame portion which is this lure which
is the top P fair
so just go kind of along with that with
a blue portion that kind of keeps that
in place alright so now what you have to
do this plug this in and then what you
want to do is you want to wrap this
around like it would be coming out of
the mouse like so just like that so you
kind of can gauge where this black piece
should go right here there's two little
black pieces and it just goes right into
that piece you're gonna place it just
about where the court should be alright
and then go over it with the flame just
like we did that other one and again
using the blue portion of the flame
which is like closest to the nozzle of
the flame or a nozzle of your lighter I
should say I'm just going to go over
that till it's nice and tight we don't
want that movie
so now just have to place everything
back that's pretty much the gist of the
cord right there okay so we're just
gonna put these screws in it's gonna be
a little difficult I guess the best way
to do it is kind of like have them kind
of fall in there it looks like it looks
like the best way to do it and we got
the last one right here
make sure that's down in there and voila
your paracord is in there guys
with the EC to be this thing is really
really finicky but what you have to do
is you have to just place the shell and
then screw it it's not like the s2 or
you can just lay it on there you got to
actually screw it in for it to be in
place all right we're learning as we go
folks so I'm gonna keep screwing this
out a little bit so now we have the
paracord in there the base is screwed on
nice and tight it's on there and yeah so
now all we have to do is since you
nicely took off your hyper glide all you
have to do is
I place it on there and we are done look
at that beautiful paracord guys this
thing not only is it
ergonomic now it has one of the best
chords on the market right now for
gaming this thing is just light it's not
look at this there's gonna be no drag at
all with this thing so yeah I'm gonna go
I'm gonna plug this in just to show you
guys that it works
it's a pray for me for a little bit pray
for BT hashtag and it lights up and I'm
on the desktop right now and it is
working so yeah now I've got a pair of
corded hyper glided EC to be alright
guys so that is gonna do it for this
tutorial I hope you guys found this
