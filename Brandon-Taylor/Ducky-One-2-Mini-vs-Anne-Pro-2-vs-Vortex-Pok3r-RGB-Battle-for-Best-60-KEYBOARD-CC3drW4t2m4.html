the better you've all been waiting for
all I've seen in the comments since
making the ducky one too many and pro
two and vortex poker reviews is hey BTW
doing a 60% keyboard battle hey BTW do a
60% keyboard battle hey BTW do it okay
well guys your wish is my command you
say jump and I say how high
just kidding but I am here to help you
guys and I'm not gonna be one of those
reviewers that just does a battle and
dances around who is the winner I'm
gonna be letting you guys know what
keyboard is the best and why I'll be
breaking down these keyboards in a
couple of different areas like build
quality design key cap quality macro
abilities ease of use connectivity and
just overall experience using it during
typing and gaming now if you want full
reviews and details of each of these
keyboards I'll link all of my reviews
down below if you haven't already go
enter that ant pro to giveaway happening
now and also make sure you're subscribed
because there may or may not be another
giveaway in March just sayin
alright anyways guys let's just start
this thing off with the build quality
and these keyboards and choose the one I
think is the best
now the ducky one too many and the am
Pro to have plastic basis and also drive
down the cost of each the ducky one too
many is coming in at $99 and they are in
high demand because of well let's just
be honest II foo now the am pro 2 can be
found for about 75 dollars plus shipping
and the weight is about a month since
they are coming from China unless you
want to get it from Amazon but then
you're paying $25 more I think it comes
out to about $95 with Prime so yeah
that's something to consider to be
honest I didn't really expect much from
the am Pro - as far as build quality
because of the horror stories I heard
but it's actually held up a really well
I've never had any reason to question
the build quality the ducky went to many
is the lightest but it feels like the
most solid meanwhile the vortex poker
has an aluminum base which is definitely
noticeably heavier after holding the
other two it really gives it that hefty
quality feeling to it I think most of us
equate quality with that
Venis but all three are made like
amazingly well and you don't have to
worry about any of these breaking down
because these are some of the top 60%
keyboards on the market now you do have
to pay a significant price for this
aluminum base at $140 which can be a
major flaw for some people overall for
me though the build quality feels best
on that ducky one too many especially
for the price to performance the plastic
of the ducky feels very light but sturdy
and is slightly better than the am pro 2
for around 15 dollars more and although
having an aluminum base is nice on the
poker it's not really necessary unless
you want to have that feeling of a heavy
keyboard so let's move on to the design
of the keyboards now the poker and the
am pro 2 are roughly the same size with
very small bezels the keys of the am pro
to sit in the actual frame of the
keyboard while the edges of the poker
are completely gone giving it that
raised look and allowing the RGB to
shine through onto your desk doing this
in turn leaves a white plate of the
poker exposed which I'm not a fan of
personally I like that while the ducky
one too many and the approach to both
have white plates they are hidden by the
frame the ducky frame is black up top
and white on bottom while the other two
are just all black the ducky one too
many also has keyboard kick stands which
allow you to put it at three different
levels to give you more of a tailored
experience while the other two don't
have any kick stance and are fixed now
although they are fixed I feel like both
have very nice slopes me personally I
like having the flexibility of the kick
stands for the design round I have to
give it to the ducky though for its
keyboard kickstand feet and its unique
design with the black and white frame if
someone has a ducky 1/2 mini you're
gonna know it now the key caps on the
ducky one too many and am pro 2 are both
rocking double shot PBT which I feel
like is amazing and they'll last you a
long time the poker is using ABS key
caps and they have somewhat of a grainy
texture to them I have to say though
guys this can be a personal preference
but for me personally I would go with
the longer lasting key caps now I know
this is a small thing but I really like
the fun on the ducky one too many keys
better than the amp rote
- now I don't know if this really
matters to you guys or not I know I'm a
sucker for those extra colored key caps
and those exclusive key caps I can just
be found with the keyboard itself
without having to buy them
it just gives your keyboard some
personality and it gets you more excited
to try more key caps in the future now
this is where I think that Becky went
too many and the amp√®re to excel the
ducky one too many comes with a few
color key caps but to shift delete an
escape Keys and the year of the dog
spacebar which is included as guys I
know I get a lot of questions about that
in my comments now the am pro 2 comes
with a teal yellow green and pink key
caps that I think personally looks sick
when somebody has those on you know they
have a ham Pro - now the vortex poker
comes as is no extra key caps not even a
key cap puller so for this round I
believe it's a tie between the am Pro 2
and the ducky one-to-many now for
connectivity it's easy it's an pro 2 it
comes with USB C and Bluetooth
connectivity whereas the ducky
one-to-many only has USB C and the poker
has a micro USB which is becoming a
little bit dated at this point the
Bluetooth of the am pro 2 is very nice
because it allows you to have a very
nice clean set up with no wires when
combined with like a wireless mouse it
charges fast and lasts up to eight hours
you can also use it while it's charging
as well which is awesome next let's talk
about the macros and the custom key
assignments because going from a full
size keyboard to a 60% keyboard can be a
bit strange at first but having the
ability to create macros can give you
some peace of mind
now the am pro 2 is an amazing gateway
keyboard into 60% keyboards because of
its ability to let you get your arrow
keys back by not only holding down the
function I J and K and L like other
keyboards to be nested they allow you to
just quickly tap the shift function one
function to and control buttons on the
right side yeah
my mind was blown when I first
discovered this at 2:00 now all have the
ability to create macros and changed RGB
on board but the am pro 2 comes with
software where you can just customize
RGB and macro settings I think this is
awesome because you can change your mind
grows and RGB fast but being able to
visually see what you've already
assigned is kind of priceless in my
opinion check out my other videos on how
to set up macros for each but for now I
will say for customizing RGB and macros
and pro 2 takes the cake with the ducky
1/2 mini amp ogre being pretty much tae
RGB everything who does it the best you
can customize each to match your setup
that's not a problem and they all do it
in similar ways the poker RGB will give
you more shine because of that open
casing that we talked about earlier
whereas the am pro 2 and ducky want to
block some of that light coming out of
those sides sadecki one-to-many also has
games on the keyboard which is kind of
cool and unique but for overall RGB the
winner for me is the poker RGB it just
has like different things like the
vortex RGB mode instead of the normal
wave mode I mean come on it looks
absolutely sick so the amp Row 2 uses
different switches namely Gator on which
after my testing fist a little bit
smoother than Cherry MX and essentially
it's higher on the key press now
switches are a personal preference but
Gator ons have really grown on me lately
also the stabilizers on the amp Row 2
are actually really really good almost
the best out of the three I would say
that ducky just narrowly liked edges it
out very slightly but what surprises to
me is that the amp Row 2 stabilizers are
just way better than the pokers which is
unacceptable for $140 for that keyboard
in my opinion
alright guys so we've come to the end of
the video and it's time to pick a winner
and I told you I wouldn't dance around
the topic now I love all of these
keyboards equally but if I had to
recommend or only have one of these
keyboards it would be the ducky one too
many for $99 the light bill quality and
design are exceptional it's got p bt
double shot key caps USBC a great macro
system and the RGB looks dope my second
choice would be the ampere - for the
price you can't beat it but for me
personally I rarely use the Bluetooth
and I find eight hours too short for
most of my needs so for me I usually was
just keeping it plugged in
the time so I mean I have a feeling that
most of you guys have you're a hardcore
gamer you're gonna have it plugged in
because you don't want it to die a while
you're mid game now I do love the
software and its ease of use and I think
if you guys are kind of worried about
getting a 60% keyboard that is the one
to get because it has amazing software
to program it dope RGB and the tapping
for arrow keys is just amazing no matter
how you look at it for three plays I'm
giving it to the vortex poker it's an
amazing keyboard but I think the price
tag kind of kills it for most people it
is the most available so sometimes
people are willing to pay that extra fee
just to have a 60% keyboard and to that
I just say do you do you because why not
you know if you want that keyboard the
poker might be a great choice but I
think that $140 price tag kills it for
most people in that case I would just
pay the extra $40 and get the master up
alt instead it's got the RGB it's got
the layers and macros but for most
people you won't need that aluminium
base to be honest with you alright guys
so that is gonna do it for this battle
if you have any more questions let me
know down below and I'll be sure to
answer you it has been your boy BT
notification squad what is up with it do
I will see you in the comments it has
been your boy BT Sam peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
