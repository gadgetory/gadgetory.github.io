with another motivation of monday today
we're going to be talking about fear
false evidence appearing real now in our
minds we have all these events that are
happening whether it's a plane crash you
have a fear of the plane crashing while
you're on it while you have the fear of
losing your job not being accepted by
your peers etc etc it goes on and on we
have all these fears going throughout
mind all day and when I can say is we
only look at the false evidence we only
look at this event is happening we don't
look at what are the steps i'm going to
take after that do you ever do that you
just stop at the event most likely so
what we have to do is we have to say
okay if that were event were to happen
what would I do what are the steps let's
say your fear of losing your job right
being fired coming in one day you see
yourself being fired was the next thing
that you're going to do well maybe I
know this person at this job well that's
probably what I would do next I'll call
this person or I know that they're
hiring over here I'll have my resume
ready so if anything were to happen i'll
have it ready to fire off to all these
companies and i will find a job within a
couple months and i have maybe i have a
savings as well so maybe i can pay my
rent pay my bills and all that and I'll
be okay for a couple of months so I
guess it's not all bad right I guess
it's not all that it's cracked up to be
so that's what we have to do with our
fears is really examine them be like
okay this event could happen what are
the steps that I'm going to take to
rectify these situations these handle
these situations our fear is that we
cannot handle the situation that comes
to us but if we plan for it we can
handle it right we can see ourself
handling in the situation and that will
give you confidence self-esteem all of
which will lead to
you handling your day-to-day activities
better so don't just stop that your
fears don't just stop that things that
are these events that you have in your
mind go beyond be better plan and tackle
on all these things because you guys can
handle it I can handle it you guys can
handle it hard or easy it doesn't matter
we can take them all down all these
fears that probably will never happen we
can handle them anyways we can handle
them in our mind and when we practice
handling it in our mind then when it
comes to us in real life we can handle
it there again that's all I'm saying
we'll be ready so take this this week
guys kill the week I will see you guys
next monday work hard work hard that's
all i gotta say work hard peace
