with another motivational Monday today I
want to talk to you guys about a cool
new trick that I found out this past
week it's from a book called the
five-second rule by Mel Robbins this
five-second rule is set to change your
life because our brains after five
seconds let's say you have an idea let's
say you have a goal in mind and you have
an idea for that goal hey maybe I need
to do X to get this goal or you have an
idea that can better your business help
your grades about five seconds what this
says is that we will our brain within
sabotages and talked us out of doing
that thing that we need to be doing so
you have five seconds so you count down
in your head five four three two one and
then by that time by the time you hit
one you need to be doing some sort of
action whether it's small or big towards
whatever idea that you just had if you
don't do it guess what your brain is
going to switch on and then it's going
to talk you out of it you're going to go
into that mode where you want to be
comfortable think about how many times
we have all these great ideas and a
couple minutes later we're talking
ourselves out of it we're talking
ourselves out of the thing out of the
gold out of the habits that we want to
create and that can better our lives but
we don't do it we continue and we let
our brain take over for us and really
sabotage us so this week try this
countdown five seconds in your head and
by that time realize that by the time
you hit that one you need to be doing
that thing sometimes like if and if I
have an idea for a video I'll just take
out my phone and write down that idea
write down a couple points about it
and I could talk about some way to
better my videos so try this week less
thinking more doing you need to be
taking action within five seconds of
having that thought that you know that
can change your life and this let me
give before we go let me give one other
example one other example is that let's
say you want to wake up early but you're
always later you hit snooze love that
warm comfortable bed she gives this
example you love that warm bed you don't
want to get out into the cold and stand
up and be like ah but guess what when
you go to sleep thinking okay I need to
get up within five seconds of realizing
it get out of your bed stand up that is
the hardest part
get the ball rolling once you're out a
bit guess what you're going to be able
to get your day going started and feel
more motivated and feel more in control
so try this out this week try the
five-second roll let me know how it goes
down when it comes below as always and I
will see you guys the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
