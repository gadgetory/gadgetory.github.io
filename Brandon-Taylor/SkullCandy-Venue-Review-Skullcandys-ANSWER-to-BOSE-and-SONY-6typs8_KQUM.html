again with another review today we're
going to be taking a look at the
Skullcandy QuietComfort 35s aka the
Venues now this is their first attempt
at a noise cancellation over ear
headphone so let's see today have they
master Dave can they compete with the
big dogs like Bo's and Sony but before I
begin guys don't forget to hit that
subscribe button for more content like
this and also follow me on Twitter you
can also contact me on there if you have
any questions as well as the comments
down below I'll always answer you guys
or do my best to now upon opening the
box you will find the case this case is
actually really nice I like the feel of
it it feels similar to the 1000 X and 3
box then you're gonna find a 3.5
millimeter cord and the USB charger in
there it's pretty standard upon picking
up the headphones I noticed that they're
a little bit creaky like you guys hear
that these things creak when they move
around so you might annoy the people
around you and it makes me kind of
question the build quality of these
headphones and I'm sure anybody taking
these out of the packaging will think
the same so I wish these were a little
bit more solid out of the box so that
people will feel like they got a hundred
and eighty dollar headphone but for the
most part the leather ear cuffs feel a
really premium they do get a little bit
hot and they do press a little bit
against your ear that being said that
same pressure creates a great seal
better than I think Sony and Bose and
the headband has metal inside so you
will be getting some protection there I
wouldn't push it too far with these
headphones I wish that it was a little
bit better on the build quality side on
the left ear cup you will find a power
button with an indicator which I is
always appreciated
a noise cancellation button for the
noise cancellation which we'll get into
later also on the right ear cup you'll
find the volume controls with a kind of
a quick attention feature which is cool
where you can just hit this button and
it will dampen your music kind of like
Sony's features so I like that they
added that in that's great for like when
you're in an airport and you need to
hear announcements and things like that
other than that I love the color of
these you guys know I love low-profile
the matte black finish on these is
amazing yeah
so overall the build quality could be
better get rid of the creepiness but I
do like the bud layout so when it comes
to the sound these headphones I'm not
gonna lie to you guys they need a burn
in period right out of the box
I was pretty concerned because they
sounded super muddy they did not sound
like in a hundred and eighty dollar pair
of bluetooth headphones so I let them
burn in for a little bit and to my
surprise the vocals became nice and warm
those mid tones the sub bass is not
there with these headphones which I'm
surprised because that is what Skull
Candy has made their name off of instead
there's a lot of mid to upper bay is
kind of like the Bose QC three fives
which is why I kind of alluded to them
being kind of in competition so more of
a neutral sounding headphone from Skull
Candy witches are very surprising but I
kind of see where they're going they're
trying to make kind of like a travel
line with these and that is much
appreciated it's something different so
different strokes for different folks
you know not everybody is into bass I
know a lot of people are myself included
but not always that being said these go
with rap an EDM still just fine it does
do classical music but it could be a
little bit better jazz and things like
that also sound pretty good the highs of
course are not as present in these the
trouble is not as present which is to be
expected it's a pair of Skullcandy
headphones other than that I think these
are a good to like just okay set of cans
and also I did not get any lag when
watching videos that being said the real
star of the show is the noise
cancellation these actually to my
surprise can hold their own against Bose
and Sony they're not as good you can
tell there's not that crazy technology
in these but it does a great job of
blocking out outside noise but along
with the seal these headphones like I
said at the beginning in the comfort and
design area the seal and the
cancellation form a great pair in this
case and it makes these amazing so
whether that's like weights clanking at
the gym or people talking or things like
that it really does a good job of
blocking all of that out and blocking
out your surroundings almost too good
some time and you're getting this all at
one hundred and eighty dollars so next
up I want to talk about the call quality
it's not that great it sounds like
you're on a walkie talkie they did not
put a lot of time into the mic which I
think they should if they want to
compete with Bose and Sony because a lot
of business people they want that kind
of feature they want a good mic in their
headphones so yeah they need to increase
the mic quality in these headphones and
the next version the battery life is
actually outstanding in my opinion that
quick charging ten minutes of charging
will give you five hours which is better
than Bose also you get 24 hours of
battery life that is in between the
Sonia's at 30 and the bose QC 35 s at 20
so a nice middle ground there for
battery they also have a losing your
headphones feature where if you lose
your headphones you can track them so
that's another nice feature I do think
that most people if they lose their
headphones if they lay them down
somewhere unless you're in a really nice
area they're gonna take the matter
they're not gonna turn them in they're
just a bit nice pair of headphones by
especially these they look pretty good
so who are these for these are for
people obviously rapping EDM and R&amp;amp;B of
these go great they're not so good for
people that love those highs and treble
and like clarinets and trumpets and
things like that
I would definitely skip over these for
those genres but for everything else
they sound pretty good and the noise
cancellation is actually outstanding I
would use these for the gym actually
that's what I recommend these for the
most
I wouldn't recommend these for travel
really but more for like the gym if you
just want a $180 pair of headphones that
sound good that gets you pumped these
will do the trick
for comfort I feel like they're kind of
lacking for long trips and flights and
travel and things like that so I would
probably skip over them for that area
but these would make a great gym
headphone if you are into over ear
headphones alright guys so thank you

questions let me know
