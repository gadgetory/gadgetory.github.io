review of the matte cast Clyde 38 Mouse
mat now a lot of you guys after the
Auris mousepad reviews like the a.m. P
500 and 300 we're looking for a mouse
matte version so they don't actually
make them the amp 900 is actually a
different kind of material but this one
the mat cats glide 38 I feel confident
in saying it's pretty much the same
thing but now in a mouse mat form and
like I said in my aunt 500 review I
think that hybrid pads are the future
there's a lot of benefits to them over a
standard mouse pad and I hate to say
this about any product but I feel like
the gly 38 is damn near perfect in every
way it's hard for me to find a real
downside to it so today I'm gonna be
going over what I think about this new
Mouse mat and give you guys my opinions
on it and it's coming in at 60 dollars
which i think is very fairly priced for
this mouse mat the dimensions are 900 by
400 by 1.8 millimeters thick
so this hybrid pad features a cloth top
and a silicone base and then it just
heat bonded around the edges so there's
not gonna be any fraying you know like
on a normal cloth pad you would need
like stitching around the edges to make
sure that the cloth wouldn't come up
from the rubber and this thing has been
super solid over the past three months
that I've been using it it's got minimal
of branding and I actually like that
they didn't write Mad Catz and big
letters like they did on like the Asus
scabbard that was crazy
I like that they have those like three
little like dashes at the top right and
it actually looks kind of cool in my
opinion the beauty of having the
silicone base is that when you roll it
up and roll it out it will lay flat no
matter what now I actually had this
rolled up in my closet for a little bit
while I was testing some other mouse
pads and mouse mats and when I brought
it out to my surprise there was no
raised edges or bumps or nothing like
that no bubbling up none of that stuff
it was just perfect it just lays out
flat no matter what so if you're
somebody that's on the go a lot this
would be a perfect mouse pad for you so
let's talk about the surface and the
benefits that it brings now when you run
your finger across this mouse mat
it's not gonna feel like any other mouse
mat or mousepad that you've ever tried
before unless you're coming from like a
am p500 it feels bumpy it feels textured
and you would think that when you put
your mouse on it it's you're actually
gonna feel those bumps but you don't
once you put your mouse on it it
disappears now the benefits of why they
actually used this kind of material and
why they made it bumpy is to give your
mouse answer more tracking information
now it's supposed to give you 400
percent more performance out of your
sensor I highly doubt that I wasn't
playing four times better it's not gonna
make you four times better or four
hundred percent better but I do think
that the double textured or a 3d texture
as they are calling it does help with
giving you more surface area for your
mouse answer to track I actually do
believe that their claims are true I
just don't think it's as much as they're
saying but me personally I've
experienced no spin outs no problems
with tracking or flick shots this mouse
mat has been performing perfectly for me
and I know that it will for you guys as
well whether you're using stock feed or
hyper glides this mouse mat will perform
perfectly for you I think it actually
really benefits people with stock feet
though if you're a person that doesn't
believe in modding your mice or you just
want to use the stock feet I think this
is a good way to kind of speed up your
mouse without getting hyper glides the
glide 38 also has even friction along
the X and the y axis so there's nothing
to get used to and you can be consistent
in your shots so to show you guys a
little bit of testing between the qck
the Chi the Asus scabbard and
the glide 38 I've just done a little bit
of testing with gliding and I would say
that it's not as fast as like a
kite or the Asus scabbard I think its
third it's definitely faster and less
stopping power then a qck but there's
enough stopping power if you want to do
flip shots and did I mention that this
thing is also spill proof so if you're
somebody that drinks at your desk which
I think they should be you should stay
hydrated while you're gaming this thing
will actually just keep everything on
top of the mouse mat it won't get
absorbed into it like a rubber or a
cloth pad would and then you can just
wipe it off or swipe it off or wipe it
off with a cloth it's easy as that that
also includes food or any dust or
anything
like that it just takes one wipe down
you don't have to worry about scrubbing
it and how should I wash my mouse Matt
it just it takes care of itself so this
thing I feel confident for sixty dollars
I think it's well worth your money to
invest in because it will last you a
long time and the quality of the pad
overall just feels amazing it lays flat
it's comfortable on your hands and
wrists when you're using it
there's no stickiness it's not affected
by humidity so there's a lot of things
to love about the glide 38 alright guys
so that's gonna do it for this review of
the Matt Cassel i30 a a damn near
perfect mouse mat that's highly
recommended by me it's $60 it's gonna
save you a lot of time and money
cleaning and buying new mouse mats and
things like that you can just have this
one wipe it down and your mouse mat will
return to knew how crazy is that
alright guys it has been your boy BT
