with another video today I'm gonna be
taking a look at the iPhone excess max
but not in the way that other youtubers
have been doing it because I feel like
it's been beaten to death yeah there's
an upgrade in the camera yeah there's a
bigger screen now so on and so forth
those things don't really matter to me
so I'm gonna be doing a top 5 of why
people would even want to use Apple at
these crazy prices because what's
keeping us why are we still using Apple
products so today I'm gonna be going
over some of the features that we've
kind of taken for granted over the years
so before we begin guys don't forget to
hit that subscribe button for more
content like this and follow your boy on
my social medias I'll be trying to
connect more with you guys on Twitter
and Instagram and things like that so
make sure you're subscribed to me and
follow me at all my different social
medias with all that being said let's
get into the video so number one when I
was thinking about switching over to an
Android phone the first thing that came
to mind was iMessage now I have friends
around the world I travel a lot my mom
has an iPad and this just allows
connectivity to all those devices
whether that's a MacBook or whether that
person is overseas and can only use data
and can't use like a typical phone
connection to send a text it really
comes in handy when traveling you can
just hook up to Wi-Fi send it over data
there's no charges and things like that
so I message is a very very clutch and
not only that FaceTime the quality is
just so much better than like whatsapp
for instance when I was overseas I tried
whatsapp it's a little bit faster and
more stable of a connection but the
quality of the camera is just not as
good so that's one thing that has really
kept me on the Apple ecosystem and that
is iMessage and FaceTime the connection
because that's what these phones are for
you know when phones first started cell
phones first started that's what we use
them for is just connecting their voice
calls through texting and now social
medias and connecting to people all
around the world so I feel like Apple
allows you to connect to more of your
friends and family more easily because
that's one reason why I've stuck with
Apple number two is support now I
haven't seen any stamps
Storrs I don't know about you guys but
when there is an Apple store you can
just take your phone anything's wrong
with it
they will take a look at it I know
genius bars and making appointments can
be a hassle but you do have that option
to take in your phone physically get it
looked at and possibly get it repaired
at who knows what the cost is that I
think Apple Care is going for about 300
bucks and there were places like your
screen cracking twice and things like
that so it's really cool just to have
that hand-holding in life if anything
goes wrong with your phone go to your
nearest Apple Store and they will hook
you up number three is the smoothness
now I had a samsung note 7 I had a note
9 and after a while things kind of get
choppy whereas on the iPhone X s max
it's been super smooth even before that
when I had the iPhone X it was smooth
even before that when I had the 7 plus
the 7 the 6 all those different devices
worked flawlessly I can't say that I had
any slowdowns I mean here and there and
especially when they release an update
sometimes it gets slow but using an
Apple device you will definitely see a
difference and smoothness just over time
another reason why I've stayed on Apple
is because the apps get updated first
now a lot of apps that I used like the
music ones like Spotify like SoundCloud
and things like that they get updated on
the iPhone faster than on Android for
some reason like back when I had an
Android I would see my friends and the
device and the program would look
completely different I'm like what's
going on I check in my store in the
Google Play Store and lo and behold
there's nothing there to be upgraded a
couple weeks later that's when I get it
so it's nice that they get those updates
out to consumers very very fast so that
you can enjoy not having bugs on your
phone another thing that I really like
about Apple phones is the face ID now
this thing is just getting better and
better every year I haven't had any
hiccups with the face ID on the XS
this thing just opens like Open Sesame
like I just look at it and it just knows
and it just opens and I'm already on my
home screen it's so flawless now when I
was using the note 9 is my main device I
noticed that sometimes I have to redo it
close and reopen my phone to get it to
work or look at it in a sort of way
really hold it up to your face so it's
nice that Apple like anywhere that I am
like if I want to look at it under a
table or if I want to look at it just on
a table and it's laying down it works
flawlessly and that's crazy to me even
in the dark this thing just works
flawlessly so Apple has the best face ID
so that's one thing that makes my life a
lot easier
another thing that I want to add in is
that they usually put in a really good
camera apples always usually about top
three if not the best I know this year
like they have the note 9 the oneplus
and all these great cameras out there
the pixel 2 is a really good camera
there's a lot of good cameras out there
but Apple is usually consistently in the
top 3 at least and I've been noticing
when I'm going on trips now the cameras
are so good I barely take out my DSLR
anymore and I just end up using my phone
editing the pictures with Lightroom and
posting so that is another positive for
Apple is their camera always solid
alright guys so that is gonna do it for
my top 5 features of the iPhone XS Max
and the ecosystem of Apple and why you
might want to pay those outrageous
prices which I did it just hurt my
wallet but but guys there's a lot of
benefit to going with the Apple
ecosystem let me know down the comments
below if you want me to make a top 5
reasons why you shouldn't get on Apple
that'd be a fun video right or a top 5
video of why you want to go android and
be an Android system because there's a
lot to love about Google's ecosystem all
their apps I use on my iPhone anyways
like Google keep Google Docs Google
cheese I use all of them yeah this isn't
a video hating on Android or that
Apple's better because I love both I
grew up on Android phones I have
recently switched over to iPhones not
too long ago so I just want to give a
different perspective on why people are
actually going out and buying these
things and why people are sticking with
Apple even after
the outrageous prices so I hope you guys
have found this video helpful if you
have any more questions let me know
about down below if you want to see a
full review of this phone I can do that
let me know I think it's been done to
death already but you know what I'm a
man of the people and what People's
Champ so whatever you guys want I will
do all right so I will see you guys in
the next one it's been your boy bTW
saying peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
