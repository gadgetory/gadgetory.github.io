work bear with me it's going to take a
while for me to get used to this camera
here you go she loves these I didn't
forget about you

problems you gotta focus on what's real
man currently I am dog sitting trying
out my new lens whoa how's it going guys

on back wow I like this currently I am
chillin with this one what bella ciao

been good so let her out a little bit
let her explore yeah she's been training
she's a smart dog she's a smart dog I
really like her so far she's been a
really really open I mean her obedience
could use some work but she's just it's
our first date with her so our second
date with her fully so she's getting
used to it and in us and not only that
but our place constantly checking to see
if she's gonna pee or not anyways I'm
gonna go take care of the rest of this
with her and I'm gonna go to the gym and
I will see you guys later you guys will

right Bella you'll see good huh good huh
you gonna sleep good at home so uh yeah
I finished up my workout did legs feel
pretty good so recently I've been
feeling like really sick at the gym I
think it's because I've been doing carps
like me for so long and my body fat is
so low right now that I just need a
couple days of carbs which I'm doing I
had red beans and rice today and I think
I said that earlier and had a bunch of
candy so just trying to get myself back
to normal and feeling right again so I
can go back to carb cycling so you know
there's time to listen to your body
ain't that right Bella got listen to
your body huh you gotta listen to your
body see what feels right what feels
good for you and do you you know like if
the diet's not working or if you feel
like you don't feel good on a day i do
the diet you know find what feels good
you know and do that so with that being
said I'm going to cut the video today
