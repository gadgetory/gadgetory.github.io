with another review today we are gonna
be looking at the Audio Technica ANC's
700 BT their newest release and their
Wireless noise cancellation line of
headphones now be warned these are not
bass headphones and again I repeat these
are not bass headphones so if you are
here for that reason look somewhere else
but if you are here for more of a bright
sounding headphone then you are in the
right place now that we got that out of
the way don't forget to subscribe guys
for more content like this
my goal is to get out at least two
reviews for you guys a week so make sure
you're subscribed to see all the new
content so let's start off with the
Comfort Inn design now I love the all
black and matte design of these
headphones these things are really
really sexy they have that 3.5
millimeter input a USB input for
charging and touch controls for
controlling playback tapping the logo
will play the song or pause and also it
skips tracks tapping on the top or
bottom will increase or decrease the
sound levels and swiping up and down
changes songs I found the controls to be
very sensitive which isn't a bad thing
as they always work but these aren't the
best for like flights if you're laying
your head somewhere or working out as
any touch could stop your song at any
point the ear cups are decently
comfortable not as good as like Bose or
Sony but I can wear them for a long
period of time there is no case which is
kind of a letdown at 180 dollars I mean
any protection for these headphones
especially when you're traveling would
have been great like a case or a pouch
anything would have been great like I
said in the intro these are super bright
and can almost be a little bit too sharp
at times
the bass is present but for EDM rap and
R&amp;amp;B it can be a little lackluster it can
be tricky balancing headphones that have
a bright sound signature but unlike bass
if you have too much well I guess you
can never have too much bass can you if
you have too much on the high end it can
really ruin the experience and can be
unpleasant like nails running a
a chalkboard and that's how I explain
these these would have been great if
they had some kind of app to really help
with the sound signature so you can
tailor it to what you want the noise
cancellation on these headphones I would
rate as good but not great I definitely
put them behind Sony and Bose but they
will get the job done in most cases not
great for blocking out voices and things
like that at the gym but coupled with a
higher volume it can block out most
noise another thing is these leak a lot
of sound now the mic is probably the
worst part of these headphones the mic
is just terrible I'm not even gonna go
there I'm not gonna do any tests these
things are just bad you sound like a
robot
these are definitely just for listening
only I wouldn't go make calls with these
so if your own calls while traveling and
things like that that's important don't
even bother the battery life is also
really good I use this for about a week
and I still have not charged these bad
boys so 25 hours I'm fairly confident
that that's what you will get with these
headphones all right guys that is my
time for this video these can definitely
be hit or miss if treble is your thing
they are definite hit but they do have
their cons to them and with no way to
really control the trouble they can be a
little bit harsh sometimes the noise
cancellation is also really good as well
but there are just far too many options
out there that can give you a better
experience for the same price just like
the Sony's I just reviewed they're the
same price but they give you better
noise cancellation and you can control
the sound I mean that's no-brainer so
thank you guys for watching don't forget
to share comment and subscribe I'll see
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
