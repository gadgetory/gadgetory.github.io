you guys think this is

thing as a good excuse
they chicken
they
I can enjoy this
we're doing that
all right come on the way
or we're gonna hit chest and shoulders
today
feel free cool
vishal the size of that Oh crazy I hate
all of the two and we turned down
tonight
yeah my shoulders have been kind of a
weak point for me I mean my fresh
shoulders have always been I feel like
my lateral and my rear delt have always
been pretty good and recently I've been
try to you know Taylor my workouts for
its getting hitting those anterior delts
so you know this is a good way I mean we
already hit shoulders once this week so
gonna hit them again very lightly this
time not all intensive workout but just
something to keep them growing I mean I
feel like sure there's one thing that
you have to continuously hit or else
you're not gonna see growth plain and
simple
shoulder days are one of my favorites
just because of the pump itself that
alone you know I shoulder day
and just completes the whole package of
your body that gives NS beef paper
I just love the way she was like I want
my children so I know how I wants me to
look and you know that's one thing about
bodybuilding is that you know sometimes
your body doesn't look how you want to
do how you want to look that's the
beauty of it you can change it you can
add things into your routine you can try
a new workout you can see what works and
what doesn't work for you it's all it's
all relative it's everybody's different
and that that's one part that i love
about bodybuilding is that every person
is different and figuring out what works
and what doesn't work is part of the fun
you know people that say i just want the
body now want to skip the fun I mean
that makes no sense once you get the
body of one as I left to do bring out
for me as it's fun
seeing the results but the notice what
is doing the workouts and enduring and
all that other good stuff I never got
that I never got why people just want to
skip out on the hard stuff hate to get
philosophical but that's just life you
can't go through
life you know powering away from
challenges you can't cower away from
doing the things that you want to do
never get which one
you have to keep going sometimes that
I've been discouraged and you know but I
might think as I've never given up I've
always been consistent persistent and a
lot of people you know they give up
right when they're about to make
progress or about to do take that next
step you know already through doing
these videos I've learned a lot
I've already learned how to edit I've
already learned I mean I'm still
learning
I'll cell phone car for me
I enjoy it I'm enjoying doing this right
now I'm enjoying who I'm becoming by
making these videos for you guys
hopefully this will not even that it has
to be a bodybuilding but just encourage
people to just try something new you
know what if so what if you fail what I
mean my channel fucking son if my
channel sucks i mean that's ok with me
you know at least i try at least I can
look back I can show people Hey look I
try it I did something
and you know that's to me I would be
happy with that at this point
hey guys i hope you guys have enjoyed
the video so far and no it's a little
bit longer than my usual but trying new
things and taking you guys along with me
everywhere so here we did a chest and
shoulder workout today and we started
off with incline dumbbell press and I
wanted to do I like to incorporate a
strength type of day so my first
movement will be always inclined like I
said in the last video and I like to do
5 sets 5 reps about in the last set I'll
hit about 10 to 12 and just drop the
weight and we worked our way up i
believe i went up to about 115 43 and
never be afraid to go past what you
think you can do my theory is that you
can always do more than you think you
can you know we always sell ourselves
short and i feel like it's the same in
bodybuilding I always try to push the
limit i mean if i don't get it if i get
about 5 reps or three reps like I said
there's no big deal you know I know that
it's still all working towards the same
goal here we have incline dumbbell flyes
and I like to turn my wrist at the top
just like in all my flight movements now
next we move into a unilateral dumbbell
flat flies today I kind of want to work
on you know I've been noticing the flies
have been doing a really good job on
like shaping my chest and and getting I
get the most sore after I do a lot of
flies so today we want to work on doing
a lot of flies and with this you know I
always just tell people it's almost like
squeezing a wet rag squeezing all the
water out that's that's how I feel what
I'm what I imagine what I'm doing my
chest workouts squeeze squeeze squeeze
hey and next we have we moved in the
shoulders and we have a lateral raise
and with these I try to do a seated
really strict and keeping my arms are
straight as possible and just bringing
them out to the side I mean I don't try
to bring them up so high just bring it
up where I can really just feel my
muscles squeezing and then we did a
superset moving into a bent arm lateral
raise and this is just a really when you
do these you can do more weight so we
superset with these two really just burn
out the muscle right and then next time
you can buy two front raises one arm
front raises and with these same thing
as with any chest movement just try to
squeeze as hard as possible focus get
that mind muscle connection
and yeah I just have fun with it man who
as you see you know I try to have as
much fun as I can in the gym and just
keeping the light and just so we round
out the shoulders we ended with some
rear delt flies laying down on a bench
just to really force ourselves to keep a
strict I hope you guys enjoyed this
video until the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
