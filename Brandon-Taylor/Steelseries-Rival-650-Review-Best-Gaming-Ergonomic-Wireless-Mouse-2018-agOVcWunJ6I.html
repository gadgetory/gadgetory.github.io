another review today I'm excited to
bring you guys a review on one of my
favorite all-time mice that has now gone
Wireless and that is the SteelSeries 650
I first saw this mouse leaked on Reddit
and I got super excited but then that
excitement turned into concern as I saw
the weight and the price which are about
the same might add the price is hefty at
$120 which I kind of blame Logitech
lately for jacking up the prices of
wireless mice and this thing is a
hundred and twenty-one grams for the
weight of this bad boy but guys before
you turn this video off this mouse has
an X Factor that far outweighs the
weight of this mouse get it so let's
talk about this mouse and how it can
affect your gaming but before we begin
guys don't forget to subscribe to the
channel for more headphone computer and
phone reviews coming soon
alright guys so in the box you'll find
the mouse the cord which is super soft
rubber and feels super nice so when you
have to charge your mouse you won't get
that nasty cord drag like on Logitech
mics it connects to this micro USB
connector on the front which is a little
bit thicker to make sure that the court
stays in place as for the actual design
of the mouse it features three side
mouse buttons which are perfect in my
opinion they're not too big and they're
not too thin I will say for small and
medium hands it's a really hard to reach
the furthest mouse button on the side so
I usually don't use it as my hands are
only 19 by 8 centimeters the Mouse 1 and
2 are excellent they have these nice
grooves that allow your fingers to feel
like they are in a nice cozy hammock I'm
starting more and more to like Mouse
buttons with those nice grooves in it
this is super nice for you palm grip
users out there I find that the clicks
are a little light for my taste I prefer
a little crispier clicks on top you'll
find a dpi button for on-the-fly
switching I find this useful when I'm
switching into games with no sensitivity
control the mouse wheel is rigid and it
feels very very
nice when you scroll it I love it now
guys I know this might be a little
subjective I know I know but I think
this mouse is one sexy Mouse I love the
two lines on each side and the
SteelSeries logo is dope with RGB you
can change the RGB as well as the
bindings of your buns and the
SteelSeries Engine 3 software it comes
with 24 hours of battery life which is
respectable for 15 minutes of charging
you will get 10 hours of charge that is
amazing the 650 is rocking 1000 Hertz
and 1 milliseconds for the latency on
the wireless which is similar to what
Logitech is doing currently now on to
the X Factor yes this mouse is heavy at
121 grams and it comes with weights that
you can take your mouse up to 153 grams
and you do this by adding it on the side
at first 120 grams scared me because
mice like the final Mouse ultralight pro
are 67 grams the Logitech G pro Wireless
is now at 87 grams but the one thing
this Mouse really has going forward is
the design on the mouse the grips on
this Mouse make the weight disappear and
not even be a factor when controlling
this mouse the rubberized grips make
this thing stick to your hand like glue
and the low profile makes it suitable
for palm grip claw grip and even
fingertip grip
SteelSeries has really struck a great
balance between adding a sufficient hump
or palm grip and a claw grip and also
making it low profile enough for
fingertip grip users I only really
noticed the weight of this Mouse once I
actually switched back to my G 9:03
which is my daily driver and even though
it only weighs 109 grams which is only
12 grams less than those 650 I can still
feel a difference but at the end of the
day does it really matter once you get
used to how a mouse moves and react
weight in my opinion becomes a thing of
the past in that case the true sensor on
the mouse feels different than my
Logitech Mouse's that I own from the
research that I've done most believe
that the 650 true move 3 plus sensor is
pretty much identical to the 3 366 and
most other top mice in performance the
true move 3 plus it uses 2 sensors for
true 101 tracking and
then liftoff detection it is definitely
there though the difference I can feel
it I don't know if it can be described
scientifically but for my uses I can
definitely feel a difference between
this and Logitech kept my dpi and my
sensitivity the same and overwatch and
it took me a while to get used to how
the mouse has to attract compared to my
Logitech mice it took me about a full
day or two once I switched over to it to
really get completely comfortable with
it once I got comfortable with it I was
hitting flick shots like none other
this mouse is a bad man ma JAMA let me
tell you guys
tracking feels super crispy like baking
first thing in the morning and
projectile shooting is a breeze on the
SteelSeries 600 I had a lot of drag on
the back of the mouse and near them but
it seems though that SteelSeries has
listened and they have fixed that with
650 which is greatly appreciated so do I
think this is the best wireless mouse
out no but it is really good for the
right people who are the right people
bTW you might be asking well in my
opinion it will work best for all grip
styles pretty much for people who love
heavier mice and people who want a
wireless solution because I think this
is the best heavy wireless mouse out on
the market right now and it's super
flexible and the way that you can
actually configure the weights which is
always a plus alright guys so that is
going to do it for my review of the
SteelSeries 650 Mouse I hope you guys
have enjoyed this review it's been your
boy bt don't forget to Like share
