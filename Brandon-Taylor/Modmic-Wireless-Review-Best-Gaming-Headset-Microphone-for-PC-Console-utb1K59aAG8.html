do you wish you had a way to tell them
that they suck
well the mod mic Wireless will help you
accomplish all that and more what's up
guys is btw here and this is the mod mic
wireless one of my favorite devices of
the year and it's just the beginning now
while I did love the mod mic 5 and I
still used it up until I got the mod mic
Wireless with my Sennheiser HD 5 8 X's
the core just got in the way and I
didn't feel like it was a really good
solution long term because the court
would just annoy me having that double
corded with like three clips it just
wasn't enough and I would always have to
end up like just in the length or it
would get in the way on my desk or like
me putting my arm onto the desk so it's
nice that they've come out with a
wireless version so today I'm gonna be
telling you guys why I love this mic so
much so in the box you're gonna find the
mic you're going to find the receiver
you're going to get two sets of the
little sticky adhesives that go on to
your headphones you're also going to
find the USB charger and an extension
for the charger so if you want to use
this while you're gaming and charge it
while you're gaming you'll never run out
of battery and I like that it's just one
cord like I said before having that two
corded system kind of got in the way
sometimes so it's nice that they've kind
of addressed that problem with the USB
as well so looking at the mic itself it
has three LEDs on there it has a yellow
when it's charging it is blue when it is
on impaired and it's red when it is
muted it's easy to see so you can like
kind of just take off the mic and look
at it to see oh it's muted or if it's
not near the mic itself you have an
omnidirectional and uni-directional
switch the uni-directional will give you
more of a like noise cancellation block
out more noise from your outside
environment omnidirectional it'll kind
of take in more of that ambient noise so
if you want people to hear when you're
typing go ahead and switch it to that
omnidirectional now what I love about
the mod mic is that it is so modular and
it's flexible and it can grow with you
so let's say you have a headphone that
you really really like you can actually
just put this onto any headphone that
you want your not really tied down to
all these hyper X's and Astros that are
kind of like overpriced and not really
worth it just have like bloated sound
and you know when you want to listen to
music it's not that good there's a
reason why I like T foo ninja and like
Tim the tat man these guys are all using
different headphones or not using gaming
headsets anymore and that's is a thing
of the past and I think people have
realized that they're not that great of
a value now keep in mind this mic is a
hundred and twenty dollars but it can
last you forever
one way that they've really done this
where this can last you up to like three
four or five years you'll never have to
really buy a mic again is because it has
a great battery life now the battery
life is coming in at about twelve hours
and after three years of heavy usage
they say that you'll still be able to
get 11 hours so this thing is built to
last setup is easy with the USB charger
you just hold both buttons on the
receiver and the mic and it pairs within
five seconds so setting this mic up is
simple and painless know the physicality
of the mic it's not that heavy it is a
little bit heavier than the original but
that's just because you have all that
wireless technology in here I didn't
feel like it weighed down either side of
my headphone and it just disappears when
it's on your actual headphone so you
might be asking Brandon what headphones
go good with the mod mic Wireless well I
think like the sennheiser HD 5 9 8 or
the HD 5 8 X's go amazing with this mic
and they're really budget friendly you
can roughly get that setup for about
$200 give or take and I know that might
seem expensive now but why not get
something that's modular instead of
buying these headphones that are gonna
break down from HyperX cloud twos
forgive me if you guys own those but I
was not a fan of those the Astros are
pretty good but those are even like the
same price and you don't get that
flexibility of being able to switch out
your mic or your headphones so let's
talk about the sound of this mic now the
sound quality that comes out of this mic
is simply amazing I think it's going to
be great for you streamers out there or
people that want to do commentary for
the YouTube videos this is a great
all-around mic and what I love about it
is that it's not gonna be on your desk
so if you're a streamer and you're
typing frantically playing frantically
you're not
get all those clicks and bumps from your
keyboard like you would with like a blue
Yeti or like something that's gonna be
sitting on your desk it could be close
to your mouth and away from your
peripherals so right now I'm gonna do a
quick sound test of the mic so you guys
can get a taste of how this mic sound
keep in mind that I'm using a very
expensive mic here to do these YouTube
videos so it's not gonna sound as good
as that but I think it sounds pretty
close so let's drop that sound test
right about now what's up guys just be T
here and currently I am in a unit
directional mode let me know if you guys
can hear this keyboard typing in the
background I got some going on ok and
now I'm going to switch to the
omnidirectional which should give more
that outside noise so right now you
should be able to hear more of the
keyboard and one more thing I want to
touch on before I get out of here with
the sound test is that this is running
over aptX technology which is some of
the best Bluetooth technology that you
can find like anywhere so it's amazing
that they've actually put this on the
mic for their wireless so what is your
guys thing do you think it sounds close
to what this mic sounds like which is
probably like 10 times the price let me
know down in the comments below alright
guys so that is gonna do it for the mod
mic Wireless review this thing is simply
amazing it is worth every single penny
that they are asking for they did an
amazing job on this mic alright so thank
you guys for watching I hope you guys
have found this video useful drop me a
thumbs up if you enjoyed it and
subscribe if you haven't already and I
will see in the next video it has been
your boy BTS and peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
