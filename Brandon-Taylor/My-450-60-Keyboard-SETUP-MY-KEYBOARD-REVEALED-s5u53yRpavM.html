off in it what's up guys is BT here and
this is my $450 60% keyboard now I get
questions all the time about what
keyboard I'm using with switches I'm
using what key caption using and what is
that cable you are using BT so I made
this video to answer all those questions
and then some and kind of tell you up
how much this keyboard actually caused
because it actually snuck up on me but
it was well worth it so today I'm gonna
help you guys out and lead you guys on
the right path to creating your own
in-game keyboard all right so let's
start off with the heart of this set up
which is the base and that is from the
mash drop alt now this thing is pretty
expensive at 230 dollars for the
switches and some key caps and the base
but the good thing about the master op
alt high profile is that it is hot
swappable it is also pretty heavy weight
compared to the old alt and why they
call it the high profile is that it has
this casing around the edges it doesn't
have an open base like the older alt it
still keeps that amazing RGB ring around
the outside which I absolutely love it's
got USB C and it is very heavy weight
this thing is not for travel it's meant
to just stay on your desk and sit and
look pretty I think I've gotten so many
questions about what this keyboard is
recently and it's the high profile so
the high profile casing is also slanted
and it gives enough of a slant to where
I don't need keyboard kickstands which
this doesn't have any so either way I
would have had to stick with this so
next up you guys should know what
switches are in these they are the
purple helios version 262 grams if you
haven't seen my video on those go check
it out
those are my favorite switches they're
like Browns on steroids and I just love
them so much they have a tactile bump
and they bottom out at 62 grams and they
just feel absolutely amazing overall
whether you're a gamer or a type is I
think it's a great middle ground and
spoiler alert there will be a sound test
later on in this video
so the switches are about ten four
so a dollar purse which I had to buy 70
for a 65% keyboard so that's another 70
so we are at $300
yikes bTW what did you do next up we are
going to talk about the key cap set now
this key cap set really encompasses what
my channel is about those old retro 80s
90s Purple's blues pinks reds oranges
and just vibrant colors and that is the
Mito laser key cap set now I waited over
a year to get these and they finally
came with the match drop all too
high-profile and I just snapped it up I
just gobbled it up I had to get it there
was no way that I was gonna let them
slip through my fingers again so I
picked them up Mito was actually gonna
be doing another drop on these very very
soon I hope I'm not butchering his name
but he's gonna be doing another drop
I'll keep you guys posted so you guys
can get your hands on these I think it
looks really good with the final Mouse
as well so hint hint if you guys have a
final mouse a red one these red accents
look amazing with it but overall I could
not ask for a better key cap said they
are gmk some of the best and highest
quality key cap sets that you can buy so
this is in-game for me I've been waiting
for this key cap set forever and I got
them they're in my hands they're not
going anywhere so the me no key cap sets
are coming in at $90 for the 65% so now
we are at 390 dollars yikes so next up
let's talk about my custom cable I get a
lot of questions on this about this
silver plug the coil and the custom
cable it's expensive it's about $60 I
know it's just so USB cable but it makes
your setup look absolutely sick so what
you have to do is you have to go to
Mecca boys comm get a USBC to female
aviator adapter and then you get a male
adapter to a USB a and then you put a
six-inch coil on there and you get a 5
feet core total and then you're done it
comes out to about $60 putting this
keyboard at 450 dollars where did all my
money go but it's worth it I think it
looks absolutely sick on any desktop
so if you guys want to get one I highly
recommend it
you just buy one and then you're done I
went with the undead pattern which has
those again neon green purples that that
80's 90's vibes that I go for with my
setup so it just fits perfectly and I
love it I couldn't be more happy with it
all right and then lastly I have a novel
keys mouse mat now this actually matches
the Mito keycap set it's actually made
in tandem with it that's why it works so
well I'll actually link all of these
things down below so you guys can check
it out but I love that mouse mat it
looks absolutely sick and they have a
couple of different colors to match your
setup so just pick and choose which one
matches your colors and you're done
oh yeah I feel like we're forgetting
something what are we forgetting guys oh
yeah a sound test and drop that thing oh
yeah good stuff right there alright guys
so that is gonna do it for my four
hundred and fifty dollars sixty percent
keyboard it's an absolute unit I love it
it has everything that I want and then
some I'm completely happy with it and
yeah until the next key cap set or
keyboard comes out this is what I'm
gonna be using alright guys so thank you
guys for watching don't forget to Like
share comment and subscribe and I will
see you in the next video it has been
your boy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
