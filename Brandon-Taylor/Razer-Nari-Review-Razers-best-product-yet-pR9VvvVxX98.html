with another review today we are gonna
be checking out the new gaming wireless
headset from Razer the Razer
naari now I know you guys I know my subs
you guys love wireless gaming headsets
so I picked these up to test out for you
guys and well believe it or not I think
this might be one of a Razors best
products to date but can they overcome
some of that Razer suspect build quality
issues that they always have or the
buggy synapse software from the past
find out today upon taking the first
glance at the nars you might think that
they are on the heavy side well contrary
to what you might think these are
actually super light and to my surprise
as well I'd say that this is up there
with comfort for me for any gaming
headset that I've ever tried the ear
cups have leather on the side but cloth
on the inside I'm not sure why they did
this I rather have it be all leather but
that being said they do stay very cool
during long gaming sessions and aren't
scratchy like some gaming headsets are
not just sorry I had to clear my throat
there on the left ear cup you'll find a
mute button volume scroll a power button
a place for the USB charger and not only
that you can actually connect them to
your computer or your gaming consoles
through the USB port some companies
don't let you do that so it's nice to
see that Razer allows you to do that
speaking of which you can use this with
your ps4 your PC your Xbox so I like
that it's multifunctional you're getting
a lot of value it also has a 3.5
millimeter ox output which allows more
connection options other than Bluetooth
and USB also on the left ear cup is the
microphone which you can tuck into the
headset when you're not using it on the
right ear cup there's a slot for the USB
receiver and another surround sound
volume rocker the volume rocker for the
volume on the left ear cup actually
controls the voice to game ratio so
let's say you're gonna hear voices
more you can turn it up or down but I
didn't find that it worked that well I
don't know it was a little weird I don't
think that it works out well to be
honest with you guys I'm just being
honest here the outside of the
headphones look metal but they're
actually plastic which lends them to
being a little bit lighter the headband
is actually a standout in these
headphones it uses a spring mechanism to
form the band to your head and to be
honest it's one of the best if not the
best gaming headset headbands that I've
currently tried time will tell though
how this headset actually stays together
I'll keep you guys updated
I'm watching you razor better you better
work the sound quality of the headphones
surprised me so much guys I mean good
amount of bass for gaming and movies
with enough clarity to let you hear your
teammates voices you can actually turn
on surround sound instead of stereo in
the synapse software which helps a bit
but they are not as spacious as I would
think with ear cups of this size I just
can't really place where my enemies are
with these headphones I don't know what
it is it just is not as spacious as I
would like it to be you can also adjust
the EQ which works well but I felt like
the stock settings on the NARAS gave the
best results also in the synapse
software you can also increase the bass
vocal clarity sound normalization but I
felt as if each one of these settings
just borrowed power from other areas of
the headphones like the mid-tones
to try to power the bass which I didn't
like I would like to have seen them keep
the same clarity in the music but with
added bass on top here is a test of the
microphone let me know what you guys
think I think it sounds pretty decent
alright guys how do I sound in my chiny
am i accurate and my bass e I think this
mic actually sounds pretty good let me
know down in the comments below it's not
amazing I don't think it's as good as
like a mod mic but it's definitely up
there in the mic centers you can
actually adjust the volume and input
sensitivity of reducing ambient noise
and things like that but like I said I
felt like these settings are just there
but don't really work that well you can
also change the RGB of the headphones
but I never really got why companies put
draining lights on the outside
wireless gaming headsets when you can't
even see them when you're playing so
does it really matter I don't know I
guys I don't get it I mean if you if you
get it let me know down below the
Bluetooth range is also nice okay I have
a secret guys when I cue up to go on my
games I usually go to the bathroom he's
on that gross I don't know but I don't
want the game to start without me so
I'll just run back it might be gross but
I call it efficiency alright alright
guys so that has been my review of the
razer nari headphones decent gaming
headset coming in at $150 it has good
sound for most applications but I would
like to see them do more with the
surround sound add more that spacial
awareness in here and these would be
pretty much close to perfect as for
build quality we'll have to see how
these hold up over time
so thank you guys for watching subscribe
for more tech videos coming at your face
it has been your boy BT and I will see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
