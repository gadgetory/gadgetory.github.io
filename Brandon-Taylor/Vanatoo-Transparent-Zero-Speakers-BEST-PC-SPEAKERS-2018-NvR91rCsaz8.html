to bring you guys a new review on some
of the best desktop speakers that nobody
knows about that's right you guys are
gonna get the first scoop on some of the
best desktop speakers money can buy and
at 360 dollars I really feel like I'm
the one ripping them off I feel like
these could be going for at least a
thousand dollars at least I mean I've
tried everything from Corsair to razor
to Logitech I've tried everything from
my desktop computer and none of them
could ever like reach the quality that I
wanted I always ended up just going back
to my headphones not anymore
that ends today with the vanna 2
transparent 0 speakers so today I'm
gonna be going over what the features
are of these speakers and why these
speakers are a must-have going into 2019
so in the Box are obviously going to get
speakers you're gonna get a USB RCA and
aux core so there is a variety of
connectors to connect it to your given
device whether that's a computer a phone
and while we're on the topic of
connections this also connects with aptX
bluetooth also in the Box I give you a
remote so you can control it from afar I
love this remote it has everything from
a bass and a treble adjuster volume it
gives you a the ability to connect all
your devices whether that's an aux or
switch whatever connection type that you
want so there's a lot of flexibility
with this remote I love that they've
just added this in and it works like a
charm
also in the Box they've added in to
magnetic grilles so you can just snap
these on to the front of your speakers
if that's the look that you want or you
can leave them off for that classic
speaker look it only needs one connector
to connect one speaker to the other a
lot of speakers have where you can just
plug in two different prongs they have
the red and the white you have to plug
them in and it takes a while to set up I
like that they just have this one
connector that goes from one port to the
other you're done the setup was super
easy it took me about five minutes to
set up the speakers in total all you
would have to do is plug in the two
speakers to each other and then you plug
your USB into your computer and you plug
in the power you're done I love it so
let's talk about the design of these
speakers now these are geniusly design
because they are already angled up at
your ears which is the way that you're
supposed to listen to music now most
speakers on the market now from like
Logitech and razer and all these other
companies they're facing straight
forward meaning they're not even really
hitting your ears they're just blasting
out sound every which way but it's not
getting the optimal sound to your ears
so Aventa to genius lee has just angled
them up at your ears so it eliminates
the need for you to buy extra stands or
prop in these up a certain way they're
already in the position that they need
to be you can also flip them over which
is another option let's say that they're
up high already and they're already
putting at your ears and you don't want
them pointing up at the ceiling you can
flip them over and they have this little
handle that just flips over and then it
points straight in genius it's such a
simple design but it works so well also
in the back they allow you to connect a
subwoofer if you so choose but I feel
like these speakers are so good the
basis so good that I don't feel the need
to get a sub woofer ever so these
speakers feature a 4 inch aluminum cone
woofer with one inch under hung voice
coil a 4 inch long throw passive
radiator and a 1 inch soft dome tweeter
and let me tell you guys the way that
these reproduce sound is simply amazing
and we'll obviously get into that in a
little bit but first let's just take a
second to admire how sexy these things
look with that satin black wood mmm
super sexy these will go great with any
setup especially with a setup like mine
back there these things just round out
my setup so nicely I love the way they
look on my desk so these speakers
feature a true buy amplified active
speaker meaning one amp controls the
base and one controls the mids and highs
so now guys what you guys have all been
waiting for the sound quality these
things have blown me away it has ruined
music listening for me forever I have
not heard a better sounding set of
speakers in my entire life of living I
don't care whether it's razor I don't
care if it's Yamaha I don't care if it's
Corsair I don't care what kind of speed
they are as long as I have my van at two
speakers because these things have just
blown me away these things just make you
want to listen to your music it makes
you want to dig deep into your catalogue
of music and never come out guys that's
how good these sound I see where they
get the name that transparent zeros
because it's like looking at your music
through a glass window how it's supposed
to be seen it's like before you were
looking through a window that had been
run through by like a hurricane it's all
messy and muddy and you're trying to
look through your music and things like
that
but then the transparent serials come
and they clean off that window with some
Windex with some mr. clean with some
scrub I don't know what he used to clean
they they come through and they clean it
so crystal-clear that you can just see
you get touch you can just place all the
instruments in the room I would listen
to like jazz lounge music live music and
it felt like I was sitting in a room
full of people just enjoying the music
together and then I had to like stop
myself out of it and snap back into
reality and I came back to my room but
that is the type of experience that
these transparent serials give it will
take even your worst sounding music
files and make them sound amazing that's
how good they are and you also get that
control with the treble and the bass so
if it's not enough bass or treble you
can adjust that as well
I don't care what genre you're listening
to I don't care okay
I don't care you can write all you want
I listen to this I listen to that
doesn't matter to the transparent
serials these things are like so what
what do you want to hear you want to
hear something new about your music let
me show you and not only are they
amazing for music I found that they are
out so amazing for gaming that gives you
this like 3d sound because they are
angled perfectly at your head they also
sound great for movie watching these
things are just simply amazing top to
bottom I cannot recommend these enough
for three hundred and sixty dollars you
are ripping off an it to buy buying
these speakers period you can hook these
up to a TV even and replace a sound bar
and it sounds way better than any sound
bar at any cost that is like similar to
this so if you put spend like three
hundred sixty dollars on a sound bar
versus these I will go with these any
day of the week because that's how good
they sound so guys if you've never taken
a recommendation or you've thought about
taking a recommendation from me
now is the time to actually follow
through on getting one of my
recommendations because these things
will transform your setup these things
will instantly take your sound setup to
the next level and you won't even have
to like break a sweat because of that
five minutes set-up time I mean I don't
know guys you have to hear these that
that's the best thing I can say right
now you have to hear these speakers to
believe it so guys if you are in the
market for a set of desktop speakers a
sound bar or just a music listening
experience maybe you have a vinyl player
whatever the case may be these things
will do the trick you can even just buy
these to play with your phone that's how
good they are they have so many
connection types
that I think most people will get their
money's worth out of these speakers wow
I don't know what else to say these
things are amazing alright guys thank
you guys for watching it has been your
boy bTW don't forget to Like share
comment and subscribe and I will see you
in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
