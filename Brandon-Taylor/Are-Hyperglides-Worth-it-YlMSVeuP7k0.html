glides worth it today we're gonna be
going over this very commonly asked
question in my comment sections in my
discord wink-wink join if you haven't
already and my twitch streams
everybody's asking are the hyper glides
worth it
they're about fifteen dollars and they
can be hard to get they go out of stock
almost instantly it took me about three
months to get my s to so today I'm gonna
be going over the features of hyper
glides and going over some of the
reasons why I use them personally so
first off these are coming in at about
eight to fifteen dollars and they can be
found on like Amazon through the
official hyper glide web site as well as
like Macs gaming and some other websites
as well I usually get mine from the
actual website or Amazon right when they
come up because these things sell out
like hotcakes so in the packaging they
kind of make it worth it and give you
two sets of the hyper glides and they
are pretty easy to install but just in
case you mess up you have an extra set
on deck all you have to do is rip off
your old ones and put on the new ones
the whole process should take you under
thirty seconds and it's a breeze so if
you're worrying about installation or if
you're gonna mess up your mouse don't
because it's super easy you'll see when
you get them just line it up and you'll
have no problem installing the hyper
glides so the materials made up of
polytetrafluoroethylene and this is the
same as which on your mouse currently
but the ones on the hyper glides they
are a hundred percent virgin grade so
again the best of the best quality of
that material since they are using that
100% grade polytetrafluoroethylene these
are gonna last you a lot longer than
your stock mouse feed these are 0.5
millimeters thick and these last four
months I think the only time I've had to
replace some is when I was actually
installing my paracord and I kind of
just ripped it off and I ruined the
hyper glide but that was my fault not
the hyper glycerol it for you for months
to come so in my quest to bring you guys
the best of the best gaming peripherals
I've really tried to break down what
makes the great pros great and what I
found is they are consistent right they
have to be consistent they have the same
mousepad they use the same Mouse they
switch out their Mouse when it breaks
down or it starts to feel a little bit
funny they are on top of their game when
it
to switching out and keeping things
consistent because it will keep their
shots crispy so that is why I try to put
hyper glass on every Mouse that I own
because I want to stay as consistent as
possible when I am playing my game who
knows this could be affecting you
already and you don't even know it maybe
you aren't missing those shots because
you know your aim is shaky maybe you're
missing it because you're not being
consistent maybe your mouse feet are
worn down maybe your mouse pad has worn
down you never know there are certain
aspects that we might not think of or
that we kind of put to the side that
actually might be affecting us and
that's why I believe in having the best
of the best so put hyper glass on your
mice guys now on faster pass you will
notice a difference with the hyper
glides for sure slower pads you won't
feel it as much but it is still worth it
in my opinion so if you guys couldn't
tell I really love hyper glides I put
them on all my mice and I believe in
their consistency and I want you guys to
be consistent - I want you guys to have
the best so go out get some hyper glides
and I'm paying me I'm not sponsored they
actually took a while they lost my hyper
glass before I had to get them out to
track them down so I haven't had the
best shipping experience with them but
they are worth it they are worth that
trouble let me tell you guys alright
guys so that is going to do it for this
