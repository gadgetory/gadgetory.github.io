I said that's gonna dance we chopped up
so we go get right back to my last
breath my club records like Kid Cudi
tonight that's all what's up guys Keaton
here and this is a review of the
glorious GMM K 60% compact keyboard and
all I have to say guys is this year
glorious is not playing around
at all I think they have some elves
making their products up at the North
Pole or something because this is just
straight magic they've been killing the
game thus far in 2019 and we're only
just hitting March I once said that the
mash drop alt was the last 60% keyboard
that you would ever need to buy I know
it's 65% but yeah okay just bear with me
here well guys this keyboard definitely
makes a serious attempt at taking away
that title you can buy a pre-built one
for about $110 and $60 for the starting
base model with no switches or key caps
you can then add switches for about 30
to 50 dollars depending on which ones
you get and another 20 to 25 dollars for
the regular key caps are the Orakei caps
with see-through sides so guys enough
about pricing let's talk about the great
features of this keyboard
all right so in the box to find the
keyboard an l-shaped USB micro adapter a
sexy gold plated USB braided cord and
escape and Windows key and some
replacement feet for the bottom of the
keyboard also included is a switch
puller to help you with pulling up those
switches because this keyboard is hot
swappable I haven't mentioned that yet
and we'll get more into what that means
a little bit later on now out of the box
this keyboard has a very nice way to it
with its black sand blasted aluminum
faceplate and aluminum base it has a USB
micro connector on the back left side
now I do like USBC over USB micro
because it's a little bit more
future-proof but I found a workaround
guys for my custom cable I use a USB see
two USB micro adapter that's like five
bucks and I'll link it down below don't
tell anybody that secret just keep that
between me and you my amazing
subscribers all right guys I mean that's
one reason why you subscribe to me right
because the
little secret can save you a ton of time
and money you don't have to go out and
buy another custom cable on the back
side of the keyboard it's got two
kickstand fee for those of us who like
to have our keyboards up a little bit
higher myself included and there's also
a key cap switcher wait what
yes you're seeing that correctly there
is a key cap puller on the back side of
the keyboard they've really thought of
everything when designing this keyboard
so you know like me always misplace
these and now I won't anymore because
I'll know exactly where it is the
keyboard feet are nice and grippy and
like I mentioned earlier they have an
extra set in the box if they ever come
off or they wear down but these seem
like they are pretty good quality along
the bottom side of the keys you've got
your function road they've got some
multimedia keys and a function rail and
arrow keys the keys himself are abs
double shot injection PBT is my favorite
but I must admit guys these do feel
better than most mainstream keyboards
out there the double shot plastic on the
back isn't that great and it kind of
gets in the way of some of that
lettering but you know out of sight out
of mind when you're gaming you're not
gonna be looking down and seeing it it's
only like little thing I actually
thought it was a part of the lettering
at first until I inspected it further I
thought it was just a font no they kind
of messed up on the double shot there
now one remedy to this is just you can
just get a bear keyboard with just the
switches no key caps and save some money
and put that towards another key cap set
to make this keyboard your own now the
pre-built version of this keyboard comes
with some of my personal favorites that
Gator Ron Browns incoming sound test in
three two one
the gate around browns are great in
between if you want some kind of
feedback when you're typing and gaming I
used to hate them but as time goes on
and I use them more and more I've come
to appreciate Browns for what they are
but what puts us in contention for the
title of the last keyboard you'll ever
have to buy is that it's PCB hot
swappable allowing you to change any
Tyria mix or gator on or Kalibak switch
of your choice and put it into this
keyboard within seconds this keyboard is
the answer to a commonly asked question
that I get so often I get this question
a lot hey BT I have X 60% keyboard
I love the keyboard but I hate the
switches can I change them out yes you
can but that involves some and soldering
and soldering the new switches which
will cost you time and money well you
still have to spend money here to get
some new switches but you can save a lot
of time by getting this PCB hot
swappable keyboard using the included
switch puller it's a breeze let's just
take out and swap out your new switches
I have a sampler switch pack here which
I use to like test out many different
switches from like chariot mix to a box
kelly switch and yeah this way you'll
never get tired of your keyboard you can
just keep on switching out the key caps
and switches when you get bored it's
like a wise man once said variety is the
spice of life don't ask me who said that
the stabilizers on these keyboards are
pretty good way better than the $150
vortex poker
yikes but yeah I'm gonna drop a sound
test for you guys right now on the
stabilizers
I like that while they did make the base
exposed they kept it black and set of
that white which I love the look of
which is one of the main gripes that I
have with a vortex poker the RGB on this
keyboard is still vibrant as any
keyboard on the market even with that
RGB not reflecting so much off of a
white bass and just the key caps so for
all of you RGB fans out there you won't
be disappointed let me tell you now from
the keyboard you can do it manually and
just do function f c gb V and H and
these will change the RGB modes each one
of those keys has like three different
cycles and variants that you can go
through like I really have to say guys
this keyboard has some of my favorite
RGB modes of any keyboard I've tried
thus far you can control the RGB also
using the software that's downloadable
from their website and set up the color
configuration to your liking with ease
as well you can speed up the rate and
the brightness as well as affecting the
USB rapport rate as well in the software
you can also control the macros I think
this is the portion of the software that
needs a little bit of work for
programming macros yes you can program
macros but it's a little unintuitive in
my opinion but this is an easy fix
from glorious with future updates I'm
definitely gonna give them some feedback
on this and we just need a way to just
drag and drop our macros or multimedia
keys onto the key presses to see like a
visual representation of the macro it's
a small thing but it could be big when
it comes to ease of use of this keyboard
for beginners in the end though guys
this is a great alternative to a lot of
the heart to get 60% keyboards on the
market right now and it's easily
accessible guys it's you can buy right
now it's in stock yes you heard that
right it's in stock it's 70 dollars
cheaper than the hard to get match drop
alt and has some of the same features
and what's not to love about this this
keyboard will check off a lot of boxes
for you guys it's got that 60% keyboard
form-factor hot-swappable switches a
great solid bass great feeling abs keys
it doesn't have USB C but
said just use that workaround I'll link
that down below if you haven't checked
it out already or seen it before I'll
link it it's like five bucks this
keyboard might actually be keeping a
spot on my desk
time will tell guys and as always I'll
keep you guys updated there will be a
setup tour very very soon I promise you
guys and I'm juiced for that anyways
guys thank you guys for watching don't
forget to lecture come in and subscribe
it has a vineyard bar bTW don't forget
the lecture come in so wait they say
that already I always mess this up
I think alright</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
