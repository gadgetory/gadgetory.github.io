review of the oneplus 60 one month later
review this was my first one plus phone
and boy was I blown away this phone has
changed the way I look at phones now and
honestly I feel like this was the best
phone to come out this year this is of
course coming from a long time iPhone
user and someone who currently owns the
iPhone XS Macs so today I'll be giving
you guys my one-month long experience
with the one plus six T from the moment
that I opened the oneplus sixty box I
was amazed not by the phone itself which
is gorgeous by the way but by the extras
that they added in like an already laid
screen protector and a perfect case that
is slim and grippy and protective these
small acts showed me from day one what
the oneplus message was they really want
to destroy the $1,000 flagship market
right where it stands they're putting
their foot down for us because this
competition really keeps dollars in our
pockets the oneplus 60 comes in matte
black purple and mere black colors I
went with the mirror black but in
hindsight I think the matte black might
be a little bit better to protect
against scratches
I always keep my phone in a case anyway
so it's not really a problem for me
better safe than sorry is what I always
say there are a couple of different
variants but I went with the six
gigabytes of RAM and 128 gigabytes of
storage for $550 there's also an 8
gigabyte RAM version with 256 gigabytes
of storage for 650 I find that the 6
gigabytes of RAM and 128 gigs of storage
is almost overkill this phone feels
great in the hand and the edges are very
easy to hold it's got a nice weight to
it it feels both heavier than the iPhone
XS Max and pixel threes to me it charges
using a USB C port on the left hand side
you'll find the volume rocker and on the
right side you'll find the power and
ringer switch on top you'll find the SIM
card slot which holds up to 2 nano SIM
cards which is great for those of us who
travel the face detection works great
and it is surprisingly fast it also
recognizes my face from all different
angles which I really like underneath
the screen you have the option to go
with a fingerprint reader as well I must
say after using this phone it's very
hard to go
- something like that pixel three it
does take a while to register your
fingerprint sometimes which is kind of a
bummer but the face detection is so fast
I hardly ever have to resort to using my
fingerprint the oneplus 60 has an optic
AMOLED 6.41 inch display even though
it's only a 1080 screen I still prefer
consuming media on this compared to my
iPhone XS max because that notch is just
way out of the way and most content that
you watch nowadays on YouTube and stuff
like that is only going to be 1080p any
wings there is an option in the settings
to turn off the knotch
and get more of a bezel consist of look
across the top but I think this phone
just looks so cool with the whole front
of the screen populated with content to
accomplish a small nutshell they really
have to make the top speaker really
really thin and when I do block the
bottom it really does make a difference
in the sound that's coming from my phone
it sounds very like distant so that's
something you have to be cautious about
when you use this phone the speakers do
sound good though when they are not
covered the colors of the optic AMOLED
screen are vibrant but not as vibrant as
something like the note 9 or iPhone X s
but it is very very close though it's
definitely not 450 dollars better if
that's what you're wondering under the
hood it's got a snapdragon 845 Qualcomm
processor that flies for gaming and
everyday tasks it is running oxygen OS
based on Android Pi and it is pretty
much like stock Android which is my
favorite because it's light and it stays
out of the way letting you make Android
yours it's also got some gestures that
the other phones don't have like if you
make a V on the lockscreen it turns on
the flashlight and if you make a circle
it turns on the camera I use these all
the time and I find them super useful
it's got a 3700 milliamp battery and
this phone lasts for days and it also
features fast charging no wireless
charging which is kind of a bummer
because like I'm a huge fan of that now
I will say though that when I do use
like a deck amp and I connect it to this
phone and it drains my pixel 3 like mad
this phone can last a full day whereas
on my pixel 3 it dies like midday I
often have to charge the oneplus 60
after like a day and a half instead of
like that same day which is also very
nice
so the 60 has a dual 16 megapixel a 20
megapixel camera
on the back and they actually can stand
up to the other flagships on the market
one thing I did notice is that it
doesn't have as good of a dynamic range
is something like a pixel 3 or the
iPhone X s max and because of this guys
tend to get blown out they just look
white instead of blue sometimes so
taking out photos outside you really
have to be careful and like focus your
pictures properly the front-facing
camera is also good although sometimes
it just makes my face look all glowy and
smooth Dover which I don't like it also
has a night mode which you can get
better at dynamic range at night as well
and the camera also shoots 4k video up
to 60 frames and it has a super slo-mo
with 240 P at 1080
alright guys so that is gonna do it for
this review of the oneplus sixty my
favorite phone of 2018 it has its faults
it's not perfect but for $550 I believe
this is the best phone on the market for
the money unless you make content on
your phone and you need like pictures
like crazy sharp pictures or you know
the sky to be perfect I would definitely
100% recommend picking this up over like
a pixel 3 a note 9 or an iPhone just for
the price alone but that's just me you
can do whatever though if you want to do
I mean just think of it what can you do
with four hundred and fifty dollars let
me know what would you guys do with
extra $450 alright guys so that is gonna
do it it has been your boy at beat t

will see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
