it's harder
enough guys is btw back here again with
another review today we have a sub
request to review on the Razer
hammerhead BTS
now Razer has always been known for
their excellent gaming products but
they've always had QC issues with them
they've always had parts failing and
their customer service is known to be so
so so are these worth the investment are
they worth the risk of dealing with that
let me tell you what I found out today
alright so starting off with the comfort
in design these are some of the best
feeling headphones that I've ever tried
not wearing but actually in my hand they
feel great they feel very heavy they
feel very sturdy they have the led Razer
logo on the earpieces which is a really
nice touch I've never seen that in any
headphone so that's a really cool
feature one thing I didn't like about
these is they have this little rough
heart around the back of the earpiece I
don't know why they did this but it
actually irritates your ear a lot if it
rows around I would not recommend these
for sports that being said they do stay
in really well and one factor that
factors into that is this little
magnetic piece on the back now this goes
on one side of your shirt and then on
the outside of your shirt and this
magnet helps the headphone stay in place
so if you're at the gym or whatever
these aren't gonna move and that's one
thing that I did like about these that's
something that's one of the features of
these headphones that I wish other
companies would iterate into their
headphones because that's a really cool
idea right
having that magnet right here to just
keep the headphones in place and not
have them move around on you
is really nice but with all that said
now these are gonna come with your
standard ear tips that come with the
double silicon tips which is nice they
fit pretty well the tips kind of leave a
little bit to be desired I do like the
case however they fit in there very
nicely very compact so you don't have to
crumple up your headphones you
I'm trying to put him into the bag like
powerbeats or something like that so
that's a really cool feature on these
okay so moving on to the sound how did
he sound
out of the box I was very surprised to
find that these are very flat flat flat
flat and that is because they have an
app which I later found out I didn't
know that at first but I found out that
they have an app for these where you can
turn bass and the booze
kind of like the jabbers they come very
flat so you can color them however you
want the big problem with this is I
cannot get these mother hears to connect
that is a huge problem this is where
their QC I think needs to be fixed
because I feel like they have the
hardware team over here and then they
have a software team and they're not
really talking so that this is a
seamless collab same with I've tried
some of their Mouse's and same thing
that their software just isn't up to par
and I see that with these headphones and
if they could get that together where
the they have this software that works
really well and then they have the
headphones that work really well and
then these teams worked really well to
make this a better product and a more
seamless experience for the users I
think they would have another homerun on
their hands but since I can't get these
to connect and since I can't color the
sound
viescha sounds flat and kind of
disappointing I do notice that they do
have a lot of clarity things like that
so I think that with the app that it
could they could be good I can't really
say and I can't really I can't really
comment on it for you guys because the
app just isn't connecting to these
headphones and I have a connected I
tried turning off the app and turning on
the headphones and turn it off
headphones and opening the app first and
it just doesn't work for me so what's
going on a razor let me know DM me mail
email me whatever you got to do let me
know how I can get these to work so now
that the sound is out of the way let's
talk about better
battery life is great it's at eight
hours these things just keep on going
I'm I like that I like this the
connectivity is great except for I can't
connect to that app for some reason so I
don't know if that affects the
connectivity rating but for the most
part these stay connected to your phone
but that's about it
the next step let's talk about the call
quality and now the call quality leaves
a little bit to be desired especially if
you're gonna be playing games I don't
know it just doesn't sound as good as I
would hope for something that's geared
towards gamers because you're gonna be
maybe you connect these two computer
your laptop and you want to have a
wireless gaming experience and the call
quality is a mic just isn't up to par so
I think they need to put a better mic in
this thing if they're gonna be pushing
it towards gamers all right so all I
know these do have their flaws it's just
just a little bit of finesse on these
would brings up to jaybird level and I'm
not joking with you guys I think these
little minor details like the rough
edges on the headphones that are not
really needed just smooth them out I
really like the logo the light-up logo
which is really cool that app seems like
it would work really well if it will
connect to my headphones so just a
little bit of finesse on these and I
think that they could have a hit on
their hand
I love the magnet on the back of the
neck that I've never seen that before
and that's a really cool feature that I
hope some companies actually look at and
bring their own version to it that being
said I can't really recommend these per
se but if you're looking for a flat
profile wishes have out of the box you
like the razer brand then these are a go
for you but it's just these little
things that are keeping it from just
being oh man just a little bit just a
little bit guys I'm telling you
desperate dad talk about price these are
coming in at a hundred bucks so they
could be competing with jaybird but it's
just they're falling a little bit short
in some areas and that's okay because
these are some of the first versions of
this head
phone and I think they're only gonna get
better with each iteration but razor
please have your software team talk to
your hardware team with everything
whether that's Mouse's or keyboards you
guys just need a better seamless
experience for the users and I think
that that will bring you guys a lot more
customers it'll bring you guys a lot
better reputation that's just some
overpriced company because you guys
really are putting out good hardware
it's just these little things that are
keeping you guys from being the top dog
and everything everything not gonna lie
to you all right razor so now that my
spiel is over I just want to say thank
you guys for all the support thank you
