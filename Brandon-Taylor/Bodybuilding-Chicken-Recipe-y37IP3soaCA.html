going to be making some chicken and
broccoli and jasmine rice and show you
the recipe i use to meal prep so tough
any further ado I'll tell you the
ingredients that you need it's so simple
I mean you have to be completely
clueless not to be able to get this i
mean hate to say it but you get your
shit together if you can't do this right
so first off you got a major key right
here dr. pepper and then you're just
gonna have some caribbean jerk seasoning
that's it i have some chicken defrosting
right now so that's going to be that so
we're just going to marinate this for
about 30 minutes to an hour and then put
it you can either grill it or you can
fit in get it cut off or you can put it
in the oven and tonight I think we're
going to put in the oven because I'm
fucking lazy so deal with it
bit I was lazy so that's imma just
rocking steamer playing I'm just going
to put a little bit of salt on it and
that's it salt and pepper or you can
also put Parmesan cheese on this shred
it as a degraded either work so oh yeah
and also we have jasmine rice how to
jasmine rice right here oh yeah we are
going to it i'll click on the stove is
on to be perfect tomorrow start those
milk pot off right you know so we're
going to portion these out right now i'm
going to be doing carb cycling so i'm
going to do a day 200 a day 100 and a
day 50 which is pretty much as
vegetables for the 50 grams so that's
going to be that yeah so i'm going to
make this and i'm going to bring you
along I mean it's right here so we can I
show you as I do things alright so we
have a pan oh my god this is a pot so
lets you make it position this in
another another way
I'm not right now a measuring cup right
here
I'm gonna trust my family on this one
honey she was tough I hear that
hopefully is that dangerous
and I'll show up this
going to touch
so you make rice generally it's two cups
two to one to two cups of water to one
rice let's get it together
smoke and we're going and the photo so
you feel that bullshit enough to meet
them all right I believe chicken
I was wrong
this should suffice and again like I
said we're just going to be taking the
dr pepper pouring it in with a little
bit of the seasoning let it marinate and
ever-evolving so while this is going on
yeah we aren't going to be ternal this
focus babbling on a baked 375 for the
best chicken 375 we cook it a little
longer but it'll be juicier so we'll be
dry as fuck and you want when you reheat
it you know you won't be hating life so
we'll start that
and while you're while you're waiting
just like place music dancing saying
whatever you want to do yeah all in all
this meal should take about 30 minutes
wait go an hour so with the mayor named
Mary Daisy and all that about 39 out
cardio lies what I'm doing is 20 minutes
i'm doing a minute and 40 walking on
incline at eight and then I put the
speed up or I have the speed at about
three bump up the speed to about a nine
for 20 seconds so do what 140 at three
for 20 seconds at nine and I'll do that
rinse and repeat for 20 minutes and
that's how we gonna shred it hi oh and
also box jump jump so this shit is
boiling so we're going to come over here
right
all right now the chicken is done and
slightly defrost itself so I do is go in
here oh now you're due for all of that
poke holes in so that it's a mare named
the dr pepper will get all up in it be
juicing all the way throughout alright
so i put all the holes of chicken and
we'll corn the dr pepper next
so once this is done I'll leave it for
30 seconds 30 seconds 30 minutes in the
fridge come back take it out put some
seasoning season it throw it in leven
one time crunch so I have to take this
out 30 minutes before but just still
tasty
but seasoned look at that let's good
middle rack 30 to 40 minutes now all we
have left is and I clean the lens so if
it's looking a little bit clear right
now that's why my bad y'all but anyways
I will check back with you guys I'm
gonna put the broccoli n 46 minutes and
the chicken out and 30 minutes and i
will show you the finished product peace
look at that perfection took me about an
hour to do a light as you guys with me
