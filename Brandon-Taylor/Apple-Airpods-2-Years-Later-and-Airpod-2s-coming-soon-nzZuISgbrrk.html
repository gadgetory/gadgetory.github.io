with another real review for real users
now today on the menu we will be
revisiting the Apple earpods which has
has some people's panties in a bunch on
my channel some people love them and
some people hate them in my opinion the
people that hate them haven't really
tried them yet and are just hopping on
that Apple hate bandwagon without
actually considering these dental-floss
looking headphones actually are the real
deal so today after two years I will be
going over what I like and dislike about
the earpods as well as what they can't
improve on because there is a
speculation that the airpot twos are
gonna be coming out very soon before we
begin though guys don't forget to follow
me on my social medias I'm doing all my
unboxings all my Instagram stories now
the number one thing that I love about
the air pots is the connectivity whether
it's to an Apple or Android device the
connection is always super solid a lot
of the companies have tried to go
completely Wireless including jaybird
Bose Sony but nobody could do it without
having to they lower the bluetooth
quality or getting massive breakups and
crowded areas that's not the case with
the ear pods I've never had one issue
with connection breaking up anywhere
that I go Apple was the first to really
do completely wireless well now Jabra
has since come along and done a really
nice job as well the second thing that I
like about the air pots is the ability
to tap to skip songs volume or accept
calls which is nice I do hope that in
the next version they will be adding
more touch sensitivity like sliding your
finger up and down will increase the
volume or decrease the volume now the
other side they can have like skipping
tracks that would be amazing what are
some gestures that you would like to see
added to the air pods the third thing is
the battery life five hours of battery
life while listening or two hours while
talking not to mention with the case you
get up to 25 hours of playback I have
noticed though that the battery life has
dropped significantly and I have to
charge them more often than not I would
like to see a better battery put into
the air pod twos now the fourth thing
that I want to talk about is the call
Claudie now most bluetooth earbud mic
suck let's be honest but apples mic
simply does not it's crystal clear if
they kept the mic the same I would not
be disappointed
the fifth point that I want to talk
about is its compact size now although
it may look like dinner floss I know
yeah yeah yeah the design really grows
on you guys and you come to really
appreciate that slim form factor of the
case and the earbuds themselves I would
like to see them maybe make like a
sports version of the air pods or maybe
add in some rubberized grips to help
them keep the man for some people
because sometimes the one-size-fits-all
doesn't fit everybody and that's a shame
everybody should be able to enjoy the
air pods
I mean did you guys have any trouble
with the fit on the air pause let me
know down in the comments below
lastly I want to talk about the sound
quality it is actually a really good
boat why not add in the ability to have
an EQ with the ear pods that would be
amazing and take the air pots
to another level depending on the song
the air pause either sounded really good
or really thin it's really a crapshoot
so having a way to really control your
music a little bit more would be amazing
and we all know that Apple can do it
they're more than capable of putting
this into like iOS or coming up with
some kind of app alright guys so let me
know down in the comments below what did
you like about the original ear pots or
didn't like about them what would you
like to see from Apple with the air pot
twos thank you guys for watching if you
haven't already drop a like on this
video subscribe if you haven't already
for more videos coming at your face it
has been your boy BT and I am saying
peace see in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
