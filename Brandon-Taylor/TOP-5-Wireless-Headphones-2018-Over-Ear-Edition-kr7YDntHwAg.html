with my top 5 wireless over ear
headphone list so I decided to make this
video and I decided that it was
necessary because I always see in my
comments people asking me what I'm using
and not only that but how do I rank each
one of these new headphones against all
the other ones that I've reviewed in the
past so I'm going to be making this a
monthly series of my power rankings of
my favorite headphones this list has
already changed so much within the past
month I've had a lot of new entries into
the top five so today I'm going to be
ranking each headphone and giving you
guys a brief summary of why each
headphone ranks the way they rank and
give you a little bit of information
about what genres they're going to be
good for if you want more detailed
reviews of each one of these headphones
I'll link them down below to check out
my older reviews don't forget guys if
you haven't already to hit that
subscribe button for more content like
this
coming in at number 5 we have the v-moda
crossfade wireless tubes now these
combine a great build with their steel
flex head Bend a great base for hip-hop
EDM and rap these are so much for the
rock or classical crowd here and the
reason why these aren't higher on the
list is because while the sound is
top-notch for three hundred and fifty
dollars you can get similar sounding
headphones with more features in noise
cancellation for the same price
elsewhere companies are catching up to
the sound quality that is provided by
the V Motors so the V mode is really
going to have to step up their game in
the coming months so these are going to
land themselves at number five
coming in at number four we have the
bose QC 35 now I've slammed these in the
past but what really changed my mind on
them is when I had to travel for 20
hours this past year they were
comfortable and the noise cancellation
is just top-notch they sound very
neutral making it good for people who
like accuracy with their music and none
of that bass or treble fluff these are
also going to be great for you editors
out there who just need a good clean
accurate sound it Bose can upgrade their
sound I think they will be in contention
for a top spot
coming in at number three we have the
second best sounding headphones on the
list my newly acquired Cyn Heiser HD
ones I love these things they have the
perfect amount of bass the treble is
nice and rolled off at the top now these
kind of suffer in the vocal section but
it's not a deal-breaker here the noise
cancellation is good but not great and
when we start reaching towards the top
of the top five you have to add in
features like a solid app to give you
more control over your cans oh and did I
mention these cost about five hundred
dollars which is a little outrageous in
my opinion although these are one sexy
pair of headphones coming in at number
two is my personal favorite headphones
the Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins px is these are the
best sounding headphones on the list
period is very hard for me to go back to
anything else the clarity in these is
just unmatched combined with a great
bass great mids and great highs the
build quality is also top notch which it
should be for $400 but when you have
these in your hand the price will just
be the last thing on your mind they have
that head-turning classic look to them
as well which I love they also give you
control over the noise cancellation in
the app but I wish there was an EQ and
their app that would put these over the
top honestly also the super close back
nature of the headphones can cause some
issues for people comfort wise but I see
it as a plus in my opinion as it really
helps the noise cancellation and that
blocks out a ton of noise
coming in at number one if you haven't
guessed by now is a Sony here on Tues
and the reason why I put them at number
one our assembly because they just work
and what I mean by that is that they
just are the closest thing to a
one-size-fits-all headphone they
combined top-notch noise cancellation
that has surpassed Bose in my opinion
while also giving you massive controls
over the noise cancellation and sound
profiles so that you can tailor your
experience to a tee not only that they
only cost three hundred dollars and are
the cheapest headphones on the list now
you may be saying what about the WH 1000
X in twos well they are pretty much the
same headphone with the WH 1000 X and
twos being more suited for travelers but
in my opinion I think most people will
be satisfied with the sony here on
Tuesday do not have the best sound
quality I would put them at about number
three on this list but the thing is they
do a lot of things really well and most
headphones on the lists are only doing
one to two things good so I really like
that this is just a complete package you
can make them how you want them and
listen to your music and have your noise
cancellation exactly how you want it
alright guys so if you made it this far
I want to say thank you guys for
watching I appreciate all the support
you guys have shown me on my videos I
hope that you guys found this video
helpful in choosing your headphones I'll
be doing an updated version of this
video possibly every month to two months
to keep you guys updated on what I'm
liking so don't forget to share comment
