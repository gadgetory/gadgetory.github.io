very long time I think it's a bit over
like two years so uh bear with me if it
sucks no it's not gonna suck everything
I make is fire our way to a team lab
take a bunch of instagram-worthy
all right so I got some fun stuff
planned for you guys to come and see
today we've been in Tokyo for about
three days now just going to know the
city but now we are going to be doing
some fun stuff today we're going to be
going to team labs instagram-worthy spot
we're going to be going to a Akihabara
mouse shop that I think all of you guys
will be interested to see they got a lot
of keyboards electronics monitors all
that good stuff statue is massive even
know if I'm getting it and frame right
now
while this thing actually is but it's
really freaking tall I don't even know I
can't even estimate how big this is I'll
probably flash it on the screen right
now and let you guys know later on once
I kind of research it
all right so we are on our way to one of
the biggest electronic stores in Tokyo
in Akihabara Tamara they have a ton of
stuff from like camera gear it might
actually the further camera for the
channel as well as they have a bunch of
mice artisan pads all that good stuff so
we're gonna check it out I'm gonna show
you guys what they have inside
all right so they have a bunch of chairs
that you can try out vx races right here
it's really cool I like that they have
everything out for you to try whereas
like back in the u.s. everything is kind
of like in a box and you have a ticket
home and then try it I like that they
let you they customize your fit to the
way you like it here at the store so you
can go home with the thing that you want
I got apple stuff right here now next up
we're gonna come to all the monitor
stations and we can check out like I
like that they have every single monitor
on display only you can read Japanese
yeah they have a bunch of different
computers they got some mice out on the
way all right so next up we have a fan
favorite razor so this is like the razor
section right here a ton of different
keyboards we got the Omata chroma at the
Huntsman I actually really like the
Huntsman I like the purple
optomechanical switches at the husband
elite with a little scroll wheel right
here and then you got the mic this is
pretty cool too
so what I like about Japan is they have
everything out on display you can go
home with the thing that you want like I
said like that's kind of like the common
theme so right here they have all the
different tactile switches so they have
tactile we've got linear they've got
clicky of course you know we got to show
love to the Romer G romaji family or you
guys at in the house okay next up we got
the g4 13 they didn't have any crazy
Logitech mice that we don't have back in
the States
they have the G 304 but it looks like
the G 305 they just call it something
different next up we have a brand that I
really want to like get into later on
and that is from Phil Cove I've heard
very good things about Philco they also
got the taupe brace which is let's do a
sound test for you guys hold on sound
test of the taupe rays these are so
expensive these are about 250 bucks us
let's do a sound test
super silent as you can see a little bit
mushy feeling I don't know maybe that's
just me now this is a keyboard I'm very
very interested in this is the H K KB
hacker
now this one a little bit weird because
it doesn't have a control key you see
this the control key is actually right
here so I think that's the right one
I think it's the control key right here
and it's all blank so yeah I don't think
it's the best for gaming this is a new
way of guys you guys heard it here first
straight from Japan 40% keyboard they
went there
yeah if you can see on the other man I
need to upgrade I'm using the 1080 TI
but I really want this I want that 2080
Ti so right here this is a row cat and
they come in like different sizes my
brother my actual real brother loves the
real cats
yeah they actually have some pretty
decent shape the scroll wheels are not
bad yeah I'm not sure they're for me
though they're a little bit too wide for
me though and here's something you don't
see every day
we got the artisan mouse pads out on
display so they've got everything here
from like different hardnesses too soft
they've got the mids they've got the
extra saw if they got that in kind
of that got the hind got a lot of
different things here so literally they
have every single pad here this is like
gamers paradise if you don't come out of
here with something that is tailored to
you I mean you got a shoes man you're
you can definitely find something that
you want here at big camera I've got a
ton of different headsets look at all
these these are all headsets but a
really cool thing that they do here is
prices are actually really good it's
actually tax-free if you have your
passport and they give you another five
percent off if you use your visa so you
get a huge discount a friend got like
ninety five dollars off of his Nintendo
switch so if you are like coming to shop
and bring a lot of money because I mean
you'll save tons of money by just
shopping hair romaji switches
who do you know that has cheaper
wireless out to try for years it's crazy
all right we are at one of the biggest
PC gaming stores in all of Tokyo in here
so I'm gonna take you guys inside anyway

in Tokyo but this one has a lot of the
mice out for you to try just like the
