gonna show you guys a way to save
yourself a lot of time and most
importantly money now in my comment
sections of my keyboards I've been
seeing a lot of people asking me what
kind of cherry I mix which you should
they go with or I get the classic I hate
my current cherry MX switches on my
keyboard that I just spent 100 plus
dollars on can I switch out them for new
ones so I wanted to make this video on
how you can save yourself the trouble
whether you already know what kind of
switch you like or you're kind of
curious about what else is out there or
you are new to PC gaming and don't know
where to start so this is a cherry MX
switch tester that cost twenty dollars
but can save you hundreds by allowing
you to test some of the most popular
cherry MX switches and right next to
each other so you can get a feel of
which one you like the best this tester
from Mac's keyboard is made up of
plastic and it holds up to nine switches
and it includes key caps and a rings to
see how they would feel if you were to
mod your keyboard later so it's kind of
invaluable to have this kind of tool in
your arsenal on the keycaps witch tester
they've included a green blue black
silver clear red grey white and brown
switches me personally I had only really
tried green blue red and brown and
silver but since I got this tester I
think I might have to try out a white
switch as well because I'm really liking
the feel of it I think that I might even
like it more than Brown after testing
them side-by-side now once you get the
tester what I would do is hit the switch
you think you would like the best about
twenty times in a row to see if your
fingers get tired and pay attention
are you bottoming out are you lightly
tapping that will give you a clear
indication of which switch to go with
now you can also get an idea of how loud
the switch is which is also a plus so
let me drop a sound test of each right
now
oh yeah I'm loving it I'm loving all of
them you know any type of mechanical key
I just love it especially that blue it's
not just annoying it's so good so if you
guys are new to mechanical keyboards and
you don't know what kind of switches you
want to get first get a cherry MX switch
tester and save yourself some cash all
right guys so I hope you guys have found
this video useful notification squad I
will see you in the comments don't
forget to Like share comment and
subscribe and I will see you in the next
video it has been your boy BT Sam peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
