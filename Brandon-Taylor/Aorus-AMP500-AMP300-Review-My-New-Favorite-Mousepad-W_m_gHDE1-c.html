review of the A&amp;amp;P 500 and am p300
mousepads from aureus or gigabyte
welcome to the future guys because these
new hybrid mouse pads are taking over
the gaming market right now seriously if
you're like me and you go and read it
you go to mousepad reviews the AM P 500
is one of the top recommendations right
now and I don't know about you guys but
I trust read it these new amazing hybrid
passes are coming out they're coming out
with these unique materials that are
spill proof and they are super washable
and they'll stay the same no matter what
for years to come so the a MP 500 is
coming in at $40 in the MP 300 is coming
in at $30.00 this is really in line with
what we've been seeing from the gaming
mouse pad market right now I think a
shooting high is around forty to fifty
dollars and this thing is said to last
longer and be a great replacement to
that mousepad the MP 500 size is 430 by
370 millimeters and this is great for
you arm Amer's out there that one a
little bit more space the a mp3 hundreds
of size is 324 by 273 millimeters which
is more than enough for you risk gamers
out there with some room to spare the
hybrid silicone base on both of these
are 1.8 millimeters thick a usual
standard mousepad like a qck is gonna be
about 2 millimeters thick so you lose
point 2 millimeters but you don't
actually feel it this mouse pad is just
super comfortable so the fabric of top
feels like a hard pad my mind is blown
for you hard pad lovers out there this
thing is gonna be a godsend so you get
the benefits of a hard pad without
destroying your mouse feet these mouse
pads feel closest to I would say like a
Hayate
Otsu but not really it just you have to
try this mouse pad to really understand
what the surface is like it is like
nothing I've ever tried and that's a
good thing so even though this kind of
acts like a hard pad it is super
comfortable for you our members out
there I can run my arm and aim with it
for hours and not have any irritation on
my forearm now it's got these heat
molded edges that you literally cannot
feel I mean
a lot of you guys out there don't like
that stitched edging feel or even having
that cloth come up from the rubber a
little bit kind of irritates your skin
this mousepad will eliminate all of that
these mousepad literally melt into your
desk without all the fraying problems
and all that crap you just it's already
heat molded it's done and I tried prying
at the edges with no luck so these
things are super solid another thing
that I love about this mouse pad is the
silicone base this thing is orange it
looks kind of sexy and it doesn't move
whatsoever when it's on your desk so
another thing that I really love about
the MP 500 and 300 is that it acts like
a heart pad but there's a lot of
stopping power probably the most
stopping power out of any heart pad that
I've ever tried so again if you're
somebody that wants a heart pad or wants
the durability you want that spill
resistance you don't want that ability
to be able to clean it this mouse pad is
gonna be the one for you guys this is
what we've all been waiting for this is
the future I love this mouse pad so much
that it has actually stayed on my desk
usually when I try other mouse pads I
just run back to my artists and ink
i with this one I'm okay with letting it
stay on my desk and it just kind of
disappears I don't even have to like
think about it I just start gaming
nowadays and this is the one that I've
been using recently alright guys so
thank you guys for watching this review
on the a MP 500 and 300 amazing mouse
pads links will be in the description if
you want to pick some up I highly
recommend them they're in my top 3 just
saying alright so I know a lot of you
guys have been asking like what are some
good Mouse paths to get this is it
alright guys thank you guys for watching
don't forget to Like share comment and
subscribe and I will see you in the next
one it has been your boy bt saying
