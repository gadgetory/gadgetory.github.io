review and today it's a bit of a
surprise I got these in the mail
they're called the try bit ex free
wireless headphones and I didn't know
what to think of it but hey I said why
not just do a review somebody sent me
these I'm guessing it's try bit so why
not try them out give them a test run
and boy was i pleasantly surprised so
today I'm gonna give you my initial
thoughts on these headphones which are
coming in is about 39.99 I just know
this because I tape their website so
starting off with these the one thing
that I noticed right out of the
packaging was this red trimming around
the edges and that's the first thing
that really stands out to me I love this
accid it's a metallic looking red it
looks very very nice these feel like the
old original Monsters if you've ever had
those back before beats when Beats was
kind of with monster and monster was
kind of with beats they kind of had this
product called I believe it was the I
monsters
I believe don't quote me on that but
these kind of feel like that but a
little bit better and those back then
didn't have the wings on them to keep
them in your ear so they were just
falling out all the time because they're
so heavy but these have a nice weight
they actually feel very premium for the
price they actually feel a lot better
than some of the top name brands I'd say
these feel better than like the Jaybirds
or Bose even the next thing that stood
out to me were the wings these things
feel like the Bose sound sport Wireless
they feel very gel like they feel very
comfortable they're not very rigid they
don't feel like hard plastic they feel
like Joe and I really really like that
it's like a silicone gel feeling it's
not the silicone plastic feeling so
there's kind of a difference and some of
you may know what I'm talking about so
in the box is going to come with a small
medium and large pair of this
tips it comes with two more sizes of the
wings comes with a cord gatherer is that
what you call these things a cord
shortener yeah we'll go with that a cord
shortener to make these shorter on the
back of your neck so if you're working
out these aren't gonna tug and I boil
boy does this thing really work I love
that they included this and I don't know
why more companies don't just throw this
in it's like a little piece of plastic
right here but it makes all the
difference sometimes they also added in
a nice pouch which a lot of brands
aren't doing so Wow I mean they're
actually giving pretty good value for
$40 and I'm pleasantly surprised one
more thing that I forgot to mention is
that you can also wear these around your
neck
they have magnets in the housing which
allow you to place them on your neck and
they won't swing around all crazy like
that like so coming apart so very nice
touch you've really thought of
everything with these and that's
surprising for a budget pair of wireless
earbuds the remote I feel like doesn't
match the rest of the headphones the
earbuds it feels kind of like out of
place it feels like I say it feels like
a toy it's better than most honestly
it's better than most but it looks and
it feels like a toy it just it looks
like a toy the red it just looks like a
toy versus these metallic aluminum
housing on the earbuds themselves so it
I would want them to kind of streamline
it maybe make that metallic I don't know
if that's gonna make the remote too
heavy but maybe that's something they
want to consider in the future just to
make everything kind of feel like a
cohesive product now the sound boy oh
boy these things made my spine tingle
guys very very warm you guys know I like
warm sound signatures warm just the base
the the amount of air that these things
can move is ridiculous the base on these
is crazy it's better than the power
beats in my opinion which have a most
base for a in-ear wireless headphone so
what I mean just wow like the air
movement you just feel that thump in
your ear and that's crazy for a in your
wireless headphone one other thing that
I really like about
headphones is that a volume gives super
loud now I know some people will say oh
don't listen to your music loud but
sometimes some music sources are very
low I listen to a lot of EDM sets and
they are just super low sometimes and
you can barely hear and I ended up
having just turning it off and just
going to Spotify or title or whatever so
it's always better to have more volume
with clarity than less volume with
clarity see where I'm going with that so
yeah these are gonna be great for rap of
course the bass is just crazy but also
with anything with vocals vocals sound
very good with these a little bit laid
back more laid-back than I like but
still very nice and that bass kind of
makes up for it this is the one
exception the one time where the bass
really outshines the MS for me and I'm
okay with that
I tested these with classical and they
just sound so good guys Wow
I mean I can listen to these things for
hours and I think these are gonna become
some of my daily drivers at least for
the gym one more thing before we move on
to the battery round I want to talk
about the comfort of these a little bit
more these things stay in your ear and
they do not fall out they're metallic
they're aluminum but they feel they have
a nice weight to them but they're not
super heavy they're not gonna fall out
on you in this gel tip that they have
the gel wings that they have just keep
everything in place and they could not
be more secure like sometimes I'll just
lay on the ground or I'll lay in my bed
and listen to music and these I can roll
around and it's just all good if they
just stay in place so if you're worried
about that if you work out hard if
you're going crazy if you're doing
Crossfit don't even worry about it let's
talk about the battery life the battery
life is insane on these guys 10 hours no
other headphone is doing that right now
not the beats X not that Jay Bruce only
one that surpasses it is probably the
power beats threes at 12 hours but then
again that's just crazy and 10 hours is
more than enough to get you through 5
days of working out
just it's incredible so again great
value the call quality as well is just
amazing I'm loving it people said that I
sounded very clear so definitely another
plus for these another thing I want to
address is the connectivity now these
sound great I couldn't find any
information on whether they had the
newest Bluetooth technology but from my
testing the connectivity is great I've
been able to walk far distances and test
these I've been able to walk around my
house without interruption strong solid
connection also you can watch YouTube or
movies without the lips not being in
sync with what's being said so again
very nice thank you so very much try bit
I am just wow I'm just wowed by your
product that you were able to put out
this much quality for only $40 and keep
in mind guys I haven't been I haven't
talked to them nobody's paying me I just
received these in the mail I have no
idea what's going on right now your
guess is as good as mine but hey I'm
glad that I got these great bass very
warm sound signature comfortable they
feel premium the only thing I would
really change is the remote to make it
look like the rest of the headphone but
even then the cord feels great they give
you a connector which you can keep the
cord off the back of your neck so all
very very nice touches and don't forget
these gel tips that almost feel like
bows so wow just wow I'm just these
things are gonna be my daily drivers I
think we'll see I'm gonna keep I'm gonna
keep using these I'm gonna keep testing
them maybe I'll give you guys an update
but for right now I'm blown away and
we'll just leave it at that for now
