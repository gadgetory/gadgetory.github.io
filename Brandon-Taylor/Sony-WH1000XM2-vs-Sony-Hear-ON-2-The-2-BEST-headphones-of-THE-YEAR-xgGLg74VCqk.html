winner who do you guys think won h1a
eight I saw your messages and here we
are we're gonna finish this battle today
and decide the winner of best sony
headphone and probably the best
headphone of the year
what is up guys is BT back here again
with another battle so if you guys have
been watching my channel for a while you
will know that I have just been in love
with all of Sony's headphones this year
they really stepped up their game from
last year fix a lot of the problems so
here we are today we're gonna have a
battle between the WH 1000 XM twos and
the new Sony here on Tues I think
personally that these are probably the
two best headphones that you can buy for
Wireless noise cancellation over your
headphones at the moment so which one is
the best and not only the best which one
is best for you today we're gonna get
into all that and decide a winner so
today is gonna be mostly about
discerning between these small little
differences between these two headphones
if you guys want the full review a full
detail of each headphone I will link my
videos down below so you can get a
review of all those and all the
different features but for now I just
want to focus on the main differences
that some people might find important in
choosing one over the other so let's
start this thing off with the comfort
and design now me personally I just want
to start this off by saying that the WH
1000 X m2 s and the Sony a cheer on twos
are both very comfortable I did find
that the WH 1000 X and twos it's a
mouthful they aren't as comfortable
because the leather that they use is a
lot hotter it keeps your ears hotter so
I found myself having to take them off
constantly I have to let my ears breathe
whereas a Sony her2 s are a lot more
comfortable they're a lot more cooler so
these could be worn in the gym without
making you sweat before you even walk
into the gym the band is a little bit
bigger on the Sony here on Tues but that
makes them feel a little bit more
sturdier I don't know if you guys have
heard about crack gate with the 1000 X
and twos but some people have reported
they they have cracked I've tried my
best to crack these things and I cannot
I don't know what people are doing are
you guys throwing them out the window or
running over them with your car I can't
seem to break mine so if you've broken
these let me know down in the comments
below how you broke them so even though
the
on the Sony here on Tues is bigger like
with wise they actually don't fan out as
much and they keep a lower profile than
the 1000 XM twos the 1000 XM to fan out
a little bit which can get over in the
way of like your daily commute and
things like that so that's something to
keep in mind if you are gonna try to use
either one of these for the gym
both have touch controls but I did find
that the 1000 XM tubes they seemed a
little bit more responsive so when you
press play on the sony here on Tues I
noticed that once you press down on it
hard and you release that air kind of
creates a suction and it's very
uncomfortable I did not get that with a
1000 XM two's so I like the touch
controls on the 1000 XM 2 is a little
bit better otherwise they are exactly
the same also too with the sony 1000 x
m2 is you can hold your right palm over
your ear and this pauses your song
temporarily and then you can take it off
and it plays again which is something
that the sony here on tuesday f
the 1000 x and twos lay down flat so you
can lay these down flat on your chest so
when you are traveling these will stay
out of your way they won't choke you
like the sony here on Tues so that's
something to consider also the 1000 X
and twos have a airplane adapter where
you can plug this in watch movies listen
to whatever they have on the plane and
that's something that the Sony here on
Tuesday so the 1000 X and twos I feel
like are more focused towards a traveler
and the here on twos are more focused
towards a commuter everyday person me
personally for the winner of this round
I have to go with the Sony here on Tues
and let me tell you why I mean I only
travel two times a year I'm not a heavy
traveler so the accessories and the
laying down of the headphones don't
really bother me too much but the main
thing for me is that these keep very
cool the Sony here on to is keep very
cool cooler than the WH 1000 XM twos so
I can wear them for a longer period of
time I can enjoy my music longer and I
can use them in more situations like the
gym but like I said if you're a traveler
you may want to go with the 1000x m2s
and by travel I mean you are a jet
setter and you need that adapter you
need to lay down features all the time
okay so when it comes to noise
cancellation both of these are great but
one is greater than the other the 1000
XM to just have that added noise
cancellation that just put these over
the top you can adjust what sounds come
in whether that's voices or ambient
noise there's just a lot more control
and when they have the pressurized
system in the app which you just hold
the ambient button for two seconds it
turns on in a adjusts your noise
cancellation to the actual pressure like
say for instance in a cabinet on a plane
isn't that incredible so this really
does work even when I turn it on in my
room I notice that the noise
cancellation goes up it gets a little
bit better so I have to give the noise
cancellation round to the Sony 1000 XM
twos
alright so let's talk about the sound
and the differences between the two now
the 1000x m2s are gonna be more for bass
lovers and braf and EDM and things like
that but keep in mind that they do kind
of muddy up that mid and the higher
range in songs but keep in mind that
bass kind of overtakes the mids and the
highs no matter what EQ I would set it
on this would happen whereas on the Sony
here on Tues the mids are just for their
in-your-face
pow they're there the highs are also
very detailed so more detailed oriented
people will want to go with the Sony
here on twos and the more bass heavy not
so much detailed but just just want that
bass that thumping that rumbling go with
the 1000 XM twos and that's not to say
that the sony here on twos are bad with
bass they are great as well they just
don't Rumble as much so the soundstage
and the sony here on twos is slightly
more enjoyable because of that added
detail you can hear instruments to the
left to the right of you it's just very
very good and that's what i'm about i
love bass too but I love my bass in my
detail I like my cake and I want to eat
it too so I find myself picking up and
going with the sony here on 2
for sound so for the sound round I
prefer the Sony here on Tues
and I think even bass lovers will love
them as well honestly okay so for the
battery life the WH 1000 X and twos are
coming in at 28 hours and the Sony here
on twos are coming in at 22 hours so
let's just make this easy the Sony 1000
X and twos are the winner for the
battery round the connection honestly in
my testing has been the exact same they
both have the same distance no breakups
anywhere that I go so both are just very
very solid pieces of tech the call
quality the Sony here on Tues are just
better the WH 1000 x m2 is you would
think that they are marketed towards
more of a traveler a business person you
know you see the person on their their
website looking out the window and
looking all cool yeah they're not that
great for calls I don't recommend them
at all actually for important calls
because they sound kind of bad the Sony
here on twos on the other hand are very
good so if you wanted to use these four
calls I would definitely recommend going
with the Sony here on Tues so in
conclusion the WH 1000 X and twos and
the Sony here on tubes are both great
headphones I mean just they are the top
of the line
forget Bose forget all these other
companies I can't even think of right
now forget all of them just focus on
Sony these are the two that you need to
be deciding in between the 1000x m2s are
marketed more towards travelers and I
definitely recommend them for sure
without a doubt without hesitation I
recommend these if you're a traveler go
with the 1000x
em twos if you travel under I'd say
about five times a year you know you
just use these s commuter you want to
use them for the gym daily basis because
you're gonna be making calls or picking
up calls you're gonna be in a library
whatever it is that you're gonna be
doing with them I would definitely go
with the Sony here on twos and that's
where I fall in I only travel twice a
year like I said maybe three times four
times but not more than five and these
have been very good for a long listening
session
for the gym and I've gotten more use out
of my dollar by getting the Sony here on
Tues All Things Considered my pick my
winner for this battle is the Sony here
on Tues all right so that's gonna
conclude this battle let me know what
