up guys I am tan as fuck but I want to
give you guys an update I've been sick
the past week I think I said that in
another video so yeah just starting to
get back into it this week I kind of
kicked it off I wanted to do the right
thing and I wanted to get back on it
because last week I was eating like crap
because I was sick let's having pizza
soup all that so here we are we're back
and this is what we got to here are some
lettuce some tuna I don't know what
happened with my camera but some lettuce
so our main lettuce tuna the tuna egg
sweet relish mustard light mayonnaise if
you want the recipe go on my Instagram
so you just put some in here and eat it
up it's about four to four grams of
protein so just getting back into it
also having pistachios this week I'm
doing low carb no carb meat and veggies
this week I don't know if I said that
but that's important doing that so I
feel pretty good I'm feeling pretty good
i'm loosing the water weight that i had
losing some of the softness and getting
that hardness back at my muscles from
the week off so I'm feeling good yo so
uh i'ma show you guys something that I
just picked up
I picked up some pistachios from Ross
Ross be four bucks I got a jalapeno
flavor what brand is this Shelton I know
I have some random brand I mean does
really matter you trying to go for a
cost efficiency here cuz nuts are
expensive you know I feel you nuts are
expensive but I love notes anyways
anyways chilly limo pistachios are
amazing they're good I haven't rat the
jalapeno ones yet but these so far have
been really good I just got the idea
that maybe Ross would have them for
cheaper Marshalls TJ maxx they might
have it for cheaper than going to
safeway it's been like 10 bucks while
back so it's been eight bucks total for
two bags hey could be way worse I'm just
going to snack on those as i said i'm
only doing meat veggies and I guess nuts
those are going to be my protein sources
for this week so I am feeling pretty
good all things considered all things
all things all things all things I feel
pretty good keeping my water up I don't
know if the sickness is making me a
little less hungry but definitely feel
like my appetites in check I don't feel
like I need to go and splurge or go all
out on some kind of food um pizza or
cupcakes or anything like that so that's
a that's a positive definitely for sure
now I am going to give you guys a number
one tip and dieting number one tip
do not suppress your thoughts on your
cravings do not because your brain the
way it works is whatever you say okay I
don't think about this I don't wanna
think about this this pizza saying I
don't think about a pizza now your brain
is going to be every time it sees pizza
or anytime you think of pieces can be a
warning warning warning Pizza Pizza
Pizza Pizza Pizza stay away from pizza
right and what are you doing you're
thinking about pizza it's fucked up but
that's how it works and when you think
about it more guess why you you're gonna
start thinking this is important because
I keep thinking about it it's not it the
only reason why you're thinking about is
because you're trying to suppress the
thoughts on why you're eating why why
you want to eat it right so instead what
you have to do is feel that craving feel
the part of you that wants that pizza
you don't have to act on it feel and
think of and realize that you're
thinking about this pizza that's all you
have to do don't try to push it away let
it be the craving will pass in 10
minutes whether you like it or not the
thing is when you suppress it that's
when it comes back
I just changed the whole I just I just
lost you like 20 pounds right there this
is why when people the yo-yo diet right
let's say two people start off the same
same level same weight one person dies
down me like 10 15 pounds and the whole
time they're restricted up so saying I
don't I can't have pieces so they go
around and look the sea fucking round
table they see mountain mikes they see
all these different crazy different
pizza places right what do they do they
want it even more so what are they more
likely to do they're more likely to
splurge right so once they're done
dieting guess what they're going to
weigh more than that person that was the
same way because that person isn't
thinking oh I can't have it does that
make sense so that person is thinking I
can't have it they're not looking out
for the pieces they don't care they
passed by piece of plans to like oh it's
another day but the other person is
dieting is thinking wait a minute I
can't have that I can't have that I
can't have so noticing all these things
that they can't have and what is it
doing is putting on their mind instead
you honestly have to you're respecting
your pizza right so you're going to be
thinking about it allow yourself to
think about it allow yourself to feel
that craving I guarantee once you're
done dining like right now I'm not even
creating beats and I've been craving
anything because I allow myself to think
about it a lot I allow myself to be okay
with those feelings and to feel what it
feels like the crave that pizza well
there's a part of me that really wants
that pizza you know in all its cheesy
goodness but that's okay it really is
it's okay
I'm telling you it's okay you can think
about it it's not going to add any
weight onto your body it's okay so take
that run with it next time you get a
craving whatever your vice is whatever
you're craving is think about this and
run with it do what you got to do stay
true to your diet remember in the last
step I before I go is when you think
about it and then also to afterwards
think about your goal think about what
you're trying to achieve are you trying
to get that the body that you will think
about that body right after your accept
the thought you know is there you feel
the craving you're okay with it being
there you're not trying to push it away
it's on your mind you realize that it's
on your mind do you think what is my
goal what is my goal you know just
defend those jeans is it to be shredded
is it to have abs I guarantee you that
craving it doesn't stand a chance it's
going to be gone within 10 minutes
anyways and that time that you're
thinking about all these things it's
gone so take this and run with it
literally I want you to run with this
idea I want you to become the best I
want you to be the best no bullshit just
I want you guys to be the best I don't
know if I start a series on this Senate
just our series on a light or mental
stuff more mental more mental aspects of
bodybuilding because I feel like a lot
of people don't do that so maybe I'll
start this maybe we'll save this episode
one
episode 1 is dealing with cravings BTW
