another battle today I have a battle for
you guys between two of the hottest
truly wireless earbuds out today the
Apple earpods coming in at a hundred and
sixty dollars and the bose sound sport
free coming in at two hundred fifty
dollars
both have past my initial testing and
both have been recommended by yours
truly but if I could only choose one
which would it be find out today but
before we begin I'd like to know what
you guys think who do you guys think one
pause and write down in the comments
below alright so let's start off with
the comfort and design of these earbuds
these have completely different designs
and will appeal to different types of
groups the air pots are ultra slim and
simplistic the earbuds as well as the
case are very compact and very portable
great for everyday commuting these can
fit comfortably into your pants with
your phone and your keys and your wallet
at the same time the Bose earbuds are
big and bulky just like their sound
support wireless counterparts these are
made for more of a workout enthusiasts
who don't mind that exercise the case is
huge in comparison to the air pockets
about two to three times to be exact and
the same goes for the earbuds as well so
if they are less portable why would we
even consider getting the Bose over the
air pots well in my experience commuting
and using earbuds in crowded places can
lead to a lot of sound being leaked into
your earbuds messing with your music and
this is where Bose has the air Potts
beat the stay here tips on the Bose
freeze are comfortable as well as
blocking out tons and tons of sound not
all sound but I'd say about 90% of
outside noise whereas the air pods block
out roughly I'd say about 50% at best
while we're on the topic of comfort they
both are super comfortable the air pause
being slightly more comfortable since
they don't go as far into your ear the
air pots are also super secure which you
wouldn't think they would be just by
looking at them I've never had them drop
or fall out of my ears and same goes for
Bose they are super comfortable and with
the wings they just never
fall out the one added bonus with bows
is that they offer several sizes of
wingtips so you can get the right fit
whereas the airpot are one size fits all
if you'd like to hear outside noises
while you run work out or commute than
the air pots are for you if you enjoy
more of a closed intimate experience
then the Bose fries are gonna be for you
me personally I work in a crowded office
with multiple conversations going on
around me and if I have an audio book on
it's impossible to have a good
experience so the Bose frees work best
for me overall though being objective
you can't really beat apples simplistic
design and to quote them their products
just work so this round goes to the
Apple earpods alright so for the sound
around the air part alot yes they do
sound better than your normal Apple
earbuds or most earbuds on the market
they sound very warm and vibrant for all
genres of music the bows on the other
hand are warm sounding but you do get
that outer base from having more of a
closed experience since the air
Direction is gonna be more focused into
your ear not leaking out like on the air
pod so you're gonna get more of that
bass most people will be satisfied with
either but I love that the bows give you
that extra kick on the bottom end that
will be great for movie listening and
genres all will benefit from that added
bass as well
so for the sound around I have to give
it to the Bose freeze alright so let's
talk about the connectivity so true
wireless technology for earbuds is still
a very new thing and the only company
that really has nailed it for me is
apple no breakups ever since I've gotten
these things and the distance they get
is just outrageous and oh did I mention
there's no lag when watching videos with
these yeah amazing whereas on the Bose
freeze there is lag and sometimes little
hiccups in the connection causing you to
lose sound in one ear but it's not as
prevalent in these as in most other
companies but it is still there and one
thing I do want to clarify what the
connection is that yes guys Apple
earpods works with Android devices as
well so don't have no fear these work
with everything so the connect
in round I have to give you to the air
pot so for battery life the air pots are
getting about 5 hours of battery life
with 5 extra charges giving you over a
day's worth of charge just incredible
on the other end Bose is giving you 5
hours of battery life and 2 extra
charges totaling about 15 hours which is
decent all things considered though I do
have to give it to the air pocket over
24 hours it's just amazing now the call
quality on both is great the Bose are
above average most of these truly
wireless headphones are pretty bad
considering that the earbud sits all the
way back here the mic has to be really
good and a lot of companies haven't
nailed that yet so both really good job
on that but Apple is just on another
level their call quality with all
headphones with all earbuds has always
been amazing I don't know how they do it
but they've somehow transferred that old
Apple technology into these air pods and
they just sound really good no breakups
you sound like you're just talking into
somebody's ear
a little creepy but it's the truth so
the call quality round has to go to the
Apple earpods again so here we are guys
at the end of another battle thanks for
hanging in there with me both have their
strengths and weaknesses and honestly I
love both but if I could only have one I
think I would have to choose the Apple
earpods Apple has really nailed the
truly wireless headphone category right
out of the gate they are simplistic they
sound good
they have great connectivity for Android
and Apple devices
great for calls and more the only thing
that really keeps the bose fries from
beating them is the price and that
connection I would however choose the
both fries if you are using your ear bus
strictly for the JIT alright guys so
that's gonna do it for me in this battle
I'll put some more links down in the
