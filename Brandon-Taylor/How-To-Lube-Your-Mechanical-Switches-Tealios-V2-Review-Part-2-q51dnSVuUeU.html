part two of the teleost v2 linear
switches review I've been using them for
a few weeks now and they've been simply
amazing but like with all things I think
they could be a little bit better so
lubing your switches is set to smooth
out your switches making them feel and
sound exponentially better now the
method that I'm gonna be using to lube
my switches is by my good friend and
keyboard god tohat types if you guys
aren't already following him you should
be because he is super knowledgeable
about keyboards but on the other hand if
things go wrong we know who to blame
hey hop oh sorry
alright guys enough talking I'm ready to
lube my tea Leo speed to switches so the
tools that you're gonna need to open
your switches are a flathead screwdriver
to get into it or a switch opener I like
to switch opener because it takes a
little less time you can just pop it
right open this one if you want to use
it you have to put it in between the two
clips right here and press
and then it comes off as you see or you
can just do a switch puller method or
switch opener method I should say well
and that just popped open we go we have
a switch open already so I'll just leave
it open for now you're also gonna need a
brush okay
Tay how recommended having like this
little oil paint brush type thing I'll
link everything down below don't worry
about it then I have this gh4 Lube it's
thick and it's from zeal PC now with a
thick Lube I found that you need to
apply even less and you would a thin
Lube so be very careful with thick Lube
I know Tejada did his with thin Lube so
I'm doing my with thick so I think that
about covers what you're going to need
I'll again like I said I'll have
everything down in the comments below
and not in the comments but in the
description so the first step you're
gonna take the brush and dip it in to
the loop now you see how I have a bunch
on there that's not what you want so you
want to take a lot of that excess off
especially when you have this thick Lube
you don't take a lot off I found that
you don't need that much with this one
and so what you're gonna do is you're
going to take the switch now you see
these two little columns on the side
here there's one on each side you're
going to go one since I have thick loop
I'm only gonna go once on it because
thick loop is just crazy and then you're
going to rub it inside this center
column right here easy enough one time
around
then you're going to take the spring
okay take the spring put some on the
bottom there put that into the center
column there you go and you're gonna get
then top nice and oiled as well then
you're gonna dip your brush one more
time the same thing you want to take
even less this time so I'm gonna just
like try to like get everything off the
brush with this thick one so get all of
that off you're gonna grab the stem
right and then you're gonna go down the
side so down here once time you go once
over here and then this part is the
you're not gonna get the front in the
back and then the legs don't go down
this part if you have tactile switch you
see these little legs that are poking
out there if you go against this part it
will make your switches less tactile so
or mess up the tactile bump so that is
not what you want so steer clear of that
and but since we have linear since the
tele doses are linear we can leave those
as well and then we're gonna Lube the
bottom try to get everything as even as
you can
consistency is key because you want your
whole keyboard to feel the same you
don't want some keys to be overly lubed
and some not and then you're just gonna
put the stem back on the spring place it
forward towards that metal clip
I don't even know I think that's the
metal clip metal switch thingy okay I'm
not you know so then you put the switch
back on like so put the top housing back
on you press it in and you have your
switch lubed and there you have it now
all you have to do is do this sixty to
sixty five times more or if you have a
full-size keyboard which I don't even
want to think about because that's a ton
of keys it's gonna take you about three
hours to get all of your switches done
so yeah that's how you lube your
switches oh yeah mmm now this is
definitely taking my switches to the
next level
they kind of dampen the sound and they
definitely feel a lot less scratch here
and they feel smooth all the way down
okay one thing to notice that I don't
know if it's because I use thick Lube or
what but I did notice that my switches
did slow down slightly so if you're
using something like a speed silver or
you just have like a need for speed this
is not gonna beat your friend I do want
to put this to the test and maybe try
some thinner Lube maybe that's where I
went wrong
I'm sure take I will disown me after
saying that but anyways guys thank you
guys for watching this video I hope you
guys have enjoyed this video it has been
your boy bt Luger switches because it is
simply amazing it really does make a
difference and it will give you an
overall better typing experience alright
guys that is my time it has been your
boy bt saying i already said that but
alright peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
