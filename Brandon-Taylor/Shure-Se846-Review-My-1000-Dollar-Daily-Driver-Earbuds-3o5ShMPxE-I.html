another review today I'm gonna be
reviewing a pair of headphones that I've
come to be spending a lot of time with
lately as they become my main daily
drivers over the past two months
I mean I've barely touched any other
earbuds which is why you haven't really
seen any earbud reviews on my channel
lately but all of this has come at a
cost a cost of one thousand dollars you
heard me correctly if the shore se8 four
sixes cost a thousand dollars insane so
today I want to answer what you're all
thinking and which are all asking
yourselves right now is spending this
amount of money necessary or is there a
diminishing return on headphones after a
certain point but before we begin guys
don't forget to subscribe to the channel
for more content like this and if you
have any recommendations for headphones
for me to try out just let me know down
below in the comments now in the Box you
are getting this plastic container which
just feels like a thousand dollars
already you get a carrying case you get
an extra cord a 3.5 millimeter to 2.5
millimeter headphone jack an airplane
adapter they also have a inline audio
control all the different kind of ear
tips for you to get the proper fit
there's silicone as well as foam tips I
usually just go with the regular black
foam tips as they give a ton of
isolation so you don't have all that
juicy expense of $1000 sound leaking out
due to the in ear style though you will
get ear fatigue after a while guys you
guys might think I'm crazy but I
actually used these thousand dollar ear
buds at the gym because they block out
everything and they sound amazing these
are also a great option for travelers
because of the great noise cancellation
I used them a lot on my last trip to LA
and they were just perfect also they
include these filters which give you a
different sound signature depending on
what you're using the black is more warm
because it cuts off the high frequencies
they have a blue one which is balanced
they have a white which cuts off the low
end so EDM Rapala
don't use the white butt EDM and rap
users you will want to use the black
filters classical and jazz users will
want something along the lines of the
white filters if you listen to all
genres though I would recommend using
those neutral blue filters and we'll get
into how these sound a little bit later
in the review they also have this
flexible plastic that wrap around your
ear near the earbud and they aren't
super comfortable and they're
comfortable while both earbuds are in
but if you are hanging one off you're
trying to listen to somebody it does tug
and pull at your ear and the back of
your ear can become a little bit
irritated sorry guys I've gotten so many
questions when walking around with these
due to the clear design they really
stand out but I'm not really too sure if
it's because they leak or if it's
because people think I'm about to
perform in a show sound so let's talk
about the sound and if these are worth
$1,000 I mean what could they possibly
sound like so I'm gonna try to give you
the best description possible for how
they sound and I'm gonna be straight up
with you guys guys these are not worth
it if you're gonna be killing yourself
to get them or your bank account over if
you can't afford them on the same note
if you can't afford them and you want
something that will last you a long time
and quite possibly be an in-game then
look no further because these sound
amazing these earbuds the SC 8 4 6 s
have some of the clearest cleanest base
of any earbud or headphone over here
included that I've ever tried it's just
the the base is just super clean there's
no distortion whatsoever these really do
give you that true-to-life subwoofer
experience as promised with their quad
drivers the soundstage is there but it's
pretty tight it's more of a closed
earbud they aren't gonna be as spacious
as something like the audio is I signed
tens that I have but it's really good
it's still really really good that being
said I haven't even touched my audios I
signed 10 since I got these because
these are just that good when switching
the filters to tell your sound these
really do shine I mean EDM and rap sound
just perfect with the blue or black the
classical and jazz sound perfect with
the filter is the trouble is just
immaculate I can't find any fault with
these headphones with these earbuds I
should say you really have to hear these
to believe it you can also just power
these off your phone and they get super
loud so there's no need for an amp or
any extra things to buy with these
headphones so you can kind of take that
into consideration with the price in
conclusion the bass is amazing you get a
ton of accessories that make you feel
like these are $1,000 the comfort is
there I do however think that there is a
diminishing return on headphones and
earbuds you're spending only for the
smallest of details and intricacies to
come out in your music so guys don't try
to kill yourself getting a pair of
$1,000 headphones or earbuds I think
that at a certain point only if you've
heard everything and you really want a
unique experience that is when I feel
like you shouldn't consider getting
something of this nature worth this much
money that being said the shorter sc8
four sixes are a great experience that
if you don't ever own them I think you
should at least hear them at least once
in your lifetime especially for your
bass lovers out there to see the quality
difference in bass alright guys so that
is going to do it for this review if you
have any more questions there's a lot to
go over with these earbuds I know I
missed a couple things ask me down below
and I'll be sure to talk to you guys and
answer all your questions that's been my
review of the short sc8 for Six's thank
you for watching and for all the support
and I will see you guys in the next
video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
