thank you guys for tuning in checking me
out I'm not going to tell you to like
and subscribe like most people you can
do that shit on your own if you like it
which are hoping that you will
please like my shit sometimes you just
gotta ask yourself walk before i go into
my workout ask myself why am I doing
this work out what I want to accomplish
do what you need to do to be your shit
done let's get into chest now what I was
doing is I love starting with the
incline dumbbell press I always always
always start with this no matter how
much i change my workout I always come
back to this movement with chest you
really really have to squeeze and you're
really really happy for your mind into
the muscle a lot of people don't do that
that's one thing if I get stressed I
know a lot of people stresses but it's
so true you have to have to happen have
that mind to muscle connection I love
doing incline because I've seen the most
games in my chest just do an incline you
know flat bench barbell bench it doesn't
nothing for me you know maybe maybe
something for you but for me this is
what I've seen works the best
next up we have the flat dumbbell bench
press now we did a variation that i got
from chris jones physiques of greatness
got to give credit where credit is due
there's a lot of great workouts and this
one I've added into my routine recently
and I've seen a lot a lot of progress
with my chest now what you want to do is
you want to be 10 Close Grip you want to
switch a grip the regular position and
do ten more and that'll be 17 I'm not
gonna lie to you these will test you on
the last few reps maybe around 17 18 19
20 I'm just straight pumping I don't
really care i'm just trying to get the
weight up as best as possible you know
giving maximal effort and that's what
it's all about okay next up we have the
decline dumbbell flyes and as you can
see at the top I like to bring it in and
bring the bottom of my wrists together
and really really squeezing and this
will a lot of people ask me oh how do
you get that lower chest when I'm in the
gym it's this movement I feel like is
really really develop my lower chest
better than a press would and we
superset these with a Close Grip press
just to get that inner chest a little
bit and just really really tired I chest
again squeezing as much as possible even
if you can't get the weight all the way
up I just squeeze the hell out of my
chest until I can't anymore and that's
what it's all about
one thing that I really want to stress
is that I always always always arch my
back to the point where my shoulder
blades are flat against all benches and
really lift up my chest so that my chest
is and the craft think of it as my chest
isn't like receiving all of the weight
by being forward in the movement and a
lot of people I see the back is
completely flat or the shoulders are
taking over and it's just doing them no
goodness and they wonder why their
chests and growing and this is why you
know they're not you know doing these
little things that will help them know
this is like I see it all the time if I
can have you guys take away one thing
from this video it would be to arch your
back and keep your shoulder blades flat
against the bench do not lay your whole
back flat and I just want to hear from
you guys about if this worked for you
guys if your chest got sore after this
or if you saw a little bit of an
improvement just by doing this okay now
this next movement that I'm showing you
guys is really great for that inner
chest and getting that upper chest and
you see that guy over there admiring if
I going to go be with shit once I leave
but what you want to do is you want to
bring the dumbbell across your body and
contract that particular pic right now
I'm contracting my left PEC and with
this movement I try not to worry too
much about you know Wade but just
feeling the contraction and filling my
muscle getting that mindless connection
again now this next movement that you
see my boys chi-wai doing it's the
dumbbell pullover what these I like to
bring it just over the top of my head
where I cannot see it anymore I can't
see the weight and once I didn't know
that I know I've gone far enough for my
chest and I bring it back over the top
and while it's over me
I like to squeeze these are great for
getting that serratus getting that nice
stretch of the chest in the back and it
just feels great at the end of the
workout to kind of get that stretch and
squeeze and it's it's a good way in your
work and I hope you guys have enjoyed my
first attempt at a commentary stay tuned
I mean hopefully I can get better at
this but let me know how you guys liked
it you know I you feel like I was
missing something let me know I want to
improve this and make it the best I can
for you guys check out this clip of me
ranking just go chest workout with you I
hope you guys enjoyed it hope you guys
can learn something kill your chest stay
tuned i got some more cool shit coming
like I said I got new workouts every
single week I try to do two videos a
