with another real review for real users
what do you guys think about that intro
let me know down in the comments below
but anyways guys I have a review for you
guys on the new surface pro 6 now I
recently did a review on the surface go
link down in the description below
shameless plug
that was my first introduction to the
surface line and boy was I not
disappointed they are giving you laptop
performance and a small form factor I
mean what's not to love about that so
after that experience I said you know
what the pro sounds like it will be like
the go but on steroids so I patiently
waited until the surface pro 6 came out
and picked one up so today I'm going to
be giving you guys the good and the bad
on the surface pro 6 before we begin
though guys I want to let you guys know
that I am now doing all my unboxings on
my Instagram stories exclusively so
follow me at bt esthetics to get a first
look at what's coming up on the channel
you'll get the inside scoop and my
thoughts my initial impressions as well
so from a design standpoint the surface
pro 6 is exactly the same as a surface
pro 5 except for this year they are
giving us a black version ooh-ahh i
decided to go with the classic platinum
because i just think it looks amazing
the bezels aren't super thin but I don't
mind because it works very nicely with
the type cover the hinge makes the
surface pro line so so much nicer than
the iPad in my opinion you can put this
on whatever surface you want and
whatever position you like and you can
be rest assured that it will stay in
that way period so as for the ports the
surface pro 6 has a USB 3.0 which is
getting a lot of crap and rightfully so
because even the surface go a 550 dollar
device has USB C connectivity and it
just takes the device to a whole another
level with that connectivity USB C is
also the future so Microsoft isn't
really future proofing this device I
will say that though that may be true
you will
to get a lot of functionality out of the
USB 3 with hard drives and things like
that also on the side you'll find a mini
DisplayPort in case you want to hook it
up to an external monitor the device is
also coming in at 1.7 pounds which is
lighter than most laptops where the
average is around 2.5 pounds or above so
carrying this thing around will be a
breeze before you go any further
Microsoft please just bundle the type
cover with the surface pro line or any
surface device these are an extra 130 to
150 dollars on top of the 900 I paid for
the device I would like to see them just
add that into the price that way there
isn't that sticker shock of oh now I
have to pay an extra 130 dollars just to
have the type cover and it shouldn't be
like that that being said the type cover
is my favorite thing about the surface
pro lines the keys are great and the
track pad has gestures which is just
amazing the screen features a resolution
of 27 36 by 18 24 267 PPI and aspect
ratio of 3:2 - it's definitely sharper
than the surface go and I have to say
guys I'm really impressed by the screen
on this thing it's very responsive as
well and it is super sharp the biggest
change to the surface pro line this year
is that the processor has been bumped up
from 2 cores to 4 cores it also not
features 8 gigabytes or 16 gigabytes of
RAM an i5 or i7 processor and 128
gigabytes of storage - one terabyte of
storage depending on your needs
I think the bump up in the cores
actually caused them to drop the
integrated graphics from a 640 to a 620
the one reason I believe this is the
case is because the four core processors
probably aren't that advanced to have
that better integrated graphics in their
most applications that creatives will
use though are mostly a CPU extensive
this machine will breeze through
Lightroom browsing and more chrome also
runs very very smoothly on this device
and even the memory hog you to does very
well on this device I am thoroughly
impressed by this device Intel graphics
I've never been great for gaming so
don't buy this if you plan on gaming or
playing for night
or pub GU will lag this is your final
warning
this year the battery has been bumped up
to 13.5 hours which is just amazing
especially for those of you who travel
out there
I love having windows on the go a lot of
people hate on Windows 10 but I actually
preferred over Mac OS at the moment the
camera is also very good as it eight
megapixel camera on the back five
megapixel on the front and both perform
very well it's also got a 1080p video
camera on the front facing camera for
video calls and I'm very impressed by
how clear the image is for me I've been
using this device to storyboard my
videos using the pin which also works
very well so when I got done testing
this device I came to this question in
my head is it worth paying an extra four
hundred dollars over the surface code to
get this surface pro and the answer that
I came up was yes and no yes if you are
a photo editor and gonna do some light
graphical work or maybe some light video
editing know if you're gonna be using
this just to go on browse and travel
because I think the surface goal will be
more than enough for those tasks if you
just want to browse watch YouTube watch
videos on the go then the servers go I
think is the better option save yourself
400 bucks alright guys so that is my
review on the surface pro 6 let me know
