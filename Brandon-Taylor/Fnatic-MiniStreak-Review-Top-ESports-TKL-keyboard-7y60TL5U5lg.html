review of the fnatic mini streak 10
keyless keyboard now a lot of you guys
out there have been requesting that I
cover this keyboard and you know what it
kind of sparked my interest as well
because a lot of streamers and some
eSports professionals are actually using
the fnatic mini streak so I want to
check it out and give you guys my
thoughts so this keyboard is coming in
at a hundred and ten dollars and that's
actually pretty good for this market for
a ten keyless keyboard usually they're
around a hundred and fifty dollars now
in the box you'll find the keyboard a
USBC core which I actually really liked
that they did that because it's modern
it's hip it's a new thing it's gonna be
future proof it's pretty cool that they
did that because most big companies like
Razer and Logitech have stuck with the
micro USB it's also got an indentation
for the cord so when you plug it in you
kind of funnel it through the back and
this actually keeps it in place when
you're moving it around in your desk so
that's kind of a nice design there so
also in the Box they give you a wrist
rest as well that is made out of PU
leather it's actually pretty cool it has
three levels of adjustment to kind of
adjust to where your hand might be it's
got a full metal build on the bottom
which is nice with magnets that really
keep it stable which is I found to be
great during gaming the color of this
keyboard is kind of a gray gunmetal
color that I actually really like it's
lightweight but it also feels very solid
so another thing that I really liked
design wise that was really smart on
their part was that they made the front
2 feet long and they made them
horizontal and then they made the ones
on the back vertical this gives your
keyboard some friction on the desk so
that it won't move while gaming it's got
two kickstand feet on the back if you
want more of an angle it's also got
these black keys that are abs and to be
honest with you guys they kind of feel
like some of the budget key caps that
I've had on some budget keyboards that
I've gotten recently that are like 40
bucks so I feel like they really skimp
out on the quality I feel like these are
gonna shine after a long time
if you eat chips or anything at your
desk just don't if you could have this
keyboard but it is cool that you can
actually put a custom key cap set on
this so that kind of fixes the problem I
love how thin it is at only 28mm
it's thin at the biggest point which is
awesome top right of the keyboard they
have a mic switch and a volume button
which is nice if you need to cut
communication it's also got a
competition mode where it turns off all
the necessary features of the keyboard
and focuses on what you need just for
your competition so like WASD your mail
a keys for instance huh you're sliding
all that good stuff and it turns off at
the multimedia keys and the RGB the RGB
on the keyboard is not the brightest
board out there but it will get the job
done it's got all the usual suspects
like rainbow wave reactive singer color
and can be controlled on board or
through the software the software for me
is pretty basic it's a basic keyboard
for eSports so if you were to take this
tool and you're gonna be good to go it's
available in the most popular cherry
MX's like the red red silent blue and
brown I went with the Reds and the
typing experience was pretty good it's
what you've come to expect from a cherry
and mixed red switch fast and great for
gaming let's drop a sound test for you
guys right now that never gets old does
it especially some good cherry MX red
some of my favorites
so in conclusion guys this is actually a
decent keyboard it was actually
surprisingly good for $110 which is
pretty competitive in today's market
especially if you need like a
plug-and-play keyboard so let's say you
qualify for the World Cup and you're
ready to go and you need a keyboard I
don't even know that you'd let you use
your own keyboard I don't know for
tonight epic they're doing some weird
stuff right now but let's say they do
let you bring your own keyboard this one
would be a great one to bring one thing
to note though before I end this is that
I actually had a friend who had this
keyboard and it broke so it might not
have the best build quality over time my
time with it it's been great and solid
but who knows anything could happen just
make sure you really put it through its
tests and like you know really use the
keyboard to make sure that it's actually
gonna last you and the ABS keycaps feel
a little cheap to me but then again I've
been spoiled by GM cakey caps and PBT
the good news is you can actually switch
off the key caps if you want romaji of
course Eric 895 K 70 alright guys so
that is going to do it for this review I
hope you guys have enjoyed this review
