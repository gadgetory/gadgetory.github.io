what is up guys Beauty back here again
with another review today we're going to
be taking a look at my current favorite
headphones my everyday headphones the
headphones that I use every single day
they always leave the house with me
they've become a part of my life and
those are the Apple earpods
now I know there's a lot of controversy
behind me if they're $160 but they're so
simplistic we've had the Apple earbuds
for the longest time with the cord and
they've been cheap and we always think
of them as like throwaway pairs but
Apple has cut the wire and now they've
added a Bluetooth version of their
headphones so how do they fare how did
they turn out well in my opinion these
are some of the best headphones you can
get just for everyday walking around
life so today I'm going to talk about
some of the features that I enjoy and
that I use and how I use them and what I
don't use and what I think is practical
and what I think they couldn't improve
on in the future
now with the comfort and design these
are very comfortable now I feel like in
the past the Apple earbuds they were
just falling out because you would bump
against a door handle or are you being
bumping up and down while you're running
things like that and they would fall out
but with these they actually stay in my
ear very nicely I sometimes even forget
to bury them there I have to check like
oh my god do they fall out but they're
always there they're just so light so
portable is an incredible design like
somehow this blocky sleek looking
headphone can fit into your ear with a
long handle and not fall out whereas
some with foam tips can start to pop out
of your ear now of course these come
with a case and I really like it I think
cases for these kind of headphones
necessary because you're going to lose
them they're free-floating headphones
you're going to lose them so for me what
I do is I listen to them I walk around
maybe take calls whatever I need to do
listen to music and then I will
immediately put them back into the case
and they charge very fast so I'll put
them back into my pocket and then I'm
done and while their stores they'll be
charged that's the win-win you get to
keep track of your headphones and also
too you get to charge them now they're a
little bit longer at the ends because
they have a receiver and now they have a
mic but that's ok I didn't feel like it
was too ridiculous I thought that when I
got them that I would be like oh my god
it's all so embarrassed wearing these
but people don't really give me a second
look so a very nice simplistic design on
headphones and like with all Apple
products they just work now the sound is
what surprised me the most about these
headphones they actually sound better
than the B techs
you can listen to them side by side and
I would pick the airpot any day the only
reason why I use the B techs in the gym
is because of the added isolation which
I need if I'm just walking around town
I'll use the Apple earpods the bass is
there the midst of there the highs are
there it's just so very well balanced
clear sounding headphone there's a lot
of clarity with these headphones
surprisingly in the small package in
this seemingly basic simplistic package
there is incredible sound so the battery
life is good it's three hours and for
these kind of headphones that has been
kind of a standard recently and I
noticed once I'm done with the
headphones like I said I just put them
back into the case put them into my
pocket in the site that they discharged
they're very small the case is actually
the smallest that I've ever seen so when
you put them into your pocket it's very
noticeable so now in the morning I just
grab my phone I grab my keys I grab my
wallet and now my ear pods every single
day those four things are a must-have
for me in the morning
so one thing that's a very cool with
these is that you can flip open the case
hood and hold an extra phone and it'll
show you the case battery and it also
show you the actual airpot battery so a
lot of headphones now with the cases
they don't actually show you how much
battery the case has they may have an
indicator light
green orange and red for how much
battery is left but with these you can
actually see the battery life and I
think some of the cost is coming from
that that there's a receiver also in the
case that will display battery so let's
talk about the call quality I didn't
have any issues with call quality nobody
said that I was breaking up or they
couldn't hear me and that's surprising
considering there they should kind of
near the back of your ear you're not
projecting into them so as close I could
pick up so much clarity from your voice
with the air pops being back here so all
in all they're my favorite headphones
for everyday life I'd be doing ran with
you sometimes outside did you need to
hear your outside surroundings their
great eyewear in the network I wear them
anywhere wear them when I have a day off
when I go out and do grocery shopping I
can just answer calls very clearly one
thing that I do think they need to add
it is controlled on the actual air pods
now they have Syria where you can voice
commanded and all that but you know in
certain situations you want to be like
hey Siri up the volume or down the
volume
I found myself reaching to my phone and
just doing the volume so cool little
touch feature maybe like swipe up or
down to get the volume up or down on one
side of the air box would be very cool
and applicant do they have all these
forest times they have all these touch
features of all these different things
now fingerprint readers so I see it in
the next upcoming versions of the test
on alright guys so like share comment
and subscribe on my video if you haven't
already and
you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
