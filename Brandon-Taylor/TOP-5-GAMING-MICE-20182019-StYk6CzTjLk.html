top 5 gaming mice of 2018 now I haven't
tried every single Mouse on the market
I'm not gonna lie to you guys
but I've tried a lot of them I tried
Razer try Corsair I've tried final Mouse
I tried Logitech I've tried Nick seus I
don't know even know the name of some of
them sowee I don't know but I've tried a
lot of them okay just trust me on that
but anyways guys let's get right into it
I'm not gonna waste any of your time
let's drop that number 5 spot or right
about now so coming in at number 5 we
have one of the most underrated mice of
2018 and that is the razor basilisk this
is on nobody's top 5 but I think it
really deserves to be looking past the
Razer synapse software I know it's very
hard it's very trying it's very testing
to use Razer synapse but if you can look
past it this is a great Mouse from top
to bottom it's got great clicks the
ergonomics are just like the g5 will -
but I think it's a little bit easier to
grip because of that slope on the side
the grips the rubber that they use is a
little bit better than the logitech g502
so why is this not getting the credit
that it deserves because it's just that
good it has a 3389 sensor in it was not
to love about this Mouse except for
maybe it's not Wireless so here are the
hand sizes and grip styles that go best
with the Razer basileus
coming in at number four we have the G
305 from Logitech now this is the
wireless version of the Logitech G pro
wired but it's not the G Pro Wireless
it's the Wireless G Pro but not anyways
anyways anyways it has one of the best
sensors on the market with a hero 12 K
sensor in it this thing is super light
and a super nimble it's coming in at 97
grams and if you put an actual lithium
battery in there instead of a regular
battery it becomes even lighter and it
gets almost down to about 82 grams I
believe and let's not talk about that
battery life I have not charged or
changed the battery in this mouse since
I got it so this thing has marathon type
energy it just keeps on going baby
it's an ambidextrous Mouse and here are
the grip styles and hand sizes that go
best with this mouse
coming in at number three one of my
all-time favorite mice it is the G 703
this is the wireless version of the G
403 I don't know what's up with this
three at the end can anybody let me know
why they're using the three at the end
on the Logitech products maybe because
they did 502 I don't know I'm getting
off-topic but anyways guys this mouse is
coming in at 80 dollars book can be
found for cheaper okay
the Wireless is insanely good it's got
that one millisecond Logitech software
hardware mumbo jumbo in there it weighs
106 grams it can be used with the power
play mat although I wasn't a big fan of
it if you want to use that for
continuous charging you can the battery
life is rated at 24 hours and also 32
hours without RGB on it's a great ergo
mouse with some of the best clicks on
the market on the mouse one and two and
also on the side buttons as well I'm not
gonna lie to you guys the hump on the
back takes a little bit of time to get
used to but if you can claw grip and
like palm grip this mouse it is insanely
good here are the grip styles and hand
sizes that go best with the G 703 from
Logitech
coming in at number 2 we have the
SteelSeries rival 650 slash 600 now this
is one of my all-time favorite mice as
well we're getting close to that number
one spot so we're getting close to some
of my favorite mice ever made this mouse
is super comfortable I don't care that
it weighs 121 grams or you can add up to
153 grams but if you like heavy mice
this thing flies because of the grip you
know this really proves the point that
it's not all about the stat sheet
because on paper it says 129 grams but
when this thing molds and forms to your
hand
and it is a breeze to use this thing
just flies around your desk and you will
be hitting shots like no other you can
get this mouse for about a hundred to a
hundred and twenty dollars the true move
three sensor feels like nothing else on
the list it's very hard to explain in
words you just have to use it yourself
and the rival 650 goes great with these
hand sizes and grip style
alright guys so here we are at the end
of the list we are at the number one
spot who you guys think took it this
year well guys if you thought it was the
final Mouse ninja err 58 Jake's on you
because it is not the ninja err 58 it's
both the ninja err 58 and the G Pro
Wireless and for different reasons yes
these have tied for number one for me
this year and for different reasons
the G Pro Wireless is one of the best
mice to come out it is a game changer
just like the final mouse promised to be
now the reason why it's a game changer
is because it's 80 grams it has these
great clicks they're a little bit
different they're not as clicky they're
not my favorite but once you get used to
them you kind of see the genius behind
why they all have that like short
actuation point it's got that hero 16k
sensor in there and it just lasts
forever because of it this thing lasts
up to 60 hours I can like use this for
like 2 weeks and not have to charge here
are the grip styles that go best with
the G Pro wireless
all right so you guys already know the
deal about the ninja era 58 from final
mouse this thing is a straight beast but
not beast in the way that it's really
big it's a beast because it's a game
changer 58 grams it is the lightest
Mouse on this list it is great for those
low sensitivity users out there that
just use that whole mouse pad user hold
desk I know people were clowning me
because I had to that big mouse pad and
like a little keyboard and like this
Mouse just moving all around and for
good reason because those Mouse can move
that quickly with the low sensitivity
it's got the top sensor in the 3360 and
it's coming in at $90 which can be a
little bit much for some people but like
I said in my review of the ninja err 58
everything for a reason
everything costs a certain price this is
the only Mouse on the market that is
doing what it's doing it also has this
amazing paracord what what who is doing
that right now I don't know any other
company that is putting a paracord on
there mouse so final Mouse yeah people
give them crap for the marketing
whatever but this is a damn good Mouse
