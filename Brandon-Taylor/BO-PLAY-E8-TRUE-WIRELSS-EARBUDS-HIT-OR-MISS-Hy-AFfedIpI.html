another review it's been a while I know
I've been moving I've been trying to
organize all my things and trying to
find time to film on top of all of that
I've had get-togethers with friends and
family almost every day but starting now
we will be back on track we are gonna be
on our normal release schedule all right
so with that out of the way the first
review of the year is the B &amp;amp; O play EA
true wireless earbuds which has been
hugely requested by you guys so I
finally decided to check them out and
see what the hype was about from the
outside looking in though I've always
seen B&amp;amp;O as one of those expensive niche
brands that charge you a ton of cash but
give you little value so I never picked
any of their headphones up but they each
looked promising so I picked them up so
let's find out today if they are worth
that hefty price tag of three hundred
dollars almost two times the cost of ear
pods might I add
in the box you'll find the headphones
the charger and three silicon tips
noticeably missing our wings and this is
where I ran into some fit issues 1/2 of
medium sized ears and usually my ears
can fit almost any wireless earbuds
comfortably but not these they stay in
but I have this feeling of they're gonna
fall out while I'm wearing them or
walking or exercising now I know the
wings would mess up the beautiful
aesthetics of these earbuds but they are
necessary in this case also the silicone
tips they include are almost abnormally
small if they are going to exclude wings
than they need bigger silicone tips to
keep them from falling out of your ear
these also feature touch controls on
each side from playing and pausing music
on the ride and skipping forward in
songs on the right earbud on the Left
earbud if you press two times you just
get back a track touching and holding
will increase the volume and decrease
the volume on either side I find that
the controls are just ok not as good as
something like the icon X 2018 controls
but they do a pretty good job of doing
what you need you may find that you have
to touch or tap 2 times or try multiple
times to get the earbuds to act the way
that you want them to act
when I first put on the e eights they
were terrible
muddy super laid back and to be honest I
thought I bought a $5 pair of earbuds so
I took them off and I put my phone at
high volume and I lit the earbuds burn
in for hours about three hours to be
exact I picked them back up and that EAS
were totally transformed it's night and
day
so I can see how some people on Amazon
they may put them on and start
complaining they probably put them on
and experience what I experienced with
the EAS and that is a very muddy
experience now what I had heard of bno
is that they tend to be on the bright
side focusing more on highs than
anything else and if you love clarity
you will love these great for classical
and rock they also can give you a new
perspective on your hip hop and EDM
music as well these don't sound like
anything that I've tried before but
that's not all they've added in an
equaliser as well and what I like about
their equalizer is that they've
simplified it for the common user you
can drag the ball over to warm excited
relaxed etc then expand the circle to
increase that certain sound signature
isn't that pretty cool no need to tinker
with all the wave frequencies like some
other apps that may intimidate some
beginners so these can go great with any
type of music you want to listen to I
personally love the warm setting
dragging that ball over to the warm and
expanding it that gives you a lot of
bass and brings up the mids these I
would say after burning the men are
probably the best sounding true wireless
earbuds on the market that I've heard to
date
so they advertised four to six hours of
battery-life
and i roughly got about four hours never
getting anywhere close to five or six
hours so it's good not great in this
case the case also provides two
additional charges summing up to 12
hours of battery life total so I would
have liked to seen a full 24 hours for
those of you who like to travel the
charging case and the ear buds take
about two hours to fully charge which is
also very nice another area where these
ear buds really impressed me is the call
quality which is simply incredible I
think these can compete with the air
pods I definitely recommend these for
those of you who spend hours on the
phone when they're talking or it's your
job or for important calls they sound
great
now a lot of true wireless earbuds have
been suffering from delay through the
Bluetooth these have that problem but
it's so slight it's oh you almost have
to be looking forward to really tell
videos are very washable with these
earbuds so I was very impressed with the
e8 I did get random pickups that would
happen during my music it was for no
apparent reason I could be just sitting
in my room I think it's that the e AIT's
kind of reset their connection every
couple of like 30 to an hour
it's really weird they're like clicks
for a second and it goes back to normal
it doesn't really interrupt anything it
just makes a small little clip but that
problem is not the end of the world the
distance you can walk away from your
phone was a little disappointing I will
get about 20 feet away when I would
leave my phone at my desk I'll walk over
to my copier at work and they would
disconnect and usually with most earbuds
nowadays I can walk I can make that walk
and it'd be okay but with these don't
plan on leaving them in your bag while
you go and work out or anything like
that in conclusion these are some of the
best sounding true wireless earbuds to
date but they come at a hefty price tag
of $300 if they added wings for the
earbuds I think these would rival some
of the biggest players in the game out
there well not perfect if you have to
have the best of the best sound you
don't work out or anything crazy or do
marathons with your earbuds and these
could be the ones for you but keep in
mind it's really hit or miss with a fit
and if you miss these miss very hard
alright guys so that's gonna do it for
