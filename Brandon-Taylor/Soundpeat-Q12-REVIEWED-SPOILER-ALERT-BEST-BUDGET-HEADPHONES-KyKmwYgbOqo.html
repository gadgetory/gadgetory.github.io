with another review today we have the
sound P Q 12 now on Amazon soap it has
been creating kind of a buzz they have
about 5,000 reviews on there q y7 s and
four and a half stars which is really
really good that that many people like
their headphones and it has that good of
a rating so I was skeptical I was always
liked when headphones you know I'm just
going to go for the j-bird so I'm just
going to go for the Bose I'm gonna go
for the big name and I never looked at
looked or took sound P seriously until
recently I saw them and I was kind of
like you know what why not why not just
it's $27 let me see what all the hype is
about so I I grabbed their new Q 12 with
4.1 Bluetooth to take a look to see how
they are now you know me I love to start
with the comfort that's where you know a
lot of issues come in for me as somebody
who works out and does a lot of outdoor
sports like cycling and things like that
that these do not fall out of your here
whatsoever now I no matter how much you
shake no matter how much you move around
the gym I never had to reposition these
I set these in one time and after that I
never touched them that's how good they
are and they're light and I'm not sure
if that's just because of the material
that they give the cheap materials that
they use because it does feel look not
as good of a quality as a jaybird or a
Bose you can tell they didn't use as
good of a materials on these but with
that being said it kind of mix some
light and it kind of makes them you not
move out of your ear it's kind of a gift
and a curse
so they also come with these little
wings and for me they work straight out
of the box I use the medium tips with
the medium fins they come with small
medium and large tips it also comes with
a great great
case and also they come with the ex fit
clip holder light the Jaybirds which you
can tie and make sure it's like up up do
the up around your ear over ear style
but I did not find that to be as good as
j-bird because of the material that they
use the material is not as rigid as the
j-bird and it kind of the material is
kind of like with it holds kind of like
moisture so it'll be on your the back of
your neck whereas j-bird kind of like
it's like sweat wick wicking if that
makes sense like it just it doesn't
absorb any sweat it doesn't take on the
wetness so with these they kind of stick
on the back your neck if you do that so
definitely if your wear them just on on
the back of your neck like this I had no
problems with that has no problems with
telling you or anything like that when I
did that now next up let's move on to
the sound these are up there and these
can contend with the best of the best
I'm telling you right now I was
skeptical when I put them on I was like
oh these are going to sound like worse
than apple headphones they're gonna
sound tinny no they sound great the bass
is great the only place where I see a
little bit of a discrepancy is in the
middle mid range with vocals at first
when I first put them on they were
little they weren't as clear but as time
went on and I burned them in I listened
to the more the vocal stuff started to
gain that clarity that the bass had and
the highs are actually pretty clear as
well so overall it's a it's a great fun
listening experience I would put it like
as follows Bose sounds for wireless and
then I'm going to put the freedoms and
then I'm going to put the Q 12s and I'm
going to put the jaybird x2 that's how
good these are they're up there and
they're not even that much worse off
than the jaybird freedom's so you're
getting a great package for $27 the
sound is is the
err trust me for $27.00 it you can't
beat this so next up we were going to be
taking a look at the remote now the
remote it's like I said the quality on
these isn't as good as the bows or the
j-bird
the the remote doesn't feel as good if
it actually feels on part like a bigger
j-bird x2 remote if I could put it like
that a bigger one it has that kind of
light feeling which again at least to
comfort the only one caveat that I have
with the remote is that the buttons
aren't clicking this in the - volume is
not as clicky as the positive and that's
I think that's more of a quality control
issue and it's a minor issue but I kind
of have OCD so when it comes to those
kind of things so that's kind of a con
for me I don't know about you guys but I
could see maybe the remote giving out or
a button or two giving out because of
that reason time will tell they also
have this cool little magnetic strip on
the back so that you can put them around
your neck and keep them there while
you're not using them but I will say
when you are doing strenuous work or
whatever don't expect to look down and
see them there because they will come
off if you're jumping up and down or
running around they may fall off but
it's a good like if you're just walking
out to your car at the end of a workout
or things like that so this is a great
package if you want to save money on
getting the Jaybirds
or the Bose I had no problems I don't
sweat a lot so I'm not sure how the
durability is I know Bose had a little
bit of issue with that but if you just
like a good set of headphones and you
want them for the gym you don't want to
spend $150 these are great option for a
fifth of the price the sounds great the
comfort is great
the materials are so-so but that's to be
expected they're not going to use $150
worth of material on these but it I
cannot recommend these enough I was
blown away by these I was not expecting
anything
these definitely lived up to the hype
and I'm very happy with them for $27
they're great for people that if you
lose your headphones a lot or if you
have a headphones that break down a lot
and you just like to buy keep buying
them over and over again these are great
headphones it's also good if you know
what you just don't want to spend $150
and you just want to get pair of
headphones they're great too and you can
see whether the sound profile matches to
your liking but all in all I love these
I love you guys thank you for watching
