again with another review today we have
some new ear buds from one of my
favorite companies
jaybird the new j-bert x-force now fun
fact of the day is that Jay Bird was my
very first pair of bluetooth headphones
so I've always had a soft spot for them
in my heart they were the first company
that I felt truly got with a Bluetooth
sports earbud should be like although
they have been far from perfect I mean
no headphone really ever is I still
enjoyed using their products because
they had a good mix of good to great
sound they had good fit options and more
recently their EQ app allowing you to
change the firmware of the headphone no
matter what device you use giving that
added emotion to get you through those
tough workouts so here we are now in
2018 four years after the original
jaybird blue but X's came out have they
finally got everything right in this
$130 pair of earbuds find out today
before we begin guys don't forget to
follow me on my social medias I've been
posting some behind the scenes videos of
my filming process and subscribe to the
channel if you haven't already it
greatly helps the channel now the
earbuds have kept their same shape from
last year this year the colors have
changed to black metallic flash which
has a nozzle as yellow the storm
metallic glacier where the nozzle is
blue and the alpha metallic Jade where
the ear tips are green the silicone tips
and earphones have changed and are
vastly more comfortable and block out
way more noise than previous models they
also have included compact if sin as
usual to get a nice seal but I feel that
the silicone tips they have added in
this year keep the earbuds in place so
nicely and block out so much noise that
the comp like tips aren't a necessity
like they were in older versions where
the jaybird x12 3 would fall out during
strenuous workouts the only time they
have came out is when I lifted off a
bench and they got caught and when that
happened only one of the earbuds came
out one thing missing though that I used
to love about the old Jaybirds is the ex
fit they took it out I must admit it
was a little bit difficult to set up I
get that you know but it did a nice job
keeping the cord off your neck I
actually lost the Tyner on the court on
the X fours and now I'm out of luck all
in all I would have liked to have seen a
better system in place or maybe even a
better Tyner that you can't lose and is
permanently on the court so I'll address
the elephant in the room now that
proprietary charging cradle is back
jaybird
we the consumer don't want this plain
and simple and when you lose it you have
to buy the entire accessory pack all
over again or you can't use the earbuds
anymore and for me that's just not right
I lost the cradle with my first jaybird
X threes and had to pay $15 for another
replacement Wow I found myself
constantly worrying about the cradle
just to make sure I didn't leave it at
work or even lose it while I was walking
around attaching the cord to the cradle
wasn't the solution either jaybird
because what if the court shorts out
from wear-and-tear in my opinion they
need to scrap this design it might lead
to faster charging but that's why we
have newer tech like USB see with quick
charging but it could be that it might
not be cost efficient or space efficient
enough to put this into the jaybird X
fours overall although not perfect I
think the new silicon tips make up for
some of the other design flaws but I
still can't justify the cradle it's just
not a good solution and we'll talk more
about the charging later they've also
made the Airbus slightly more powerful
this year sound wise I have to turn down
the max volume sometimes whereas before
I'd be craving for more volume the new
speaker sensitivity is up to 99 plus or
minus 3 dB
and 1 kilohertz and that's up from 96
plus or minus 3 dB at 1 kilohertz of the
jaybird X 3s the speaker sensitivity
tells you how effectively a speaker
converts power into volume so we're
getting a slight bump here the sound
quality of the earbuds and presses me
year after year I just don't get how
they give such good sound stage in these
earbuds it's always been like that with
Jaber they are so layered and so
detailed the app lets you control the EQ
onboard which is great for switching
devices
it also can give you the exact sound
qualities that you like here's what my
EQ looks like on the app in case you
want to try it out for yourself the
clean bass and detail mids and highs
combined to give you that extra push
during your workouts and these just
aren't good for workouts guys these have
become one of my favorite headphones and
most use headphones because the sound
quality is just that good I tested them
against my shirt SCA for sixes and they
held up really nicely
not as much sub bass and definitely not
as clear but they are more open and
spacious than my SC 84 's the sound
quality is a lot closer than you would
think guys the connection is a little
lackluster and that's because they are
still using AAC and SBC so you'll be
getting lag on video still sadly I hope
in the jaybird x5 s they add in apt X or
apt X HD and these earbuds will be near
flawless for me from media consumption I
am a little bit disappointed in the max
distance as I started getting breakups
while using these at distances that I
thought would be pretty reasonable for a
sports earbud the battery life is eight
hours of playback for two hours of
charging and for quick charging it has
changed from 20 minutes for an hour to
10 minutes of charging for an hour which
is a great improvement for those of us
who forget to charge their earbuds
before the workouts call quality has
never really been a strong suit for the
jaybird X line and it continues to
struggle sounding very hollow like
you're in a hall or talking to somebody
in the bathroom when you're talking to
friends and family or business calls I
would definitely keep cost to a minimum
when using the jaybird X fours these are
sports earbuds and with that comes some
drawbacks with connection and call
quality but the sound quality and fit
are amazing jaybird designed these for a
specific reason and that is for the
active person and the things that don't
fall in line with that fall out of line
very quickly that being said I do love
the jaybird X force for music and for
working out outside of that if you are
looking for a do-it-all headphone that
you can do calls and media you might
want to look elsewhere alright guys so
that is my
if you have any more questions be sure
to let me know down below thank you guys
recently for all the love that you guys
have been giving on my videos I really
appreciate it I'm gonna try to do
another giveaway very very soon it's
been your boy BT saying peace I'll see
