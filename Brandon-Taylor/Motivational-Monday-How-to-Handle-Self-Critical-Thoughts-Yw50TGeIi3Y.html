another motivational Monday and as you
may or may not have seen there wasn't
one this past Monday because we had a
lot of trouble at the hotel there was no
Wi-Fi and I was hot spotting with my
phone and the uploading speed was not
good enough but anyways we got another
full work week ahead of us and you know
what I need these videos as much as you
guys I need a Kickstarter as well I need
to tell myself these things as well so
without further ado here we go let's
jump into it today's topic is how to
deal with critical thoughts now we all
have these thoughts that come in and say
your works not the best not the best
looking person all this and that etc etc
compare ourselves with others throughout
the day and what happens we try to argue
with this voice say no I'm the
best-looking I my work is amazing and
what happens there's a lot of anxiety
there's a lot of anger behind it and all
these other emotions now think about
this I want to give this example let's
say you're arguing with the person what
happens when they come at you when
they're going at you and you're arguing
back with them what happens there's a
lot of anxiety there's a lot of anger
there's a lot of sadness and nobody wins
and I'm proposing today that this is the
same thing when it comes to the voice in
your head same thing what happens when
these voices come in all you have to do
is is listen it's that simple if you
want to fix a lot of these problems just
listen listen to this voice it's not
going to kill you it's not going to hurt
you you're not going to die it could be
much worse so what you want to do is you
want to listen to these thoughts all
your work is not the best don't try just
listen all you have to do is sit back
and listen be still stop stop what
you're doing stop any tasks that you
doing and just stop and listen I
guarantee those voices will stop after a
while and then once those are done then
you can deliberately think about what
kind of thoughts that you want to have
so you listen and then later on you plan
out you say this is how I want to cure
myself this is my best self this is what
I want to improve on these are the
things that are actually happening in my
life not some old messed up thoughts
from the past this is now this is what
needs to happen right now and this is
much more productive than going through
the day arguing with yourself and
getting angry getting having anxiety and
then you carry that interior
relationships into your work and nobody
wins just like any other argument so
this week take this go out there kill it
listen to that voice in your head and
let it go and then later on plan your
attack plan to kill it so let's get
after it if you learn something from
this video give it a thumbs up it really
helps a channel comment subscribe all
those great things and I will see you
guys next Monday peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
