want to know can you chair do this
what's up guys bTW here and this is a
review of the max anomic Peugeot scepter
Pro now I don't know about you guys but
in the past I've heard so much bad
things about gaming chairs like they
hurt your back the way to over prized
for what they are and to be honest
that's what's really kept me away but
more and more of you guys kept asking me
to do gaming chairs so that led me to
reaching out to max na Mike who
graciously sent me out a chair to test
now the first thing they did was they
sent me over to their size guide which I
actually really loved because you just
put in your height and your weight and
then it gives you some recommended
chairs that would fit your body style
and that's gonna be clutch because you
can't try this chair before you get it
right so this gives you the best chance
at getting the best fit for you once I
did get the chair it only took me around
15 minutes in total to really just put
together the chair step-by-step using
the guy that they gave me they also
include all the tools you need to put
together the chair as well now this
chair in particular is using leather
with some nice suede along the sides the
stitching has held up nicely speaking of
which I believe they're the only company
that actually does in-house embroidering
so I got my name right here as you can
see it's got five rolling feet on the
bottom that glide great on carpet or any
surface that you put it on the 40 arms
are super customizable it's got three
levers the first lever allows you to
move the arms up and down as usual it
can also be moved forward and back and
also in and out this was one of the main
gripes of my embody chairs that the arms
are too wide so this was an actual
upgrade for me also in the armrests they
have indentations where you can put your
fingers in the groove it's the little
things man on the left side of the chair
they have a lever to allow for locking
or rocking deliver on the right side you
can raise or lower the chair and
everything is smooth and nothing creaks
on this chair and it just feels like
it's very well built as it should be as
this thing is coming in at 430 dollars
the padding on the seat feels great it's
not going to let you sink in but it
gives you enough support and cushion to
be comfortable but hold its shape
fully for years to come it also comes
with a back pillow which feels grade as
well as a headrest that wraps around the
top of your chair and it just feels
great when you want to recline and chill
out you can recline by pulling the
second lever on the right and you can
lay all the way back which is something
that I love and I haven't been able to
do that for years because I've just been
using task chairs I've fallen asleep in
this chair so many times since I've
gotten it just chilling and watching
movies watching Game of Thrones and it's
just been amazing
and another reason why I did want to
check out these chairs is because so
many top streamers are using it like
ninja tea food shroud all of them were
using max anomic chairs at some point
and they were gaming and streaming for
hours so it can't be uncomfortable if
all of these people are streaming for
hours and hours and hours at some point
their back would just say I need a new
chair but they're not doing it and I
think that this chair is actually really
really comfortable no I wanted to use
this chair for a few weeks before
recommending it to you guys because I
didn't want to recommend something I
wouldn't use myself I can't be messing
up your guys's back you know and this
chair has exceeded my expectations
because of all the negativity around
gaming chairs don't believe the hype
guys this chair is actually legit the
only negative I can see about this chair
is that maybe it's too comfortable where
you won't get your work done which has
happened to me more times than I'd like
to admit I also want to see how this
back pillow will hold up over time we'll
get flattened well I need a new one will
I have to replace it I want to see how
it will last over a longer period of
time but for now it's been great alright
guys so I know these are coming in at
four to five hundred dollars and they
can be pretty expensive so max anomic
has given me a discount code just use
the code bTW and you can save on some
free shipping of the chair alright guys
that's gonna do it for this review of
the max anomic ergo scepter Pro it has
been your boy BT don't forget to Like
share comment and subscribe and I will
see you guys in the next video hey ace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
