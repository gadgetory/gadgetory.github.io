here again with another video it's been
a while I know guys forgive me I've been
traveling the world I travelled a ton
lately in Europe over the past couple of
weeks as some of you may have seen in my
Instagram stories if you haven't if you
didn't see it you can always follow me
here at bt esthetics
on instagram anyways since I've been
travelling so much I've needed a solid
pair of headphones to get me through
those 16-hour flights and that's where
the bose QC 3 fives series to come in
the clutch now you may be saying bt now
leased came out like a year ago you're
late and yes I've had them for a year
but I never really saw a point to
reviewing them once I got them they're
exactly like the series one I mean there
was literally no difference between the
battery life both have the great same
comfort and button layout the only real
difference being the Google assistant
button so that you can control your
music without having to look at your
phone this is all fine and dandy but
what if you are an iPhone user I mean I
used both by the way so don't roast me
in the comments please I couldn't really
see a point to telling people to upgrade
now they are coming out with an Alexa
update for iPhone users but still would
be nice to have some of that Siri in
there somehow but I'm sure evil Apple
has something to do with blocking them
from doing so with all that being said
this is my year with the bose qc25
version 2 before we begin with these
amazing headphones don't forget to smash
that subscribe button for more content
like this there will be a giveaway at
10,000 subs guys one pair being some
Sony headphones so make sure you really
don't miss out make sure you're
subscribed so how did all this happen
these were once my most criticized
headphones to becoming some of my
favorite headphones well to cut to the
chase it really came down to me
traveling more if I'm honest with you
guys these things just rock for travel
the comfort is amazing for those long
flights where your head it's just flying
all over the place and you're trying to
get some sleep and you want to try to
get as much sleep as possible
especially when you find like 16 hours
and not only that the noise cancellation
blocks out so much of that engine even
without playing music it dampens
everything around you I mean most noise
cancellation headphones are pretty weak
in that regard you put them on and you
know you can still hear noise outside of
you and even Sony doesn't do it that
well but after he wearing these all
around the world I seriously don't know
how people travel without some kind of
noise cancellation headphones if you're
some kind of traveler you have to own a
pair of these for sure in the past Bose
has gotten a lot of hate the age-old
saying goes if there's no highs and
there's no lows then it must be Bose
right well to some extent that is true
but that doesn't mean that they are bad
sounding at all on the contrary they
actually sound quite full and rich
without going too far into each side of
the spectrum higher low and vocals are
actually really nice and present as well
after trying so many expensive
headphones I've come to the conclusion
that the QC 35s are where they need to
be in terms of price to performance
sound wise I mean I've tried
thousand-dollar headphones thousand
dollar earbuds and for 350 these are not
bad at all they are right in the middle
of the pack I think where they should be
when compared to some of the more
expensive brands like Audis you know
another great feature to these is that
you can actually connect them to
multiple devices and this helps when
switching to like an iPhone to a macbook
or having an Android and iPhone hooked
up to it it just works flawlessly and if
you're not using the button for the
assistant you can use it to change the
strength of the noise cancellation which
is also awesome
a little bit more control of course the
build quality is always exceptional you
can throw these things around and rest
easy knowing that these will not break
on you and you can really just take
these anywhere give them a beating as
you go around the world and they'll be
just fine
I mean 350 may seem like a hefty price
tag but you're getting headphones that
will last you a lifetime in my opinion
the comfort is top-notch the top-notch
build quality and most importantly you
get that rich full Bose sound all
combining to give you an excellent
travel companion for your every day
like so if you were on the fence
definitely try them out because they
have definitely grown on me these past
couple of months you know and I can
admit that I was wrong in the past I
criticized these a lot but that was
before I start traveling and that was
before I really saw the genius in these
headphones they're amazing so thank you
guys for watching as always guys thank
you for your continued support and I
will see you guys to the next video
don't forget to hit that subscribe
button on the way out if you haven't
already we're almost there guys we're
almost there all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
