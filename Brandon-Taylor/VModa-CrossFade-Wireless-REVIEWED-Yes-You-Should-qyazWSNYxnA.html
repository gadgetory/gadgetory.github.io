with another review today I have the
much requested much much requested
v-moda crossfade Wireless and I've been
seeing these in the comments and every
single one of my videos and you know I'm
a man of the people so I had to give you
guys what you wanted and you know what
thank you guys because I wouldn't have
tried these without you guys and I am
very very excited to do a review on
these so without any further ado let's
get into the review now you know I love
to start with the comfort and I looked
up reviews on these headphones before I
bought them just to see what you guys
were talking about I was like are these
really that great so I checked them out
and a lot of people were saying that ear
cups aren't deep enough they clap on
your head they're a little uncomfortable
but I didn't notice any of that I was
able to set these and forget them and
what I like about them is that they keep
a little profile so if you want to use
these for the gym you can do that as
well I'm gonna show you guys look you
can put them on right here and you can
just go about your business I didn't
have to readjust them once it was a
great experience and look I forgot I had
them on right now
would you look at that but anyways
moving on to more into the comfort they
have these leather cups I really like
them
the leather feels really nice it feels
premium it is yet to be seen whether
they will hold up over time but I'm
gonna test these out and I'm gonna see
how I said long I'm gonna put them to
the test guys and also to I really liked
the band on these as well very very
stretchy right they're not gonna break
on you
so v-moda helped you make a good
purchase because
these headphones you have something that
is not gonna break easy
you can rest easy throwing these into
your car into your bag into your
suitcase have them on around your neck
and be doing stuff all that good stuff
so I really like what they've done with
these headphones there's this leather
nice feel on the top and there's a
neoprene like material in the middle
which is really nice one thing I will
say about the design is this little
cable with these cables right here so
these little cables stick out they come
out and I will say that I'm a little
skeptical because what if this catches
on something and rips out right there
really braided they feel really nice and
they're gonna hold up really well but I
could see these or see people
accidentally like nudging them or
getting caught on something and shorting
out one of the sides so that's something
maybe v-moda wants to look into changing
but it kind of gives it this cool little
retro look also so it's a give and take
now there's also metal band around the
ear cups right here
which is really nice it feels like real
metal and it just gives it a nice heavy
feel even though these are a live
headphone just feels really sturdy one
thing I will say though is the button
placement I'm kind of disappointed
because there's up-and-down for volume
and the press play fast forward and
rewind button right here but they're
placed horizontally instead of vertical
so I didn't like that very much that's
something I feel like they need to
change because there's a lot of room on
this ear cup up and down there's a lot V
motor so maybe in the 2.0 version they
can kind of fix that problem and also to
the power button I wasn't really
impressed I'm thinking of you guys when
I test these products so I'm thinking
for maybe a first time user hmm if I
have the switch right here right there's
a switch on the side and you have to
move it and then hold it to pair it's a
little less comprehensive and it's a
little
how should I say it's a it's a little
non user-friendly yard for somebody
that's buying hats
wireless headphones and has never paired
headphones before it could be a problem
it took me a little bit of time to
figure it out so let's talk about the
sound sound sound sound these sound
great guys the base on these is perfect
I would describe them as accurate
balanced perfect amazing great so one
thing I did notice is the mints are a
little lacking I really like vocals to
be in the forefront it really just
brings out the emotion and it brings out
the sound and the headphone so I felt
like the bass kind of overpowered the
vocals the bass are definitely the star
in these I would have wanted the myths
to be a little bit more pronounced so
let's say I break in the song comes when
the music just cuts off and then you
have the singer singing and then they
hit a high and then as a bass comes in
and I love that I love that when the
bass comes in and hits you just feel
very emotional and I didn't get that
really with these it was there but not
so much and I found myself wanting that
contrast but it didn't get it so if
you're a person that likes that too then
these are kind of borderline but they do
highs really well they do the bass
really well the vocals and the mids they
were okay I'll say that much I'll be
real with you guys they were okay but
the perfect bass made me overlook all
that because they were a really fun
headphone they Rumble a little bit so
you guys will not be disappointed if
you're a bass head if you're into jazz
even if you're into EDM RB rap even rock
they do everything great they're a great
all-around headphone with a bass heavy
emphasis so next up let's talk about the
battery life the battery battery battery
life
they put 12 hours of battery life in
these so we kind of know what we're
getting into I actually got a little
less than that using full volume so I
feel like they could
put in a little bit more time I'll put
in a bigger battery made them a little
bit more heavy just to get that 20 hour
range which is kind of a sweet spot but
the sound will make you overlook that 12
hours especially when you plug them into
your phone or plug them into your hook
or laptop or computer they sound great
and they come with a great chord which
is braided and it just feels very nice
the whole package just seems very nice
the case in these two feels very nice
they're very protective
protecting your $300 investment I really
feel like they put together a great
package for people that want beats
killers
these are beats killers but I'll get to
that in another video
and tape so I did find an interruption
in connection with these guys and that's
when I had my macbook set up and then I
had these connected to the macbook and
had my phone in the middle and what
happened was I got a little bit of
interference my Bluetooth was on on my
phone and they interacted with each
other and I got a little bit of static
but the sound just makes you overlook
all these shortcomings guys I was
telling you these are gonna be in my
rotation now I kid you not these are in
my rotation permanently because they
sound great they have a low profile they
feel nice they're comfortable the bass
is perfect I cannot recommend these
enough so with all that being said no
headphone is perfect but the
shortcomings of the V motocross via
Wireless are nothing compared to the
pros that you get with this package
alright guys so thank you guys for
watching thanks all the new subscribers
for subscribing to me I really
appreciate it I appreciate you guys drop
in the comments the likes all that good
stuff and my main goal with this channel
is just to help people so I feel like I
am accomplishing that and getting better
with my video skills and just
challenging myself to do these videos
to put out cost and material for you
back so thank you guys for watching it
has been your boy BT I will see you guys
in the next review probably within this
