with another motivational Monday today I
want to talk to you guys about jealousy
about seeing others and then making you
feel small but here's one tip that I
have that I found very useful for me and
that is when you see somebody and you're
like man they make me feel really small
they make me feel really insecure about
myself that feeling we get confused with
man I see greatness in them and I know
that I can get it myself so that
greatness that you see in somebody else
it means that you already see it within
yourself and you know that you're
capable of doing it but oftentimes
people get caught up in jealousy and
they try to hate on others but to make
themselves feel better and less insecure
but that insecure feeling is just you
feeling excited and you seeing that man
this person that I'm aspiring to be that
same greatness with that this person has
is within me just like I can guarantee
you anybody that's watching this video
right now you are awesome guaranteed
guaranteed you're awesome and if you've
ever felt small if you've ever felt
insecure it's because you know what
greatness looks like and you have
already seen it within yourself so don't
shortchange yourselves don't let that
jealousy get in the way of your goals
and you starting something new or
gaining that greatness because that same
greatness is already within you guys you
guys just haven't tapped into it yet I'm
telling you tap into it believe in your
greatness know that it is possible
anything is possible don't let anybody
any circumstance make you feel otherwise
and feel that insecurity bubbling up
inside of you and take that and realize
that hey I am great too
and you're just in all of this person
people are our mirror guys there are
mirrors whatever we see in somebody else
these are qualities that we've already
noticed within ourselves good or bad you
know it could be easy for me to say hey
look I don't have this many subscribers
and this person has millions man I feel
so jealous I feel so insecure why am I
even trying but instead I say man this
person can do it so can I so can I that
hard work that they're putting in I'm in
awe of it and it inspires me to become
better knowing that that grimace that's
within them is within me so all it is is
you guys are seeing that awesomeness and
other people not jealousy you're seeing
awesomeness and your it's reflecting
back at you you're seeing yourself in
this person say that I can do that so go
out and do it struggle fight for what
you want so go out there and kill it
this week before we go on holiday some
of you may be already be on holiday but
I just want to end this video by saying
happy holidays two guys I just want to
thank everybody for all their support
and I was actually really sad that I
couldn't give away more than I did for
my giveaway so that is gonna be my goal
for next year's to do more giveaways for
you guys and just give you know it sucks
to just hate feeling limited to a
certain amount or I hate being limited
by resources I just want to give less
what it comes down to so I hope you guys
understand we are going to kill this
next year I'm telling you guys but we'll
get into that later on in another
motivational Monday before the year ends
so I will see you guys in the next video
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
