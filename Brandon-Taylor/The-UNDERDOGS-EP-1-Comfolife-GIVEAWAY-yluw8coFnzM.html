different from any we've read people
we have been interpreted by
New York City Mayor the next regretful
that you're aware enough man in life in
our position when i dub thee and hear
first-hand district taco let's hear the
right
what is up guys is BTW back here again
with a new series to it for you guys and
also for the underdogs that's what this
series is going to be about it's about
the underdogs in the headphone that game
today and this is episode 1 so let me
tell you guys a little bit about how the
series is going to work it's going to
work by me reaching out to companies and
having them send me their headphones
therefore I can take their headphones
review them give them honest feedback no
ads so that they can push the headphone
game further hear me out so I really
want to help these lesser-known
companies better their products so they
can compete with the likes of Bose
jaybird and beat because anything that
sparks competition betters everyone in
the headphone game is better the
companies that are higher up because it
pushes them to push technology forward
it also helps the lesional companies
build up their company and also who
knows maybe they become huge maybe they
become the next piece Jaybirds we
benefit again so it's a win-win for
everybody so I feel like by giving
honest feedback instead of just giving
an ad to you guys I'd get by these i'm
going to give you guys on a tree back
and give the clipping a lot of feedback
so that they can better their products
and compete because at the end of the
day if you get a product and you don't
like it you just don't like you're not
going to buy again from that company
right so this is only meant to help the
companies and also to there's going to
be a giveaway because I'm reaching out
to these companies not only to get a
review pair but also a second pair to
give way to you guys and to create kind
of like a interaction with my
subscribers and see what their opinions
and thoughts on these headphones are and
also to I said back in November that I
wanted to give everybody headphones but
I couldn't at the time so this is one
step closer to being able to do that so
the first company nice enough to send
this headphone is comfo life
duster HD wireless sports headphones now
these things I've been able to test for
the past week and I've had a lot of fun
testing them I'm going to be honest
sometimes when I test headphones I
really don't look forward to wearing
them at the gym or anywhere because it's
just kind of a hassle not I'm not
hearing good sound and I know I'm
spoiled so without any further ado let's
start this review now first up we're
going to talk about the comfort and
design these come with a power beats
like design using the hook to go behind
your ear now I did find that the
material on these to be a little bit
better than the power beats because
they're flexible they're not just one
piece that you kind of Bend really hard
to get into place for your power of
these threes these are more just fit to
your ear and be comfortable at the same
time with comfortable materials so
that's great they also includes silicone
tips and these are actually pretty nice
feeling a lot of the times with the
lesional companies they put in these
tistic they're really thin and these
actually feel almost as good as a
jaybird quality silicone tip
so very comfortable I wore them for
hours and they're very light so they
also have a nice chord a lot of
companies to they give you these cheap
cords this one actually feels really
nice so they have the up and down volume
buttons and the press play button and
pause button on the top one thing one
tip that I have for them is maybe the
name of their headphone doesn't need to
be on both sides of the headphone and
also to the design of their logo I feel
like it could be a little bit more
animalistic over all the materials feel
pretty good not as premium as a power
beat three but they do feel really nice
and they feel like it's going to hold up
over time and they're also waterproof a
lot of you guys always asking okay if I
sweating these a lot on my heavy flutter
these are waterproof so you don't have
to worry about it next up let's talk
about the sound now with a lot of
budgets headphones they really suffer
from a lack of clarity and a lack of
clarity especially in their mid tones
which is the vocals and that's one way
that I can tell as soon as I put on the
headphone whether there's a lot of
clarity and if I'm going to like it is
through the vocals that's the easiest
way for me to decide can you decide and
I can tell you guys within seconds of
nope yes these are good these are bad so
with these once I put them on the vocals
were very clear surprisingly clear I did
not expect that I expected kind of sound
that you would get from maybe a skull
candy headphones but these sounded very
clear base is also something and it is
very nice it's very satisfying it almost
gives a a resonance in your ear i really
like the only place these kind of are
held back is at the highs but these are
working out headphones so with that you
want to be thinking about emotions you
want to be thinking about what kind of
emotion who these headphones gives me
during a workout and mainly we give that
through the vocals and we get back
through the base so it has those covers
so mortgage you want I would actually
compare these to the power of you three
they actually sound very similar maybe a
tad less clarity but very very similar
and I think it's a great value for the
40 or 50 bus to just go ahead and get
these if you're on a budget I was still
very confident in saying you would be
very pleased with the sound profile one
thing I will say and one tip to the half
of them is that the volume doesn't go
down very low before it turns off so
when you go down to the last tick on
your iPhone or your Android it is still
very loud and then that could be a good
or bad thing depending on who you ask
but sometimes when I'm talking to people
at the gym or if I'm at work and I just
I need to hear people coming to talk to
me I needed to go down a little bit
lower so that i can let in ambient noise
and maybe if you're a runner you need to
ambient noise think for maybe version
two of these that should maybe look into
why meme the gap of low to high volumes
of making more of a gradient these
lasted me a full eight hours I really
enjoyed using these and not having to
charge them I've only charged these once
I still haven't had to charge them again
that's crazy i've been using them off
and on for about a week using them
through my work out and they have lasted
guys it is crazy so you're getting the
full eight hours there with battery so
very good value for the price again so
next up let's talk about the
connectivity I didn't notice any
distortion or interruptions using these
headphones they use 4.1 Bluetooth and in
the gym around people with other
wireless headphones my workout partner
uses Jaybirds and we did not notice any
interruption at all between the two so
kudos to come fo life for putting in
quality connectivity into these
headphones
moving on the call quality these are
again very good although sometimes I
didn't notice an echo when talking to
people and these are marketed as not
having an echo but during calls I did
notice a little bit insulin echo and
when I was playing my music or watching
a video while talking to people people
could hear the music from my headphones
so that's something maybe they want to
look into fixing but overall if you're
just doing short phone calls there's no
problem with these people can hear you
just so in conclusion I can recommend
these for forty dollars very great value
