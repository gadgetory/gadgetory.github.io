with another review today we're going to
be taking a look at the Jabra 65 T's now
these were recommended to me by a
subscriber I think his name was Aaron
don't kill me if that it wasn't your
name but I just want to thank you for
letting me know about these because I
tried them out and they are amazing and
I just wanted to let you guys know that
if ever you want me to review a pair of
headphones or any product let me know
because sometimes I don't even know I
didn't even know about these headphones
and I was pleasantly surprised by these
so today let's get into why I like these
headphones but first don't forget to
subscribe for more content like this so
one thing that I really liked about the
Jabra sixty-five T's is how compact the
cases a lot of the cases that we've been
seeing lately are very long they're very
big and they're not very functional for
everyday carrying this is about the size
of the air pod case which is very very
nice I can carry this in my pocket I've
even forgotten that it's even in there I
have to tap my pocket like it's still in
there whereas like something like the
Bose sound sports are just crazy big and
don't really fit in your pocket that
well so right off the bat the case is
very very nice now the air boats
themselves fit into your ear very very
nice
you kind of twist them and they kind of
lock into place they have a small ear
tips which I felt let in a lot of
outside noise so if that's something you
don't like these might not be for you
but as with most sports earbuds they
want you want to have a little bit of
that outside noise coming in so that you
can hear outside surroundings whether
that's running or doing other things
it'll be easier for you to hear what's
going on around you so on the right ear
bud you're gonna have the press play
pause button and skip tracks and on the
left side you have the volume rocker
which is very nice a lot of companies
aren't putting that on their earbud so
it's nice to have that functionality
there it works very very well
didn't have any problems with it at all
now you will notice on the action
your buzzes there are a lot of holes in
fact there are four microphones on each
side of the earbuds and these will give
you crystal-clear call quality which is
very very nice it's not as a good as
Apple but it is up there and don't call
me an Apple fanboy don't do it now you
can also have voice assistance on here
from like Bixby at Google assistant and
Siri so there's a lot of functionality
with these earbuds if that's your thing
I don't really use it but I know a lot
of people do now the actual sound of
these earbuds are very very good as well
now out of the box I was a little bit
disappointed especially for the price
point
coming in at $169 I was a little bit
disappointed but I said oh wait maybe
there's an app so I went on I've got the
app installed it and what do you know
there's a equalizer and this equalizer
is very good it was it allowed me to
customize my song while I was listening
to it so I just had a song play like a
rap song and that customized it so that
the vocal sounded clear the bass was
there the highs were nice and rolled off
so it was very cool to actually just
have that real-time equalizer where I
can just change it and make the songs
what I want so whatever song that you're
listening to whether it's classical jazz
rock whatever is your forte just play
the song mess with the equalizer as
you're playing with it and that will
give you the best sound quality possible
for the music that you like so the
battery life is coming in at five hours
which is pretty good considering that
all the microphones that it has in it
all the buttons and stuff like that
where it's like that err pause they
don't have any of that and those are
only six hours so six hours versus five
hours and you're getting a lot more here
with the job or 65 tees so I really like
that and then you're also gonna get
extra two charges with the case totaling
to fifteen hours which is pretty good
now one thing that I think puts the
Jabra 65 T's over all other headphones
or earbuds in the truly Wireless
category is the stability these things
have not crapped out on me at all they
have worked flawlessly in the gym
anywhere outside on runs anywhere these
work flawlessly
these are up there with the air pots and
with the Samsung gear X's these are very
very stable earbuds and I don't know why
other companies couldn't just come out
with something similar the technology
they put in here to make these so stable
the connection with your phone you're
never gonna have any of those drops so
don't even worry about it so all in all
I wish they would add it some like foam
tips or something to block out more
noise but overall the stability the call
quality the sound profiles and the e
cues are just unmatched it just
everything just works it's a great
package they're very comfortable in your
ear they don't ever feel like they're
gonna fall out so you don't have to
really worry about that so all in all I
give the Jabra 65 T's the bt seal of
approval because these things are
amazing so check them out if you haven't
already I think they're well worth the
price and let me know what you guys
think alright guys so that is gonna do
it for my time thank you guys for
watching so much I appreciate all the
support that you guys have given me
lately

recommendations for headphones let me
know down below I'll be sure to check
them out and get a review out to you
