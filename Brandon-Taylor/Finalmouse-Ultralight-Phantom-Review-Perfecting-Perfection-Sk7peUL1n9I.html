mouse's mouse mouse is nice mice hmm I
gotta decide soon this review has to
come out what am I gonna do
alright so my favorite Mouse the final
Mouse ultra light Pro has just got even
better final Mouse has just released the
ultra light phantom edition an updated
version of their already instant classic
the mouse I mean these things are
selling out like hotcakes and rightfully
so I mean even at the price of $90 which
may seem crazy to some they're just
selling out has a top sensor an amazing
shape and it takes comfort to the next
level it has great buttons side buttons
a great scroll wheel and it only weighs
67 grams Wow
you definitely don't see a mouse of this
size in this weight ever now you know us
the consumers we'd like to complain and
we can never be completely satisfied and
we tell the manufacturers what we like
what we don't like and in my comments I
saw a lot of people saying that they did
not like the cores and you know I will
say that it was kind of stiff well they
have just added the phantom cord to the
ultra light probe making this thing
perfect I mean check out the difference
as I push against the cord compared to
my sunset version there is almost no
resistance and this will keep you from
missing those critical shots sometimes
this thing might as well be cordless
that's how good it is
for the past two weeks my SR in
overwatch has been going up coincidence
I don't know but what I can say is that
this thing is worth every penny
as this is an in-game Mouse in my
opinion well you know until the next
sensor comes out and then we're gonna
need another mouth one thing I know a
lot of people were looking forward to
was a smaller shape which is justified
as this is a medium to large
headed mouse in my opinion but if your
hand fits this Mouse
wow you are in for a real treat your
rankings and your games will just say it
all you don't have to take my word for
it
check your rankings alright guys so that
is just a quick review on the updated
version of the ultra light pro the ultra
light phantom it's probably sold out by
the time you're seeing this and oh yeah
did I mention that each one of these
Mouse's is very unique the paint
splatter of the stars and all that is
unique to each Mouse which is also
really cool but yeah like I was saying
these things are probably sold out by
the time you guys have seen this but
stay tuned to find out my socials for
updates on when you'll be able to get
your hands on one thank you - final
Mouse for sending me out one of these to
test for the past week and I've really
enjoyed using this and yeah I couldn't
be happier this is staying on my desk
100% of the time I'm not kidding you
