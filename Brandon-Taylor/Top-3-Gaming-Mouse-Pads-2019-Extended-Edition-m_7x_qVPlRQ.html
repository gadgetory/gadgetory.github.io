are my top three gaming mouse mats now
mouse mats are great because you get
some support for your wrist as well as
never running out of space on your
mousepad when you have this huge excel
or extended mousepad it also makes your
setup look really really clean instead
of having like its own separate XL
mousepad on the side and then you got
your keyboard all by its lonesome on the
other side you can have both on it and
it looks like it's like one whole unit
for your keyboard and for your mouse I
know there are plenty of good ones out
there and I've tried almost all of them
and these three are the three that
really stuck out to me the most all of
these work great with hyper glides let's
just get that out of the way right now
and I found that all of them aren't
really affected by temperature changes
so they are all really consistent so
without any further ado here is my list
of my top three Gaming Mouse mat so
let's start off with a mouse mat that
I've gotten the most questions about
when people see it in my videos and that
is the Logitech G 840 coming in at $50
now it's a little on the expensive side
it's the second fastest on the list and
I personally moved to this mouse mat
after having the G 640 and I never
looked back the dimensions are 15.75
inches by thirty five point four three
by three millimeters thick there is no
stitching around the mouse mat so it can
start to fray at the edges if you aren't
careful it has a very grippy base and
the surface is tuned for a Logitech mice
so you guys out there that use a
Logitech mice you're gonna love this
mouse mat this mouse mat is probably the
second fastest mouse mat of the three so
be careful if you are somebody who needs
a little bit more control I also love
that it has minimal branding with the
black-on-black G if this mouse mat had
stitching it could be an in-game
mousepad in my opinion the next Mouse
mat on the list is the two XL glorious
or three XL glorious depending on the
size of your desk it's dimensions are 36
inches by 18 inches with a thickness of
3 millimeters and it comes in at a
really good price point of $35 for the
two XL and $40 for the three XL I found
this to be one of the best
if not the best cloth mouse mat on the
market and super consistent day after
day during intense gaming in terms of
control it's silky smooth but it still
has a lot of control so you get the best
of both worlds here
it's got anti fraying stitching that are
some of the best that I've ever seen on
any Mouse mat this mouse mat is gonna
last you a long time let me tell you
guys I probably say that this is the
slowest pad on the list for you shaky
Amer's out there this is gonna be the
Mouse map for you overall this should be
the gold standard for gaming mouse mats
as this is an in-game Mouse mat 100%
alright guys so we've come to a final
mouse mat on the list my new favorite
Mouse mat that asus rog scabbard whose
dimensions are 35 point 4 inches by 15
point seven inches and it is three
millimeters and it comes in at a price
point of $40 at the time of the
recording of this video now let's just
give this out of the way now the
branding on this mouse mat is horrendous
asus why the need to put rog scabbard in
big letters on one side then the rog
branding on the other I mean I get it it
glows in the dark
and all that cool stuff but most of us
like a clean non brown it Mouse mat or
very minimal branding if you must now
outside of that this mouse mat has blown
me away
it's got splash proof stain resistant
quarter or light fabric aka Cordura
which feels fantastic it's easy to clean
and most spills and dirt spots seem to
come off by themselves it's just amazing
the Cordura material that they used for
the surface is one of my favorites it's
super slick with some control I go as
far as to say that this is the new
artisan of the mouse mat game right now
like if artisan was to make a mouse mat
I feel like this would be it lick shots
feel absolutely fantastic on this mouse
mat I really recommend this to people
who have like medium and high
sensitivities because this surface is
just buttery smooth you get a great ride
for your mouse mat especially when
you've got some hyper glides on this
baby oh man your mouse just flies
alright guys so that is gonna do it for
my video on the top three mouse mats I
hope you guys have enjoyed this video if
your mouse mat didn't make it to this
list and it works for you more power to
you but I want to point people in the
right direction and I
these three are a solid start alright
guys so it has been your boy bTW don't
