gonna start the vlog by of course going
to the gym and I'm not wearing the black
and thank you shirt just woke up just
caught up on some sleep it's about 11
o'clock now and I'm ready to start the
day I'm ready to get it in on film a
good video today I don't know what I've
got these cool little figurines here
I've got a flash he's pretty cool it's a
pop figure and I got one piece I got
Tony choppa
Tony Tony chocolate so it's pretty cool
I really like I'm putting putting them
on the back of my desk for like
backdrops for videos and stuff like that
so it's pretty cool
I really like them so I'm probably gonna
get more of these I also got this one
for ELISA she loves Harry Potter so got
the Harry of course anyways that's what
we're doing today so I will see you guys
in the lip
so I ran out of c4 I ordered it from
Amazon and I got a fake version so it
did not work for like a week and also
name while it's having such crappy
workout so I was just getting really
warm nothing was happening and it got no
effect so I was really mad about that
and I picked up some of the gold
standard preach where do I get this from
Vitamin Shoppe just because it was
locally and I needed something fast but
it's been working out pretty well I've
used to in the past I forgot about it
went back to see 450 X but now I'm back
on this and I really like this so the
pump time is good but the energy is
better long lasting and feel of strength
wise it's a lot better as well so check
this one out and of course I'm stacking
it with high volume make a little turkey
sandwich on the baguette just for a
little bit of energy before the gym it's
all about timing
so like I have a lot of cars before I
worked out to give me energy throughout
not just to go with my pre-workout just
to give me energy throughout something
else that's get to half before workout
is orange juice high fructose quick
efficient energy for your work
all right so just finished my workout
and I filmed it all by myself that was
really a challenge plus sneaking the
camera around the workers all for you
guys because I love you guys
but right now I'm heading to get some
supplements and I got to take back to
Lululemon and then I got to get some gas
how fun now we're gonna do some filming
this is a great great product love right
here it's called silken self-cam by evil
Jen I really like the products for the
quality you can just almost taste the
quality within their products it's
really good that product that I'm that
you see there is a creatine complex but
it does something else that no they're
like creatine is doing well at least
that I found is it has a lot of like
BCAAs and a lot of amino acids in it as
well so with the uptake of the creatine
into your body it's gonna up take those
BCA's with it
so it's a great product I'm like as soon
as I take it I feel energized and
there's no caffeine or stimulants in it
it's just 15 and therefore you know the
creatine is working because creatine
gives you energy to back to your muscles
it replenishes your muscles so it's
great to take after your workout I like
to take it after because it'll replace
the the phosphates after your workout as
opposed to before you may not need it
you'll go into the workout with a little
bit more but
I find depleting and then putting that
right back in really leads to a lot of
muscle growth so the best way I like to
do this some people sit during which
works fine those ways works I mean it's
really up to you but this is the way
that I found works for me enough
rambling I'm heading to Lululemon right
now to return the Hat maybe get I need
some should workout shirts because I
have these bright colors and sell like
that and it doesn't go with everything
so I have like I can't wear this with
like red shoes you know what i mean or
orange juice because it just looks
ridiculous and this is like the only
shirt that I really have left so I need
to upgrade my wardrobe for the
Tylar film in there because it was so
packed anyways I got toasted coconut
pistachio on accident a strawberry then
I got some swedish fish cuz I was in the
mood and then mochi and sprinkles I love
spring in a food coma at the moment
sheesh and it's hitting me I need to go
home and take a nap ASAP oh one thing I
will say though before I put on the next
driving clip is take care of yourself
well if you're dieting for a couple days
and it's been crazy and you've had a
crazy week at work like go out and treat
yourself to like your favorite food go
go treat yourself to like just cheer
self good it'll lead to better
self-esteem and self-confidence because
you're taking care of yourself
therefore you are important and you are
treating yourself as such so that is my
reasoning for like going on eating every
weekend or and like working out and just
getting a really good meal and that's
what it comes down to is just taking
care of myself
you know so always remember that you
know take care of yourself so you can
take care of others so if you're down
and you're not you're at your best and
how can you give your best to others
what is up guys what is that what is
that what is up we are back here at my
career or should I say our crib
me casa su casa as they say so I got if
you have a Ikea desk you know that it'll
start shipping after a while and I have
a black guest and you can really see the
white coming out so I'm going to see me
so you guys can like get my reviews and
stuff I use my desk a lot so we're
important to have a clean surface and
you see this right here it doesn't look
good on video it really doesn't I've
noticed it on my last video and it bugs
me also to around these edges you see
here just kind of chipping away chip
chip chip so I bought one of these from
Amazon people recommended it and they
said that it works on IKEA desks of
black brown so hopefully it works let's
try it out
so here's the spot after I have kind of
marked it up a little bit looks better
but it might be time for new desk RT
I've only had this for a little bit and
already it's kind of breaking down on me
so IKEA linen lemon lemon whatever yeah
not the best desk to get in black maybe
a white maybe you like everybody else
maybe it's time to go away maybe let me
know what you guys think I hit 300
subscribers thanks guys I really
appreciate it
preciate all the love and support you

you're here for the tech or the vlogs or
the fitness thank you guys I really
appreciate it I really appreciate all
the a lot of good comments and I'm just
gonna keep going you know people are
like why don't you have that many
subscribers whatever just really
mattered just as long as like putting
out content that the people that are
subscribed to me like in love and then
it'll grow from there you know not
really like set on the subscribers
because I wanted to get a hundred
subscribers by the end of the year but
I'm at 300 now so just supposed to show

good videos and getting better myself to
make entertaining comic content and
educational content and informational
content that people can actually use so
