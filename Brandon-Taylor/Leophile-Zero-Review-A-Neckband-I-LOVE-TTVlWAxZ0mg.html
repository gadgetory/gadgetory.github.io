with another review today we're gonna be
taking a look at the lio file zeroes
bialya file these were recommended by
Faisal sama don't kill me if I just
butcher your name but he has a sub he's
been asked me to do these for the
longest time so he called me out and I
wanted to review them I reviewed them
and I was pleasantly surprised by what I
found so today I'm gonna be taking a
look at these headphones they are a neck
band sports earbud so we're gonna take a
look at these but before we begin to
forget to hit that subscribe button for
more content like this all right so
these are a pair of active noise
cancellation gear buds that have a neck
band and they're made mostly for sports
and just playing when you open the box
that says just play so there's a hint
they want you to get out and they want
you to use these headphones while you're
out and about and being active now found
the build quality of these earbuds to be
really really good the neck band feels
really really good especially when
you're in the gym it doesn't move around
at all this has to be one of the best
neck bands that I have ever tried guys
I'm not even kidding you it stays in
place better than any other headphone
that I've ever tried with a neck band
and you guys know that I am NOT a fan of
Nick bands if you've watched my older
reviews but these I can definitely
recommend because the Nick band just
stays in place it forms to my neck
perfectly it's lightweight it doesn't
rub against my neck in the gym when I
lay back on a bench or anything like
that it stays in place I never had one
issue with it falling off or hanging off
to the side like it does sometimes with
some earbuds so it's very refreshing to
find a neck band that actually works and
stays in place and keeps your ear buds
in place like they are kind of marketed
to now in the neck band they have a
volume rocker which also doubles as a
skip back and forwards for your tracks
it also has a press play and power
button as usual I found these to be very
clicky a very nice and tactile so
overall the build quality on these is
amazing for 60 bucks the chords coming
out from the actual Nick van to the ear
buds also feel really really good and
another thing that I like is that the
ear buds are very lightweight themselves
and the silicone tips that they provide
which
provide three different tips they feel
amazing they almost disappear when you
put them into your here I almost forgot
that I was wearing them most of the time
Comfort on these is immaculate guys let
me just tell you that much
so on the actual earbuds you'll see that
there is a speaker or a mic of some sort
and what this does is it listen to your
outside environment and then it blocks
that noise through the active noise
cancellation now when I turned on the
active noise cancellation I didn't
really notice a difference because he's
really isolating you no matter what
these things block out so much noise
that I think the active noise
cancellation only has to do a very
miniscule amount of work and that's a
very good thing that's where you want to
be at you can just put these in without
the active noise cancellation and they
work just fine whether in the gym or on
the train or commuting these things
block out everything I mean wow the mic
on these earbuds are absolutely amazing
it is crystal clear it's almost like
you're just talking with your phone up
to your mouth crystal clear on both ends
whether that's here in the other person
or the other person hearing you these
things do a great job of just
transmitting your voice and voices just
in general
now one thing with neck band earbuds is
that they're supposed to give you a lot
of benefit you know you're supposed to
get that better mic you're supposed to
get noise cancellation you're supposed
to get better battery life and I feel
like some of the brands have kind of
failed at that
but these give you 20 hours of battery
life that is amazing for this type of
earbud so why can companies like this at
a budget give you $60 earbuds with great
sound great mic noise cancellation great
battery life and these other big-name
companies can't seem to do it it kind of
makes you wonder right another thing
that I really love about these earbuds
is that you can actually plug them in
through USB and then plug them into a
3.5 millimeter jack whether that's on
your laptop or phone and it works
without having the battery being full so
you can actually save battery life or
maybe you don't want to use bluetooth
you won't actually just connect
your laptop you're not in the situation
where you need to use Bluetooth so you
can actually just use the cable so I
really really like that feature about
these headphones as well so speaking of
sound let's talk about the sound a
little bit these things pleasantly
surprised me the bass on these is very
nice and rich not only does it say that
not only as an advertise like that but
they also follow through with that claim
the bass on these is so good guys so
good and another thing that I like is
that the volume reaches really really
high levels without distorting so when I
listen to like a DM says Tomorrowland
has happened so listening to all those I
was able to listen to those and max
volume and have the sets not sound like
they're coming through a potato
so when earbuds can do that and they
still sound really good still can
increase the bass the vocal sound
amazing on these for whether that's
through EDM rock classical jazz
everything just sounded very very good I
have no complaints when it comes to the
sound maybe a little bit more clarity
within the mid but that's just me being
nitpicky and that's $60 these are an
absolute steal so if you don't mind a
neck band and you want all the benefits
from a neck band as sound battery and
all that these are a great choice
alright guys so in conclusion I just
want to say that these things are
amazing from the mic from the sound from
the noise cancellation to the isolation
everything just is amazing and not to
mention these have the comfort to go
along with it
they stay in place I don't have much to
complain about I don't have much to
knock these on maybe a little bit here
and there with the sound just to raise
it up but as $60.00 I mean what more
could you really ask for when it comes
to these earbuds so if you're a person
that likes neck bands or a person that's
been on the fence about it you're not
sure about it and you want all the
benefits that they are claiming that
they should have these are the ones to
look at and you can try it at a low cost
of $60 guys so in my opinion I think
it's worth it to give these a shot
they're great for working out there
great for commuting and
so yeah definitely take a look at the
leo file zeroes they are an amazing set
of earbuds alright guys so that has been
my video I know I hit 10,000 subscribers

other giveaway soon so stay tuned I love
