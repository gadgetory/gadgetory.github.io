what's up guys - speedy here and this is
the review you guys have all been
waiting for
asking for DME commenting in all my
videos that have nothing to do with mice
and here we are guys today we're gonna
finally review the model Oh from the
People's Champ glorious now I want to
start this review off by saying
competition is good for everybody it
pushes the original company to come out
with something new and it drives down
prices so in the end guys the consumer
aka us benefit from the competition so
it's a win-win for everybody
and I feel like that is what the main
goal of the model is it's to get like
mice that we all deserve into our hands
without paying $300 on eBay before we
begin though guys I'm doing a model old
launch party tonight on Twitch where
I'll be answering questions and giving
away one or two model O's on stream to
one or two lucky subscribers so check
the details down below for my twitch
link and I'll have all the details on
the time and stuff like that when we're
gonna go live on my Twitter so enough of
the logistics let's talk about this
beautiful mouse and the beautiful box
that it comes in I mean come on this
thing is gorgeous now there are four
different variations of this Mouse you
have a matte white and a matte black you
also have a glossy white and a glossy
black now the matte versions will set
you back fifty dollars and it's gonna be
sixty dollars for those glossy versions
of the mouse now after using these mice
for a while now my recommendations are
this go with the matte version if you
are a competitive gamer there's just no
way around it it's just more secure
overall in your hand go with the glossy
version if you are looking for more of
an aesthetic look to your setup although
you can gain with both those are just my
recommendations the matte version is 67
grams and a glossy version is 6 grams so
you do gain one gram by going with the
coating but that is
negligible in-game in my opinion
weight-wise guys I know I'm gonna get
this question I can't tell the
difference between this and the air 58
but in my opinion once you go down below
80 grams there starts to be a
diminishing return and I feel like shape
plays more of a factor in your aim at
that point the white versions do collect
some dirt but they are very easy to
clean another difference between the air
58 and this is that there are more
smaller holes on this whereas the air 58
has these big huge holes and there are
no holes on the side which I actually
kind of like because it helps with the
structural integrity of the mouse over
time then it mentions of the mouse with
2.4 inches wide at the front and 2 point
6 inches in the back across the middle
it's going to be 2.3 - which helps with
grit it's also 5 inches long in total
the height is about one inch of the
front and one point for 7 inches tall at
the highest point these measurements are
very similar to one of the most popular
shapes ever made the FK one from Zowie
it's got that glorious logo on the
left-hand side and the glorious written
at the front side of the mouse with this
Mouse you can use all grip styles my
hand is 19 by 8 point 5 centimeters and
this thing fits like an absolute glove
with my claw grip you can also use palm
grip with this Mouse I did notice that
palm grip was more comfortable on the
glossy version because the edges on the
hexagons are smoothed over and on the
matte version I definitely felt the
hexagons a little bit more when using a
palm grip but that just comes with the
territory of having a mouse with holes
with a you know some penta hexa
Pentagon's I'm just kidding guys we're
not doing that again ok for sizing
everybody is different and it's personal
preference but I think that danger zones
for this Mouse for it not working for
some people might be if you're above 21
by 10 centimeter palm grip it just won't
be comfortable your fingers will be
hanging over the edge also if you are
below 16 by 7 centimeters and your
fingertip grip you might be at risk as
well and I think claw grip users should
be safe with a variety of hand sizes the
side buttons are nice and clicky and
they aren't mushy at all let's do a BT
sound test for you guys right now
just for reference guys a lot of people
are saying put the mic right next to the
mouse the mic is right here if you can't
tell it's literally right here they're
doing a live sound test and they are
click key mm-hmm now the omron switches
on the mouse 1 &amp;amp; 2 feel great let's do
another sound test for you guys right
now oh man these things are nice they
are super sexy guys let me tell you
let's do the DPI button 2 while we're
here the DPI button lost through the
scroll wheel nice and click you guys I'm
telling you guys these are some of my
favorite clicks on any Mouse around I
think the only thing that really beats
it for me might be like the G Pro
wireless now that dpi button up top
allows you to change the DPI and the DPI
actually changes color on the bottom of
the mouse which is nice the scroll wheel
has RGB and indentations to help with
scrolling it can also be used as a
button as well as I just demonstrated
now what's cool about the model is that
they save you a lot of time and money
from buying third-party mods to start
your mouse starting with the mouse feet
they have their own G skate mouse feet
so buying $15 hyper glides it's just not
necessary anymore
these are actually made up of 100% pure
virgin PTFE which is the same material
that they use on hyper glides these are
actually 0.81 millimeters and thickness
with rounded edges so that they don't
catch on the mousepad hyper glide 0.548
s--
fast as boy for context i lowered my
apex sensitivity from 802 points to a
400 3.0 cents that's about an 800 a dpi
difference that's pretty big now the
good news is if you like control their
glorious pad gives you a ton of control
but if you're like me and you like speed
the asus scabbard is simply amazing it
feels like you are on ice with this
mouse as well as on the glorious Helios
these things just fly with these G's
the ascendant Court is another area
where you don't have to mod your mouse
it's not as good as a pair of cord but
it's better than everything else on the
market now the reason why I think pair
cords are slightly better than the
Senate cords when I push this in the
cord into the model oh it kind of moves
the mouse when I push the pair of cord
into like a moderate s2 it doesn't move
so that is the main difference that I
saw but that being said it's still
better than everything else on the
market it's a little bit more loose
around the cabling inside but like I
said this thing you can have it
free-flowing on your desk you don't need
a mouse bungee you can use it for just
that safe peace of mind but I don't
think it's necessary anymore
now you can control the RGB through the
software choosing with various visual
effects including my favorite glorious
mode you can also put it into a single
color mode if you want to match it with
your setup theme now in my opinion the
RGB looks absolutely sick it's got two
lines flanking on each side of the mouse
and a light on the scroll wheel and the
way it reflects off the inside of the
hexagons
is just simply dope the white version
looks the best with the RGB of course
especially that glossy one but the black
also looks kind of cool kind of like
twinkles inside of there and it looks
absolutely sick there's also a deep
bouncing feature in a software that
allows you to lower the click latency to
4 milliseconds but there is more of a
chance of double clicking it's got that
3360 sensor that has just been proven
time and time again to be reliable in
any setting whether you're a casual
gamer or an eSports professional now
it's got a 1000 Hertz polling rate which
is the rate at which your computer
checks the connection it's also got a
point seven millimeter lift off distance
I've personally had no spin outs during
the use of this mouse the whole time as
for tracking is great on the iconic
glorious three XL mouse mats but I
wanted to do some more difficult testing
on some more difficult mouse mats and so
I went to artisan the Kai and
the radiant and I'm happy to report they
perform perfectly I tried to spin off
the sensor with no luck in-game this
mouse performs exceptionally I think my
first game I dropped like a record of 15
kills in one game in apex I mean I'm no
pro so this kind of blew my mind
the sixty seven grams come
with the 3360 sensor an amazing shape
provide for an amazing experience that
you won't be disappointed by for fifty
to sixty dollars you get one of the best
mics on the market if not the best
backed by one of the most solid
companies in the world right now in the
gaming space so is it better than the
air 58 in my opinion it feels like more
of a refined product over the air 58 and
let's not mention the price coming in at
forty dollars cheaper than the air
fifty-eight
I think this mouse is an absolute steal
and I could see it being the in-game
Mouse for a lot of people out there
glorious was smart with the shape and
the size of this Mouse and it will
definitely fit most people's hands and
grip styles out there alright guys so
that is gonna do it for this video I
hope you guys have enjoyed this video if
you haven't liked share comment and

Mouse video very very soon and updated
