with another review today we're gonna be
taking a look at the Apple watch series
for the newest latest and greatest from
Apple I do feel like the Apple watch
series four is worth it so I'm gonna go
over some of the features of why I think
this can be beneficial for you to buy
and why I think it almost is a must buy
so let's get into it today before we
begin though guys don't forget to hit
that subscribe button for more content
like this so this year with a 44
millimeter there's 30% more viewing area
and the L PTO technology in the screen
actually gives more power efficiency so
you're getting more battery life at 18
hours this year that has been one of my
gripes with Apple recently is that I
want them to hit 24 hours all right
they're not there yet because I want
them to be able to track sleep but since
they have no sleep app I mean I guess
it's not really a thing and that's where
I feel like companies like Fitbit have
apple beat is on sleep and having that
all-in-one tracker that tracks every
living aspect of your life outside of
the screen they've added an s4 chip that
has made this watch super snappy coming
from the series - this thing doesn't lag
at all there's no freezes it's very
smooth you can tell even just scrolling
through the apps or moving around
there's just no lag they've also added
the crown of the watch to have haptic
feedback so when you're scrolling
through apps or pulling up your app
screen there's a little bit of a kick
there and it's very enjoyable this year
I really like having that haptic
feedback the 40 millimeter screen is
coming in at 399 and the 44 millimeter
is coming in at 429 and that is version
that I went with there's a whole
different slew of different colors I
went with the Space Gray there's a 300
dollar difference between the stainless
steel and the aluminum I went with the
aluminum because I don't think the
stainless steel is worth it but that's
just me the silicone that they use is
also top-notch it just disappears on
your wrist it doesn't get too hot during
workouts on the face of the watch you
can now add more Informatics so you can
have up to 8 different things whether
that's weather UV you can have your
music you have breathing and things like
that so is this a all-in-one
one-stop shop also this year they've
added where if you just bring up the
watch to your face and dictate something
like play Drake or play music or what's
the weather you don't have to say hey
Siri anymore it just works and this is
very powerful doing workouts where I
don't have to have my phone I don't have
to pull it out all the time it makes my
life a lot easier so I can just dictate
to my watch what I want to play and it
plays it while I have my headphones on
and that is amazing that's one feature
that I love a lot so another area where
this helps is texting and driving do not
text and drive guys but if you do use
the Apple watch because you can just
dictate to your wrist who you want to
text what you want to text and it just
sends it out there's no looking at your
phone taking your eyes off the road you
know I've been guilty of that don't tell
anybody but you know what this watch
betters my life it keeps me safe it
keeps my life safe I'm telling you this
is a lifesaver guys so there's two
versions there's a GPS and there's a GPS
and LTE version the LTE version lets you
stream and have all the functionality of
texting and calling from your watch and
that's a nice feature I just went with
the GPS because I'm not ready to give up
my phone yet but I will get there one
day but this is a good start and I'm
really feeling like the Apple watch and
OS is getting there it will replace our
phones one day where we don't have to be
carrying around our phones but until
then I'm gonna carry both speaking of
GPS I really like that you can have maps
on your actual watch and that's
something I've been using a lot recently
when traveling you can just pull up
wherever you want to go on your wrist so
you don't have to have your phone out
looking around missing the beautiful
sights so you can sightsee and things
like that and have Apple maps on your
wrist telling you directions that is
power and that is making your life
easier it's making your life better so
that is what I'm all about if it didn't
make your life better guys I would not
recommend it to you but there's a lot of
features with this watch that will help
you another area where this watch really
shines or really benefits your life is
working out now this thing actually
tracks things that are harder to track
like yoga a stationary bike things where
you're not really moving your arm
the heart rate sensor on the back tracks
very nicely your heart rate and can give
how many calories that you're burning
throughout your workout and it can time
it and you can keep track of your
workouts that is power and that is
something that I really really enjoy and
I really think that will benefit you
guys as well so they have the three
rings on there as usual which measures
your exercise which measures just your
daily activity whether that's playing
with your dog or walk around the house
or going up stairs or at work they also
track how much you're standing up and
moving around so you're not sitting all
day which isn't the healthiest thing so
I love that it just shoots you
notifications to get up and moving which
I'm a big fan of so another thing that
I'm really trying to take advantage of
lately is the Apple pay I like that you
can just go into the store beep your
watch on the sensor and it pays for your
groceries or your food
very easy you don't have to whip up your
phone or your wallet you can just whip
your phone the kind of sounds weird you
can just whip out your watch and put it
against the sensor and it just works so
Apple pay is a thumbs up from me and
lastly there is a walkie talkie mode so
if somebody else has an Apple watch when
your friends you can just walkie talkie
kind of like the Boost Mobile back in
the day you can chirp people but that is
a nice feature where if you just want to
have a conversation a quick conversation
with somebody you don't wanna make a
full fledge phone conversation you can
just do the walkie talkie mother alright
guys so that is gonna do it for the
Apple watch series for I definitely
think it's worth picking up because it
benefits your life so much it helps you
guys to live a longer life a better more
healthier life and that's what I'm all
about
so guys if you're in the market for a
SmartWatch and you have an iPhone pick
up the Apple watch series 4 if you
haven't already I do think it is worth
the upgrade over the other ones so that
has been my review on the Apple watch
series for I hope you guys have enjoyed
it if you have any more questions about
the Apple watch or just want to say hi
down below I'll be sure to answer you
