this what up guys is BTW coming back to
you here with another wish I say another
topic and this topic today is going to
be on beginner's luck so I'm reading the
book alchemist right now we're listening
to it and one of the things that stuck
out stuck out to me the kind of place
like bodybuilding the whole book does
but one thing that really stuck out to
me was this concept of beginners luck
now talks about like you know when
you're gambling for instance you're
gonna in the beginning you're gonna
start winning you're gonna have that
beginner's luck in and after a while
you're gonna fall off it's going to get
hard you're gonna lose this money you
may gain lose gain lose and it's going
to be difficult and that first win is
just supposed to wet your beak it's
supposed to show you what success feels
like so maybe you lose those first five
pounds and then it gets really hard
right and then you think oh crap you
know now i am i'm stuck like this is
really hard i want to give up right but
the only way that you're going to
succeed is by going through these
obstacles that are being placing your
way for a reason that initial success
that you feel that should tell you that
you're going to succeed because it's
giving you a taste so that when it gets
difficult you can remember those five
pounds and you can say look i'm already
tasted it I know it's going to be sweet
i know i can continue so that's one way
that I've kind of related that the two
things together and it just goes with
everything in life and any kind of
success that you want to accomplish you
know what be present look at you know
maybe the signs that you will succeed
maybe obstacles do get placed in your in
your way but why are those obstacles be
placing your way in the first place
you know it has to be for a reason right
why why would the why would obstacles
pop up there's no reason for them right
except for to make you succeed so it may
take you on a different route it may
tell you to go one way when you want to
go another but you just have to be open
to that change and open to that
free-flowing pneus of life and you know
sometimes it doesn't work out the exact
way that you want to work out but you're
gonna get there eventually now with that
being said I'm gonna go eat some
chipotle you've already seen my balls so
i'm not going to show it i will check in
with you later bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
