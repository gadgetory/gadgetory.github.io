with another review today we have the
beats solo 3 Wireless now these boasts
the new w1 chip by Apple it was
announced at the iPhone event
still no MacBook Pro but nonetheless
they released iPhone and the new w1
technology so this bodes well for
pairing for better battery life and just
overall connectivity now it's still blue
- it's still connecting through regular
bluetooth but the chip helps it get
better battery life and to have a better
stable connection now Apple has also put
in a feature where you can charge these
headphones for five minutes and you will
get three hours of playback time that is
incredible that is unheard of and this
w1 chest is the real deal let me tell
you guys so if you're looking for
something that's easy to use you're in
the right place now Apple set out to
change the game with this w1 chip and I
feel like they have it may seem small in
the beginning but I feel like they can
build upon this and they're pushing
Wireless towards the right direction
nobody else is doing this nobody else
was putting 40 hours of battery life
into their headphones nobody is putting
this quick-charge feature and nobody is
putting it trying to improve the
connectivity to the point where you will
never get any interruptions that is
incredible so I feel like they have
really succeeded in changing the game at
least for now
even though it seems small at least for
now they have changed the wireless game
for the better it's less time on a cord
charging now let's move in to the
comfort the design of these headphones
now what I can tell you guys I know
somebody in my comments
well I look like a fool if I have the
beats 2.0 studios and I can tell you
that they haven't really changed it the
design on these whatsoever I like that
they kept the LEDs on the side of the
headphone where you can see how much
battery you have it has five LED lights
and at most forty hours of music so that
mean it's each one of these dots is
eight hours so you can kind of figure
how much you have left and that is
incredible my Studios do not last me
this long about two dots is about two to
three hours they still boast this
plastic band one piece and this plastic
cushion up here the best part of this
these headphones are the ear pass these
fill premium everything else kind of
feels a little borderline cheap
especially like the hinges I know this
side of my hinges don't sound as good as
this side this side is a little bit more
tough than the other side so I don't
know if that's a quality issue or what
but there's some things where you expect
when you pay $300 plus tax to get and
with these with Beats we all know that
we're paying for that marketing we're
paying for the name for the Apple for
the beads name and you know what if
you're okay with that that's one thing
if you're not okay with that you're
going to probably end up hating these
but moving on I will say that these cups
are very nice they move a contour to
your head no matter if you have a big
small head medium head whichever and
they also fold up they also have these
hinges that fold up and now I have the
studios and those hinges have not broken
on me they have not been loose
they've snapped into place every single
time so I have faith that these will do
the same I'm not really worried about
that
the only thing I'll worry about is the
band breaking now they include a case
but that case is cloth it's not hard why
would they not for $300 help you protect
your $300 investment
and put in
some hard shell cases I don't get it
Apple I mean that's a minor gripe I mean
for me it's a big thing because if
you're traveling if you're throwing them
in your back for the gym it could be a
problem if you forget to take him off
your seat and you sit down it was at
this moment that he knew he up
that could be a problem they also come
with a table if you want to just plug
them in to your phone they updated I had
the old solos and the button on these
seem a lot better it seems a lot more
click here so you don't have to press
and maybe break the remote like a lot of
people were doing so it seems like they
fixed that it's a little minor
adjustment there's no real difference in
design I feel like they just put in the
w1 chip when it comes to the design of
these headphones now let's move on to
the sound the sound on these they've
cleaned them up as well they've cleaned
up the bass the mids the highs are still
kind of lackluster but these are
supposed to be a fun headphone they're
made for when you go to an Apple store
and you are looking at like Apple
products and you say oh let me put these
on and listen to a top 40 song they're
gonna sound amazing they're going to
have that deep bass they're going to
have good mids for the vocals which
translates to fun when people want fun
and a casual listener wants fun you know
audio files will probably get on these
and hate these but the average consumer
wants fun and I can say that these
deliver and that's one thing where
people hate on beats which I never got
is that they're made for lower in bass
mids so if you're EDM or rap or hip-hop
or R&amp;amp;B or even a little bit of jazz
they're great but that's what they
therefore you're buying the beats
knowing that that's what they're for if
there are other options out there if you
want to have something more balanced
with something more clarity with more
highs but these sounded really good
for what they're for and they also
boasts soundstage which I know a lot of
headphones don't have and I was
surprised with these small ear cups that
they're actually able to make it sound
like something was behind me and
something was in front of me and
something was too left-right and it was
really amazing so this translates really
well for movie watching there's no lag
during movies and lips being off and
things like that so definitely worth
picking up if you're into those genres I
can tell you that right now if you're in
a rock you might be able to skip over
them so I hope this translates into
other companies kind of using the same
technology maybe the W one buying this
chip putting it in into their headphones
and giving that connectivity now I use
these in the gym and I notice no snow
breakups no interruptions of people my
girlfriend has Beats and I was working
out with her and I didn't notice any of
that distortion or anything like that so
that was this chip is the real deal guys
I kid you not it's the real deal
so in closing if you want a bass heavy
head phone that is pretty clear it's
clear in the mids as well with the good
vocals you listen to a lot of like like
I said R&amp;amp;B rap top 40 pop songs they're
all going to sound great on these then
by all means go for it if you have the
extra money go for it if you're somebody
that is wondering why do I need a w1
chip I could already have the solo twos
stay with the solo twos you will have no
issues there but if you're an audiophile
and you're looking for clarity and highs
and something to smash all genres look
elsewhere these are very tailored for a
certain market and they do that market
really well I can say that and these are
meant to be a fashion statement as well
so you're paying for you know what
you're paying for when you get these
haters alike we all know what the beats
brand is about
so can we really blame them not really
they're going to do what they're going
to do and they're smashed in the market
if you guys want any more
recommendations or need help with any
purchasing let me know in the comments
below I will be
more than how glad to help you guys
thank you guys for watching it's been
bTW and I will see you guys in the next
video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
