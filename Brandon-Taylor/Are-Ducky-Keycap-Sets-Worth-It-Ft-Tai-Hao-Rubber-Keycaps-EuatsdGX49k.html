look at him he's got a bad reputation
they be looking at us thinking we're too
much what's up guys Nikki here and today
we're gonna be answering a common last
question that I get all the time our
ducky key cap sets worth it and we have
a special guest in the house the tie how
rubberised key caps as well I've been
using both of these for the past few
months now and today I'm gonna give you
guys my experience with them and let you
guys know are these things worth $60 for
the ducky key cap sets and 20 for the
tie how rubberized key cap sets now I
don't know if this is a spoiler or not
but I have three of the ducky sets on
three of my 60% keyboards at the moment
because they have so many cool stylized
looks that you can just customize it to
your liking so on my ducky one too many
I have the ultraviolet key cap set with
the pink tie house and then on my master
of all low profile I have the good in
blue with the green rubberized key caps
and on my AMPRO - I have the Joker key
cap set with the green rubberized
keycaps to give it that Joker green
purple and blue look I think it looks
absolutely sick now when you do buy the
ducky Qing upset you're gonna get a
hundred and eight so if you have like a
tkl or a full-size keyboard you'll be
good to go keep in mind though they
don't have any of the specialized right
shifts so if you buy this for a master
op alt you're gonna need to leave the
original key on there it's not going to
be like a hundred and fifty dollar gmk
key cap set that includes an extra right
shift so over the last few months of
using these I've gotten to try a bunch
of different key cap sets I've tried
cheap ones I've tried that I hockey cap
since I've tried the expensive ones like
the Mito laser those are like a 150 for
the gmk sets I have some bentos on the
way I've got a ton of different key cap
sets that I've tried and I always come
back to the ducky key cap sets so over
the past few months of using these I've
gotten to compare them to like Thai
hockey cap says to like cheap twenty
dollar ones did you find out eBay -
expensive ones like a G and caimito he
cap set these things have held up so
nicely like even when I use my tie
hockey cap sets as much as I love the
Hawaii keycap set they get dirty
it's very very hard to clean they're a
little bit rougher whereas the ducky
offset it feels almost like those $150
GN keiki cap sets when I put them
side-by-side with like a GM K abs these
feel simply amazing and they hold their
own especially for $60 they're really
really easy to clean they don't hold
dirt or markings and overall they just
feel like the day that I got them now
these are PBT seamless key caps and
these things are gonna last you guys
forever let me tell you and I don't know
about you guys but I eat at my desk
sometimes because like I'm editing I'm
on the go I have to be working non-stop
or I'm gaming and there tends to be some
kind of food that gets onto the keyboard
I try my best but it does happen
sometimes you know we've all been there
a spill happened and over the past few
months I kid you not guys these look
exactly the same as when I got them now
these are PBT seamless key caps the
legends are not going to rub off I don't
see any chipping or anything like that
on any of my key caps I also really love
the font and the placement of the
letters on the key caps as well for $60
guys I think it's gonna be hard to find
something of this quality and that will
last you as long as the ducky key cap
sets well for $60 when I compare them to
my $150 cap sets like I said these
actually hold their own and these are
gonna be in my collection for a long
time to come I'm not letting go of these
things whatsoever so the deputy cap sets
are not shine through so what a lot of
people are doing is they're buying the
tie how rubberized key cap sets not only
for their grip but to also give the RGB
some chance to shine through and another
reason why people are adding the tie
hockey cap sets to their keyboards is to
add another color element to their
keyboard now me personally I put that
green tie hair over a ski cap set on the
Joker
keyboard and it just looks absolutely
sick it just ties everything together
for me it's got the green it's got the
blue it's got the pink it's got the
purple everything that the Joker is
known for the problem that people have
been running into is them not lasting
people are noticing that the grippy
nature of the key cap set does wear down
over time and they also collect
a lot of dirt so what you can do is use
some dishwashing detergent and wash them
do not use alcohol because it will break
down the rubber trust me I'm actually a
scientist and another question I go with
the tie hockey cap sets is doesn't make
a difference for gaming well I think it
depends if you have very very sweaty
hands it will make a huge difference for
you okay if you don't if you're like a
medium sweater kind of like I am you
like sweat normally I think you'll be
okay with the normal ki cap sets some
people also don't like typing on the
left hand with the grips and then on the
right hand you're not gonna have grips
so it's a little bit different when
typing but for me it doesn't really
matter I'm gaming most of the time and
editing most of the time so I usually
just have one hand on the keyboard
mostly at all times so the rubber ASCII
caps are not gonna make you play better
but they will help you get a grip on
your keyboard see what I did there man I
was bad man I gotta work on my jokes man
so the taiyaki cap stats are only going
to cover the 1 through 6 the Q through
are the A through F and they're also
gonna have some arrow keys in there if
you want to put it like let's say you
have a 65% keyboard or a tkl or a
full-size keyboard you can also put them
on your arrow keys personally guys I do
think that the tie hockey cap sets are
worth it for $20 keep in mind that you
have to clean them the right way with
some dishwashing detergent and most
likely you're gonna have to replace them
at some point in time so just keep that
in mind just like when you use like a
playstation controller and you're using
the joysticks over and over and over
again yeah they get worn down so this is
no different these are rubber but yeah
at the end of the day they're still
gonna be worth it in my opinion
alright guys so that is gonna do it for
this video I hope you guys have enjoyed
this video it has been your boy bt don't
