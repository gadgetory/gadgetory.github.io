another review today we are going to be
looking at the Bowens and Wilkins px
over ear noise cancellation headphones a
lot of you guys in the comments have
been asking for these so I finally
decided to pick them up now they're
coming in at a whopping 400 dollars so
as time has gone on I feel like
headphones have been getting more and
more expensive but that's because the
technology that they're putting into
these headphones is getting better at
the same time they're coming out with
more apps so you can customize your
experience whether that's bass or mints
or highs whatever you like companies are
doing that now they're are giving you
more control over that noise
cancellation as time goes on so it kind
of warrants this $400 price or does it
so with the Bowens and wilkins p x's i
really wanted to look at is is worth
$400 are they giving you enough bang for
your buck so today we're going to get
into all of that
in the box you'll find the headphones a
USBC connector that's right USBC not USB
be a 2.5 millimeter jack and a back now
this bag is quilted it feels pretty nice
in the hand now as you guys know I love
that vintage look that these have they
have that gold accents with the
ballistic nylon blue material that just
looks amazing it's very durable and I
really really enjoy the look of these
headphones I even think these look more
stylish than the beats I got stopped a
lot on the street when I wore the P X's
as opposed to the studio threes on the
right ear cup you're gonna find the
volume rocker with a press play pause
button and this button is raised which I
really like it's very easy to discern
which button you're pressing unlike some
other ones where it's kind of like
flattened or it's indented and it just
doesn't really help you out also you'll
find a noise cancellation button as well
as the power slider and pairing button
so one thing when I first picked up
these headphones I looked on Amazon as I
always do and look at reviews at what
people are saying and I saw that a lot
of people are saying that they're
uncomfortable but I beg to differ
these give you a super close back
experience because of the way that your
cup is formed it's super stiff around
the ear cup not so much plush like
something you would find in a Sony
headphone where it kind of molds to your
face these are actually kind of hard
which gives you that oval seal and it
gives you a nice bass response
now what's crazy is these do not create
any jaw or head fatigue when we're in
the for a long period of time when I was
at the gym it actually was very very
nice I didn't have to take them off or
they didn't get really warm it was nice
having that oval shape of the ear cup
that's very stiff without it molding
onto your face creating heat so as you
could imagine less surface area with the
headphones less heat but one thing I did
notice that the gym is that the swivel
design of the hinges they would come off
when I would lay down on a bench or
doing a workout so keep that in mind
they're great for every other workout
just not
chest or shoulder workout another really
cool feature that these have is that you
can lay these down on your shirt or take
one ear cup off and this will pause your
music so that's really cool if you're at
the gym or somebody needs to talk to you
you can easily just take them off and be
able to talk to people
one thing that I've really realized with
these headphones is that there are
varying degrees of clothes backed
there's like the Sony that bows which
they kind of go on your head but very
lightly and then there's these which is
more on the extreme cup to almost
suction type ear cups which would really
give you a greater bass response so
you're gonna get that resonance you're
gonna get that soundstage that intimate
experience that you won't get with Sony
or Bose sometimes it kind of feels like
the sound is leaking out whereas these
everything is just captured within your
ear it's simply incredible just from
that I feel like they increase the sound
quality a lot these are absolutely
amazing for rap EDM and anything that is
very base reliant because of the closed
back design but also they sound very
good with classical piano like it just
sends chills down my spine it is simply
amazing and I love listening to all
genres with these headphones I mean I
can listen to jazz one minute
rock one minute and it just all gives me
this experience that I haven't found
really with other headphones that close
back really really close back design so
a very good job Bowen and Wilkins now
also bones of Wilkins is saying that
these have an angle driver which gives
you more soundstage and I agree these
have amazing soundstage you will not be
disappointed if you are into soundstage
let me tell you that if you love
instrumentals if you love just great
produced tracks you will love these
headphones these aren't as detailed as
something like the a th's that I just
reviewed check it out if you haven't but
they are more detailed than Sony Bose
and anybody else you can think of that
I've tried I would go as far as to say
that these have a some of the best sound
just detail why it also up scales all
your music to 768 Hertz which is just
giving you more information it doesn't
sound artificial it sounds very full and
rich compared to listening to the same
track on like some Sony's or Bose so
really good job on the detail with these
just all-around great set
now the noise cancellation is good it's
not great it's not bose it's not sony
what I think helps it is that close back
design it gives you a very nice seal
already and then you throw in a little
bit of noise cancellation in there and
it just works very very well now you can
control the noise cancellation in the
app you can do a city mode a flight mode
or in office mode depending on where you
are and it's supposed to give you a
tailored experience I used multiple in
different situations and they sounded
pretty much the same across the board
you can also change the variance of how
much you want it to block out which is
very nice I do however wish that they
would have added something that lets you
tailor the sound profiles that's just
something that headphones nowadays can't
get away with if you're gonna charge
$400 you need to have some of these
basic things like sound profiles and
having an EQ in the actual app there's
no excuse me
now when they say 22 hours that is very
very good I've gotten 22 hours with
these but what I also like about these
headphones is as soon as you take them
off or they're on standby mode or when
you put them laying down in your chest
or in standby mode so you're getting
longer battery life you're not just
saying okay turn them on now I have 22
hours it's like no you're getting 22
hours plus some and I was able to just
like put these to the side one day I
forgot that I even had them turned on
and I came back and there were still 50%
so a really good job on the battery life
the connection also has been rock solid
for me I've had no problems with it
it has aptX Bluetooth technology which
really helps with the sound quality when
you're listening to like an Android
device or an experience things that can
transfer those high-quality bitter ease
the call quality is also really good
there's no muffled miss there's no
feedback from you talking into the mics
which is very very nice something that
like the beats really suffered from is
that problem and these do not have it so
the big question is are these worth
three hundred and ninety nine dollars
four hundred dollars the simple answer
is yes I have been enjoying these
headphones day in and day out I've used
them for gaming I've use them at the gym
they're great in all different settings
and that's one thing that I really try
to stress is if you're gonna buy a set
of headphones I like for them to work in
multiple situations not just one the P
X's give you a ton of options when it
comes to noise cancellation and give you
that close back design around the ear
cups really helps to immerse you into
your music so if you like to get lost
these are gonna be for you the clothes
back design of the P X's is like nothing
I've tried on the market today Sony Bose
and nothing
none of them get this good of a seal on
your ear to keep out noises and to put
you into your own world so I think that
that is worth the $400 if you can spend
it if you have that extra money go ahead
and just go all out
treat yourself alright guys so that is
gonna be my review thank you guys for
