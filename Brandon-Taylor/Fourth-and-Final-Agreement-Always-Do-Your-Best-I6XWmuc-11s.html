the 4th agreement as you can see we're
not in my car today we're in my backyard
thought I do end off the four agreements
and a more common place anyways this
agreement is one of my favorites because
it gets rid of that in a critic that we
all have that inner judge that gets on
ourselves for any little thing that we
do wrong or not doing perfectly right
nobody's perfect and this agreement is
to always take do your best now we may
not be always compatible with our word
we might not always be not able to take
things personally and we might not
always be able to realize that we're
making assumptions but we can do is do
our best and when you catch yourself you
know sprit may be spreading poison or
talking about somebody you catch
yourself and be like look I said that I
was going to be in pet bull with my word
and not go against anybody because I
hurt myself and then you change it right
you're doing your best you know these
are all old habits that we all have and
they're hard to get rid of I not always
be able to not take things personally
and you might not always be able to
realize that you're making assumptions
but what you can do is do your best to
catch yourself you may oh man this
person doesn't like me you're making an
assumption but then you catch yourself
like wait a minute how do I know that I
can't read minds do I really know that
they don't like me do I really know and
then you move on from there you know a
lot of the times we catch ourselves
doing things and we get on ourselves
like why are you not perfect you know
you said you were going to do this right
these are all voices that we've heard
before
why aren't you the at this point of your
job why aren't you this point in your
diet or right or to looking why's your
body look the way that you imagined it
to be you know sound familiar these are
all things that we all go through it's
not just you out there I go through to I
had a bad workout this week and I got to
the end of the world I was like you know
what I have to just do my best right now
that's the best I can do even even if
it's not I know that I can do better
right now this is the current situation
I'm gonna do my best to make the best
out of the situation you know I was
feeling down I was just not into it I
couldn't get into my workout people were
all my machines and you know really got
to me and I did my best to get the best
workout that I could you know if you
mess up on your diet a lot of people
they get out there that critic gets on
them after they eat a burger what does
it do it makes them feel bad so then
what do they go do the eight more
burgers say and give up instead of
saying this is an isolated incident this
is what we're going to do now and I'm
going to do my best to stay on track you
know you do your best you may see a
freakin advertisement for McDonald's on
TV and or you may see a yellow and red
in and out signing maybe I am I really
want that burger you know the marketing
gets to you right you did your best to
resist it you did your best you know you
did your best and sometimes we do things
and we wake up and I'll crop i just ate
that burger I didn't want to do that you
know but we're all human right so you
allow yourself to be a human at the end
of the day if you guys have watched all
of the four agreements I thank you from
the bottom of my heart and even if you
haven't go back and watch the other ones
there's some good information in there I
hope that my hope is to for all of us to
get better just as as people as humans
as hell
each other out being a community well
you know realize we all want the best
for each other and the best for
ourselves so go out there use these four
agreements see if it doesn't change your
life and always do your best you know
whether it be in the gym the diet your
friendships your family always just do
your best make time whatever you gotta
do to make sure you're doing your best
and when you're do your best your best
is going to become
