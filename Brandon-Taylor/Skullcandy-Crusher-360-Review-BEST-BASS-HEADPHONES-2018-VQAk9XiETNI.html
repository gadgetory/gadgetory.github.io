i test a lot of headphones here a lot of
headphones come through my review table
you know they all start to sound kind of
similar there's few standouts
you know maybe they hear some like bumps
in the base or the mids or the highs
but for the most part they almost sound
very similar and then a headphone comes
along and changes all of that it just
blows everything out of the water
not with the best audiophile quality but
with a characteristic that will set it
apart from every other headphone on the
market which I love and the headphones
I'm talking about are the crusher 360s
from Skull Candy these things blew me
away from the moment that I put them on
guys there's clarity
there's bass but let me not get too much
into the review right now let's start
off with a comfort and design now in the
past school candy has been subject to a
lot a lot of criticism about their build
quality but guys throw that out the
window for $300 they've stepped up their
game big-time with these headphones the
hinges don't creak whatsoever the
leather is some of the best leather I've
ever felt on any headphone including the
bose qc25 these things are super
comfortable the headband up top is just
nicely padded the headband up top is
also super comfortable I love wearing
these for extended periods of time they
came out with this limited edition
colorway and I just think it looks
gorgeous they have minimal branding the
skull isn't white and big all up in your
face like some other brands it's matte
and it's very tasteful it also comes
with a case a 3.5 millimeter jack and
also a USB charger on the left there is
a base slider and it is touch sensitive
which I really really like you slide it
up and it gives you a purple indication
of how much of the base is being boosted
on the right side you have the controls
with the plus and the minus in the
actual shape of them so you can find
them a lot easier when you're like
working out or even just commuting or
just everyday use it's just so much
better than the
a three-button system that is normally
put on any other headphone they've got a
nice solid feel to them the build
quality on these Skullcandy I have to
applaud to you you guys really step it
up with these headphones the battery
life is gonna be rated at 29 hours which
is in line with what a lot of companies
are doing right now sony is around 30
it's actually nine hours better than
bose at only 20 hours for them so 29
hours of solid battery life that's not
rapid charge for those of us who always
forget to charge their headphones like
me 10 minutes will give you 3 hours
these also have bluetooth 4.1 so before
we talk about the bass let's get into
how the mic sounds let me drop a little
test for you guys right now so like I
said before the beginning guys these
make you want to dig deep into your
musical catalogue I was going back and
listening to like Tupac biggie uh sure
yeah things with a lot of bass to really
bring out the sound signature of these
headphones and sometimes the bass would
be overwhelming too much where the song
would be too layered but what I love
about these headphones samosas that they
keep the integrity of the song and the
image of the song you can get a clearer
image of the song while getting that
bass response that is just mmm it's so
delicious guys it's almost like you're
riding in a lowrider with subs in the
back these are just Wow for me it
brought back memories of just riding
around in high school blasting my music
and having my friend with subs just
blast my here's a sub bass and these do
the same exact thing and I really love
that about these headphones you know
headphones are an emotional thing they
make you feel and these make you feel
literally you know by vibrating your
head and it also brings back that
feeling of you know nostalgia like going
back and listening for those old songs
and these just aren't a one-trick pony
guys it doesn't just do bass and rap in
EDM really well it does classical very
good as well you just turn down that
bass ladder to maybe like one or two
clicks and like everything just sounds
super clear I mean I have no complaints
about the sound signature here highs are
nice and rolled off they are a little
recessed but not so much
that you feel like it's clipping or it's
taking away from your music even
classical sounds good on these
headphones while you're listening to
rock music
strumming like basses and guitar strings
are just resonating and vibrating on
your head you feel like you are in a 360
environment at a concert just music just
enveloping you and that is the best way
to describe these headphones I am just
so mind blown I took these to a party
recently and was showing these to people
and just letting them hear certain songs
with them and everybody was blown away
by them they were asking like how much
do these costs where can I get them I
want to buy them these things are just
an amazing set of cans guising you
really have to listen and hear them to
believe what I'm saying I mean I sound
super hyped up I sound super excited but
guys when do I ever sound like this when
do I ever just say guys these are a
must-have because they are just so
different if I could add anything to
this headphones it would be noise
cancellation but sometimes noise
cancellation does get in the way of your
musical experience and these actually do
do a great job of just forming around
your ear with that nice memory foam and
blocking and isolating out a ton of
sound so it's not really a problem and
with that bass I mean nothing is getting
through come on and that's just me being
nitpicky but we'll see maybe in the 360
twos they'll come out with that but
until then these are an amazing set of
cans and I can recommend them to you
guys wholeheartedly without a doubt when
you put them on when you listen to them
when you show your friends and family
they will be blown away I guaranteed
these are gonna be an amazing set of
cans for this holiday season if you want
to give them out yeah Wow
I'm just skull candy thank you for
sending these out of course all these
opinions are my own they've been my own
you guys know that I keep it real with
you I never want you guys to go out and
get a pair of headphones and say bTW
these aren't what you said they were I
don't want to be that guy so you know
that I'm giving you the real deal the
lowdown on these headphones they're an
amazing set so go out and cop them if
you're a bass lover EDM lover to
classical music I think these can be a
headphone for everyone alright guys so
