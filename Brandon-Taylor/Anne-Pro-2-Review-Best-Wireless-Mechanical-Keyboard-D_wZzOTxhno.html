is a review of the ant pro 2 it is
finally here this thing has been highly
requested all over my Twitter all over
my Instagram all over my youtube
comments in every video hey check out
the am pro - hey check out the am pro -
hey check out the am pro - I even think
I saw somebody's mom in the comments
saying hey Brandon check out the am Pro
- what are you doing you idiot so here
we are today we're checking it out I'm
gonna give you my thoughts on this 60%
keyboard and all of its features and let
you guys know the scoop do I think this
thing is as amazing as people are making
it out to be find out today and more but
don't forget to subscribe because there
is gonna be a giveaway on one of these
keyboards with some custom keycaps I'm
gonna build it myself and ship it out to
one of you lucky subs so make sure you
are subscribed because you don't want to
miss that so upon opening the box I
thought I'd done good because the box
was white so I was like did i order the
white one well I don't remember maybe I
did on accident I don't know well I
didn't because there is a black keyboard
inside and this thing is gorgeous and
we'll get into more the design a little
bit later but also in the box they've
included some colorful key caps some
teal pink yellow and purple key caps and
I think this just gives an added
customization and a special look to the
keyboard they're also adding in a USBC
cord and a key cap puller upon
inspecting the keyboard this thing is
very slanted it is a nice weight though
it's not too heavy and it's not too
light I think it is actually the perfect
weight on the back side of the keyboard
you're gonna find the USB C port and
this thing is a little bit finicky
because you it has to be plugged in the
right way some devices don't care which
way you plug in the USB C but this one
does I thought I got like a broken
keyboard because I plugged it in and I
was typing on it and nothing was popping
up so yeah make sure you plug it in the
right way if it doesn't work the first
time swish the plug and it should work
so on the back side you're gonna find an
on/off switch for the Bluetooth
capabilities so the keyboard itself
doesn't have any keyboard feet per se
there's no flipping up like a ducky
keyboard
one size fits all it's very slanted but
I actually like the incline on this
keyboard it's very nice it's somewhere
in the middle it's in the middle so it's
not gonna offend anybody by going too
high it's not gonna be too low and
offend people that like their keyboard
high it is just a very neutral like
slant so I really like that about this
keyboard the key caps themselves are PBT
double shot which are some of my
favorites these things are very durable
and won't get that nasty shine on them
so I'm a big fan of PBT and they've
added it in on this keyboard so one
thing that I really enjoyed about this
keyboard was the software now opens
provides a software where you can like
update the firmware control the RGB so
if you have like a custom look for your
setup you can actually choose your color
palettes and things like that and set up
your computer and keyboard to look the
same which is nice you can also download
like rainbow effects and breathing
effects and waves and all those kind of
things so it is really cool that they
give you a lot of flexibility with this
keyboard they've also added in a
keystroke assignment as well that you
can download to your actual keyboard and
this is way simpler than the mesh drop
control or ducky macro system so what
you have to do is click on the key and
then select what multimedia or whatever
functionality you want on that layer and
then you just download it to your actual
keyboard and you guys know me I like my
multimedia keys because I listen to a
lot of music so I like having that
control like while I'm in game I don't
have to close out of my game and then
pause the music and things like that so
what I did is I assign the multimedia
keys to the bottom rows of the keyboard
for like volume and like skipping tracks
because that is one thing that I really
miss going from like a 10 key list or a
full-size keyboard is those multimedia
scroll wheels and things like that we
all missed those arrow keys so what you
can do is hold down the function key and
then hit wast WASD and that is your
arrow keys so that's kind of nice that
you don't have to really like move your
hand over to JK and L it is just right
there it's already programmed and ready
to go they also have added in this
really really cool feature that I think
separates it from the ducky and the
master lock control even though the
master drop control already has like
arrow keys it is really cool that
they've added in this tapping feature so
all you have to do is tap
function one function two and control
those are your arrow keys and it
functions just like your arrow keys so
if you tap it it's actually just gonna
make it act like an arrow key right
that's crazy
that is simply amazing it's genius I
accidentally stumbled across this
because I was just tapping it out of
habit I went to go tap the arrow keys
and it was working and I was like wait
what's going on because I was doing like
a typing document and I needed to go
back and like edit a word and I was like
wait why is this working there's no
arrow keys on this I'm just tapping and
I'm like oh this thing actually works as
arrow keys and I lifted up a line and
sure enough that's the way they
programmed it to work so it is simply
amazing that is one thing that can
really help those people who are trying
to decide do I want to go from a ten
keyless or full-size keyboard down to a
60% keyboard this makes the transition
that much easier so moving on to the
switches they come with gate Iran like
red blue and brown and also Kaleo box
white and Kaleo box brown now these are
a different type than the Cherry MX that
we are all used to so this is my first
time using gate Iran and I think I'm
seeing it wrong don't kill me in the
comments if I'm not saying it right but
I think that's how you say it Gator on
gate Gator on yeah we'll go with that
so the gate Iran feels a little bit
different than the Cherry MX red which
is what I got I got the Gator on Red's
it feels slightly different I really
can't put my finger on it or it's just a
mental thing for me but it feels a
little bit different not bad but
different now the spacebar and the shift
and the inner keys those stabilizers on
those are really really nice it makes
the keyboard feel very very premium
because there's no wiggle on these
there's barely any wiggle on them and a
lot of cheap keyboards they have crappy
stabilizers so it's really cool that on
this like Sony $5 keyboard they've added
in some great great stabilizers and
features onto it one thing that I didn't
notice is that out of the box the
spacebar was a little bit soft it felt
like I was pressing it into a pillow but
after a while after I broke it in a
little bit it became a lot like the
other keys on the keyboard so enough
talking guys let's get on with a typing
alright I'm not gonna do it this time
I'm not gonna do the aw yeah I'm not
doing that nope mm-hmm no you guys can't
decide this time for yourselves whether
it sounds good okay before I forget in
the software they actually have a macro
system as well so you can actually like
go through and create some keystroke
assignments so for like programs like
Premiere Pro which I use a lot I can
actually go in and have the like certain
keystrokes for my editing to make
everything a little bit faster the
Bluetooth is easy to control you just
hold down the function key and one two
or three or four and you can connect up
to like four devices which is nice
pairing was super easy and I got no
interruptions while using the keyboard
in Wireless mode I even put my phone in
between my computer and the actual
keyboard and I got no interference it
was very strong because it's using
Bluetooth 4.0 and what I like about this
keyboard is that it gives you that
minimal look there's less cables on your
desk so if you want to run like a
wireless mouse like the G 903 and this
keyboard it's nice to just have a clean
desk with no wires you don't have to
drill through your desk and all this
crazy stuff just to hide your wires this
thing has no wires necessary the battery
life is coming in at eight hours and
that's about what I've been getting you
can actually turn it off or put it in
low-power mode when it's not being used
to control the RGB mode all you have to
do is hit the function key and then hit
the number on the top I think it's nine
zero and also the dash button at the top
controls the brightness one thing I did
notice is that if you want to use a
software it can't be connected via
bluetooth you have to actually go in and
plug in the USB C to actually use the
software so that's one thing to think
about and after you turn off the
keyboard and turn it back on you have to
go in and change the mode of the RGB
back on to what you had it it doesn't
actually save it although it does save
all your keystrokes and things like that
if you want to take it to a friend's
house so that's nice so other than that
I can't really find any flaws with this
keyboard this keyboard is actually
really amazing and I think it might have
a permanent place on my desk but that is
a point for another video I'm gonna be
doing a mass drop versus ducky versus an
Pro two plus another another one I'm
gonna add in another keyboard another
60% keyboard can you guys guess what it
is
take a guess down below and let me know
what you guys think it is alright guys

the amp pro 2 this keyboard is simply
amazing

videos are sponsored they're sponsored
by me because I have to pay and buy all
this so yeah I'm giving you guys the
real deal on these products this is an
amazing keyboard especially with that
bluetooth capability gives your desk
that minimal looking setup that is just
so so so nice alright guys so don't
