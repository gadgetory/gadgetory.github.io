with another battle today we have a
battle that has been highly requested by
you guys and that is the battle between
the two heavyweights of the noise
cancellation world the sony WH 1000 XM
3s and the Bose QuietComfort 35 bose has
been at the top of the noise
cancellation headphones game for years
now but Sony has been making great
strides year after year
so has Bose finally been dethroned find
out today but before we begin guys don't
forget to hit that subscribe button
subscribe to the channel it really helps
me get more and more content out to you
guys because I mean who doesn't like
content alright both of these headphones
are coming in at $350 which is what most
companies are asking for for this type
of noise cancellation headphones this
year Sony has made great strides to make
their headphones lighter and more
comfortable which is greatly appreciated
the ear cups are now as big as the both
QC 35 which is one of the things that
really made Bose more comfortable than
any other headphone even after all of
this bow still takes the cake with this
lightness the QC 35 just disappear on
your head they also have nice touches on
the headband with the Alcantara material
which is the same material that's used
on like high-end yachts and Porsches and
for that reason the Bose QuietComfort
live up to their name and they take the
comfort round when it comes to design
those sony has been pushing the limits
whether it's with their touch control
system for volume and media control but
then they took it even further and gave
us motion detection where you can hold
your hand over your right ear cup for
quick attention temporarily suspending
play of your music so you can hear
you're outside surrounding bows on the
other hand has kept it simple and has
stuck with a three button system which
does have some advantages believe it or
not such as when you're sleeping off
with them on or things like that the
buttons will stay out of your way
whereas on the touch controls you can
mistakenly hit them when you're in your
sleep sony has also given us a USBC
charger which gives us a lot of benefit
over the USB charger
the Bose one of which is the ability to
quick charge super fast so for the
design round I have to give it to the
Sony's they design the crap out of the
1000 x m3 sound is one of those
subjective topics so I'll try to explain
this the best I can
Bose tries to appeal to the masses with
a rich and neutral sounding headphones
they have also built in an EQ which
levels out your music no matter what
volume you're at with that being said it
goes well with all John rules of music
but it doesn't really do anything
exceptionally well sony on the other
hand has taken a different approach with
their app they let you dictate how you
want your music to sound you can add
more lows mints or highs to your liking
and if you're willing to put in the time
and mess around with these settings you
can find the best settings to suit your
musical tastes the bass on the 1000 X
and 3 so it's really good and isn't as
muddy as last year's version it's a nice
rich and clean bass that I know a lot of
you guys will love for the sound round I
have to give the Sony that EQ just can't
be beat it will go great with everything
whether you're a classical lover to rap
or even heavy metal the Sony's will do
it all for you
Bose has been the leader in noise
cancellation for as long as I can
remember but things are changing
nowadays I see more and more people on
my flights wearing Sony's whereas before
it used to be all Bose and this year
Sony definitely tops out the QC 35 with
their new cute in one chip I have found
it does a great job of blocking lows and
high frequencies whereas Bose only
blocks out those low humming frequencies
like engine noise Sony also lets you
control what sound you want to hear from
the outside whether that's only voices
or maybe you need to hear your
surroundings while you're walking or you
want to let in car noise or bus noises
while commuting sony has given you the
complete power here so for this round
Bose I'm sorry you've lost your crown
finally when it comes to connection
though the Sony 1000 X's are far
superior giving you L deck and apt X and
many more codecs whereas Bose is just
giving you a AC and SBC to the lowest
bitrate codecs
I found the AAC and SBC least to some
lagging while watching youtube videos
and because of the low bandwidth and
with the Sony's you never have to worry
about that when you're using Elle Decor
aptX
HD so for all you Android out users out
there you will be getting the best sound
quality with the best connection for you
iPhone users Apple has kind of shunned
you and shun the aptX technology in
favor of its AAC technology which just
isn't as good plain and simple this
round has to go to the 1000 xm3 is they
have the better codecs leading to a
better and more stable connection and
just overall better sound quality call
quality has always been bows a strong
point and Sony's weak point but Sony has
made a lot of improvements this year and
they actually are usable for calls now
even with these great strides I still
have to give the call quality the bose
battery life is also better on the
sony's coming in at 30 hours whereas the
quiet comfort zone lis have 20 hours
come on bose you got to step it up to
take it even further now the USBC on the
Sony's will give you 10 minutes of
charging for five hours of playback the
Bose on the other hand for 15 minutes of
charging will only give you two and a
quarter hours of playback so for this
round I have to give it to Sony again in
conclusion guys Bose has slightly better
comfort and call quality and Sony is
catching up in both of these areas year
by year in all other areas including two
of the most important categories sound
and noise cancellation the Sony's are
just in a whole nother league now
so my recommendation is that you grab
the 1003 is do yourself a favor as they
are my top pick right now for noise
cancellation headphones trust me you
won't be disappointed alright guys so
that is my time don't forget to Like
share and comment on this video if you
enjoyed it it has been your boy beat
and IM sayin peace i'll see in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
