first I am changing my music streaming
service but for a good reason so as you
guys know I read all of your guys's
comments and one of the comments said
and I quote what the hell are you
listening to your music on Spotify if
you're concerned with having the best
quality possible-- why aren't you on
title you stupid so I said you know what
maybe he's right maybe this person is
right so what did I do
I went on title I got myself a 30-day
free trial to try it out because their
service is $20 a month you heard it
right
$20 a month whereas Spotify is about $10
a month I'm actually on a family plan
with some friends and it's only two
dollars a month for me which is insanely
good so that's why I've kind of been
sticking with Spotify but here are the
reasons why I'm going to be switching
over to title for now and the near
future until maybe Spotify hi-fi comes
out so my main concern with title when
it came out was doesn't have enough
tracks and apparently it does apparently
has forty eight point five million songs
in their library which is insane and the
big reason why I'm switching is because
of the hi-fi high definition
lossless CD streaming quality not mp3
because when you listen to mp3 music
they take out a lot of the information
to make the file smaller frequencies and
information that they think that you
can't hear so lossless has a lot more of
this information in the file so it's
pretty cool that they're streaming these
flat files over to you so high quality
music on Spotify is only at 320 kbps
whereas on title it is 1411 kbps now
that is almost four times the amount as
you can imagine this has a lot more
information the bitrate is way higher
which leads to better transfer rates and
better sound quality so what did I do to
really test this out I didn't want to
just blindly say oh this is just they
say it's better so I'm just going to
accept that and just cancel Spotify
so did I do I had title and I had
Spotify open and I listened to them
back-to-back to really see what the main
differences were and for me it mainly
came down to the bass and the warmth and
just the mid tones and a little bit more
clarity it didn't have this haziness on
the music that sometimes you get with
Spotify and I really enjoyed it I
enjoyed it on my macbook on my desktop
PC and my iPhone and my galaxy s7 all of
which were great cool just to be able to
have these hi-5 files in my pocket that
I could just stream I don't have to go
and download a ton of flack files like I
was to really get that high quality I
could just stream it and I can have a
big library at my disposal now they also
have entitled music videos and
exclusives and things like that which is
really nice I do I did find myself
watching more music videos because I had
the streaming service why not it's right
there the one thing that I do miss about
Spotify is the playlists and this is one
reason why I never switched over to
Apple music and that is because you
can't listen to other users playlists I
don't know if this is a feature that I
just haven't found in title but they
have these curated playlists from
artists from industry people that kind
of know the music and make these
playlists for you which are better than
Apple musics in my opinion because the
Apple music playlists are super old and
outdated they didn't feel very fresh and
these on title feel very fresh they have
new music and that's what I'm about
finding new music I love finding new
artists that are up and coming that
sometimes are better than some of the
mainstream artists that are out now
title makes it very easy to navigate and
explore and find these new artists which
I really enjoy so they don't have the
user playlists but they do have
playlists that I actually use saving
your music is easy saving albums and
obviously you can download music onto
your phone which is great for when
you're traveling or not gonna have the
most ideal connection to internet or a
network connection on your phone so
that's really cool so after my trial
gonna be sticking with title because all
of my headphones the Audis LCD to the
fostex
zero zeros the Sennheiser five nine AIDS
even these all are benefiting from this
lossless streaming high-definition music
now I'm running all of these through my
deck I know a lot of you guys ask what
kind of deck I use I use a chord mojo
deck it's a deck amp actually and it
boosts your music up and it powers your
headphones that are really underpowered
because most computers and back books
are kind of underpowered when it comes
to that so that is what I use and these
all my headphones are just benefiting
greatly there's a lot more clarity and
bass is very clean I just like it I'm
just enjoying it right now a lot I'm
going back and I'm listening to a lot of
music that I love alright guys so that
is my time I hope you guys have enjoyed
this video let me know down the comments
below what do you stream with you
download your music are you listening to
Apple music Spotify are you on tidal
let me know down the comments below what
you used and I will see you guys in the
next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
