another motivational Monday and if you
haven't noticed it is now tuesday
tuesday night to be exact when I'm
filming this and I did that for a reason
because tomorrow is a big day for me
tomorrow I signed the papers for my new
apartment and I move in this weekend it
all happened within this past week it's
been a crazy roller coaster of emotions
and it got me thinking why is it so hard
to change why is changing our
circumstances or our life or
characteristics or things like that so
hard why do we always revert back to the
old self why is it so hard for us to
leave the oldest behind and become all
that we can be why it seems like an easy
choice right it's not it's not and this
is what I have noticed coming up within
myself this week and that is although
this change is amazing it's great for my
life I still feel scared and I'm going
to tell you guys why I think that is
because change is a two-sided coin on
one side of that coin you're going to
have all this progression you're going
to have success you're going to create
new great situations and opportunities
for yourself but on the other side of
that coin this is what gets us to stop
is that they're suffering that comes
with it there's always suffering it's
that yen in that yang there's always
good in the bad and that's all right you
need that balance but just realize it's
like if you were to become a manager at
your job your current job and then all
of a sudden now you have to deal with
payroll you have to deal with scheduling
break you have to deal with inventory
you have to deal with employees fighting
with each other mediating you have to
plan
for the group you have all these new
responsibilities and you say wait wait a
minute why why did I sign up for this
why didn't I just stay a regular
employee and I believe that is because
we want to progress and once we get
there we know that we're going to have
to suffer so what's going to happen
we're going to progress and then there's
going to be the suffering that comes
with it and guess well we're going to
get used to that suffering we're going
to become better and then you're going
to progress some more and then guess
what that next level there's going to be
more suffering there's going to be new
suffering there you're going to have to
deal with and on and on and on it never
stops so don't let that stop you it's
always going to be there as long as
you're trying to do something great
there's always going to be suffering and
that's okay that's just a part of life
but in turn you're going to gain so much
success and you're going to gain so much
as a person as an individual you're
going to become better more valuable
your self-esteem is going to go up your
confidence is going to go through the
roof so don't let that other side of the
coin stop you I'm having to work
overtime at my job I'm having to move
into a new apartment my girlfriend's
birthday is tomorrow my birthday is on
Sunday and I am supposed to be moving in
on Saturday and going out Saturday for
my birthday so it's a lot and it has
stressed me out but I know that I'm
going to grow from this stress stress is
not the stress is not the enemy it's
thinking that we shouldn't be stressed
that's what gets us more stressed if
you've seen some of my older videos
where I talk about anxiety and stress
and how that stress helps you rise to
the occasion to get done that if
you were just relaxed if I was just
relaxed right now that I thought life
was great I wouldn't be trying to make
the best of the situation I'll tell you
that right now we've all been there
we've all had that anxiety that has in
turn been a positive for us where we saw
something where we normally wouldn't see
it so guys if you guys are trying to do
something great with your life if you're
trying to succeed make yourself
uncomfortable own that suffering say
look I'm at this level I'm owning it
that is my suffering and you know what
I'm going to become better because of it
so take that and go out and kill this
week I'm kind of having nostalgia as
this is probably the last motivational
Monday in this room ever so I'm a little
it's a little bittersweet but I just
want to say thank you guys for keeping
up with this series I really appreciate
it it's going to be weird let me know
what you guys think of the next place
that I'm at so I will be doing an
apartment tour probably a setup tour as
well and once i get everything settled
and you guys will be the first to see
the finished product I promise so stay
tuned for that I should have a review
coming out this week I'm gonna work my
you-know-what off to get that out for
you guys alright so thank you guys for
watching and I will see you guys in the
next video
