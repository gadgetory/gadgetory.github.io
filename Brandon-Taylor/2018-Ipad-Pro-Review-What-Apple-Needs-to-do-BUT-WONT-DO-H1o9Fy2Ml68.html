special report and we can charge you
more money so with the new iPhone X you
can make pictures but the difference
between the iPhone X and the 7 + 6 is
that we can charge you 10 times more so
I'm going broke trying to buy a cell
phone well we've become a trillion
dollar company so make sure I can't pay
this one make sure you can't put
groceries on the table make sure what's
up guys is BT here and this is a review
of the 2018 Apple iPad pro me personally
I held off on picking up an iPad pro for
this new revision and boy did Apple
deliver on the new design but there is
some caveats to this otherwise perfect
piece of tech which we'll get into later
today
coming in at $199 for the base model of
64 gigabytes of storage going all the
way up to 1750 for a terabyte of storage
on the iPad pro you can get these with
LTE but I just like to run a hotspot for
my phone to cut down the phone bill but
that's just me you can do whatever the
you want to do the new design has the
squared off edges which makes it feel
like you're holding a 12-point 9 inch
iPhone 5 which people miss dearly for me
this device is very comfortable to hold
with its edges although if you try to
one-hand this device this thing starts
to get a little bit top-heavy with the
12 point 9 version I would really
suggest 11 inch version for one
and things like that I don't think you
need to 12.9 you kind of have to cradle
it like a little baby Apple says this is
an edge-to-edge display on their website
but it's not edge to edge more like an
edge to bezel but I actually like that
it has a bezel so that you don't
mistakenly hit the edges and register
touches on the edges at the top you'll
find a magnetic strip which holds the
Apple pen and charges it which is nice
this year also change this year is the
addition of a USB C port this is greatly
appreciated as now you can add hubs
which can bring back the headphone jack
that they took away from us how could
you Apple I use mostly bluetooth
headphones as you guys may know so
taking the headphone jack isn't really
an issue for me but it can't be for some
pros who want to use this as a music
mastering device I have a new audio
technica m50x bluetooth Edition review
out on the channel now for you music
masters out there is that a word masters
yeah we'll go with it the 2732 by 2048
pixel 264 PPI screen looks gorgeous
it looks like the icons on the screen
are just straight popping out at you
I've never really seen the screen that
ever really comes close to what Apple
puts out its vibrant its color accurate
for you photo editors out there or
Skechers the new 8 core a 12 X processor
is a straight beast there's no lag
anywhere to be found ladies and
gentlemen opening multiple applications
sees no lag when I move the slider on
there new redesigned Lightroom for iPad
I get instant edits to my photos there's
no lag in between my changes and the
photos which I love it gets like right
on the dock gamyeon this device is just
simply amazing from the amazing screen
to the new a 12 X it has anything that
you throw at it with ease the speaker
sound great there bassy and clear for
media consumption now at this point in
the review you may be thinking this all
sounds great too great in fact there has
to be a catch
there is and this is the main point of
my findings on the iPad pro it's an
amazing device top to bottom but what
kills it is Apple's reluctancy to make a
dedicated operating system for their
tablets this machine is just too
powerful to be running just iOS it needs
like a Mac OS s sort of like what
Microsoft is offering give us the choice
to make this more like a computer than a
tablet and the iPad pro would be in
touchable it would pretty much kill off
the MacBook Air oh wait
that is the point Apple needs to
separate these two devices with the
addition of a smart folio keyboard and
an operating system
it would eliminate the need for a
MacBook Air think about it if you get a
fast device with touch end of the
MacBook Air and possibly some users from
the MacBook Pro as well
so I believe Apple is waiting a couple
of generations before they combine these
two devices but that would mean the end
of one or more lines which I don't think
that they're ready to do quite yet so
until then we get this iPad pro with iOS
yay it's a great device don't get me
wrong but sometimes in life it's the
little things that add up and bite you
all right guys so I hope you guys have
enjoyed this review let me know down
below if you have any more questions or
if you just want to say hi I'm always
here for you you can get a pat on the
back I'm here for you have a great week
guys it's been your boy bt saying peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
