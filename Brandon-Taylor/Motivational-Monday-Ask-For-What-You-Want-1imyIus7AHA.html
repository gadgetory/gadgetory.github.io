with another motivational Monday asking
for what you want out of life
everyday our life and our decisions
impact the rest of our life
the questions that we are willing to ask
what we are willing to ask for and that
will determine how much confidence you
have and how far you go in life if
you're not willing to ask for what you
want you'll never get it I think the
chances of you getting it are about 3%
if you don't ask so let's say you want
to raise you wait around and wait around
you don't talk to your boss because
awkward then how do you feel you kind of
feel like you're not very appreciated
you start feeling anger towards your box
like why they're not seeing how much
working on putting in instead of just
going up just asking your boss hey can I
get a raise and that will you have a 97
percent chance of getting what you want
by doing that as opposed to three
percent sitting back and not asking and
that goes with anything your
relationships your friends you have to
ask for what you want your needs and
most of the time when you think about it
people will give you what you want we
think that they won't but they will and
if they don't at least you ask least you
have the confidence to ask and you let
it be known what you need what you want
if you just always sit back and I don't
ask for what you want go after what you
want
knock on doors ask the right people to
get into this company or for me it's
like asking all these headphone company
to work with me I make it shut out a
hundred times 200 times but that one or
two times that I can get in with a
company that'll be worth it because it's
broad right but you have to be willing
to go through that rejection a lot of
times that's what we're scared of the
most is that rejection you don't want to
be rejected it feels bad right it feels
shitty but we must be reject it in life
no way around it and if you do get
rejected it's fine you have to really
just sit there with the feelings and
then it becomes a normal thing which how
to push the way and not really deal with
our feelings and eat our problems away
or it comes out in different ways
addiction is all that it's no good for
anybody it's not good for you so what I
want for you guys is to ask for what you
want if you need help with something
ask for help if you want something for
free ask for it if you're right and that
leads me into the way you ask now you
may say I don't I feel strange asking
but you have to go in there expecting
people to say yes if you go in there if
you wait around the longer you wait the
more angry you're going to be the more
you feel like the person should already
be giving it to you it's so cetera that
when you finally build the courage to
ask that person is going to feel that
anger
and they're gonna push you away the
better when you have a lot just come out
and say it come out the same what you
want that is literally the best thing to
do because it takes away all that and
you're canceling all of that getting
down on yourself and it allows you to be
free confidence so try this this week I
want to challenge you guys ask for five
things that you normally wouldn't ask
five things we can write it down maybe
you've been thinking about certain
situations and expect a yes from it and
then go and ask for it guys
so try this out this week let me know
how it goes hopefully the audios okay I
don't know if I said that already my mic
is out of battery so yeah I'm hoping for
the best when I go to edit this alright
guys I will see you guys in the next
