is the battle between the surface go and
the regular apple ipad guys before we
start this battle can we leave the whole
PC versus Mac Mac versus PC thing out of
this please pretty please this is a
product versus product whichever one
wins or doesn't win doesn't mean much
because what works for one person might
not work for another
what I want to do today with his battle
is give you my feedback on these two
excellent devices in my opinion before
we begin though guys don't forget to
subscribe for more content like this so
let's get the pricing out of the way
first shall we the iPad is coming in two
models a 32 gigabyte at 30 29 and a 128
gigabyte at 4:29
with the 810 fusion chips the surface go
for the 64 gigabyte is coming in at $400
with a worst hard drive and the 128
gigabyte version is coming in at 550
which is the better option in my opinion
with a gigabytes of RAM and a faster SSD
I have with me here the 32 gigabyte iPad
and the 128 gigabyte version of the
windows surface go I honestly don't
think price should be really a factor
when deciding between these two devices
because they work very well in their own
right so I'm calling this round a tie
one thing that really drew me into the
Microsoft go was the ability to have an
actual desktop experience and not just
some glorified iPhone and to be honest
this was really kept me away from
tablets for the past years I mean where
do they actually fit in in our lives I
mean this is where I think that the
Microsoft go excels as it gives you a
small form factor with the ability to
turn it into a great hybrid experience
with the keyboard and pen that being
said if you saw my surface girl review
you will know that I experience a ton of
lag which led me to feel a little bit
underwhelmed especially when I'm running
memory hogging websites like YouTube and
yes I did use edge guys this on the
other hand is where the iPad excels with
this close off iOS system I mean it
really shows us power you have to get
everything from the App Store but these
apps are super optimized completely for
the device and that's one thing that
Apple has always had going for it is its
development development development
development they really really put the
time into developing the apps for the
iPad the iPhone the Macs and they always
seem to run so seamlessly whereas on the
surface go you have to turn off s mode
to get good apps because the Microsoft
Store is really lacking at the moment
let's be honest so to keep it short and
sweet
you get some freedom but you get to lag
with the surface go and you get an
optimized closed-off system with Apple
hmm this seems to be a theme for every
battle involving a Windows and Mac
device for most people who aren't
computer savvy I'd say go with the iPad
it's smooth out of the box you don't
have to go download programs on your own
and deal with all installing them and
turn off s Mon and things like that you
can get straight to the goodies if
you're like me though and you love
freedom and can deal with a little bit
of lag here and there and you kind of
realize like you know what YouTube is a
very memory hogging program then go with
the surface go why not after holding
both devices honestly I love both so
it's very hard to choose a winner based
on build quality one design bonus that I
do feel like the surface go has its it
stand which I love I love being able to
prop this guy up any and everywhere and
it just stays in place no matter what
you could buy a case for the iPad that's
true but they can fall or you have to
reposition the case it's just not as
good of a solution as on the Microsoft
Surface go the iPad is a prettier device
though the bezels are slightly smaller
along the edge which makes it a little
bit nicer to use when consuming media
the Microsoft goes bezels which you know
feel a little bit dated like I'm holding
an old Amazon fire tablet or something
like that the iPad does come in three
different colors and the Microsoft Go
only comes in one so I hope you like
silver but to me of the design of that
hinge really really just I love it and I
miss it when I was using the iPad so I
have to give this round to the Microsoft
Surface go as far as webcams go I don't
need to say much here here are two
examples of video in the same condition
and now here are some pictures in the
same conditions not even the $10,000
camera on the MacBook Pro has as good of
a camera as on the surface go at 550 do
you guys need me to say more I mean I
just let the video speak for itself the
accessories from Microsoft and Apple
respectfully disregarding third-party
options is better with Microsoft though
in my opinion three words a dad trackpad
the keyboard goes for an extra $99 and
it takes the Microsoft go to another
planet that the iPad can't even reach
the iPad is 160 and has no tri pad they
both offer pins and they're very similar
in price so I mean guys the keyboard for
the Microsoft go just wins accessories
goes to Microsoft Co when it comes to
battery life the battery life is 9 hours
on the Microsoft go and 10 hours on the
iPad I felt like once I started running
intensive programs though on the
Microsoft go that number lowered
dramatically whereas the optimized iPad
kept more consistent battery life even
under heavy load the 2048 by 1536 264
PPI Retina screen on the iPad gets
brighter and looks nicer than the
Microsoft goes but the Microsoft Go
screen is still no slouch with a 1,800
by 1200 pixel resolution and 217 PPI and
it's still a pleasure till use the
screen on the iPad is more touch
sensitive than the Microsoft go so I
found myself hitting the screen on the
iPad at times when I didn't want to but
in return this made typing on the actual
screen a lot easier the Microsoft Go
screen takes a little bit of time to get
used to to determine how much pressure
to use to get it to register on the
screen so the winner here is obviously
the iPad the speakers are slightly
better on the iPad compared to the go I
do like the USB port on the surface go a
lot more it gives you way more
flexibility to add like monitors SD card
slots USB Mouse's and keyboards and
while you're still able to charge while
on the iPad you have to buy a lightning
to USB adapter and then you're going to
lose some ability to charge
and use the port at the same time so
there's that one last thing that I want
to touch on is Microsoft's facial
recognition feature that allows you to
open a laptop versus Apple's fingerprint
reader I vastly enjoy the recognition
feature more than the fingerprint reader
when opening my device so this round
goes to the Microsoft Surface go
so which device will I be carrying
around
honestly the winner for me is the
Microsoft go and I'm not just saying
that because I want to be cool and hate
on Apple no I mean I have a MacBook back
there for heaven's sake but I'm saying
that because it's like no other device I
have ever used whereas the iPad gives
you me something similar to my phone
with the closed-off iOS system which
while nice and optimized leaves very
little room for customization and
flexibility that the Microsoft goes
Windows 10 offers you having a desktop
experience anywhere I feel like sitting
down at is such a great feeling if
you're already in the Mac ecosystem and
have purchased 10 of apps love airdrop
and things like that that come with a
Mac ecosystem by all means the iPad is a
great device so yeah those are my
thoughts me personally with a Microsoft
go so thank you guys for your time if
you would be so kind as to drop a like
on this video if you enjoyed it and
subscribe if you haven't already it's
been your boy BTS and</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
