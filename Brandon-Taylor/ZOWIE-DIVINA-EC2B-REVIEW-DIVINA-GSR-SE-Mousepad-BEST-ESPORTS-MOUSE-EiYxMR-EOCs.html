the review of the Divina EC to be from
zali now with their new Divina Lyons now
is trying to bring more awareness around
women in East boards and trying to get
them on a professional stage so not only
does their Divina line have a great
message but they've also added in some
new features to this mouse under the
table and they were pretty sneaky about
it sneaky sneaky Sally but I found them
and I'm gonna be sharing the differences
between the old ec to be and this new
Divina EC to be so let's start off with
the design of this mouse now it is now
in a powder blue and pink and I think it
looks sexy in any setup they've also
improved on the clicks in my opinion
they are super crispy now let me give
you a test of the mouse one and two I
super crispy now I love it Zoe I love it
alright and also they have changed the
side buds now in the past people have
been blasting them for their side
buttons being too mushy on the EC 2a and
2b not anymore guys let's give this a
listen
oh yeah crispy mmm these side buttons
leave nothing to be desired and they are
amazing so they've also changed the core
to a new rubberized material I don't
know what it is but it works like a
charm on your desk you get no feedback
on the actual Mouse if you just have it
laying on your mousepad there's no
resistance or anything like that they've
also done something super simple but
genius and that they angled the mouse
cord up where the mouse meets the cord
they angled it up so that it won't drag
on your mousepad most mice have it just
shooting straight out or even downwards
and that causes a lot of drag so I love
that Sally has thought of all these
little things for the eSports
professionals the scroll wheel is also
nice and defined so when you're clicking
through and switching through your
weapons you definitely feel that click
to have it register with your mind
moving on to the mouse feet they have
these two gigantic mouse feet on there I
know in the original ec to be there are
actually four small feet people didn't
like it
zowie listened and
came back and they gave us these two big
mouths feet that just feels like they
rubbed a stick of butter on the bottom
side of your mouth it just feels super
super smooth when you are on your
mousepad on the bottom they have a dpi
switch where you can change the DPI from
400 to 800 to 1600 and 3200 and also on
the other side they have another button
that they added in this year and that
has a thousand polling rate 500 polling
rate and 125 Hertz for polling rate so
really cool that they put everything
onto the mouse you don't have to have
software to use a Zowie Mouse and that
is one thing that they've always drive
for is just plug and play for the
eSports professionals and so if you're
gonna take this tool and you're gonna be
plugging it into like a different
computer or something like that not your
own personal computer you don't have to
have that software loaded you can just
actually have the settings on the mouse
you can configure it right then in there
and be ready to go for your match so
let's just get this out of the way right
now Zowie is the king of shapes this
mouse is the most comfortable Mouse on
the market period I don't know what kind
of hand model they're using or where
they got this technology or where they
thought of this design but it is perfect
you can lay your hand on this thing and
just get right to gaming it's
supernatural I don't know what they've
done but they've nailed it and they've
knocked it out of the park they've
always had the best shapes no matter
what Mouse they have you can find the
perfect shape for you now this is gonna
be for right-handed people it is an
ergonomic Mouse and I think with this
Mouse what they want is for like palm
grip and claw grip users because of the
maximal contact points on this Mouse you
can use it for fingertip grip and I was
using it for a little bit with fingertip
grip and it performed just as good so
you can use a bunch of different grips
with this Mouse and be comfortable so my
hands personally are nineteen by eight
point five centimeters so if you are
that size or below and go with the EC to
be if you are above that you can go into
EC 1b so I want to just touch on another
point with this Mouse and the comfort is
that with most Mouse's most Mouse
companies you kind of have to have an
adjustment period with the mouse
it doesn't always fit perfectly right
there's always some part of your hand
that hurts a little bit or your wrist
has a little discomfort and you know
what you just say you know what I'll
deal with it I will get
this I'll get used to it at some point
not with this Aoi Mouse you put this
thing you put your hand on you this
Mouse and that's it there's no getting
used to there's no pain points there's
no nothing you can gain four hours and
get up and be like oh there's not even
game today so that's one thing that I
love about hours that they've kept these
same amazing shapes over the years now
this does have a glossy coating and I
was a little bit skeptical of it at
first but after using it for a while it
actually sticks to your hand like glue
once you get used to it there's no
coating like this on the market
currently at least that I've tried so
Zowie also came out with a mousepad for
their Davina series as well the GS are
now this is different than the older
black GSR this thing is super silky
smooth and buttery there is this is
almost like a speed pad whereas with the
old black GSR it was a super slow pad it
was really really slow but it was great
for sniping this one is more of a speed
pad so I find that tracking and things
like that are super easy with this
mousepad so I definitely recommend the
mousepad and also what I love about it
is that it has this nice premium rubber
base and when I rolled it out of the box
it actually just rolled flat and I
haven't experienced that with any of
their mousepad with other mousepad as
you guys know you have to like you know
push down on it or use it for a while to
kind and have it lay flat this one right
out of the box the rubber that they use
just lays flat that's it so if you're
going to land again if you want to just
bring this to land its gonna lay flat if
you want to roll it up put it in your
backpack with your mouse and you're good
to go so so far so good right everything
sounds great but how does the stink
perform in-game let me tell you guys
whether you're a sniper projectile or
hitscan this mouse can do it all and it
does it really well there's a reason why
this is one of the most used eSports
mouse in like forever this thing is on
everybody's desk and for good reason
because the shape just allows it to
disappear and for your mind to have a
connection with your mouse get that mind
to Mouse connection is what I like to
call it it's not a scientific thing but
my definition of that is just where the
mouse just disappears because that is
what we want at the end
the day we want our mouse to disappear
we want our keyboard to disappear and
just be able to game like we are in the
game and have the game envelop us and to
focus on the game not on the peripherals
we want these peripherals to stay out of
the way okay and that's what the ec2
bead does and it does it really really
well also this mouse is rocking a 3360
sensor it is the top-of-the-line sensor
yeah and it is super snappy alright guys
so that is gonna do it for this review
of the ec2 B I hope you guys have
enjoyed this review if you have any more
comments or questions let me know down
below this mouse is coming in at $70 I
know that's a little bit steep for some
people but in my opinion it's worth it
because it saves your wrist
I mean wrist health or saving $10 I'll
go with some wrist health and also the
mousepad is coming in at $35 and you
know what it's a premium mousepad it
stays consistent what more could you
want from a mousepad
so before I get out of here guys I just
want to send a shout out to Zowie and
add a sink for sending this out to me
for testing all these opinions have been
my own if I would have to say like one
negative or con about this is maybe the
color for some people maybe it doesn't
really like fit your color scheme but
this mouse is so good that I think that
it's worth it to actually just overlook
that alright guys so it has been your
boy BT don't forget to lecture come and
subscribe and I will see you in the next
video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
