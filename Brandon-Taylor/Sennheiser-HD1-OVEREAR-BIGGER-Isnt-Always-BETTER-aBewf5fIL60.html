what is up guys is BT back here again
with another review today we finally get
to try out the Sennheiser HD one over
ears now I've been meaning to try these
ever since I tried the on ear HD ones
those things are amazing so I would
expect nothing less from Sennheiser on
the over here so today I'm going to be
answering a couple questions are these
better than on ear how do they stack up
against other competitors I'll be
answering that all today
so one preconception that I had about
these headphones were that they were
very heavy and they clamped very hard I
looked on Amazon reviews as usual and
that's what I saw but upon getting them
taking them out of the box they were
actually very very light probably some
of the lightest over ear headphones that
I have tried so far I love the leather
on the cups it's almost bow status it's
not better than Bose I love that faux
leather on there the faux leather on the
top of the headband also is very nice I
love the metal accents you know I love
that I agree
old-school classic look of these
headphones these also have an airplane
adapter for those of you who travel a
two point five millimeter jack and of
course a case you will definitely feel
stylish wearing these I look at myself
in the mirror catch myself and I'm like
woah who was that good-looking guy no
I'm just kidding but those headphones
they look amazing and they're gonna look
amazing on you as well and I forgot to
mention these are coming in at $500 Wow
but the materials that they use are very
premium it feels like you got a $500
pair of headphones
so I tried the Sennheiser HD one on ears
and I was just blown away by the clarity
the bass everything was great the
comfort was on the soso side they got a
little bit hot as all on ears do so I
was hoping by switching over to the HD
one on ears that would get rid of the
heat problem I would have better more
powerful headphones that can just blast
my head with even more music but I found
myself a little disappointed and that's
only because I tried the on ear HD ones
before these if I didn't try those then
these would be probably some of the best
sounding headphones on the market period
so I haven't burned them in for a very
long time I've only run through one
cycle of the battery but what I can say
is that it is clear up a little bit but
there is a little bit of muddiness
with these headphones and it was kind of
left me disappointed
I mean after trying that HD one you that
clarity I got the bass the thump it just
worked with all types of music I put
them on people's head my friends my
girlfriend and everybody immediately
said wow these things are clear now with
the HD ones I think get that feeling I'm
gonna be honest with you guys I was a
little bit disappointed these do sound
really really good don't get me wrong
the bass is incredible the sound is very
good but there's a little bit of
nuttiness in the mids where it just
knowing how the on ear ones are it kind
of makes me just compare I can't help
but compare I'm only human guys so I can
pair them with that so I have to say
that these are still above average these
are gonna be better than I would say
even the Sony's at this point sound wise
not noise cancellation wise but sound
wise these are better than the sony here
on twos and the 1000x m2 let me just
state that right now but I think the HD
one on ears are above both in all of
those so these feature aptX and these
sound great they sound better on Android
than they do on Apple because as you
know Apple has a W on chip they're in
fisticuffs with a Qualcomm so they don't
have the aptX driver in their phones
if you're an Android user these are
gonna sound even better than the Apple
counterparts and I plan on explaining a
little bit more I've been doing research
for weeks and weeks now on bluetooth
technology and what the differences are
in quality and why it works the way it
works so expect a full-blown video on
bluetooth coming soon
the top quality isn't that great in
these I was a little bit disappointed
especially at this price point of $500
this should be sounding a little bit
better your voice comes across very
quiet so if that's something that is
important to you you might want to think
twice about giving these headphones what
I did notice is when I went to the gym
and I put both of these headphones into
my pocket I started getting breakups on
the headphone and I think it was just a
signal interruption or people at the gym
coming around me but the Bluetooth was a
little bit disappointing in this case so
using these for a couple of days the
battery life did not disappoint is
coming in at 20 hours which is more than
enough to get you through a couple of
days of listening the noise cancellation
is also great I love it it's not Sony
level but it stays out of the way while
getting rid of outside noise it's
actually actively canceling out noise
it's not passive like something like the
Beats Studio threes so I really like the
noise cancellation it's not too strong
it's right in the middle it blocks out
enough noise I never had any sounds
creeping in while I was at the gym or
when I was in the car wearing these so
great job Sennheiser
so all in all these are a gorgeous pair
of headphones I love them I love the
look I love the sound
I love the battery life I love the noise
cancellation I just wish I didn't try
out the HD one on ears before thee
because if not I would just be ranting
and raving about these even more so than
I am so kind of unlucky Sennheiser and
if I had a choice if I had to recommend
you guys the headphones I would
recommend the on-air version of these
headphones now unless you really love
over ear headphones then go with these
but for the $500 price tag I think you
can bump yourself down get the on ears
for a little bit cheaper about $300 and
have that crystal-clear sound so yeah
overall I love them five hundred dollars
I got these on sale actually on Amazon
for three thirty which is I think a
better price and the price that they
actually should be so if you can get
them on sale definitely go ahead and get
them alright guys so thank you guys for
