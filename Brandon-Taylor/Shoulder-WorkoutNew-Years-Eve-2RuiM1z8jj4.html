back with another commentary hopefully
you guys been like the commentaries i'm
gonna keep him coming and I should be
saying happy new year of course you know
I hope you guys all had a good new year
and all been killing it this January so
today I have a shoulder workout for you
guys with me and Lisa what we did was we
started out with dumbbell shoulder press
with these you want to bring it down to
about 90 degrees and then press it up
not locking out but when you press up
keep in mind that you want to try to
squeeze it up don't just try to throw it
up throw up weight because that's how
you get injured squeeze the way control
it and you'll see it definitely a
difference in your shoulders next up we
have a lateral raises which are one of
my favorites I do them like every single
shoulder workout hands down the best use
of that width and I've seen the most
changes of my shoulders by doing this
single exercise adding this to my
workout and what you want to do is you
want to bring your elbows up you don't
want to bring your hands higher than
your elbows don't see a lot of people
doing that and you want to think of
bringing it up and out you know don't
almost like your hands aren't even
attached to the way and in this workout
as you see we're doing a lot of pressing
motions so we did a behind the back
which I feel like it's more the traps
and it also stretches out your friend
deltoids which I really like same thing
what you guys are going to hear me
preaching is a lot of squeezing just
squeeze the weight up you don't have to
force it up I mean maybe the last cup of
reps for step but just squeeze the
weight up coming down 90 degrees never
locking out keeping constant tension
that's how you build muscle next up we
have the
upright row these are another one of my
staple warehouse from my shoulders and
as you see I'm bringing up and then back
up back almost to my neck and by
bringing it back like that at the top at
the very just at the very top slightly
that'll give you your your traps and a
good workout at the very end so if
you're doing it and your wrists hurt
also what you want to do is try to bring
it up with your elbows I'm not trying to
bring it up with your hands you know
hook your hands on don't wrap your thumb
around the bar and raise it up and back
let me know how that goes if you guys
have had problems with that work out let
me know if this fixes the problem next
up we have the PEC deck and this is
going to get the rear delt to really cap
off the shoulders you know you want to
complete shoulders so we got the front
gets laterals with the sot for the sides
and now we get the back and now this
back part we're going to do PEC deck for
about 10 to 15 and you see how my elbows
are in line with my hands so people drop
it back and you're not getting good
workout like that you'll feel a lot more
it's going to make it a lot harder when
you keep your elbows in line with your
hands in a straight line think of it and
pull back it's going to kill you I trust
me and we superset at this with some
I waited I don't know what you call
these honestly it's almost like a
dumbbell row but it's like a trap row
I'll call it what you want to do is try
to bring your shoulder blades together
your traps together on the back of the
neck and I've been doing this one for a
while just to really burn out by rear
delts and my traps everything and get
that rock look you know so try it out
let me know how it goes and I will catch
you guys in the last hat in the last in
the next commentary because it's showing
the last anywho coming up took a few
clips of my new year and I hope you guys
enjoy it all right stick around for that
