is the review of the teleost v2 switches
the linear brother 2 might be love it
Helios switches now these are the linear
form so for those of you guys who felt
left out after my zeroes v2 review
because you don't like tactile switches
hey now we got the linear version and
we're gonna do a review on it so I'm
gonna give you guys the breakdown on
these two leo switches and see maybe
just maybe these might be able to
replace my Z Leo's v2 switches yeah I
said it
so let's start off with the pricing now
these can be a con for a lot of people
but you are paying for quality here now
it's ten dollars for ten switches so
that comes out to a dollar per switch
but I think that these are well worth it
if you love linear switches because
these are some of the best so the great
thing about these switches like the
opilio Cecilie OSIS and the silence is
that they have less wobble than your
gate around switches so they're gonna
give you like a more smoother experience
overall right out of the bag you can
tell that the switch is just made so
well me personally when I pull it out of
the bag and I was pressing down on it
just with my index finger I was like wow
I can already tell the difference
between this and a cherry MX red I make
less mistakes then on that gate around
red or a cherry amix red because of that
bottom out weight they feel a lot
heavier than a gator on red gator on
reds are really smooth but at the same
time I make a lot of mistakes because
they are so light so for those of you
guys out there and I know that's a lot
of you guys a huge majority of you guys
that love linear you love cherry MX red
or gate around red this would be the
next step for you if you're wondering
what to get next so whether you're
typing whether you're gaming I feel like
these can do it all all right guys I
know what time it is do you guys know
what time it is it is time for that
sound test and don't forget to write the
time stamp in the comments saying here's
what you came for as usual
ah yeah these Tilly osis are so wheat so
right now my Attilio savvy tools are not
lubed and I did that on purpose because
there's gonna be a second part to this
video where I show you how to lube your
switches and then we're gonna do a
comparison between the unloop versus a
lube to see if you guys can tell the
difference we're gonna put them back to
back and do a battle I'm going to tell
you guys my experience with lubing do
they feel smoother is it worth it
it's a worth your time more importantly
and all that good stuff coming soon in
the second part to the teleost review
for now though I feel confident
recommending these wholeheartedly to you
guys if you guys are a linear lover you
are going to love the switches I have no
doubt in my mind you guys are going to
be like Cherry MX who gotta run whoo
after you try these teleost v2 switches
alright guys so that's gonna do it for
this review I hope you guys have enjoyed
this video it has been your boy bt don't
forget to like share comment and
subscribe and I will see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
