with another review today I want to talk
to you guys about the importance of
trackers now there's a lot of fitness
trackers going around there's Fitbit the
Garmin there's all these different
brands how do you know which one to
choose and why are they even important
why would you even want one you know
even the Apple watch is a viable option
now for these kind of products so I
decided to make a video on why they're
important because I was skeptical at
first too but hear me out because my
opinion has changed now if you have seen
some of my old videos you will know that
I have a cop reference and that cop
reference goes something like this when
you're driving in a 50 mile-per-hour
zone and then you get to a 35 mile per
hour zone up ahead sign right are you
gonna slow down or are you gonna go that
50 right through that 35 mile per hour
zone
most likely you're gonna go 50 miles per
hour because nobody's holding you
accountable and if you're already going
that route why would you stop now let's
say the same situation happened you were
going 50 and 50 mile per hour zone
and then you see you have 35
mile-per-hour zones but this time you
see a cop right next to that side are
you more likely to slow down yes you're
gonna go that 35 miles per hour and that
is the same way a tracker works you see
when you have something that holds you
accountable when you have something that
is watching you and you have to answer
to it's almost like a little trainer on
your arm so that way you'll see what
you're doing right and wrong and if
you've eaten the wrong things how that
can affect your progress they hold you
accountable they hold you accountable
guys you know at the end of the night
when you're looking at all your stats
you can say
I need to do better as opposed to not
seeing your stats not getting any
feedback from anyone or anything and
then you're just going about your
business what's gonna happen you're
gonna forget you're not gonna see that
progress you're not gonna see any of
these cool charts that some of these
apps have and you're just gonna fall off
so it's a good way to keep track of your
progress
first and foremost now with all that
being said let's move in - what tracker
I use and my experience now I first had
the charge one by Fitbit it was a charge
HR excuse me now my problem with
trackers and the Apple watches is they
don't have that grade of battery life so
if you're trying to track for two to
three days max on the battery and let's
say one day you forget to wear it and
then you're going about your day and
you're like huh I guess I don't really
need that watcher that tracker and then
you stop wearing it I mean this has
happened to me I forgotten totally about
the Fitbit I go about my day and I'll be
like man I had a Fitbit yeah that's
right so I picked up the charge -
because they said it had five days of
battery and this is very very good I
have gotten five to six days of battery
with this device I'm working out I'm at
work and this tracker has held up very
nicely I'm very impressed
so here it is right here here is the
Fitbit charge - and now I'm going to get
into a little bit of a review overview
of why I like this tracker and why I
think you guys should probably pick this
one up
now they updated it and what I like
about this new charge - first off is the
price they didn't rate they just updated
the charge HR with a better screen
and better battery life and they didn't
charge me for they kept it the same
exact price so kudos to Fitbit for doing
that I really when I saw the price I was
like that's really cool of them to do so
you can really tell they're in it for
the people they're in it for us you know
they want us to be better they're a
business of course they got to make
money but at the same time I really felt
like this move kind of made me realize
that they actually do care and the
company is very set on helping people so
through pressing this button on the side
you can get to a lot of things you can
see the time the date how many steps you
have the fat-burning zone for yourself
your heart rate what kind of workout
you're doing you can set it to the
different kind of workouts that you
might be doing so elliptical bike
running weightlifting all those
different things which is really cool
because it can calibrate your movement
to what activity you're doing so that's
a cool feature now Brett people might
say Brandon bTW I mean this thing is not
accurate I can wave my hand and it'll
get stepped or my heart rate is not
completely accurate into those people I
say of course it's not going to be
accurate this isn't meant to be
completely a hundred percent accurate
but if it can be 80 to 90 percent
accurate then you can get that feedback
which is most important is it's not
supposed to be a accurate to the book by
the book exact numbers it's supposed to
be a guideline for you to do better and
to give you an idea of what you're doing
on a day to day basis you know so you
may have those days where you know
you're waving your arms or you're doing
more work with your arms and you know
you're like why are my steps like at a
thousand
have you been walking a thousand steps
well it's giving you a generalized idea
of your your activity throughout the day
so don't expect this to have the exact
heart rate because it's just going off
of a little sensor on the bottom you
know it's great technology if it can
give you around the right heart rate
that in itself is really cool so what I
like about the Fitbit charge HR 2 is
that it'll send you a lot of
notifications through your Fitbit
through your phone through your email to
try to contact you to say hey look you
need to be moving or you need to be
doing this or you need to do 90 more
steps that has something called win the
hour where you can do 250 steps and you
can win the hour so you try to win all
the hours in the day so when I'm at work
or doing different things I'm in the lab
I'm at my computer I'll get these
notifications on my wrist a little
vibrate and say hey you need to be
moving and this motivates me to get up
and be like you know what I shouldn't be
moving I should be moving those 250
steps so it's a really great way to just
keep yourself active throughout the day
even if you don't work out even if you
don't go to the gym if you even if you
don't have time to be active this is
just a way to show you that every day we
can do something to be active and I
really like that I really like that idea
and that concept another great feature
of the Fitbit ecosystem is that they
have a nice food tracker now you can use
My Fitness Pal which you know is really
nice but I like that they integrated a
food tracker where people you can enter
your macros and enter how many calories
you want to get for the day and what you
want your weight loss to be and then
this will give you the calories that you
need for the day and then you can add
different foods let's say I eat at
Chipotle
you can add chicken you can add whatever
toppings you got into the app so you can
see if you're in a deficit or a surplus
for your calories which is really cool I
really like that and it calculates your
steps your heart rate all into how many
calories you have left for the day so it
gives you a very general idea of
how your day is going and it tracks and
it keeps you and it holds you
accountable and also it calculates your
weight so you can enter your weight
every single day and it'll show you a
chart going up and down of what your
weight is and you can keep yourself
accountable by saying how much weight
are you am I actually losing are the
foods that I'm eating actually working
another feature a big feature of the HR
2 is of course the heart rate monitor
now it's not completely accurate like I
said but it does give you a lot of
motivation so when I'm in the gym I try
to keep my heart rate at a certain level
if I see a dip or I know I'm not in my
fat-burning zone
I'll try to like up the rate I'll
decrease the rest times and my sets and
go harder it just gives you that much
more of a push as opposed to nothing at
all and for 150 bucks it's worth its
weight in gold you can also track your
sleep now this is something I'm really
bad at because like I'm working so hard
with YouTube with work in a lab so I do
scientist stuff all day come home work
out and then I go to sleep really late
and wake up early so it really motivates
me to sleep earlier it'll send you a
notification saying hey it's almost
bedtime
at about 30 minutes before your bedtime
so these little reminders kind of just
help you in your everyday life you know
it's a product that will help you in
your everyday life now
in the new HR 2 they also added another
relax exercise onto the the tracker and
what this does is it gives you a
two-minute or five-minute breathing
exercise now if you're being in a
meditation which I've meditated maybe
every other day I try to at least it
gets you in tune it gets you more
relaxed when I'm at my desk I can just
turn on the relaxation app on my watch
and it'll show this little bubble going
in and out and you follow it with your
breath in and out
and when I'm swamped with paperwork or I
have a lot to do I actually stop my
paperwork and I turn on this app and it
calms me down playing this - but it
calms me down and to me like it's things
like that or all these different things
add up to you having a better life and
when a product can do that just by your
day to day then it's worth it whether
it's the Apple watch with us the Garmin
whether it's the new Fitbit charge HR
the flex whichever one you decide to go
with make sure it has the features that
will help you most in your life that's
the best advice I can give you now I
really really like the Fitbit charge HR
- and I recommend this one strongly to
anybody trying to get into the tracker
world definitely one with the heart rate
monitor so I hope you guys have enjoyed
this video on why trackers are important
and maybe you give you guys that little
push that you need to go out and get
yourself a tracker
remember that cop that I was talking
about yeah you don't want him to catch
up with you and that's life life will
catch up with you so definitely give a
tracker a try you know give a tractor a
try
tracker a try and and see how it works
out for you
you know take it what's the worst that
can happen your life gets it a little
bit better and even then that's amazing
so go out there get yourself a tracker
and let me know how it goes and I will
see you guys in the next video peace
every day 24/7 I'm getting more shredded
