the newly released iPad pro accessories
I am gonna do a full review on the
actual iPad pro I picked one out I'm
loving it so far but I wanted to do a
review on the accessories and if you
should pick them up or not as with all
Apple products they are very well
designed but they come at a cost so
today I'm gonna be telling you guys if
it's worth it to actually pick up a
smart keyboard folio or the Apple pencil
apple in my opinion does a lot of things
right with their products it's the small
things it's a very small minor things
that we take for granted and then they
put a price on it and then we say why is
this so expensive the Apple pen is
coming in at a hundred and thirty
dollars which is I guess in line with
what some of the other companies like
Microsoft is doing theirs is around 100
as well
Apple has now added in a way to charge
this magnetically to your iPad pro so
you just snap this on and it charges and
it gives you a little indication of what
the battery is on the iPad pro like I
said it's the small things and that is a
small thing that really makes a
difference in my opinion now the
magnetic strip I think could be a little
bit more magnetic I guess the best term
to use is because I actually dropped my
pen just carrying it around you got
nudged off and it fell off and I
scratched the tip and now my tip is
ruined I have to pay for another one so
I wished a magnetic strip on this was a
little bit stronger for people carrying
it around because that's how they have
marketed this thing is that you can just
snap this on and just carry it around
and it's not gonna be a problem well it
is gonna be a problem and it is going to
mess up your PIN so using the pin was
actually a breeze now all I have to do
is press darker if you want a darker
shade or you can now shade with the side
of your pen or pencil so it can give you
that kind of like gradient look that
some artists go for I'm not an artist
myself I just use this for like
storyboarding these videos and drawing
out my shots and things like that but
this does a very good job
just being a good pen and pencil you can
also double tap on it twice to change it
into an eraser which is also very nice
I do wish that you could like flip this
thing around and just erase with the
other side kind of like a pencil with it
to give you that I don't know that mine
to a pin connection but I mean double
tapping is kind of a functionality
feature of this where you don't have to
flip over your pen but some of us I mean
me namely likes that you can actually
just flip your pin around and just erase
so I mean it's just a little thing I
don't know let me know what you guys
think do you guys what you guys like to
have the double tap or would you like to
flip it around and erase let me know
down below so do I think the Apple pen
is worth it yes for $130 you're getting
a lot of functionality with these you
can buy the tips again I have to go buy
another tip but just keep in mind that
you cannot travel with this comfortably
I would actually put this into like a
pin slot into your actual backpack and
things like that now moving on to the
folio case now for me the iPad pro is
the surface Pro's those are things that
are trying to replace laptops they're
getting more and more powerful by the
day
and with that I think you really need a
dedicated keyboard because typing on
screen just does not work for me you
have to actually lay the iPad flat on
your lap to type you know like this and
things like that and I don't think that
that's a smart way to do it I don't know
I ended up just holding up with one hand
and trying to tap like this and just go
all over my screen with one finger and
it's not productive okay it just takes
more time so having a keyboard in my
opinion is a necessity for like these
pro lines of tablets that being said the
smart folio case is one of the best that
I've used but they need a trackpad on
here and I think that that kind of goes
back to Apple needs to redesign a whole
new operating system for the tablet line
but I will get more into that in the
actual review of the iPad pro but for
now I want to just say that the keyboard
does a good job it's okay to type on I
don't really like the texture of the
keys that's just my personal preference
but those keys and the material
that they do use over the top of the
keys best protect the screen a lot and
that's one thing that this case does
really well is that it protects it on
both sides whereas something like the
surface pro it's only on one side
because they have the hinge on the other
one so you can get scratches on your
windows logo and things like that so I
like that they keep everything nice and
tidy and they protects it from bumps and
scratches and things like that
I wouldn't drop this because there's
electronics in it couldn't mess it up
and it's not that protective where it
won't stop it from shattering your
screen but it does a great job of just
protecting from scratches or putting
into your backpack and things like that
and how it connects us by three pins on
the actual keyboard and three pins on
the actual iPad pro and you just go from
there and it's just snaps in very nicely
it has two viewing angles as well so you
can snap it into like a taller one or a
shorter one and this works well when
you're in bed or you're in a couch or
you're in your chair or on a desk all
these angles were more than enough I
thought before with a Microsoft Surface
pro line that having that hinge that
goes at any different angle was a far
superior but Apple has found out a good
set of angles which you can choose from
still not as good as having any angle
you want but it does a good job of
giving you two angles that work with
multiple settings so good job Apple on
the design as always like I said great
design from Apple comes at a price
though of $200 so is this thing worth it
yes until somebody comes out with a
better keyboard which I'm going to be
out on the look for recently because I
think $200 is a little steep I would
like to see this around like 150 but
it's Apple you got to pay that Apple tax
until then I would definitely say if
you're gonna pick up an iPad pro and you
type a lot or you're gonna be writing or
using this as kind of like a standalone
laptop device definitely pick up the
folio case because it actually does have
a lot of functionality it works really
well not the best typing experience but
it does a good job alright guys so that
is going to do it for this video don't
forget to Like share comment and
subscribe on this video if you have any
more questions about the iPad
accessories let me know down below or
you have any recommendations for me you
want to tell me some better ones I'm all
ears
you know I have no dedication Apple
isn't paying me for this so you know I
have no brand loyalty let me know
is there something better something
cheaper works just as well I'm all-in
alright I'll see you in the next one
it's been your boy BT saying</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
