review of the triple OS from BenQ yes
binkey does make speakers they're not
just a monitor company anymore
so today I'm going to be going over the
unique features of this bluetooth
electrostatic speaker not dynamic its
electrostatic and these things can range
up to like $1000 let's start off with a
unique design of this speaker now it has
two subwoofers and two amps and it has
two flaps or two speakers that flip out
so when they're folded I feel like they
give you more of a 3d sound and when
they're like flipped open I feel like
they give you more directional sound so
it really is up to what flavour you're
going for that 3d sound or do you want
more of a directional sound so let's say
for instance you're at a party and you
want to have this like in the middle of
the room you can like fold the flaps and
this thing will be shooting out sound
everywhere or if you want to have it
like at the beach or something and you
guys are all sitting in one direction
you could just have it shooting right at
you so there's a lot of flexibility with
these flaps I know it kind of looks like
one of those Star Wars ships like where
it's like flying and all that but yeah
guys it's not a Star Wars ship it is an
actual speaker so on the top of the
speaker you're gonna have your controls
which are the pause and play button
you're gonna have a mode button which
you can set it to a 3d sound which we'll
get into in the sound we also have a
volume rocker for plus and minus as well
we also have a bluetooth pairing button
and a power button so on the back side
you're gonna find a USB micro on the
back for charging or for like continuous
play if you so choose
speaking of battery this thing lasts
forever it has 18 hours of battery life
this thing is a powerhouse also on the
back there's a 3.5 millimeter jack if
you want to plug your phone directly
into the speaker and shoot it out and
you don't want to use bluetooth so
that's another option they also have a
connection via NFC as well so folding
the flaps does make this compact for
travel but it is a little bit on the
heavy side I will say these also have a
dual mode where you can turn this on and
have two speakers playing at once so if
you buy two of these bad boys you can
have them at your party blasting music
from every which direction which is
amazing so like I said at the beginning
of the review this is a electrostatic
speaker which is gonna give you a lower
distortion rate at higher volumes and
electrostatic speakers are really known
for their details so these are gonna go
best with like jazz and classical music
so when you go to an electric static
speaker you're gonna lose some bass but
the good thing about this speaker is
that it has a 3d mode which raises all
the frequencies on the chart of this
speaker meaning you're gonna get more
power down at the low end compared to
another electrostatic speaker so these
really benefit from having high quality
music files so I wouldn't recommend this
for somebody who is using Spotify but
more people they're using like at least
Apple music you can get by and title is
perfect with this speaker the genres
that go best with the speaker like I
said are jazz and classical RMB is
really good there's a lot of rich mid
tones I will say though that even though
they have that 3d sound the bass isn't
there but that isn't what this speaker
is for this is for us detail clarity
people out there that really love the
detail and the nuances in our music so
let's say you've tried JBL you've tried
Sounion it's just too much bass it
overtakes the vocals it overtakes the
trouble you want something with some
rich detail some clarity in there this
is the speaker that you've been looking
for I'm gonna drop a sound test of some
chill hop music right about now
so what did you guys think I know it's
hard to really get a gauge of how a
speaker sounds over a mic but I think
that this thing does a really good job
for a certain type of listener so guys
if you have been in the market for a
detail-oriented Bluetooth speaker with a
lot of power 18 hours of battery life I
actually have a 10% off coupon
I think it's 10% I'll drop it down in my
description so you guys can check out
this speaker and get a discount for my
subs only so yeah you guys can check out
this speaker as well and get it for a
discounted price alright guys so that is
gonna do it for the review of the travel
OS it gets the BT step of approval for
clarity and for detail free base heads
out there look elsewhere and I know
that's a lot of you guys but for that
small minority or you just want
something different this speaker is
gonna work wonders for you alright guys
so that is gonna do it for this review
don't forget to Like share comment and
subscribe and I will see in the next one
it has been your boy bt saying</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
