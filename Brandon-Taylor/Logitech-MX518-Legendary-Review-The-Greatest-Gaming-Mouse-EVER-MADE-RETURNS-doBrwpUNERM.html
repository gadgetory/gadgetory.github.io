is Beattie here and this is the review
of the refreshed version of the greatest
Mouse of all time the logitech mx518
hero edition now I've been playing PC
games for what seems like forever and
the mouse had always stuck out to me
from the past was the mx-5 10 the
original version of the mx-5 18 one of
the most comfortable mice ever made
period guys I play countless csgo
world of warcraft vanilla and DOTA games
with that mouse so once they stopped
making it I was a little devastated as
you could imagine hello darkness my old
friend so this began my journey of going
through mouse after mouse trying to find
one that could fill its shoes but as you
guys know the gaming mice climate change
from one that was like about comfort to
one about aesthetics trying to be overly
gamey meanwhile leaving our hands
cramped until now until the hero refresh
of the logitech mx518 but how does it
stack up against the rest of the field
in 2019 is it as comfortable as we all
remember let's put it to the test today
and find out now the design of the mouse
hasn't changed all that much it's got
the exact same legendary shape as the
mx-5 10 now with a silver coating that
fades into black near the back of the
mouse its glossy but it's really really
grippy and even after four hours of a
gaming session I never felt my hand
slipped once now in the past when you
would use the original image 510 the
coating would rub off near the fingertip
area so I'm hoping that won't happen now
I'll keep you guys posted on that but
Logitech has been pretty good about
their coatings in the present day a on
the bottom you've got three mousepad
feet you got one of the
at the bottom and one on the side
they've also got a little one around the
sensor as well this Mouse glides like
butter on every Mouse path that I put it
on so it's not gonna be an issue guys
it's got two side buttons that are light
but a little bit mushy in my opinion and
the back button feels a little bit more
loose compared to the forward side
button the four button is slightly
smaller than the back button as well the
scroll of spring feels a little bit
cheap too compared to some of the newer
mice on the market especially when you
click down on it it feels like the mouse
wheel could come out at some point like
come out of the socket or just become
loose at some point again we can only
see and time will tell
please believe I will let you guys know
if anything happens to this mouse now
you've got three buttons along the top
as well that can be customized and the
new Logitech of software two of these by
default are dpi buttons the cord is thin
and stays out of the way Logitech is
definitely getting better about their
cords let's just say that right now now
let's talk about what makes this shape
so good it's all in that thumb this
little groove right here there's nothing
better than it in gaming mice today it's
down right perfect if you are looking
for economic palm grip Mouse it's got
rubber grips on either side that has an
amazing feel to it the slope on the
right side is very forgiving on the
backside of your palm whereas some mice
they have a hard fall off which makes
this Mouse really really comfortable on
the right side they have a ledge to help
you with picking up and controlling the
mouse for gaming though this mouse is
still a beast guys nothing has changed
from like 2010 I think there's 2000 I
don't even know how long that Mouse has
been out for but I find a fingertip grip
and claw grip very hard to do this mouse
because of the ledge and the thumb
portion kind of get in the way it's
definitely more of like a pong grip
relaxed claw grip Mouse in my opinion
the grip that works the best for this
mouse is like a 131 where the thumb is
on the left side you got three fingers
on top and the pinkies on the right side
with all that being said I am very
accurate with this Mouse it took me a
while to get used to since I've been
kind of moving over to a fingertip grip
lately as of late but practicing in
Kovacs made reverting back to a 131
breeze the hero sensor in this mouse is
capable
going up to 16,000 dpi I personally only
use about 800 dpi I didn't experience
any spin outs or liftoff distance
problems with this mouse the hero sensor
is definitely my personal favorite mouse
sensor at the moment I don't think
there's anything better in my opinion
overall though guys the mx518 pretty
much is what we expected it to be that
same amazing great shape of the original
now with that new snappy hero of sensor
it does keep that same similar buttons
to the older version which is kind of
disappointing but me personally I never
really used the top three middle buttons
except like push-to-talk maybe in
discord or in game alright guys so that
is gonna do it for this review thank you
guys for watching as always it has been
your boy bt don't forget to Like share
