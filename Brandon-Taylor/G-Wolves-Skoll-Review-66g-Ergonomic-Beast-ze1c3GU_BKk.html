review of the G wolves skull ace Edition
Mouse now a lot of my amazing subs out
there you guys were tagging me on
Twitter telling me about the G wolves
Mouse telling me to check it out that
you wanted a review so that led to x-ray
pad reaching out to me and saying hey
you want to test out the G Wolf's cold
Mouse so I obliged and they sent one out
to me and I have never been so wrong and
so blown away by a mouse so today I'm
gonna be going over what I love about
this mouse and why it is so good for
those of you guys out there that have
been wanting an Ergo lightweight mouse
this is it before it began though guys
shout out to x-ray pad for sending me
out this mouse amazing company all these
opinions are my own they're not owned by
G wolves they just carry the mouse so
there's no need for me to lie about this
mouse or do any fluff or anything like
that this is gonna be the real deal they
told me to give them real feedback on
this mouse so they can improve on the
mouse before the final Mouse comes out
this is actually a test version of the
mouse but it was so good and I'm so
excited to share with you guys that I
couldn't wait and I had to make a review
on it as soon as possible
now before we begin with the unboxing
can we just all take a second to admire
how beautiful this box is it comes in a
tin like lunch box container and it
looks absolutely sick it feels like
you're getting a collector's edition
Mouse and I feel like you could just put
this on your shelf and have it as a
little collector's item and it looks
absolutely sick in my opinion and for
sixty dollars it's really cool that they
put in that much detail into this Mouse
now upon opening the mouse you're gonna
find some paperwork and you're also
gonna find some extra Mouse feet which
is always nice and some wipes so you can
clean it off before you put on the new
Mouse feet also in the box to my
surprise they added in an extra paracord
and I was not expecting that they are
really appealing to us mice enthusiasts
out there so let's talk about the design
of this mouse now for color it's got
great at the mouse one and two and it
fades to black on the back it's very
tastefully done it looks absolutely sick
in my opinion it's got an ergonomic
shape for you right handers out there
it's very similarly shaped to the ec2 B
I'm going to
up the stats right now so you guys can
see the difference so a little bit
bigger on the size and it also fills out
your hand a little bit more than the EC
to be it's not as big as the EC to a so
keep that in mind it's right in between
so it'll work for both users of those
mics now the EC to be is actually 90
grams and this one is coming in at 66
grams so sexy this mouse is gonna work
best with palm relaxed palm claw relaxed
claw it's not the best for fingertip
grip out because of the little edge in
the front so I wouldn't recommend it
they do have another Haiti version
coming out in September that's gonna be
ambi for you aggressive claw or
fingertip grip users so don't feel left
out your time is coming and be users so
in my time in using this mouse I
predominantly use palm grip my hands are
nineteen by eight point five centimeters
and it was an absolute dream the EC to
be was a little bit short for me and my
fingertips would hang over the edge just
slightly with this one there's none of
that it fits damn near perfect I'd say
if you're like eighteen by eight
centimeters or above you're good if you
go over like a twenty-two by ten
centimeters you might be in the danger
zone so keep that in mind there's four
mice feet on the bottom although I feel
like they could have moved the front
left one a little bit out a little bit
more because when you press it in a
certain way the mouse on the back right
kind of tilts up a little bit and I only
noticed that happening sometimes it
didn't affect my gameplay or didn't
throw me off but it's something that I
noticed when I was clicking down on the
mouse one also on the bottom of the
mouse they have two buttons to let you
control the DPI the scroller is nice and
big and defined which is nice you can
also click it and it has a nice click
very nice there's also a G wolves logo
right above the scroll wheel which is
very tastefully done in my opinion and
like I mentioned earlier this mouse also
comes with a paracord it's a little bit
stiffer than your normal paracord though
it's just a little bit tighter of a
weave overall but when I press the court
against it like I did a paracord only
near the rubber as a very front of the
mouse that this mouse start to really
have the cord affected and the paracord
on this mouse just disappears when
you're actually using
in a real time so when we're dealing
with these light mites one of the most
important aspects of these mice has to
be their structural integrity and this
mouse has some of the best side panels
in the game there is no flex whatsoever
because we all have been there where
we're in a tense situation and we need
to grab on to our mouths make sure we
have complete control and we're
squeezing the living hell out of our
mouse and this mouse has held up
amazingly well the only place where I
felt a little bit of flex was on the
bottom near the back - mouse feet so
that's something to take into
consideration if you're a person that
gets upset and slams down their mouse
but for the rest of us that are just
using it normally and can control our
emotions this mouse will hold up just
nicely for you all right so you guys
know what time it is now it is time for
that sound test of the mouse one and two
these have Omron switches and they sound
great there's little to no play on the
mouse one and two let's do the sound
test oh yeah very nice so let's talk
about the side buns a little bit now
there's little to no play you do have to
press them in slightly to get them to
register not as much as like as Ally
Mouse they're not as big as like AEC to
be so keep that in mind if you're a
person that likes a really big ones but
I feel like Logitech has the best ones
these are somewhere in between they're
also easy to reach with your thumb and
not too far forward which is nice so
let's drop another sound test for you
guys very nice and clicky not militia at
all very nice very solid along the
bottom side of the mouse they have two
parallel lines for the RGB which is also
very tastefully done in my opinion the
RGB can be controlled in the software
which is nice they've got where you can
choose a solid color for your set up or
a wave color my favorite is to hold on
mode where if you press the mouse one in
two it reacts and it shoots down a RGB
line down the side of your mouse which
is really really cool in my opinion also
in the software you can change the DPI
steps you can change the pulling rate
all that good stuff you can make macros
the usual suspects are all in there and
ready to go for you it's got the top the
lion 3360 sensor performs great on all
surfaces like my class
 kind right in you name it this
thing will perform on it it goes up to
12,000 DPI so that's gonna cover pretty
much everyone so what G walls has done
is they've listened to the community
right they know what's popular they took
one of the most popular shapes in the
history of mice right tweaked it a
little bit right made it fill out your
hand a little bit more they put in a
3360 Center a paracord and then made it
66 grams and said guys go to work and
guys when I tell you this you know
people say oh you always say this Mouse
is the best this is the best guys listen
to me
okay I picked up his mouse and usually
what I have to do is I have to go in
after tweak my DPI when I get a new
Mouse I have to tweak my ingame setting
for my sensitivity with this Mouse I
picked it up and I just started to game
and this thing my aim from the first
game that I used his mouse was just
incredible I am a straight beast with
this mouse it performs perfectly this is
just a test unit so if they're gonna do
something or add something or I don't
know what they're already just pretty
much messing there on the verge of
perfection I think if they move that
mounts fit out a little bit on the front
edge here I think that's gonna get rid
of that tilting a little bit but for me
it really didn't affect me in game but
it could for some of you guys out there
so keep that in mind but for me the
comfort mixed with the great sensor
mixed with a lightweight I can gain for
hours so there's no harsh edges on the
hexagons this thing when you lay your
hand on it you're not gonna pick up your
hand and there's gonna be an imprint of
the hexagons no none of that and it may
seem like I'm hyping up this Mouse you
may not believe me right but if you're
following me on Twitch okay if you were
hurt listen to me on Twitch I was not
excited about this Mouse but now that I
have it in my hands and I've been gaming
with it I was wrong okay I should have
given it a chance
this thing has exceeded my expectations
and for those of you guys out there that
have been waiting for her go
lightweight Mouse this is the time to
get it and for sixty dollars what
they're giving you here they're giving
you an enthusiast Mouse
and at a great price point of $60 it's
hard to find fault with this you know
just moving that mouse foot out like I
said and it will be perfect in my
opinion all right guys that's gonna do
it for this review of the G wolves skull
ace edition amazing Mouse if you guys
are looking for a lightweight herbal
mouse highly recommended by me if you
don't care about Wireless like a G 703
if you don't care about that the
paracord is amazing on this Mouse it
feels like your Wireless pretty much
anyways guys it has been your boy BT I
hope you guys have enjoyed this review
if you have any more questions about
this mouse let me know down below and I
will see you in the next one peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
