another battle today we have a battle
between the new G 305 which is the
wireless version of the G Pro so one
thing with the G pro is that the court
really really sucks a little it was nice
to see that they came out with a new
wireless version of this mouse same
aesthetics same button layout so this
has been one of my favorite Mouse's over
the past year and most used I always
come back to it after using every other
Mouse except for the final Mouse so now
that the court has gone how does this
Mouse compare to the G pro so I'm gonna
do a comparison today for you guys so if
you already have a G pro or you're
thinking about getting the G 305 this
video should be able to help you a
little bit with that decision but before
I begin don't forget to hit that
subscribe button for more content like
this it really helps a channel and I
appreciate all the support that you guys
give me so obviously let's talk about
the price now the price of the G Pro is
44 dollars the price of the G 305 is $60
and I really feel like the G 305 is very
affordable for what it is you're getting
a wireless mouse you know you put in the
lithium battery you can get up to 500
hours of game time with it not having to
worry about it whatsoever
now grip wise these both grip the same
so if you're a fingertip or a claw grip
user these mice are for you in fact I
think it's one of the best claw grip or
fingertip Mouse's they can get the
coating feels great the grip is nice if
you can grip it and this mouse will fit
people with large hands medium hands and
especially small hands so those of you
with big hand sizes don't expect to be
pong gripping this Mouse either one of
these mice because it's not gonna work
freedom at last there's no more of this
braided stiff hard cord on the G Pro now
it's all gone with the wireless version
of the G 305 but it's not that simple
with that you're gaining another 12
grams of weight to the mouse and this is
what I feel like really affected my
gameplay usually with the G Pro I can
just hit shots it's very easy to move
around
but I could almost like feel where the
battery was in the mouse when I put the
lithium battery into the G 305 so it
would throw off my shot a lot and I used
it for about two weeks now and I still
can't get used to it I'm still missing
shots that I used to hit with the G pro
same sensitivity same dpi playing
overwatch the only things that really
say the same was tracking because you
don't have to be as accurate but sniping
was super hard I still haven't gotten
sniping down and projectile is isn't so
bad because you have to be as accurate
but if you're a sniper definitely stick
with a G Pro if you are more of a
tracking slash projectile maybe you can
get away with the G 305 and on that note
I would say if you're a very competitive
person if you want the best most
accurate Mouse that you can get then I
would go with the G pro if you want
something you're just a casual gamer you
want Wireless you want something small
claw grip then the G 305 isn't so bad
but just keep that in mind if you are
very serious go to G Pro another
aesthetic difference between the two is
that the G 305 does not have RGB it just
has an indicator that shows how the
battery is doing and also on the G Pro
you're getting RGB if that matters to
you
the buttons are different though the G
305 buttons are more crisp they're more
I don't know it's like some rice
krispies treats cereal they just snap
like it's just a super super crisp like
an apple just blending to Apple it's
just there's it's almost like the final
Mouse that's how good the clicks are
even the side buttons are better on the
G 305 compared to the G Pro the G pros
buttons have been known to be a little
bit light in the past and I have to
agree with that sometimes I would
misfire or shoot before I was really
ready so something you have to get used
to and there's a learning curve with the
G pro but not with the G 305 the buttons
are crisp they're they're they're clicky
they don't press in as easy as with the
G pro so the hero sensor that they use
in the G 305 is supposed to be on par
with the three three six six but gives
you a longer-lasting
a life full advantage of that double-a
battery but like I said something about
this Mouse like I just could not hit the
same shots I don't know if it really is
a difference between the hero sensor in
the three three six six but real-world
testing these and I'm sure you guys if
you guys have both are testing both you
might come to the same conclusion as I
did so that's gonna do it for this
comparison this battle for this battle
I still go with the G Pro even though it
has that terrible cord I still like the
accuracy of it and I'm a super
competitive person so me personally want
to play an overwatch and things like
that I want the best of the best I want
to know that I have the most accurate
fastest mouse available to me you know
if I'm missing shots and I feel like my
mouse is hindering me that's a problem
that's not worth 60 bucks so that is my
take on it if you're a casual gamer if
you want something Wireless claw grip
you have medium or small hands then the
G 305 is a great option but for me like
I said I'm gonna pass on it I'm just
gonna use my G Pro still I'll deal with
the wire alright guys so thank you guys
