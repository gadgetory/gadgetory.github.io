with another review today we're gonna be
taking a look at the note 9 now this is
the first phone review on the channel
and I figured what better way than to
get this amazing device so I picked it
up and I've been using it for the past
two weeks I took it to Hongkong overseas
and it was my main device over there for
taking photos for making calls for
texting for media consumption while I
was overseas
I didn't bring my laptop I didn't bring
a tablet I just brought the note 9 and
this thing did not disappoint me so
today I want to give you guys a little
bit of a different perspective and
something that I didn't see most reviews
mentioning and that is the sound this
thing is amazing
for your Bluetooth devices as well so I
want to go over some of the details
about that and more in this review but
before we begin guys don't forget to hit
that subscribe button for more content
like this now coming from a smaller
device an iPhone X the 6.4 q HD Super
AMOLED display looks gorgeous it's
really big it's great for media for
gaming for consuming videos like YouTube
and things like that which I loved
it's super vibrant and super punchy with
that comes a lot of saturation and I
didn't notice that compared to my iPhone
except the pictures did really get a
little bit oversaturated sometimes
especially like skin tones but because
of the punchy vibrant colors it makes
everything that much more fun it makes
games pop out of your screen
it makes photos pop out of your screen
and another thing that I like about the
size of this is that I can show people
memes and not have them grab my phone
you guys know what I'm talking about you
go you just want to show somebody your
phone you just want say hey look at this
like funny thing ha ha ha and they grab
your phone because they can't see it
because they're on this little screen
right so I really enjoyed just being
able to show people from far away and
they can just read and see the whole
meme without even having to grab my
phone out of my hand so that is a very
nice feature that's not really a feature
but it's something that I enjoyed one
thing I did notice what the Infinity
display is that
on the rounded edges sometimes lighting
can kind of make a line across the top
kind of a glare so it's depending on the
light you just have to turn the phone
sometimes but I did notice that it did
happen some of the time coming from an
iPhone user this phone is huge now I've
had the six plus in the past and coming
up to this phone it's just wow you need
two hands to really operate this phone
and they kind of make it that way right
with the s-pen and we'll get more into
the usages of this pin later build
quality of this phone looks amazing I
love the blue and I love the yellow
contrasting pin so the design it looks
amazing it feels amazing in your hand
the buttons feel great I don't know why
they put in a big speak button I know
that you can download software to get
rid of it but why do you need a full
fledged Bigsby button nobody uses Bigsby
I mean do you let me know down in the
comments below now this thing has a face
and iris scanner and I did notice that
you really have to look up top to where
the camera is sometimes for it to
register your face with the iris which
could be annoying it sometimes it wasn't
as fast as my iPhone decks where I can
just like look down and it can somehow
recognize my face from an angle but this
one you really have to put it in front
of your face for it to work but that
being said it does work it also has a
fingerprint reader on the back which is
nice and I really like the placement of
the fingerprint read it also doesn't
need a dongle to use headphones that's
right it has a headphone jack guys which
is very nice because I was able to bring
my shirt sc8 four sixes along with me on
the trip and I just enjoyed not having
to have something extra in between me
and my phone and not having to worry
about do I have my dongle with me so
that was nice it also uses USB C which
you plug into the bottom to charge the
phone it also connects wirelessly you
can wirelessly charge this phone as well
which is nice now I found the S Pen to
be great I love just pulling this thing
out making notes and things like that I
thought that it would be gimmicky and
that I wouldn't use it but I actually
used it a lot like I was pulling out
when I had a thought about you know
something I want to do for these videos
or I thought about the review for this
phone or other devices I was able to
just pull out my phone and just write it
down I didn't have to have a notebook on
me like I do sometimes
I just pulled out my phone and was able
to just write and it's so much nicer
than typing on a phone I don't know I'm
a very hands-on person I really like the
feeling of just writing and creating so
it was nice to just have that pin there
and pull it out in make notes it also
has other usages like skipping songs by
pressing double tapping it and triple
tapping it to go back it also has a play
button for playing songs I use it
sometimes only when I had my pin out and
I was writing something already that I
used a double tapping other than that I
just left it as is I would just control
my music regularly you can also take
pictures with this pin as well which is
nice if you want to prop your phone up
somewhere and take a picture across the
room you can do that as well
I found the UI of this coming from the
iPhone X a lot snappier than the iPhone
X and all surprising to me I always
thought Apple had one of the smoothest
experiences out there but this phone is
fast and it's smooth Android has
improved a lot now I had the Android G
one back in the day and that thing was
like the first Android device so I've
been it with Android since the beginning
up until I think that s two Galaxy s2 so
it's now coming back to this phone and
really seeing the progress that they've
made validate used to have to run roms
and things like that and I didn't want
have to deal with that just to make my
phone run fast but they really made
TouchWiz a lot better and it runs a lot
faster nowadays and I don't feel like it
gets in the way of me controlling the
phone or doing what I need to do with
the phone there's also two versions of
this phone there's a six gigabyte 128
and there's an 8 gigabyte of RAM and 512
gigs of storage which is amazing that's
mind-blowing and that is expandable up
to one terabyte you can put a 512
gigabyte microSD card into one of these
phones which is I'm saying that I didn't
notice any other reviewers mentioning is
that this has a PTX
HD and Sony's L DAC now I just picked up
the Sony 1000x m3s they sound amazing
and I was able to turn on LD AC which is
the highest transfer rate of music
through bluetooth right now so there's
not going to be any lag you're gonna get
the best possible quality from your
music as well
and nobody's talking about this that is
amazing now in comparison the Apple code
act that the iPhone uses is AAC which
only transfers up to 256 kbps a second
whereas this is 996 kbps that is almost
five times the data raised transfer guys
Wow so that's one thing if you're really
serious about music and you love
Bluetooth and things like that and you
have Bluetooth headphones or devices I'm
going to the best possible quality your
quality fiend an audiophile fene go with
the note 9 this thing is amazing for
music so let's talk about the camera for
a little bit these have dual 12
megapixel cameras on the back and a
facing camera that is amazing
I really love all the selfie Mo's like
the selfie focus mode I did notice that
the selfie focus mode it blurs off the
background and things like that but if
you have two people in the picture it
kind of doesn't know what to blur out
and it can kind of be hit or miss and
some of your face can end up being
blurred but if it's one person I'm gonna
take a selfie somewhere it works really
really well I also love the selfie wide
mode we can get a wide vision of your
surroundings by tilting the phone it's
actually really really good I love that
you can like hold your hand up to the
camera and it will then give you a three
second countdown to take the picture and
here I'm gonna show you guys a couple of
pictures that I took while I was on
vacation in Hong Kong it also shoots 4k
video and it has slo-mo this camera
looks good and I think he can compete
with the iPhone X and another thing that
I really really enjoyed is using the
s-pen to edit my pictures now not the
cheesy ones and all that stuff in the
app but I actually used Lightroom a lot
to edit it and you can like select
deselect you can edit certain parts with
the brush and things like that the
highlights the mid-tones and things like
that color and it really really does a
good job I love the pin for this reason
and it's another reason why I think this
is just a great all-around media phone
now one thing I want to touch on that I
haven't touched on lastly is the battery
life now when I was in Hong Kong I never
had to worry about this phone dying
point-blank period I just let this thing
I just used it all day I'll use it all
day out
back with 50% I would use it for finding
restaurants I would use it for watching
videos I would use it for taking
pictures I'll use it for Instagram
YouTube everything and I never had to
worry about this phone
whereas iPhone I was I had to bring my
battery pack but I did not use my
battery pack once on my trip guys and I
was out all day from like I'm talking
about 9 a.m. to midnight I was out all
day and this phone I never had to worry
about it dying on me this phone is
amazing I definitely recommend it
especially I know a lot of you guys here
are for headphones and this thing goes
really well with any headphones that you
want again if you have Sony if you have
something it uses aptX bluetooth or the
HD this thing knocks all of it out of
the park it has a great camera all-day
battery life a great screen for watching
YouTube like my videos and it's all
around just a great device I have no
complaints the only complaint that I can
see is that I have to handle this with
two hands now I did drop this once
because I was fidgeting around with it
and things like that and I ended up
dropping it because it was so big so
this is a two-handed device if you're ok
with all that you love this pin you want
a brake camera you want you consume a
lot of media this phone is gonna be a
great choice it's coming in a thousand
dollars which is kind of steep but I
think for all the features that they
pack into this I think something like
this is more worth it than an iPhone X
right now alright guys so that is going
to do it for this review I hope you guys
have enjoyed this review if you have any
more questions about the note 9 or you
want to just say hello down below I'll
be sure to answer you guys and I'll see
you guys in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
