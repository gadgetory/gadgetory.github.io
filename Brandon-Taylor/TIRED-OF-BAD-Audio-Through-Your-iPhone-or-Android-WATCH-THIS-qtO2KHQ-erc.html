your phone do you not want to spend $300
on a dedicated high five I do file
player then those videos for you today
I'm going to be sharing with you guys an
easy way to upgrade your iPhone and
Android device audio without the need to
carry around a dedicated music player
this is a setup that I had been using
and is dummy well over the past couple
of months its pocketable and gives you
enough power to power your IEMs or cans
on the go so as some of you guys may
have found iPhones and Android phones
may lack the power and volume necessary
and needed to drive your headphones
properly it might not even be the
earbuds fault that your phone doesn't
have enough power so what you can do is
you can pick up a feel q1 mark 2 Dec
aunt for $100 it comes with an ox ox
Jack a USB micro 2 USB Lightning a USB
micro 2 USB and if you have a USB C
device you have to pick up a cord but
those are only like 6 dollars so you're
spending 106 dollars to upgrade the
entire audio setup that you have on the
field q1 mark 2 you'll find a gain
switch from low to high a base switch to
increase the base of your headphones so
for those of you who feel like your
headphones just don't have enough mm
enough base here is your solution
staring right back at you in your face
it has two headphone jacks one is a 3.5
millimeter the other is a 2.5 and
there's a line out if you want to
connect it to speakers or things like
that it also has a volume knob which is
what you use to control the volume of
your music while playback it's also got
a DSD indicator when playing DSD files
all I know this thing has powered
everything that I've thrown at them with
ease the bass boost is also great
boosting the lower end by 5.4 dB it's
not obnoxious by any means but it just
gives your headphones a slight little
oomph
a little Rumble to them which is nice
the reason why this DAC amp is so
important is that you can boost the
power aka the volume output to higher
levels without distortion and these do a
remarkable job of that my headphones of
choice of course being the SE 8 4 6 is
by sure which are pretty expensive but
offer great bass and isolation
I also switch off to the one more quad
drivers which are a little bit more
affordable I'll link both down below but
they give great fidelity as well and
instrument separation for a full review
of both these headphones check out the
link in the description alright guys so
that is a short video this time but this
setup can really make a difference in
your day to day audio setup on the go
thank you guys for watching and don't
forget to Like share comment and
subscribe in this video I'll see you in
the next video is being a boy bTW saying
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
