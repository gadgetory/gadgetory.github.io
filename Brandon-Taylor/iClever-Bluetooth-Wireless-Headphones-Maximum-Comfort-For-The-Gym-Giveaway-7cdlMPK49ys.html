this dog
my head
what is up guys is BT back here again
with another review today I am going to
be bringing you guys the iclever
lightweight bluetooth headphones now
they are gracious enough to send me out
a pair and they also are going to give
away a pair to one of my subs so I will
tell you at the end of the video how you
can win a pair of those so let's get
started these are coming in at about $26
run-of-the-mill basic packaging you're
not gonna get many frills with this
because they don't need to they don't
they're not on the shelves with beats
and Bose and jabbers so why do they need
great packaging it's just you're buying
these for the headphones come with the
standard three tips they come with the
standard three wings and overall I like
to say that these are very very
comfortable they're very very secure I
really had to go out and try these I
danced with them I took them to the gym
I tried to spin around get them out of
my ear and these things stay put and I
think it's mostly attributed to this
little rubberized wing that goes all
around the headphone not just into the
crevices of your ear it's going all
around so that all contact services are
working together to keep these into your
ear and it really really works they
don't look like they're gonna fit into
your ear very well but they do now the
remote is one thing I enjoy about these
the the buttons feel very responsive and
a lot of the cheaper Laurine headphones
the buttons the remotes just don't feel
that great and this one feels pretty
solid it doesn't feel like it's gonna
break
it doesn't feel cheap and the buttons
when you click them they gave a very
nice satisfying click so comfort in
design I really enjoyed using these the
cord even it's not that cheapo material
plastic hard material is actually a soft
lightweight material that feels very
good especially when it's on your neck
so let's talk a little bit about the
sound now the sound is so-so guys I'm
not gonna lie to you guys
these
they're good enough to pass for $26
headphones I would say they're very
accurate but my main gripe with these is
once they get past a certain volume one
earphone starts to act differently it
starts to get louder than the other and
they start cutting in and out and
instead of maybe trying to put that high
high volume in here I wish they would
have kind of leveled it off to the point
where it was cutting off instead of
trying to go past what these can really
handle these drivers cannot handle that
amount of volume but that being said I
do think these sound good for the price
these are going to be best with rapping
EDM the vocals and the minutes on these
are very laid-back so I wouldn't
recommend these for anything that is a
very vocal forward now the battery life
is rated at 8 hours and that was what I
was able to get with these headphones
that lasted me actually a whole week of
working out the call quality is actually
very good on these as well and that's
one thing where I feel like Bluetooth
headphones need to really come up in
it's an area that a lot of people are
disappointed I see in the comments a lot
that you guys are disappointed by call
quality from Bluetooth technology
started off as those little earpieces
that you could talk to and I don't know
why they haven't really brought that
technology over to headphones just in
general that being said I do think that
these sound very good when on the phone
with somebody whether that's them
talking to you and people that you will
talk to well thank you for using these
because they actually sound really good
and one last thing that I want to really
touch on with these headphones is they
have a 24-hour support system so if your
headphones break down they are there for
you they are there to back you up on
these headphones and I really appreciate
that about a company especially a
company that's not as big as some of
these other companies and these other
big companies don't even offer us that
so a really good job now these 13 grand
headphones
really good especially for the price
they're $26
so these $26 headphones I can recommend
if you guys are on a budget if you guys
are looking for something super super
secure I would recommend these mostly
for those that are working out and you
guys work out maybe three to four times
a week and you need some great
headphones that will just stay in your
ear or maybe you have kids that you know
break down all their headphones and you
don't want to buy them that expensive
pair because you want to see what
they're gonna do with these or how they
treat their headphones these are gonna
be great for you I think if you know
highs in classical and mids and vocal
Ford music is your thing then you may
want to look elsewhere but all in all I
can recommend these wholeheartedly to
you guys
ic find myself going for these a lot
because of the fact that they just stay
in my ear to win a pair of these write
in the comments who your favorite sports
team is doesn't have to be football or
basketball can be soccer it could be
football it could be any athlete or team
that you support or that you really like
write it down in the comments below for
a chance to win all right guys so that's
been your boy BT I hope you guys have
enjoyed this review and I will see you
