what is up guys is BT back here again
with another review today we have the QC
30s by Bose the quiet comfort 30s now I
was super hyped for these because I love
their QC 20
they were amazing headphones and now
they've made a wireless version of them
and I can say that they do not
disappoint
or do they I'm going to tell you in this
review whether they are worth that $2.99
price tag which is really hefty which is
really hefty now let's get into the
comfort in the design now bose is known
for their extreme comfort hence the
quiet comfort name and i can say without
a doubt that these do not disappoint
they live up to the name and then some I
would forget that they're even there
most of the time so one tip that I do
have when you put these into your ears
push them in a little bit so push them
towards this way into your canal a
little bit and it will create a better
seal the comfort is just out of this
world with the stay here plus tips
I just cannot rave more about these tips
I don't know what the engineers are
doing over at Bose but they're winning
guys they're winning a lot now let's
talk about the elephant in the room this
little thing right here this little neck
band right now I was very skeptical of
neck bands I saw people in the gym
wearing them and I was like I have my
sound sport Wireless why do I need that
I just have a cable on my neck you know
but this adds a little bit more
stability to your neck that makes sense
so it'll keep your headphones in place
better than a cord will a cord it might
get caught with the sweat on your neck
or just in your clothes and at work I
would have my headphones like wrapped
around here and I kept expecting these
to fall so I would have these around my
neck obvious
I'd be walking around my job and I would
expect you to like you know headphones
start moving one way or another as
you're walking as the bounce happens but
this keeps them in place and I really
like that so that's something you
struggled with in the past this little
band fixes it now the band has the power
button on the inside it is very hard to
press but that's for a reason and that
is because they don't want you like
going like this or hitting your neck
against a button in it going off and it
has an indicator in here which turns red
when it dies I know because it died on
me and it has a Bluetooth indicator on
there as well and then on the bottom
side it has a place to charge now these
also come with small medium and large
tips as well so you can fit them to your
liking the band is really nice it's made
out of a nice rubber which it doesn't
get sweaty and it keeps that grip enos
on to your skin felt tugging at your
skin so it's really really nice and
comfortable my girlfriend tried them on
and she said she couldn't even feel the
neckband so I'm telling you guys if
you're skeptical make the leap I made
the leap and I'm so glad that I did
because these are becoming a favourite
of mine now the band is a little bit
smaller on the back side so that you're
able to tilt your head back forward and
it's not going to interrupt it's not
going to lift the front of the band up
so that's a very smart design choice by
both now let's get into the sound and
this is where bows really surprised me
these headphones are probably the best
wireless headphones that I have tried
ear buds hands down peer without a doubt
I will put my name I will sign on the
dotted line
these mark my words are the best
sounding wireless headphones that I've
heard
thus far and I cannot recommend them
enough for any genre I mean I was
knocking out rock I was knocking out
Andy I was knocking out rap classical I
haven't put in some metal because
somebody wrote in my comments about
metal so I was like you know I'm gonna
try metal on these and they knocked it
out of the park
so I can confidently say that whatever
you guys want to do with these
headphones go and do it because it'll
shine the vocals on these aren't amazing
the clarity is amazing the hot it has
highs mids lows this is the first time
I've ever gotten to say that in any
headphone it has every single level
nailed clarity everything you guys are
going to be so impressed by these I feel
like the buttons on these headphones are
really nice they're almost like the
sound sport they're a little bit better
though than the sound Sport Wireless and
they're very clicky they're very
responses they're very solid and I feel
like they're going to hold up to a lot
of punishment now on the side they added
a way to increase and decrease the
amount of noise cancellation so let's
say you're not in such a noisy
environment you can just turn them all
the way down or maybe if you're running
you can just turn it all the way down
since you need to hear your surroundings
cars coming bikes that is a really cool
feature that you're able to kind of
adjust how much you want to tune out the
world now has 12 settings that you can
put it at 12 levels once you get about
halfway it's knocking out almost
everything so the one way that I like to
test noise cancellation is I go in my
car I turn the radio all the way up and
I turn the noise cancellation on the
headphones on and then I see if I can
hear the radio and with these they
blocked out the radio completely which
is crazy for ear buds and what these do
is it listens for sounds in your
environment and then it cancels out
that wavelength within the headphones so
if you're in a plane and you hear that
humming this is giving you the opposite
of the humming and cancelling it out so
that you don't hear it so I am very
confident that these will do a great job
now what they're not going to do is
they're not gonna block out people
talking next to people in the gym random
sounds just knocking your weights
clanking around
I heard all of that but it was very
minimized so keep in mind that it's not
gonna do any quick sudden sounds but it
will get rid of any underlying constant
sounds for you so these are going to be
great if you're if you travel on a train
if you travel on planes if you can go
back car whatever you want to do these
will not disappoint you now one thing I
want to note about noise cancellation is
that you don't have to turn up the
volume all the way and that's something
that I've noticed with these headphones
is they're not the loudest headphones
but they don't need to be because the
donors cancellation is so good in every
situation now with all these great
features and me ranting and raving about
how great these headphones are wait a
minute there's going to be a caveat to
this and that caveat is that the battery
life is not that great
I mean it's ten hours but when
headphones die on me in the gym I get
angry and these died on me at the gym
keep in mind that I was using them for
calls I was testing the crap out of them
I was listening to music all day and
they lasted the 10 hours but the
indicator when I went into the gym was
50% about two hours later my battery was
dead and even when my battery died right
before it gave me the indication that it
might be dying soon it said it was at
20% so keep in mind that the battery is
not accurate on these and I don't know
why that is but I found it not to be
accurate because it was saying one thing
and it was showing another so keep that
in mind when you're rocking these to
always keep them charged and I'm
surprised they didn't put a bigger
battery in these
sitting they have the neckband I mean
they might as well have put some
double-a batteries in here like you know
imagine what they could have done with
all the space they have in the band it
makes no sense but I guess you can't
have everything right guys they can't
make the product too good for us right
we got to be wanting more now the
connection is great as well it's not as
good as the Apple's newest w1 chip but
it was fast and it was functional and
connecting to two devices is seamless
guys it is seamless it's probably the
best that I've ever tried even between
Apple's w1 chip or anything like that
and don't wait I got called out for not
talking about in Mike calls with these
headphones with headphones in general I
got called out so I'm going to take care
of that right now before I forget now I
talked to a couple people on the phone
with these headphones and they said that
I sounded far away and people kind of
felt that it was hard to hear me and I I
I'm not the most confident in the mic in
these headphones but what can you do so
if you're going to be using these for
calls a lot you might want to look
elsewhere I don't think that they're the
strongest in that category I don't know
if they usually Bose is good with the
mic so I'm not sure what's going on
maybe it's my connection maybe it's my
carrier I don't know but from what I've
heard and with people the feedback
people gave me is
no bueno so what do you guys think do
you guys think that $2.99 is too much
for headphones let me know in the
comments below what you guys think
because I feel like you're getting such
a good package with these that I almost
don't mind paying that premium price and
if everything all the components all the
materials used for these headphones feel
really nice they feel solid they feel
great
the sound is over the top it's probably
the best that I've ever heard so I'm
willing to take the hit on my pocket my
pocket is going to be hurting after
these blood these will be my newest gym
head these will replace my Beats Studio
twos
finally I've been waiting to get rid of
those forever and these have done the
job I wanted some good earbuds they were
up to par sound wise and these fit the
bill guys I'm telling you guys go out
and buy them right now are they worth
that $2.99 price tag a big fact yes they
are so you don't have to take my word
for it go out try these let me know what
you guys think in the comments below and
tell me what you guys think alright guys
