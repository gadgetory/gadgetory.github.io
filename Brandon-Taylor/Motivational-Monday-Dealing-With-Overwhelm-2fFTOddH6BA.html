with another motivational Monday today
we're going to be talking about
overwhelmed now a lot of times in life
we get overwhelmed by just the sheer
amount of things that we have on our
plates whether it's our goals and
aspirations or family or work light our
friends take care of our pants all these
different things demand our detention
and the more scattered we are the more
out of control we feel so try this
technique that I'm about to share with
you guys and that try to focus on one
thing for a week let's say you want to
get your diet on track for one week make
that your main focus maintain all of
their aspects of your life you know
don't just say you know i'm not going to
show it to work for a week maintain
everything else but put your energy and
time slowly into dieting all that extra
energy except you have into dining for a
week and see if that dieting does not
get better and which what it will do is
it will carry over into the following
weeks that energy you put it to figure
out what kind of foods your body needs
what kind of calories your maintenance
and what kind of workout you need to be
doing figure that out for a week put in
a ton of energy into it hammer down
knock it out and then for the following
weeks after that it's going to be like a
snowball effect and it's going to keep
rolling it's going to get bigger without
you having to put in a ton of energy
right it's like a rocket when a rocket
first starts launching right it takes a
lot of energy for it to get off the
ground but once it's off the ground and
into space
it's just floating that right is it is
getting carried so same thing goes with
your diet the same rule applies and this
can go for anything in life it says your
work life your family life your friends
you know put in that extra time for a
week blast that rock it off whether it's
your family whatever blast that rock it
off and see it just tumble and see it
just gained momentum instead of trying
to put in a little energy to get this
rocket off and it doesn't get off the
ground put a little bit of energy into
your friendships and then it barely gets
off the ground put in a huge blast of
energy and watch that some no blast off
so try this out pick one or two things
will be to just focus on one if you can
try to cut out multi tasking and see if
it doesn't help you progress in your
life rather than trying to fix all your
problems all at once and then getting
nowhere focus on one thing do that one
thing really well and then move on to
the next the next week so let me know
down in the comments below how this has
helped you with your overwhelm or if you
have any suggestions for people that may
watch this video let them know down the
comments below and let me know because
I'm still learning as well and it's
always good to hear other people's
perspectives alright guys so thank you
for watching I appreciate you guys I
will see you guys next Monday for
another motivational Monday</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
