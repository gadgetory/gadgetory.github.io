with another review today we finally
finally finally get to take a look at
the Sennheiser px
C 550 s coming in at 350 dollars they
are direct competitor to Sony's WH 1000
X and to s and the bose qc25 sand and
the Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins P X's now I've been
loving all of Sennheiser's wireless
headphones lately so can these keep that
amazing streak going of amazing
Sennheiser wireless headphones let's
find out today so in the box you'll find
a case a 3.5 millimeter adapter an
airplane adapter handy for those of you
who travel and finally a USB charger one
thing that was oddly satisfying about
the pxc 550 is how you turn on these
things you simply twist the right ear
cup from the laid down position and bam
they are on and they are ready to pair
on the right ear cup you'll find the
Bluetooth switch and effect mode which
I'll get into a little bit later with
sound profiles like a club a movie and a
speech mode I'll get into which profile
I prefer the most out of the three later
on in the review the noise cancellation
switch is also on the right ear cup now
you may be saying where are the volume
buttons where are the controls
well the pxc 550 sr touch controlled and
for my testing these are some of the
most accurate touch controls my fingers
have ever laid themselves upon I have
never had any accidents with controlling
the music the volume goes up and down
when I want when I want to skip a track
back or forward to a positive track it
is super responsive all the way around
I'd even put these over the Sony's touch
controls for sure the ear cups are oval
shaped and very comfortable the overall
footprint of these headphones is very
small
and I don't recommend them for people
with big heads though sorry guys the
leather used here is very comfortable
and doesn't get very hot for those of
you who want to work out in these
overall I love the lightweight design of
these headphones Sennheiser has been
killing the game when it comes to sound
their HD 1 series being some of the best
wireless headphones on the market I
however find these to be a bit thin
these do not feel like they go with the
Sennheiser name at all I don't know I
think I just expected more from them I
honestly think that they're for point
40s and the 4.50 s are a lot better
sounding these are super neutral
probably even more neutral than the Bose
QC 35 s and that's saying a lot
I found these to lack a lot of the
emotion necessary now these do have a
cap tune app which you can change the
huge you can look over the noise
cancellation and things like that but I
didn't feel like it helped that much
compared to their other headphones it
may be slightly bumped the bass slightly
bumped the mids and things like that but
it still left me wanting more and on top
of that the max volume is just so so low
I mean did I just want to fill something
with these headphones anything at all
movie mode seems to be the best in terms
of sound quality all the other modes
accentuate just how thin this sound is I
think that the Sennheiser 4.50 s sound
more clear and crisp at a lower price
point and offer noise cancellation -
what is being offered in the P X C's
they really like that power and like all
aspects here if there is a silver lining
though with these headphones it is that
they offer great noise cancellation it's
very very strong but it stays out of
your way
you can increase the noise cancellation
with the slider which is nice the
battery life is great at 30 hours more
than enough time for the longest of lay
overs and flights they also charge
pretty fast I mean they fully charge in
about three hours which is really good
these also feature NFC pairing and
bluetooth 4.2 from my testing
NFC can be a little bit finicky in
crowded areas and stuff like that voice
max makes your voice sound crystal clear
let's just get that out of the way right
now when making phone calls it does let
in outside noise though and it can be a
little bit distracting especially if
you're in a crowded place you're gonna
hear like the music from the intercoms
and people talking all around you
so it's kind of like you're having a
conversation with the person in the same
room that you're in with all of the
variables so some people may or may not
like it I didn't really like it so with
all that being said the pxc 550's are
great noise cancellation headphone but
that's as far as it goes if you care
about sound then you'll probably be
disappointed especially if you've heard
some of Sennheiser's competitors like
bose or sony so my recommendation is to
pick up the HD one series or even the
450s by sennheiser if you're on a budget
they offer better sound that actually
packs a punch I mean whether we want to
admit it or not emotions play a huge
part on whether we like a headphone or
not and I just can't see people feeling
anything here alright guys so that is
gonna do it for this review if you have
any more questions feel free to ask me
