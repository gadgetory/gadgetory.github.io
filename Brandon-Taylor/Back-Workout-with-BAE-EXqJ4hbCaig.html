LA saw my favorite DJ cascade was
amazing show I gave the show about six
out of 10 but I gave cascades portion to
10 out of 10 because he was really good
but a lot of things are wrong there's a
lot of lines and all this crap that was
going on that just made it it was hard
to get into I'll tell you that much by
the night ended off really well and now
we're back I feel like crap traveled uh
12 hours in like two days so yeah
definitely feeling the effects of that
so just trying to get back on it you
know we have portos which is a bakery in
LA which is amazing and have a lot of
cheese danishes from there so I want to
finish those up this week but with my
planning with the plan is for this week
I am going to have those cheese danishes
after my workouts carb backloading so
right now I'm going to head to chipotle
I'm just going to get some veggies and
meat and then work out and then after
that I'm and have all my cars which is
probably cheated danishes so I'm gonna
do that for the next couple days kind of
do some carb backloading like that
that's really benefit from the extra
carbs and then the following week what
my plan is is to do two days of a low
carb no carb 250 gram and then a high
carb day which is like the cereal day
that I posted if you haven't seen that
go check that out so anyways I'm gonna
take you guys to chipotle and show you
what I get
can you guess what this is
steamed veggies
welcome to me if you don't use this I
don't know what you're doing to the best
right here kool aid to Bath Tabasco you
don't put this on your bowl I don't know
just makes it that much better I can't
have it without this
so hey I said I got veggies

road right here
