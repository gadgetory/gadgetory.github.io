another review today we are gonna be
taking a look at the sole run free pros
now I've been using these on and off for
about the past six months so I think I
can give you guys a good idea of what
these do and who they are for during my
time at Hong Kong I didn't see any Sony
I didn't see any bows but I saw a lot of
soul soul is huge over there and for
good reason they make some awesome and
innovative products and their new run
free pros are no exception I mean this
is gonna be a different kind of review
for me because these are kind of a
special earbud I mean soul has managed
to put a personal trainer into your
earbuds these are what they are claiming
to be the world's first 8i earbuds with
G AIT analysis technology to monitor
your run with real-time voice coaching
it encourages good form it pushes you to
get a good cadence when you are running
they also measure your maximum leg force
aka the shock of your feet when hitting
the ground and detect when you need to
lighten your step
it also takes into account your symmetry
as well it all tracks this in the app
which holds all of your data so you can
improve on your running style over time
this is gonna be great for those of you
who want to get into running but don't
know where to start I will say that
during my testing I tried running in all
different kind of crazy ways to get
these to respond and it did notice when
I did have in proper form it's got
plenty of tips to help you on your
journey as a runner next to the earbud
itself it has a rubberized grip to help
them stay in your ears and I have to say
that these things lock into your ears
without problem I actually like rocking
these just to work or other places not
just for runs because they are just so
comfortable these are also sweat I px5
water-resistant I love that they have
this LED on the side that allows cars to
see you at night if you're a night
runner it's the little things that can
really keep you safe over time so these
have 11 hours of playback with two hours
to charge them fully it's got a PT X
bluetooth 4.1 and a 10 meter distance
range which is pretty good last but not
least how do these guys sound well I
have to say that these actually sound
really good there are no slouches in the
sound
it's not gonna give you a world-class
sound don't get me wrong but these
earbuds will get your heart pumping
which is what they are made for and I
find myself actually grabbing these
we're just on the go when I wasn't going
to work out or things like that rap rock
metal EDM you know all the high-energy
workout music sound great on these so if
you're somebody who is looking to get
into running or a beginner I think these
can be a perfect companion to not only
push you to motivate you but to also
prevent injury and perfect your running
form alright guys so that is going to be
my time thank you guys for watching
don't forget to Like share comment and
subscribe and I will see you guys in the
next video it has been your boy bt
