you can crash it down what's up guys is
BD here and this is a review of the
collaboration between mash drop and meze
the meze 9 900 are closed back
headphones now lately I've been rocking
a lot of well mostly open-back
headphones and because of that I've been
kind of missing that bass that wore me
punchy sound that some closed back
headphones give and so the meze 99
seemed to be what I was looking for and
then some
so today I'm gonna be going over what I
love about these $200 headphones which i
think is a steal by the way now mash
drop did send these out to me but all
the opinions in this video are my own I
haven't been directed in any kind of way
guys so let's start with what's in the
box now in the box we're gonna find that
woven nylon case and aux 2 quarter inch
adaptor an extra set of ear pads a 6
foot headphone cord with controls now
these have a very lightweight
construction with their CNC carved
walnut wood ear cups which look and feel
spectacular a quick fun fact is that
they are actually called the 99 in
reference to the cups being ninety nine
millimeters tall the headband is made up
of a stamped magnesium spring steel and
it feels incredible on your head the
spring helps to fit the headphones and
fit them onto your head kind of like a
hammock wood it gives you a nice even
pressure on your head now this is one of
the few headphones guys that I can wear
and not have to constantly adjust it to
get the headband to sit properly on my
head and I think these have to be some
of the most beautifully constructed
headphones I've ever laid my eyes and
hands on they look like they could cost
probably like 10 times the asking price
here if I told you guys that these are
worth $2,000 you might believe me
actually when you put your hands on them
now the Kevlar ofc cord is detachable
with a microphone and remote so if you
ever want to switch over to listening on
your phone you get some added features
like a mic and things like that some
voice commands now this is a small thing
but it's a personal preference maybe
it's just me but I like a thicker cord
it just feels more solid to me but
that's just a personal preference to me
I'm sure that
they know what they're doing and they're
pros at making headphones so I'm just
gonna sit back and enjoy these
headphones the ear cups are made up of
PU leather with memory foam and they
feel amazing and comfortable and they
don't get too hot and they block out
everything around you because the memory
foam is that good seriously like
somebody walked up on me when I was
gaming and scared the out of me
okay out of the box they took a few
hours to really open up but the sound
was so so good after they did it's warm
it's bassy
and they sound great with a lot of
genres out there guys I was pushing the
bass on my are me-80 I to deck and I kid
you not the would start to rattle and it
was like a dope experience it really
like sent chills down my spine you guys
really have to like experience it to
really believe it and to really feel
what like sound resonating off of wood
and really feels like you know you don't
you don't listen to the music you're
really feeling it with these headphones
if you don't have a DAC or amp that
allows you to adjust the EQ you can just
get a uq like peace to you Y and push
these things to the limit there's no
harsh highs as well so you'll have less
listening fatigue over time rap hip-hop
jazz and pop sound absolutely incredible
with these closed back headphones my
go-to album as you guys all knows a
tional wrote it just sounded amazing
Travis's voice just shines on the tracks
with that bass and jazz and rock also
sounded really good with these
headphones Nirvana and Death Cab for
Cutie's sounded really good to me as
well and I know some of you guys saw my
last video black pink also sounded
incredible with these headphones let me
just put that out there right now
and also some people really like closed
back headphones for gaming because of
the explosions and the sounds and
especially like for movies too these
actually I've been actually using these
for my gaming and I've had no problems
with like soundstage and placing enemies
in the map so these are a great deal all
around for 200 bucks so if you guys were
to try to go and buy the meze 9 9s on
their website there would be three
hundred and nine dollars I believe but
when these come out on mass drop these
will be $200 which I think is an
absolute steal for all the quality of
materials that you're getting I feel
like I'm definitely
ripping them off by getting these uh for
this price it's it's kind of incredible
that they were able to bring a $300
headphone down to $200 so whether a
pro-gamer or audio file or whatever your
needs are if you really like a warm bass
e-signature then I think the meze nine
9s are going to be right up your alley
they're going to be what you're looking
for and guys I'm gonna put a link down
below where you can get another $10 off
so 194 these these are beautiful man and
they look sick in like most people setup
so you can't really go wrong all right
guys so that is gonna do it for this
review it has been your boy bt don't
forget to Like share comment and
subscribe and I will see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
