with this I'm you get out of the product
I might be playing the father what's up
guys as promised I'm coming to you with
a video about what's in my gym bag so of
course we're BAM nike you already know
what it is nike always I'm very brand
loyal except for probably my power
lifting shoes those adidas one exception
anyway starting off what I'm going to
touch on is what's in my gym bag the
things that I carry on a day-to-day
basis and just products that I use
supplements and i'll give you a little
overview of what each product does and
why i like it anyways we'll start off
with this belt this is a belt by insur a
she uses bailed on like back days leg
days and now chest days to keep my waist
nice and tight and also prevent back
injuries I just got is pretty expensive
belt but it's worth it to invest in what
if you're serious about lifting yeah I
definitely recommended hey and I'm just
going to go in order so I'm going to
talk about using as I take it throughout
the day of course like I'm going to
pretend like I'm going into a workout so
going into a workout the first thing I
do is I have my pre-workout my pre
workout consists of this new one that I
got evl has a cool label look at ish
whoa that alone I should tell you right
there it's just good but anyways I
really like this one it lad the energy
lasts all the way through my work out
and you know with some like c4 I've
noticed that tourists into my workout I
kind of trash I kind of be really
energized in the beginning and then
nose dive and I can't be having that
 because we go hard you know what I
mean next up and usually when I take
this I usually mix it so I'll take one
scoop of this and I'll take about half a
scoop of team of all just for pump just
because like the way I look with the
pump and this I really recommend this
product this will elevate your
pre-workout another level and it's a
little expensive but it's worth it if
you have the extra money it's not really
necessary in my opinion but I think of
it as you know this is opening your
blood vessels and allowing nutrients
allowing the pre-workout to get to your
muscles and allowing the creatine to get
to your muscles because when you take
caffeine your veins are going to close
right and it's a vasoconstrictor so it's
going to close and nutrients can't in
blood flow can't get to your muscles
right so this is just a extra step that
I take to ensure that I'm getting proper
blood flow to all my muscles and I
definitely notice the difference when I
take it and when I don't take that okay
now next up we have what I'll do is I'll
take some of my bcaa's so I usually put
this into my water jug I'll show you
right here up so I'll have this in my
gym bag usually but this is about a 70
70 ounce water jug and I got this from
walmart so just in case you're wondering
check out one more it's like four bucks
and I see a lot of people at the gym
they don't bring water you know they
just walk over to the fountain that's
definitely not enough water for you to
be getting during your workout as much
as we sweat as much as we as hard as we
go you need a lot of water so usually I
try to finish one of these before i
leave the gym
and I'll fill it up with about two and a
half scoops of this this just ace with
recovery just getting my amino acids
during my workout it gives me a little
bit of a boost I don't know if that's
placebo but it just makes my water
tastes good and I drink it throughout
the day as well because let's face with
drinking water is boring you know I I
can only drink so much water before I
get sick of it and I need something to
clear out my palate when I'm eating
nasty stuff like tuna or dry chicken for
the 50th time in the day so that's a
good one check it out it's pretty cheap
but I think 90 servings is about 50
bucks and I you do about two and a half
servings a day do ever work out and
throughout the day that's that okay so
recently I've kind of changed it up I
haven't been taking protein whey protein
so with that being said I need something
to replace it something that's going to
not bloat me because what a lot of
people may not know is that way comes
from cows milk and if you're lactose
intolerant which I as I'm getting older
i feel like i am you can't digest that
way it is going to cause you stomach
problems I've had some and you're not
going to be able to digest the protein
so it's just a waste so with that
experimenting with that I decided to try
a new product it's um its amino acids is
a it's a mass and recovery catalyst its
cell Kim by evil Djinn and this is a
good one I really like it after my
workout it gives me a blue state has
some nitric oxide in it so that your
amino acids can get to your muscles like
the blood flow like we're talking about
with the pump so this has a little bit
of that in it and I as soon as I take it
I just get a rush of energy it's crazy
like I really love this product hands
down this is the best new product that
I've
I recently and I'll recommend this to
anybody honestly it's it's worth it you
know it's 50 buck for about 40 servings
but I got off amazon check it out the
mango flavor is amazing it tastes really
good and it's just a good alternative to
whey protein which you may not be able
to digest who knows okay next up in my
bag see and besides like gym clothes
which I bring every day you know find it
racers everyday different color every
day um I had my gym clothes in here and
I also the number one thing that I
cannot work out with if I don't have any
products anything headphones headphones
make the difference for me and I just I
don't like hearing people talk and I
don't like Pete hearing people like come
up like as bad as it sounds like when I
get into my workout I just want to work
out I don't want to talk I just want to
 up and these allowed me to do
that they have great base these are the
power beat tues and I went through a lot
of headphones and I came across these
their wireless they don't get in the way
you know they're not the big I have had
the big ones before the on
year-over-year ones and I just I was
sweat on them and be gross these are
great I've had them to get it they I
don't even realize they're on half the
time they're easy to put on they don't
get in your way and you can kind of like
you're somebody just come up to me I
just pop it out like that and I don't
have to like readjust them author out my
workout and it's amazing so check them
out if you haven't I got them on sale so
they're a little bit more worth it they
retail for 200 which I don't think
they're worth it so if you can find them
for about 150 which is why i gotta for
definitely get these okay next we have
something it's kind of like an emergency
pack I guess I guess which is Starkist
tuna in a pack and a pouch it's a
flavored hickory smoked and I love this
I love this on the go you know if you
need the buses I'll just get a plate in
the fork in or just eat out of the back
or you know it's has 19 grams of protein
in it and it's just a good way like on
the go a lot of people don't know about
these check it out if you haven't but I
carry these with me just in case
anything goes have anything happens you
know what I'm saying because
happens okay next in my bag we have the
sony camera bag which is the cameras off
like obvious lamia right now so it can't
be in the bag but it's kind of some bag
set shot like to carry this with me to
the gym I don't take my full gym bag in
the gym obviously but I take this into
the gym and I carry my camera in here
for filming and it just keeps us safe
got it from best buy for twenty bucks so
if you're looking for one I definitely
recommend this sunny okay another thing
I like to put in my bag is this banana
well not this banana but a banana in
general i like to have a banana before i
go into work out for potassium potassium
helps with muscle contractions and it
just it's a good simple card that'll get
you your energy up after a long day at
work so it's not pictured here I left it
in my car is l-carnitine I take that
it's something I've been trying i don't
know if it works it's kind of like a
placebo thing but it's supposed to get
you take it before your workout and it
helps digest use your fat for energy so
i've been trying that out lately i don't
know it might be placebo we'll see but
that's that i hope you guys have enjoyed
this got some ideas for your supplement
stack and your gym bag i mean i know
that's not a lot but it's simple but it
is what it is that's what I carry keep
it simple you know don't worry
complicate things and get the best
results you can this is BP checking out
I hope you guys have enjoyed this and I
will be back soon with another video
