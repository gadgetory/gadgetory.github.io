again with another review today we have
a review on the j-bert Arras the newest
in the j-bird line I finally got my
hands on them and I'm here to give you
guys my thoughts on them I reached out
to j-bird and they actually sent me out
a sample to test so Thank You Jay bird
for that but all these opinions are my
own in the time that I was communicating
with Jay bird they also wanted to go
over some of the issues that I was
having with like the proprietary charger
and why they use it and some of the
audio delay so I'm gonna give you guys
an update on what's been going on with
that as well but before bringing guys
don't forget to hit that subscribe
button for more content like this I'm
doing earbuds headphones phones
computer accessories and pretty soon
computers and computer bills I'm gonna
get into that as well
so stay tuned make sure you're subbed
and there could be a possible giveaway
very very soon possibly on some Jaybirds
so be on the lookout for that
now one thing that Jay Bert has really
nailed this year in 2018 is their
silicone tips and their ear fins these
things remind me of the Bose sound sport
Wireless and those are super comfortable
some of the best silicone on the market
and these can really compete with those
so that's saying a lot so right off the
bat amazing comfort and they also
isolate a lot the oval shape really
helps with blocking out and fitting into
your ear canal to block out gym noise or
outside noises or you can leave them a
little bit loose to let in that outside
noise there's also a tightener on the
back to keep the cord off your neck
there's also a clip as well so you can
clip it to the back of your shirt and
things like that the cord as always is
amazing it's sturdy it's always good
from jaybird the remote is smaller and
lighter than on the jaybird x fours
which I like these are great for if
you're just in the gym and you want to
work out you want a very minimal
headphone then you can save yourself $30
and pay the hundred dollars for these
earbuds and get like the baby brother of
the j-bird x-force
I really enjoyed using this in the gym I
love Jay burrs way of controlling your
music they have the volume rocker which
also doubles as skipping track so if you
hold the positive it'll skip it forward
if you hold the negative it will skip
back a track so it really avoids all of
those unnecessary double
in triple taps that sometimes don't work
correctly and you have to time it right
so I like that they just got rid of that
completely and just do something that
works so I like if it made that Ross a
little bit lighter these are coming in
at thirteen point five grams and the
daybed x fours are fourteen point seven
that's definitely gonna help with
keeping them in place during your
workouts for sound what can I say these
are my favorite wireless earbuds for
sound at the moment it's got great
spatial soundstage I compare these to
somewhat of an open-back headphones but
they don't leak out the sound they
actually keep it very isolated I don't
know how Jaber does it but the drivers
in here are amazing I love the bass
response in these headphones you know if
you want to you can go into the EQ and
change the bass I really like to pump up
the bass and the mids that really just
brings in the richness of songs for me
and the genres that I listen to it could
be different for you guys though if you
want to pump up that hives in the treble
if you love classical you can do that as
well so these are the first earbuds I
really feel like are just super spacious
and the soundstage is great you can hear
it layered like a cake you can have your
ms your vocals and your bass doesn't
over covet the troubles just roll off
nice and tidy at the top it's just an
amazing experience top to bottom I love
these and I think these are actually the
same drivers I was looking at the specs
as the jaybird x4 so you're getting an
amazing value with these save yourself
30 bucks why not so one problem that I
really had with j-bert is the
proprietary charger like what if you
lose it what if you don't have it with
you and your headphones are dying which
is all still valid points but now I kind
of see why they're doing it they're
doing it to keep sweat from getting into
the electronics and to keep it I px7
rated so you can submerge these up into
a one meter and water and they'll be
fine up to thirty minutes I believe so
yeah
these will do a great job if you are a
huge sweater still not a fan of the
proprietary charger but at least there
is some reason behind it and it's a
pretty good reason in my opinion because
it'll lead to your headphones and
earbuds lasting a lot longer so the
battery life is six hours down from
eight hours on the J brew X fours this
is still pretty good I
myself being able to get through almost
an entire week with the just east air
but it's going to the gym about one to
two hours a day
yeah the battery was great in my opinion
I didn't really see a reason to even
need eight hours unless you're going on
a flight then I would say go with the
Jaybirds or you know you're not gonna be
able to charge for a long time ago with
the j-bert you need that extended
listening if not why not just go with
these and save yourselves from dough so
call quality has never been a strong
suit of the j-bird lines they sound
tinny like you're in a hallway these are
mainly made for sports and working out
and the occasional call once in a while
they do the job just fine
but don't use these for business or if
you are taking important calls or you
need to call your family they're barely
gonna hear you
so yeah definitely go with something
else in that case but if not if you're
just using these for a workout headphone
these will do just fine another area
where I had a lot of issues is the
connection when I first took these into
the gym I had iOS 12
I took them into the gym and there's a
ton of breakups but it was actually a
bug with iOS itself once I reset to the
network settings on my phone I'll give
you guys the directions down below if
you need to do it as well I did that I
took him back to the gym and they worked
perfectly fine and they have the same
Bluetooth range as a jaybird X fours
these are also rocking the new Bluetooth
5.0 so yeah you get a lot of great tech
in these earbuds alright guys so that is
gonna do it for my review of the J Berta
Ross I love these earbuds they're one of
my favorites now I love what j-bird is
doing with the sound and the sound stage
of their ear buds j-bert never change
and that eq mmm just so good it's so
good it's really hard to beat when I go
to other ear buds I really miss that
feature I download their app I'm trying
to look to see if they have an EQ and
they never do
so jaybird thank you for having the EQ
whoever came in with that idea is a
genius they need a raise alright guys so
thank you guys for watching if you have
any more questions be sure to let me
know down below if you haven't already
