what is up guys it's BTW back here again
with another motivational Monday happy
new years to all you guys out there I
hope you guys stayed safe and celebrated
with your loved ones and now you get to
celebrate with me so here we are so
today I want to talk about the topic of
celebrating small wins this year so I
see a lot of posts like oh you know 2016
was terrible I you know I had a terrible
year and with those people I can tell
that they're not celebrating their small
wins you can either have a bunch of
small wins that add up to a huge win or
you can would be waiting all your life
for that one big win and it will never
come or if it does it's like lightning
striking or winning the lotto it's very
very seldom that's going to happen it's
going to happen over time it's going to
be all those little small victories that
you enjoy why not life is short enjoy
those small little victories and your
life would be so much better a lot of
times we dismiss that oh this person did
something great of course they did
something great and then when you do it
you say oh well it's you know it's just
a fluke I don't know how this happened
you know it must be by an accident or
something see the difference so this
year I'm inviting you guys to use the
phrase of course of course I got over a
thousand subscribers last year because I
make great videos see how that works it
brings a smile to my face or I could say
oh well it was a fluke i mean i don't
know it's just dumb luck you know but
the more you celebrate those small wins
and give yourself credit it's going to
boost your self-esteem gonna boost your
confidence you're going to be able to
try more things new things and you will
succeed at those have little small ones
at this and all of them are going to
up all of them are going to add up into
one big win which is your life which is
your purpose so guys this year celebrate
those small wins and you're going to end
up with a big win for 2017 all right
it's been your boy BTW i will see you
guys in the next video peace
when you did it right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
