another common Terry today we have a
request you know I listen to you guys
and we have a request today we have the
bose QC 35 in the matte black now I've
wanted the qc25 for a very very very
long time and I didn't get them because
like I said before once you go wireless
you don't go back let me come on you
know so first we're going to start with
the comfort I mean these are the quiet
comforts so I you know we're gonna have
to talk about the comfort now they have
these a nice little leather cups here
and I really like them I used them for I
mean some of you may get on it but I use
them for working out you know as one of
those people in the gym because I wanted
to test out the noise cancelling
capabilities so I tested these out and I
never got any ear fatigue I never like
got tired almost forgot that they're
there sometimes they're very light light
weight for what they pack into this
package so I'm really impressed with
that there has this leather on the top
it has cloth on the bottom which is
really nice feels very premium feels
like it's very good and we can also talk
about the durability now these stretch
out a whole lot a whole lot so I really
like that feature on these two so if
you're traveling and let's say you're
sleeping right you're sleeping this is
me sleeping on a plane if I was sleeping
on the plane right and I roll over
whatever you don't want them to break
you know they have that flexibility
where they're not going to break on you
so that's a very good feature to have
for travel you know if you want throw
these into your back real quick you know
sometimes when you're at the airport and
you just want to throw something in the
back you know keep going through TSA is
such a pain so throwing these in your
bag whatever that's gonna you're gonna
have a little bit of peace of mind
whereas you went in with some other
contenders for the noise canceling over
here now with that being said let's talk
about why you get these you get these
for the active noise cancellation right
and the way it works is it doesn't work
in the sense that you're going to feel
like you're in a sound booth or whatever
like you can't hear the rest of the
world you're going to hear voices you're
going to hear babies crying you're going
to hear loud sharp noises you're going
to hear all that I'm going to tell you
why because these they have a little mic
here which gathers sound frequencies
from the outside world and it then
projects the opposite frequency into
your ears so it blocks it also it
cancels it out so you got the outside
and you got the inside coming together
and they meet and they cancel right so
that's how it go so it has to be a
consistent sound that's why these works
so well in the airplane has to be like
right you're going to hear this at the
beginning made the first five snaps and
after a while it's going to slowly
disappear because it's going to these
headphones will know what to listen for
so that's why when you're on a plane you
know when you hear the the engine
roaring
it's the same amount of noise frequency
that's coming through so it can easily
block that out it's easily going to buck
that out but when you catch it off guard
when there's something that may be a
baby crying out of nowhere right you're
going to hear it at first and it will go
away right when you hear like a sharp
noise or maybe waste dropping of the gym
or when you hear a flight attendant
bumper card into your chair you're going
to hear it you know you're going to hear
all that because it's not ready for that
it's not already putting out that other
frequency to block that out for you all
right so don't get these to try to think
that you're gonna block out all the
noise don't come back to the commons
bank BTW you told me you lied and told
me that these block out all sounds and
everything and I felt like it was in the
sound booth about the record a record no
it's not happening okay so next up let's
talk about the sound now this is where
Bose gets one over and I saw and I read
amazon comments I do a lot of research
on all headphones that I do reviews on I
go a look at what people are saying
about them and I tested for myself and I
gather as much information I can to
compile it into this it to this review
even even customers to me we are the
ones that are using the these products
right so that's what's the most
important outside world usage alright so
what I found is hold on I found a lot of
people saying oh these are just noise
canceling headphones right these just
their active noise canceling headphones
that's what you're paying 350 for why
counter that and say why can't they have
amazing sound stage amazing you know
amazing sound that would put these over
the top you're telling me for our harder
and $350 you cannot put in some sound
stage into these some you know more a
better quality I understand that the
active noise cancellation is good but
from what I've read it's the same one
that's in the key
c25 so what did they use all that money
from the qc25 for for if not to research
to put better technology after year
after year into their products we
deserve that you know they're a big
company we're spending our hard-earned
money so they have to do making a huge
profit on these you know all they did
was put a receiver into the qc25 bingo
we pay a hundred dollars more I
guarantee you they're making a huge
profit up off that and I'm gonna keep it
real with you because that's what's
happening you know and I just wanted I
want to tell you guys by comparison this
is what I use for my mac i use the
sennheiser 598 and they have amazing
sound stage you're a little lacking on
the base but they're good neutral
headphone I get here all the instruments
I love just putting these on and just
sitting back and relaxing right so why
can't if sin Hazar can put in a hundred
fidel our headphones now i think they
can put a hundred fifty dollar
headphones sound stage that's amazing
and bows $350 puts in okay sound why
can't they just do a dragon ball z
fusion and just
you
bring the best of both worlds together
and make something that's untouchable it
literally if they did that these would
be untouchable but they're touchable
because of that reason and i think the
sound quality is okay and i think if
you're not going to be traveling if
you're not going to be you know road
trips or whatever you don't have another
pair of active noise-cancelling
headphones be my guest get these but my
thing is why not just get a cheaper pair
of active noise-cancelling headphones
that have just the same amount of sound
and i'm gonna do a comparison really
soon on the so be be able to look out
for that okay so getting more into the
sound these sound good but they're not
great and I feel like they used a Bose
name these the active noise-cancelling
as a front to make us pay more money and
we have to be okay with it oh they have
the all this technology for the noise
cancelling in here so alright i guess
the the consumers will just buy this up
and you know when the sound quality is
just okay they'll say exactly that it's
just okay but the active
noise-cancelling well i can tell you
that if you use it in here if you use
with the comply tips or if you use any
anything bluetooth whatever you can get
as much isolation as these all right and
you can block out voices too I can't
hear when I have in ear headphones
in I think that your money could be put
towards other things I mean if you have
the money and you travel a lot and
you're on a plane a lot by all means get
these I think they're worth in that
aspect but the sound quality to price
ratio which these are headphones I don't
care put aside that have noise canceling
these are headphones these are made for
sound so that should be tight if not the
the
the frontrunner for most important thing
at least tie for the active noise
canceling these you know what I mean so
that's my only complaint with these
otherwise I think they're a good
headphone they get they get loud they
have base which I do think they improved
on a little bit Bose has always been a
little flat I always describe their tone
as in the middle they don't want to
offend anybody they don't want to go too
low they don't want to go too high they
just like to sit in the middle so that
they can please everybody right so
that's how I feel about the sound and
these kind of continue with that they
did add a little bit of bass and these
do Rumble a little bit which I really do
enjoy and I really liked but if you
already have active noise-cancelling
headphones or you're going to be on a
plane and you already have the qc25 I
think you're you're okay with keeping
that a 350 in your bank and using it for
other things if I had to rape them out
of 10 I would take off two points
probably for just the price of them you
know if they brought down the price
maybe 300 250 I think that these would
be a good value but 350 I don't think so
alright guys well thank you for tuning

mine I hope you guys enjoyed this review
