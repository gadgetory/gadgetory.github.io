with another motivational Monday today I
want to talk about not taking things
personally it's so easy to take things
that people do or say personally as an
attack on you but you have to remember
that these people they're not doing it
because of you they're doing it because
that's just how they are it has nothing
to do with you it has everything to do
with how they see the world things have
happened to them circumstances
situations they've been hurt so whatever
people do they try to hurt other people
so you need to remember that nothing
anybody ever does is because of you
because of the person you are because of
your personality doesn't matter how good
you are how how charitable you are
people will still find a way to come at
you and sometimes I can see in my con is
other people's comments and I was just
laughs I have to feel sorry for these
people you know even like a tech review
people come in and try to hate it's like
it's just a tech review i sent a date
it's just a tech review like it's not
hurting anybody it's not hurting them
personally but they have to reach out
and try to hurt people and I always find
it funny almost and I'm a little bit sad
that life has brought them to a place
where they feel like it's necessary to
do these things think about it we need
people were typing out the comments or
when people in your life for coming at
you for no apparent reason you could be
a good person which I'm sure most of you
guys are you have to remember that none
of this no matter what you do no matter
who you are how good of a person more
somebody will always come after you so
you can't take it personally just brush
it off nothing anybody says it is
it's because of you you know you go out
be the person that you are meant to be
the person that you feel like is the
best version of yourself always continue
to improve and you allow yourself to
make mistakes and that's okay you're
going to get better and better and
better while your haters stay the same
alright guys so that's been this week
