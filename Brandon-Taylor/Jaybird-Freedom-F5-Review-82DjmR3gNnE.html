review on the j-bird freedoms these are
legit I'll say that they retail for
about two hundred dollars it's pretty
expensive but for wireless we're gonna
be looking in that price range
anyways especially for like better
quality better sound and you know me I
love my goods I love my good sound so
these they come with a lot of different
options how you can wear them you wear
them over the year like this right you
can wear them under the neck like I do
like this I mean you can even wear them
like this if you want right I prefer
like this I just found like I need to
adjust them less this way when I have
them over here and I had to adjust them
a lot so this way they they just stay in
I mean and also to another good thing
when you let's say you're doing running
or any type of like physical activity
any bounce around a lot you're gonna
have to be turning your neck a lot what
I found was that when I do that it would
come out alright I start to move so hey
genius ingeniously I hit this clip this
clip right here now this clip clips on
to the back of your shirt so like the
first clip on to your shirt so like that
it's clipped this when I move course
stays in place you see it's not it's not
moving at all so that is freaking
amazing once I did that I stopped having
any problems with this with this unit so
let's talk about the battery life the
battery life is about four hours and I
like to blast my music so a little I
would say I have
to last up to I think five hours on this
just on this it also comes with a little
adapter a little a charging port battery
extendable battery and this just clips
on like so and it adds on another four
hours I've only had to use this like
once and I was when I first got the
headphones and I want to use them right
away and I didn't get a full charge but
then that it lasts about one workout
alright so maybe saying okay that's kind
of like shitty but when I would have to
the beat the pyro so I've had the power
B's and I have cheaper Dex twos they
claim eight hours but they're nowhere
near eight hours I work out for about
two hours I bodybuild so I work out six
days a week six maybe seven times a week
if I go renting or something outside so
I work out a lot and when I had those I
was not able to work out two times in a
row comfortably it would either die by
my second at the end of my second
workout anyways or or like I would have
to charge them before that or I knew I
wasn't going to have enough battery to
get through the whole workout and
they've never those were never lasted
more than one workout anyways so I saw a
lot of people commenting on on the the
forums like hey four hours a pattern
like no way like I don't want that light
these other like generic ones they're
the freakin 12-hour battery but
everybody that I've and I asked around
this week people that at my gym that had
like jobless and like some other
headphones I've just in generic what's
off Amazon and they said it lasts one
workout maybe two in the second when it
dies out so what I saw I think that
these actually have a
battery life I do like by themselves I
think they have a better battery life
because not only do you have this we
have the charging port for another four
hours legit four hours so you're getting
a legit eight to ten hours off these two
things now I've never when the mob will
say when the charging clip is in it's a
little bit more it's a little heavier
you know obviously it's gonna be a
little heavier on this side but the only
time I found a problem with it was when
I was cycling and when I was cycling I
was like you know Gert you're bouncing
up and down and it was starting to like
come out a little bit I just readjust it
it so it's a small I wouldn't recommend
it for like running with the clip unless
maybe you had it like the over ear like
that I probably wouldn't recommend it
but I like I like the the buttons on
these I will say that you do have to
kind of like it's not just like you hit
it and it goes up you kind of have to
press down press down press down kind of
hold it for like a second each time and
that will that's been a little annoying
I will say but than that I really like
the remote if you hold down on the mind
the low button then it goes mute they
mutes your mic if you go I'm not sure
what you what happens when you hold up
but obviously oh yeah when you hold a
best during a call it means holding that
- goes back a track holding the up the
up volume increases are goes to the next
song and I want to talk about next is
the call quality so as soon as I put
these on like the other person's voice
is very clear my voice is very clear no
issues whatsoever that and comparing to
the day bird x twos
it's way better when I had the X twos it
was like very tinny was very like people
just getting all kind of wind noise I
could hear it just me talking to the
person it just sounded very bad call
quality
why so that's another upgrade that they
did and talking about the j-bird x2 I
had the tapered X twos right they were
and how our view on that go check that
out if you need to see it I did have
them so I'm not trying to like pulling
over on you guys I did have them so one
thing that I love the soundstage that
they have and that continues with these
right so they have the soundstage at
those house and compared to the power
Beach the power bees have no sound stage
is just loud
so with these it in your ear it if
they're very small
alright so I get to see that they're
very small you take this off so this is
size right and that's going on in your
ear the the Jaber next tooth those are
like plugs those little were legit plugs
like it would stick out of my ear so
much and it would be like so
uncomfortable for me that like I would
have to adjust them all work out like no
matter if it's over under your whatever
ear like I just cannot get a good fit
Kampai tips which are the foam tips I
couldn't do well with these they're very
comfortable
they're very light it doesn't feel like
they're gonna fall out maybe in the
beginning of my workout when when I'm
first getting started and you know kind
of more aware and like you know I'm like
okay how's the fit how's it fit then
that's when I noticed but after that
after I get settled in I don't have to
move these at all during my whole
workout I can just work out so I really
enjoy that about these the smaller size
does make a huge difference over the x2
and if you don't have don't have the X
twos and if you have the X twos and
you're looking to upgrade I would say do
it
because they're really already looking
at grade you want something better if it
if the j-bert x twos are big or too big
for you if they're not loud enough these
are way loud enough that was my other
complaint with Jay predicts Tuesday's
they weren't not enough they just found
it very flat and they fixed that and
they fixed that with the app that I will
show you right now this app right here
the my sound app now you can they have a
preset ones but you can change you know
two different settings on your on your
jabber next Tuesday and the good thing
about this is when you do that it goes
over into all apps so let's say it
changes the firmware so like let's say
you change an app or you play through
Apple music or you place through Spotify
or you play SoundCloud a lot of EDM sets
right and the sometimes a sound isn't
the best or maybe it's flat or maybe it
sounds very tinny I can she go into the
app and change change how it sounds and
make it sound better and that that right
there that is I think worth the fifty
dollars more than the J Britax twos and
I know they have the Jaber 3s coming out
right I know they have that they were
threes but lick them up they're the same
size and for me that's why I went with
these because the J Brand X 3s are the
same size as the J Brand X twos and
that's my main complaint like I don't
like how big they are maybe for some
people that's okay but for me I could
just never get a good fit they would be
sticking out of my ear like this you
know the only thing I would say what
that is if you like the fit of jaber
next to wait for the X threes if you
like you know the smaller size and
you can deal with the battery click give
these the way the size is way worth it
in my opinion that side of the size that
you're you're losing by going to these
you're actually gaining a lot so that is
that it comes with a lot of accessories
because with let me show you guys comes
with pouch if you guys can tell I have
the blue ones the ocean blue I love the
color I saw the white ones in person I
didn't I don't really like the white
ones too much and okay let me be honest
with you guys I have the white ones and
they got dirty all right be real G I had
the white ones and they were getting
dirty after like three days of use
especially the jam your attention the
Justin the buttons and everything with
your hands now it doesn't know though so
I mean if you're like me and you're
gonna be touching your the enjoy your
workout or you're outside doing dirty
things or running or hiking don't get
the white ones get the black or the blue
so it comes with small medium and large
tips for these the the regular silicon
which is what I use it comes with a
small medium or large of the fins right
these help keep them in your ear some of
the clips and it comes with these two
little cable organizers that keep your
clip from off your neck you know if
you're doing the overhead style or if
you just want a little less than slack
in the back you can use it but I haven't
needed to use that I just used a little
clip thing on the back of my neck and
that has worked amazing alright guys so
that is my review if I was to give it or
a square out of ten I would say I'll
give it a nine
25 right and I take five off because of
the clip the battery clip you know if
they could have got the eight hours in
here that would be great but I think
it's still it's still up to par with the
other headphones but it's not completely
perfect because luckily I have to drive
to the gym so I can just plug it into my
car and make sure my headphones are
charged before I go to the gym but if
you forget or whatever it then you have
to use this and that's kind of
inconvenient so I take out some points
for that but like I said most most
wireless headphones these days they
advertise 812 hours nearly laughs but
work out so either way I mean maybe they
get pull virus on standby or they get 12
hours on low volume but you know US base
hits or whatever trying to like blast
music blast new drake or future EDM
songs
Tiesto of Afrojack it's this isn't gonna
I mean it's that it's not gonna cut it
so anyways not so I forgot to just
mention it comes with these complex as
well I like them but I just find that I
get more bass with the silicon that's
always been true with any headphones
this compact it's kind of take that away
a little bit so I really like the sound
the way they sound with the contact with
the silicon tips worth it if you have
the David X tooth and you don't want the
size upgrade if you don't like if you're
comfortable with the size way for the x3
as simple as that better than the power
beats lifetime warranty so she cannot go
wrong alright guys so that has been my
review I hope you guys have enjoyed it
go out and get these because they're
amazing
so nothing short of amazing the sound
quality is amazing so go out get it
yeah peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
