are my top three logitech gaming mice
for FPS shooters now recently I've been
hating on logitech a lot with their
romaji switches and the g502 Wireless
and calling it a brick but in actuality
I fell to my heart I was like you know
what I'm not doing Logitech justice you
know they are one of my favorite gaming
companies and I've been using their
products for years now so I wanted to
make this video as kind of a dedication
to them
in the hard work that they put in and
detailing my top three mice that they
put out recently so Logitech this is my
I'm sorry video alright let's get into
it with the number three mouse now
coming in at number 3 we have the
Logitech G 305 now this thing can be
found for around 50 to 60 dollars its 87
grams it feels great in your hand and
what I love about Logitech mice is that
they are very simplistic but they just
work the side buttons are thin and
clicky the top one and two buns are
clicky the scroll wheel is perfect on
this thing there's not much to complain
about with the G 305 now you can put a
double a lithium battery into this Mouse
and get it down to about 87 grams and
the battery is great running off a
lithium battery I've only had to change
the battery maybe once in the one year
that I've had this mouse now they still
haven't come out with hyper glides for
the G 305 but as soon as they do I'm
switching over to this and I'm probably
gonna be using this a lot more in the
near future once I do that so overall
great Mouse this is a great claw grip
fingertip grip Mouse it is just super
simple it's super light and it's super
nimble I love this thing for just
sniping and flick shots but if you have
big hands you might want to pass on this
because this is a very small Mouse or if
you really like small mice this one I
don't think you can get anything better
than the G 305 on the market currently
alright so let's do a little click test
because I know you guys love them so
much so so good I love these Logitech if
you're watching this you guys make some
of the best clicks on the market
currently also it's got that hero sensor
on it super precise super accurate it
was not the love about the G 305
so coming in at number two we have a
mouse that I have fallen back in love
with recently and that is the G 703 this
is a great palm grip
ergo Mouse it's great for you medium to
large hands out there and even some like
smaller hands can fit this as well for
that palm grip it's great for that 1-3-1
grip that uh I don't know I just feel so
accurate when I do one three one it's
like you just have like it just takes
away all shakiness from your shot you
guys could try it if you haven't already
it's got these huge side buttons on the
side which just feel amazing you cannot
miss them when you hit them these also
have a great mouse one and two with
grooves on it let me do a quick test for
you guys right about now so nice some of
the best on the market I have to tell
you guys now it's also got some hyper
glides on the bottom here that I put on
myself these really change the game for
my G 703 let me tell you guys like it
really made a difference if you have a G
703 and you have a hyper Glenna to get
do it and tell me you can't feel the
difference I dare you now outside of
that the scroll wheel on this thing is
amazing it does weigh a hundred and
seven grams which is pretty big but the
other big thing that it has to combat
this is it has these amazing side grips
that Logitech just nailed this mouse
just glues to your hand guys it is
simply amazing I feel like I'm in such
total control with this mouse when
aiming and because of these side grips
I've really fallen in love with this
mouse again no other mouse has these
kind of side grips on it I worst able to
put this on like the G Pro Wireless and
I think that Mouse would have been like
untouchable if they did that now the G
703 has 24 hours of battery life on one
charge and that's enough to get you
through a lot of your gaming sessions
but I do notice that I do have to charge
this a lot more than the other mice on
the list but anyways guys these are
coming in at around 80 to a hundred
dollars I think now you can always catch
them on sale I think I bought this one
for about $50 on sale so yeah you can
just catch them on sale when they go on
sale sale sale sale so coming in at
number one we have the beast
the G Pro Wireless my most used mouse of
this year and for good reason
it's 80 grams and it really changed the
game in terms of like what a wireless
mouse could be no I'm not gonna lie to
you guys
at first I really didn't like this mouse
and I know I've talked to a lot of you
subs out there and you guys had the same
experience you used it for like a day or
two you're like nah this is just not for
me and that's how I was - I haven't made
a review on it detailing it but after a
while after I got used to the simplicity
of this mouse it's hard to use anything
else for me it's got great side buttons
the mouse one and two have these great
mechanical switches on them that just
are so light and so crispy that once you
like press it there's very little like
delay and like response time the
mechanical switches on the mouse one and
two aren't amazing let me do a quick
test for you right now so good I think
these are my favorite clicks of any
mouse on the market currently I'm not
gonna say maybe it is these are my
favorite clicks right now guys they are
simply amazing once you get used to
these it's hard to go back and try other
mice now it's got insane battery at 60
hours of battery life holy cow I can't
remember the last time I really have to
charge this thing it just goes on and on
and on so you never really have to worry
about battery with the G Pro Wireless as
well now they don't have hyper glides
for the G Pro Wireless yet and it's kind
of disappointing but they are coming
this month I believe so I'll keep you
guys posted
make sure you sub make sure you follow
me on Twitter so I can keep you updated
and let you know when they do come out
now another thing that I really love
about this mouse is the scroll wheel
it's so light and it's thin I don't know
why but it just flows like butter like
the click eNOS is there the like ridges
and stuff are there and I feel like I
can like swap through my weapons I've
recently switched over to using like
jump for my scroll wheel so I can just
like flick this and do bunny hopping all
over the map in Apex so it's really
really dope another cool thing is for
you lefties out there is that they
actually let you put the buttons on the
right or left side so that's another
plus for this mouse now it's very
simplistic it's great for like
grip or a fingertip grip in my opinion
palm grip you might be on the edge of
not having it work for you I know a lot
of people that are palm grip did not
like this mouse so this is a claw grip
fingertip grip mouse in my opinion
alright so thank you guys for watching
thank you logitech for making all these
great wireless mice you guys really set
the standard for wireless mice and I
really appreciate you guys I'm sorry for
the videos that I made hating on you
guys I mean maybe it's warranted I don't
know but you guys make some really
really good mice and the best Wireless
mice on the market so kudos to you guys
keep doing your thing I'm a big fan all
right guys it has been your boy BT don't
forget that likes your coming and
subscribe let me know down below what
Mouse you use or have used on this list
and we can talk about it alright I'll
see you the next one it has been your
boy BT saying</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
