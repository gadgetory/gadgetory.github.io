another motivational Monday today I want
to talk about being overwhelmed you know
we have a lot of things going on in our
life for me this week you know making
mistakes at work and having people play
them up I've had to make videos and all
these demands from all of our
relationships and all these things come
together and it makes you feel
overwhelmed so what can we do to kind of
get control of our emotions in these
times and what can we do to kind of get
ourselves back on track so that is what
we're going to be talking about today so
today I have two examples that I want to
give you guys two techniques that you
guys can use one the first thing is with
being overwhelmed it's just trying to
solve too many problems at once trying
to go back and forth you know for me
it's like okay I need to fix us at work
okay I need to fix this for my videos I
need to do all these different things
and this can lead to overwhelm so what I
like to do is get out a piece of paper
and a pen and write down everything
that's on my mind that I think is a
problem so I write it down and then I
put I number it I had number one two
three four five six you know in order of
priority of which one is most important
to the least important and which ones I
can actually take action on at that
moment sometimes we try to think our way
through things when there's no action
that we could take at that time so we
get all this anxiety and there's nothing
we can do so we just sit there and we
have all this energy to try to take on
this task and it's not necessary so
decide what can be acted on now and what
needs to be acted on later so I number
one two three four five six and then
after that I start with my number one
and then I attack that problem I solved
that problem and I don't look at any of
the other problems until that one is
solved and then I go to number two and
then number three and usually by number
four or five that's when there's nothing
I can really take
chinon is just something where I have to
put it off to another day and it clears
my mind that needs to be taken care of
on Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday
with it whatever day it is getting
control like that writing it down and
actually seeing it and taking it one by
one it relieves you of a lot of stress
now number two the second thing that I
recommend doing is grave don't forget to
breathe now what I mean by that is a lot
of the things that we go through we
resist we don't want to let it in we
don't want to let it get to us we don't
think we can handle it we don't think we
can handle the emotions but try this try
this the next time you are feeling
overwhelmed breathe with the overwhelm
sauna use anger as an example when
you're mad aright hear your breathing
very very hot right here you're eight
you're angry right you're feeling it but
sometimes when we're sad or anxious we
tend to try to reject it and it comes up
even more within ourselves instead of
allowing it to be there and breathe with
it so I imagine myself breathing in my
anxiety and then breathing out and I do
this for ten minutes and I allow it to
be there so I keep that anxiety in mind
or I have the situation or the anger or
the sadness in my mind and I breathe and
this allows your body in your mind to
dissipate this energy that's in your
body that's trapped because you don't
want to accept how you're feeling and
that is a part of accepting how you feel
it's not through thinking it's not
through you know of solving a problem
sometimes it's just about letting that
energy flow through your body and just
release you know and release all that
tension you know we're so tight
releasing that tension and just becoming
relaxed again so try this it's not going
to kill you it really isn't we think
sometimes if we allow that anxiety or
stress to come in that it's going to
destroy us somehow but really is it no
it's not so try this so number one write
things down and prioritize number two
breathe in and out whatever you're
feeling to dissipate
the feelings in your body and there you
have it you will be clear and here i am
making this video because that's the
steps that I went through this week
today before i made this video and now
I'm here talking to you guys so it works
all right I'm not lying to you guys so
thank you guys for watching I hope you
guys enjoyed this motivation on Monday I
know it's a little bit late but like i
said i have to go through some stuff too
so I'm right there with you guys I'm
doing the stuff with you guys so I hope
you guys have enjoyed thank you for
watching I'll see you guys next one day
