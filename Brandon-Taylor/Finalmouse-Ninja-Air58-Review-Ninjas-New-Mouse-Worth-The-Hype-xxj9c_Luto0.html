the review of the final Mouse
ninja air 58 now I'm not stupid you know
I know what all of you guys are here you
want to know is this mouse worth the
hype is it worth that $90 price tag ooh
ooh all right we're gonna get into all
of that today I'm gonna go over what's
changed what's the same how it affects
your game play with grip styles this is
best with I'm gonna get into all of that
today and more so first they've made
this mouse a lot lighter they've made it
58 grams which is down from 67 of the
old phantom and ultra light pros now you
might be asking how did they do it well
they've taken out more of the plastic on
the side noticeably you'll notice a lot
more holes actually there was no holes
here on the phantom now there's holes
and I was skeptical at first I thought
it would be irritating to my fingers but
it actually adds a lot of grip to this
mouse and I actually like this a lot
more than any old phantoms on the bottom
they've also taken out some hexagons
octa hexa hexagons these are hexagons
six sizes hexagons right let me know
down the cops below that's hexagons
right so they've also taken out another
row of hexagons along the bottom to
lighten this Mouse another 9 grams I
don't know how they're gonna make this
lighter in the next version I don't
think that they should because the 58
grams is perfect so they kept the mouse
1 and 2 the same these things are crispy
listen to this oh yeah
it's a sweet sound right there I would
say these are on par with some of my
favorites like the Logitech G 703 which
has like my favorite clicks of all time
it is better than the G 305 I just love
how light and crispy these are and they
the sound oh my god I just love it so
they have that there's also the DPI
button up top and noticeably different
they've also changed the scroll wheel so
it doesn't have the just the ribs
anymore now it has a haiku Japanese poem
on each individual Mouse so each Mouse
that is out there is gonna be unique
what company can say that ok what
company can say
they've given you a unique Mouse of all
the thousands that they've made so it's
really cool that they've added that
personal touch now I know you might be
saying these are $90 is it worth it well
when you think about it like some
companies like Apple and things like
that what they'll do is they'll engrave
your iPad and things like that making it
unique so I think it'd be kind of like
that the price is kind of going into
that handmade crafting kind of
experience that they're giving you with
this mouse that can't be found on any
other Mouse right now the side buttons
are very nice they're still clicky and
tactile I love them I have medium hands
myself I am eighteen point five
centimeters long and nine centimeters
across and this mouse fits my hand like
a glove now I experiment all the time
with different grip styles I do like a
claw grip I do fingertip I do palm and
what I love about this mouse is that it
can do all of them so if you have small
hands I would say palm grip is safe on
this maybe not claw maybe not fingertip
grip it might be a little bit too big
for you but definitely palm grip will
work for you if you're medium you can
hit the full spectrum you can get claw
fingertip and palm if you're large you
can definitely hit claw and fingertip
palm might be you might have some
fingers hanging over the edge and things
like that but for the most part
everybody can use this Mouse and that's
what I love about this mouse is that
it's comfortable no matter how you use
it and with that light weight the 58
grams it really just floats in your hand
this thing floats on your mousepad
the mouse feet feel amazing there's no
drag speaking of drag let's talk about
this cord this paracord this thing is a
game-changer this thing I know a lot of
you guys out there wanted this mouse to
be Wireless myself included but this is
the next best thing okay this is the
next best thing this thing floats on
your desk it feels like nothing is
connected I would say it feels just as
good as my G 703 and that thing is one
of my favorite Mouse's and going back to
a cord it's not a problem
whereas when I went back to like my G
Pro from Logitech with a braided cord oh
man this thing was horrendous
I have to use a mouse bungee
speaking of mouse bungees this thing I
think is the mouse Bungie killer you
don't mean a mouse Bungie for this mouse
it's superlight you can just have the
cord laying on your desk and it just
stays out of the way it feels like
nothing is connected to this mouse
what's changed on the ninja air 58
paracord you might ask well it's a
little bit looser than the old phantom
my phantom seems a little bit tighter so
it there was a little bit very slight
there is a slight difference when kind
of push them towards the cord but since
they've loosened the paracord this thing
just floats like nobody's business it
looks like a butterfly and stings like a
bee now I'm not gonna lie to you guys I
don't play for Knight I'm not gonna put
a fortnight play on here because that's
just not me I'm gonna stick to what I do
and what I do best is overwatch I'm a
masters player in that I also play call
of duty black ops 4 and this thing has
not disappointed me it's super light I
can snap on two opponents very quickly
and that's what we want right we want to
have our curse over here and then snap
to the middle onto somebody's face and
shoot them right or body we wanna get
that head shot right you are sniping
you're gonna be using projectiles like
rockets and you're also gonna be using
like tracking and things like that where
you have to stay on a target with like a
machine gun or like a tracer and things
like that so I can kind of give you guys
an idea of what this mouse can do for
you
so that lightness can snap on to
opponents very easily
I found myself sometimes overshooting
because I was so used to having a
heavier Mouse I think that gee 703 is
coming in at about ninety seven grams
don't quote me on that
no went through let me know down in the
comments below if you know so that Mouse
is about 50 grams heavier give or take
and I definitely noticed like I was
overshooting when I first got this mouse
but once I got used to it once I was
able to just snap onto people it just
felt like my hand in my my mind and my
brain was just connected because it was
just super like intuitive I don't know
how to explain it it just feels like
you're just snapping onto people and
it's just like your hand like your hand
is in the game that's it it's connected
to whatever gun that you're using so I
can
definitely say that this has improved my
gameplay you know it's not gonna be
world's better than what you're using
now but it does make a difference and
that's where that $90 comes in it's a
niche product you know everybody has
their hobby right everybody has their
thing that they spend a lot of money on
and mice are one of them there's mice
enthusiasts out there shoutouts to
Reddit Mouse review I'm on there all the
time
oh yeah there's mouse enthusiasts out
there and we love our products you know
we want the light as well at the latest
and greatest sensors and things like
that the sensor on this mouse the 3360
is super snappy I'd say it's on par with
the 3366 of the logitech I've had no
issues with spinning out or lift off
distance or anything like that as well
so like I was saying this thing and
ninety dollars it's like buying Gucci
you know only like maybe like two
percent of the population by Noguchi but
the people that buy Gucci love Gucci
they wear it they are willing to spend
that extra money meanwhile the rest of
us we can shop at H&amp;amp;M we can shop at
Target we don't really care right but
mice that's our thing gaming that's our
thing why not just spend the extra and
do your thing right don't feel bad about
it I mean I hate to sell like out like a
Salesman but you know everything has its
price you know and I know a lot of
people are gonna comment on the price
and it's not worth it it's not worth the
hype well depends on who you are you
know if this is something that is in
your budget and you're an enthusiast I
say go for it screw the judgements from
people you know you like what you like
alright guys so do I think the final
Mouse
ninja air 50 is worth it yes I think
it's worth it and I think that a lot of
people who are mice enthusiasts if
you're a ninja fan if you just want like
the cool customizations if this has the
light is the latest and greatest on the
market drop that 90 don't look back
alright guys I'll see you in the next
one is Benny bored bTW Sam</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
