most used headphones this is probably
one of the most asked questions and my
comment section what headphones do I
actually use I mean I review a lot of
headphones but what do I use on a day to
day basis so today I'm gonna be letting
you guys into my world but before we
begin don't forget that there are a few
more days in the giveaway and the
winners will be announced at the
beginning of 2018 also I want to say
Happy Holidays to you guys I hope you
guys are happy prospering and enjoying
time with your families
so let's start this thing off with what
I use when I'm chilling at home for home
listening I use the otter z LCD twos
with the Decker de Kamp these two are a
match made in heaven guys
the Deckard really opens up the
soundstage of the LCD twos creating a
beautiful experience like no other
this comes at a high price though as the
LCD 2s are $1,000 and the deckard amp
can run about $700 expensive but once
you do try the setup it is very hard to
go back to something else whenever I
hear a new song I'm always like you know
what this would really sound great on my
LCD twos the only downside to these are
that they are very heavy but with that
heaviness you get a ton of power I love
these for everything and that's
something that I try to stick by for
when I get a headphone that I'm going to
use on a day-to-day basis it has to be
well-rounded for all genres of music and
movie watching
the headphones I grabbed the most when I
go to work are the beats X they look
great with work clothes and most
importantly they will stay out of your
way when it matters to most especially
when I'm working in my laboratory they
also have loads of treble that give you
that bright boost to get through those
drowsy mornings especially when I have
like paperwork and stuff like that I
just put those in and I go to work and I
get a lot of work done and really boost
my morning so great great set of earbuds
for the gym recently it's been the 1000x
and twos by Sony I think this is mostly
due to it being super cold outside right
now and these keep my ears warmer than
the sonic here twos I do however switch
off between these and the Sony here twos
and which one I grab usually just
depends on which one is charged the most
honestly both feature great bass and
some much-needed noise cancellation to
block out loads of gym noise they also
get plenty loud for gyms that are crazy
packed during rush hour so amazing set
of headphones you can't really go wrong
with them definitely recommend them for
the gym alright so that is gonna do it
guys for this video if you have any more
questions about my setup or what I'm
using leave it comment down below and
don't forget to smash that like button
if you liked the video sub if you loved
thank you guys for watching it's been
your boy BT saying peace happy holidays</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
