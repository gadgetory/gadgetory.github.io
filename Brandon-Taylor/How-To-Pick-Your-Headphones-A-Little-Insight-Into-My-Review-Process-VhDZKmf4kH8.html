with another video today I'm gonna be
helping you guys figure out how you guys
can pick out headphones and some things
to look for and also - I want to let you
guys end today on how I review my
headphones and what goes into my process
of listening to wearing the mess in the
battery connectivity but today we're
gonna get into all those things and then
some okay so you want a pair of
headphones where do you go what do you
do what are you looking for so the first
thing that I tell people the first thing
that you have to know is know your music
that is number one know your music what
is your goal what are you trying to
listen to what are you trying to get the
most out of what genres are you
listening to that's number one
well that's rap EDM okay for me those
are my main ones I know that I'm looking
for headphones that are tailored towards
that kind of music spend any more on
that and number two we have sound with
sound the one thing I want to challenge
you guys listen to your favorite song
and then choose one characteristic about
that song that you really like well
that's the vocals the lyrics the bass
the treble the highs all those things
listen and I want you guys to pick one
characteristic now after you picked that
one characteristic that is gonna be your
main goal for picking out a headphone so
let's say you pick a neutral headphone
like bose qc25 those aren't gonna be the
best choice for something that super
bass heavy and somebody that likes a lot
of mids they're just a very neutral flat
headphone that go with mostly classical
and jazz listeners people that like
neutral music now if you want something
more with bass we all know the brands
that are bass heavy like Skullcandy
beats v-moda those are gonna be your
bread and butter for the bass and I'm
just saying some brands off the top of
my head
those aren't necessarily the best but
those are what are known for having a
bass so it kind of points you in the
right direction towards those headphones
for me personally I've done so many
reviews and when I first started off I
was looking for bass like a lot
you guys out there and then I started
realizing that hmm I really noticed when
the vocals when the mids aren't up to
par it's like when you're on the phone
with somebody and you hear that static
and you kind of hear or their voice
sounds a little distorted you know what
the voice should sound like and once you
hear it in a different way you notice it
and for me that's how it gets now I
notice a rafter that when the vocals are
just not there and the mids aren't as
good so figure out that one
characteristic that is tailored to what
you like now also when it comes to sound
what I do is I have a neutral pair of
headphones that are very accurate in the
Audis LCD twos they're great reference
all my headphones wireless or wired
versus those and then on the lower end
for the bass heavy I do my fostex X zero
zeros because I think they have the
perfect amount of bass and I compare
then I can say okay this is better than
the X zero zeros or as below how far is
it below those and then same goes for
the highs for the highs I have my
Sennheiser five nine eight those things
are very thin with the bass but the
highs the minutes are great there's a
lot of separation there great open back
headphone so I test against those and
then I can say okay well where does it
live where on this spectrum from the
five nine eight to the LCD twos in the
middle for the fostex x zero zeros on
the end where does it all lie and then I
can make a generalize statement based on
what people are listening to I listen to
all the genres I go through all the
different types of music and then I
bring you guys to review that is how I
take sound now number three before we go
on to the Comfort battery and all that
stuff I just want to say one thing that
is very underrated is Amazon ratings if
you guys aren't already doing this I do
this for everything that I buy I'd go on
there and let me give you guys a little
tip this is a little secret that I have
pick the three star reviews don't do the
five which are just oh my god this is
the best product ever No
and don't listen to those don't listen
to the one stars don't listen to those
out as well because it's just either
they had a really bad experience I got a
bad living headphone or there is this
high mighty headphone that is just
amazing with no flaw you want to bridge
that gap and bring it to the three star
the three star they'll tell you what's
right and they will tell you what is
wrong
they're very balanced so three star
Amazon reviews that's a good place to
start and then from there what I do is I
go on YouTube I look at other reviews I
see what other people are saying doesn't
match up with the Amazon reviews and
then you can make a generalized pick
based on what type of music you listen
to yourself for battery life number four
I'm gonna just talk about this a little
bit you have to determine what it is and
how long you're actually listening to
your music what are you using them for
are you flying around the world and you
need 30 hours 20 hours you got a bunch
of lay overs where you can't charge the
headphones what is it that you're
actually doing with these headphones are
you going to the gym five days a week
two hours a day they need ten hours
figure out where it is you lie on the
scale for me personally I'm using them
all the time sometimes they use them at
work sometimes I use them at home
sometimes I use them at the gym well all
the time I use them at the gym but it
has to last through a lot of things so
having quick charge features is amazing
like the beats X and the power beats you
know like five minutes of charging gives
you two hours of battery life things
like that those are all things to look
out for and I think are kind of crucial
to having a good set of wireless
headphones alright so let's talk about
comfort now also to what you want to
decide on is do you want earbuds or do
you want over here do you want on ear
headphones what type of person are you
do you not like things shoved in your
ear do you have a weird ear canal shape
then go with over ear or on air do you
just get really hot do you not like
things on you are you gonna be working
out of them then get ear but me I'm not
really a sweaty person when I'm in the
gym I sweat a little bit but for the
most part I can wear over area and be
just fine so I'm always testing to see
how hot do these over ear on your
headphones get do they clamp them down
really hard I really tried to put
headphones to the test and really test
the materials to see how they feel do
they feel solid do the bands
feel like they're gonna break do they
have metal in the dance to keep them
from breaking so these are all things
that I look for when I look at the
design another thing is button placement
some have terrible button placement I
don't really like the bose qc25 button
placements like back here some they
don't have the etched in signs for
whatever you're having to press so the
little things like that really add into
the design and the comfort of a
headphone also - I look for very low
profile headphones I don't like
headphones that really stick out a lot
unless it's gonna be for home listening
because otherwise they just get in your
way when you're out and about now the
sixth and final thing that you want to
look for is the distance that you can be
away from your phone now this may be
important for some people that like to
leave their phone in the locker room and
they go out and work out you know you're
doing Sprint's or things like that and
you have your phone over to the side now
what I do is I just lay my phone down
and I just walk away and I kind of pace
how far I'm walking in a straight line
and this gives me kind of a general idea
of how far I can go some I can leave it
in the locker room others it has to be
in my pocket at rest I'm getting some
static so it really just all depends
definitely look at the distance and how
far the Bluetooth range is because that
actually does matter a lot for some
people all right guys so that those are
my tips for finding a new pair of
headphones and how I test the headphones
so let me know down in the comments
below what headphones are you using
right now all right do you like them you
hate them are you looking to get a new
pair let me know down below that's been
my time it's your boy bTW
