another review today we're gonna be
taking a look at the Edifier r12 att's
now these are some bookshelf speakers
that I think are a amazing value I've
tried speakers that are like three
hundred four hundred dollars each and
these are only $100 for the pair so
amazing value and I just want to let you
guys in on this little secret because
these things are ridiculously good
whether you're listening to vinyl or you
want to game with them or you just want
good sounding speakers to plug your
phone in these have you covered but
before I begin guys don't forget to hit
that subscribe button it really helps a
channel out I'm trying to get to 10,000
subs very very soon and I can only do
that with your guys's help so thank you
guys again for all the support and all
the likes and all the comments alright
so in the Box you're gonna find the
speakers you're gonna find an RCA 2 aux
cord you're gonna find a RCA two RCA and
you're also gonna find a remote which is
also very very nice now on the right
speaker what I love about these is that
they have controls for treble and bass
on the sides so you can really tailor
your experience to what you like and
right out of the box the sound signature
on these is just simply amazing the
clarity just you just cannot miss it you
cannot ignore the fact that these things
are super clear the bass is rumbling if
you want it to be I mean you can go up
to 6 decibels or -6 whatever floats your
boat and I really like that feature so
it's almost like having our own little
EQ unnatural speakers to tailor your
experience without the need of software
or things like that so great value and
for the size for how loud they get you
would think that these would be much
bigger but these things are like little
chihuahua they just pack a real punch
they have a lot of bark they have a lot
of bite and they're in a small package I
also love the aesthetics of these
speakers now you can take off the front
and it reviews the speaker the tweeter
and also the subwoofer and I really like
the look of these speakers on the side
they have nice wood finish so it looks
great on your desk or on a table or with
your vinyl player or whatever you want
to do with these speakers on the back
they actually have two places where you
can plug in the RCA cords now that is
really nice because you can have it
simultaneously set up to your phone or
you can have a set up to your computer
and your record player it the
combinations are endless so that's
another really cool feature and it works
no matter what you have it plugged into
so if you have it plugged into both
it'll play both if you just want to play
through your phone and you haven't
hooked up to your computer it won't
interfere so very nice a very versatile
set of speakers I really cannot find any
fault with these speakers they are the
perfect speakers at a great price of a
hundred bucks
these blow my logitech speakers out of
the water I have to tell you they blow
them out of the water no competition so
that should just tell you guys how good
these speakers are and they're only a
hundred bucks I cannot stress how good
of a value these speakers are alright
guys so that is a little quick video on
the Edifier r12 att's great set of
speakers if you're looking for some
speakers for your setup for your home
set up or your home studio whatever it
may be go check them out it's worth a
shot
100 bucks to have amazing speakers yeah
it's a no-brainer for me alright guys so
thank you guys for watching I hope you
guys have enjoyed this video and I will
see you guys in the next one it's been
your boy bt saying peace don't forget to
subscribe and like and share and comment
on this video
thank you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
