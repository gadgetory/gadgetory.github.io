you can add add a weight in here and see
so we asked something in here supposed
to like do something I don't know let's
see
what's up guys is Beattie here and this
is the review of the g502 wireless one
of the most popular gaming mice ever
made has now gone Wireless now in the
past I've used the g502 proteus spectrum
and it just wasn't for me the weight and
the grip on the side will just kill my
hand so I've moved on to other mice like
the Logitech G pro that being said this
is a very polarizing Mouse either you
love it or you think it's a brick and
I've been guilty of brick shaming this
mouse but that's just because it didn't
work out for me but I promise guys I'll
be as unbiased as possible with this
review coming in at $150 does the g502
wireless have what it takes to be a top
gaming mouse in today's market let's
find out today so in the box you'll get
the mouse some weights and a wireless
adapter and a cord the wireless adapter
can be plugged directly into the
computer with the dongle or just by
using the cable one thing I didn't like
is a Logitech braided the cable logit
have to move away from that recently in
their G Pro Wireless why go back
Logitech why it sucks when you have to
charge your mouse and use this braided
cable at the same time it just suck the
mouse itself carries the same organ ama
cos I nits the first Mouse now with a
wireless switch and a place for the
light speed adapter if you want to use
that Logitech Power Plate mouse pad now
I used to use one but the cloth start to
come up and raise up off of the mouse
pad so I returned it so just fair
warning if you're trying to buy into the
system I would kind of steer away from
the power play back the mouse is
weighing in at 114 grams which is not
horrible you can also ask 16 grams
making it 130 grams in total if you like
you can place four of the 2g grams in
the middle and two of the four grams in
the back of the mouse it's got these
texture grips on each side that are a
little bit too rough for me personally I
would like to see just like a rubberized
grip kind of like on the G 703 now this
mouse can be used for all grip styles
palm cloth fingertip grip now my hands
are nineteen point five by eight
centimeters and it fits perfectly I'd
say another three to four centimeters
should be safe for your length and your
width of your palm claw does worked well
with this mouse but it does cause me
some discomfort with these side grips I
feel like one three
one grit 131 grit is the best overall
bit for this mouse because it has that
ledge so you can put your ring finger on
it that alleviates some of the
discomfort when I did use this mouse
it's got a quick dpi button switch near
your thumb that actually is pretty
useful in game for switching your dpi
on-the-fly if you want to switch like a
sniper it's got two side buttons I feel
pretty good and two buttons for the DPI
switch up top which is indicated by the
lights on the side in the middle it's
got a button to unlock the hyper scroll
wheel the button above that shows the
battery life on the mouse the mouse one
or two clicks are nice and light and I
gotta say guys Logitech has some of the
best clicks in the game so let's drop a
sound test for you guys right now oh hi
yeah even though it's a g502 this scene
clicks so sexy so got to give it to
Logitech can't even hate on that the
battery life is rated at 6 two hours of
gameplay and can quick charge for 5
minutes for up to 2.5 hours of gameplay
now Logitech never fails when it comes
to battery life I can't even remember
the last time I had to charge my G Pro
Wireless the new Logitech G hub software
sucks but it does allow you to control
the dpi levels the hero sensor does go
up to 16,000 dpi and has a polling rate
of 1,000 Hertz you can also control the
RGB with the usual effects like
breathing in single color mode to match
your setup the mouse is comfortable in
my opinion until you have to pick it up
again again and again so the one major
con for me is that the weight
distribution is kind of weighted towards
the back and then with that slant on the
back it kind of tends for the it kind of
lends itself forward the mouse to fall
out of the back of your hand but like I
said if you're like a pong grip or 1:31
you won't have that issue because your
whole there's more surface area on the
mouse so you won't have it falling out
of your hand so what I can see is that a
lot of the people that are using this
mouse on love this mouse are probably
gonna be palm grip reasons
another con for me is that while the
scroll wheel is amazing for editing and
browsing when you're actually gaming it
rattles and when you kind of reposition
your mouse over and over again the mouse
scroll wheel kind of rattles and shakes
and you feel it vibrate throughout the
whole mouse
I don't think it's that great for a
competitive setting book for casual
gaming you probably overlooked that and
one more issue that I had with this
mouse is that on the back-right
it is a little bit too sharp the corner
is a little bit too sharp so when you
are swiping the mouse and you're doing
this kind of motion let me show you that
we know in this kind of motion this
backside really really starts to dig and
scratch your mousepad so that can be
another distraction while you're trying
to game especially in some of these
fast-paced eSports games if you need a
mouse with a lot of buttons this is
actually a pretty good option I don't
think there's anything better in the
wireless market correct me if I'm wrong
that has this many buttons has a great
sensor and has a decent shape for like
pong grief users reducing the Mouse way
down to 114 grams actually help this
mouse out quite a bit in my opinion
actually played better than I thought I
would with this mouse but that was only
once I switched to the 131 grip it's
just way too uncomfortable for trying to
claw grip this mouse so for all of you
guys that a palm grip uses out there
this it could actually work for you I
can't believe I'm actually saying that I
can't believe I'm actually recommending
the g502 but it's happening you heard it
here first
different strokes for different folks
guys alright if you like bricks hey this
is perfect
so all right guys thank you guys for
watching it has been your boy BT don't
forget to Like share comment and
subscribe and I will see you in the next
video
