these are the Sony WH 1000 XM threes
that follow up to my favourite headphone
off last year this headphone just keeps
getting better and better every year the
only thing that really kept the 1000 X
m2 s from greatness was the comfort the
ear cuffs well nice got really hot and
they would clamp down on your head
pretty hard causing head fatigue yes
head fatigue is a thing by the way the
good thing about Sun is that they really
listen to us and what we have to
complain about and they really do
improve their products based on that so
let's see today if they have achieved
greatness again with a 1000 X in threes
but before begin guys don't forget to
hit that subscribe button for more
content like this and follow me on my
social medias if you haven't already the
sony WH 1000 X and threes are coming in
at $350 which seems to be the sweet spot
for this type of audiophile noise
cancellation headphone
what I like about Sony is that they try
to give you your money's worth the build
quality has changed quite a bit from
last year the outside of the cup is not
plastic with touch controls instead of
the leather type material that they have
before up and down being for volume left
and right to skip tracks tap in the
middle will pause the song holding your
hand over the right ear cup will enable
you to do the quick attention mode
pausing your music temporarily so let's
say you need to hear an announcement at
the airport or talk to somebody at the
gym hold your hand over that ear cup and
they can hear you just fine
I do wish they would allow you to
disable the touch controls when you're
sleeping on a plane or relaxing in a
chair this year they've also changed the
charger to a USBC charger which is nice
because most devices now are using USBC
chargers sony has also made it a point
to make them a lot lighter it's closer
to the bose qc25 and i think that that
has the best comfort of any headphone
out currently the hinges are still made
out of that plastic material which comes
in black and beige like last year I mean
I know some of my subs out there you
guys have been complaining that this
plastic snaps on you but I've never had
a pair of sunnies snap on me and I'm
pretty
ruff of my headphones inside the ear
cuffs last year they had this padded
material within the ear cup and they
kept it in this year and I feel like
that really muffle some of that great
sound coming out of these headphones I
really do wish that they would remove
this in the next generation the ear cut
footprint really mimics the bose qc25 by
opening them up into a bigger oval shape
these are also foldable and feature a
case to store them in with a 3.5
headphone 2 aux jack I really like the
design of this year's model they
included enough changes to make this a
big upgrade especially in the comfort
department now where Sony has everybody
beat recently is in their headphone app
and the ability to change the EQ of your
headphones on the fly this makes them a
great choice for anyone you will be
hard-pressed to find a better sounding
noise cancellation headphone that will
fit the majority of the masses the bass
is incredible on these passing my
previous favorite headphones the Bowers
&amp;amp; Wilkins P X's the bass is out of this
world while keeping the vocals nice and
clear and what's nice is that you can
add even more bass in the app if that's
your thing the 1000 XM 3s are like a
pizza okay and before you turn off this
video hear me out you literally can put
any topping you want on your pizza so
for instance the pepperonis the bass
mushrooms are the mid-tones bell pepper
are the highs you can also leave out
things that you don't like on your pizza
like pineapple let's say you don't like
highs take those highs out I honestly
can't find much fault with these
headphones and they sound great with all
genres if I had to be super nitpicky my
only complaint is that I wish there was
more separation but these are a
closed-off headphone which is their
nature and they're not gonna be known to
have a lot of soundstage anyway oh and
let's not forget about the dsee
technology which bumps lower quality
music up to a lossless type file it is
not true lossless but it does make your
music sound a little bit better and it
doesn't sound processed or anything like
that so that's going to be great for
people that listen to a lot of Spotify
because those bit rates are so low they
use an old codec
so having that dsee can actually make
spotify songs sound a lot better and get
a lot more quality out of them these
headphones sound amazing with Eminem's
newest album kamikaze which I recommend
you listen to if you haven't already so
to sum up these headphones these are
pretty much the pizza of the noise
cancellation audiophile world at the
moment and it's a damn good pizza the
noise cancellation is just exceptional
they have passed bose their new noise
cancellation technology that they're
calling the cute in one is frankly
better than the Bose and I really wish
that I have these on my last 15 hour
flight to Hong Kong there have so many
different modes they have the ambient
mode which lets in either voices or
noises and can control that an app or
through the button on the side of the
headphone it's really your choice what
you want to hear with these headphones
and that is amazing power you can choose
what you want to hear from the outside
world after traveling with the bose qc25
i've noticed that they only really block
out low-frequency sounds whereas the
sony's they do all frequencies and they
give you a nice coverage from crying
baby all the way down to engine noise
the connection is exceptional with these
headphones I've had no problems
whatsoever with these and crowded areas
like the gym or commuting these things
are super solid and that is due to them
having like LED AC and the aptX HD and
those are the highest bitrate transfers
and the most stablest connections that
you can have on a headphone currently so
it has all that feature packed guys the
battery life has stayed the same this
year at 30 hours but the quick charge
now gives you 10 minutes for five hours
of battery life which is up from last
year where they only gave you 10 minutes
for 70 minutes so there's definitely a
big jump in better performance this year
the call quality is also exceptional
overall these headphones are spectacular
and are definitely worth picking up as
an upgrade over last years in my opinion
just for that comfort alone you can
enjoy your music for longer periods of
time and you won't get that half a tea
from wearing them for longer periods of
time which is excellent for traveler
and commuters or if you just love music
the touch controls are now more
redefined and work every single time now
the noise cancellation is now even
better than Bose there's incredible lows
mids and highs and if you don't like how
they sound out of the box you can change
them in the app what's not to love
really it's really hard for me not to
fall in love with these headphones so if
you have been wondering what the best
headphones are to buy right now you're
looking at them alright guys thank you
guys for watching
it's been your boy BT I'll see you guys
in the next video don't forget to
subscribe like and share this video if
you enjoyed it and I will see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
