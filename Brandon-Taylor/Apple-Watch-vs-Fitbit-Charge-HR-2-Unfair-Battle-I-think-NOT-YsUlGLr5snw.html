what is up guys is BT back here again
with another battle today I'm going to
be doing a battle between the Fitbit HR
to charge HR 2 and the Apple watch
series 1 and give you guys my real-world
experience on both of these devices no
tech specs because at the end of the day
this product just needs to work in the
knees to add value to your life in the
real world and in the real world what
does it really matter what kind of
processor it has if it's not adding
value to your life then it's not worth
it flat out but before we begin don't
forget to hit that subscribe button to
my channel for more content like this so
let's have a little chat about a small
concept before we get into the battle
and that is the acronym keep it simple
stupid ki SS which is the thought
process that if you over complicate
something simple that it could turn out
worse then if you would have just done
that simple thing very well some of you
may see what I'm going with this but I
want you guys to keep this in mind as
you go through this battle which I know
what some of you guys are thinking looks
on Pharaon paper but hear me out so
let's start off with the comfort and
design now both of these are very
comfortable although I do like the
silicone band of the Apple watch a
little bit more just feels nice not to
have any of those sharp edges you can
also buy bands for both which is nice I
like that you can remove bands and
something that but out of the box I feel
like the Apple watch feels a little bit
better but not to say that the Fitbit HR
2 is not comfortable it's also extremely
comfortable now the Apple watch is going
to be more for a night out on the town
where as a charge HR 2 is going to be
more suited towards like working out and
everyday life and even office I feel
like
appropriate I did find that that watched
day to get in the way sometimes for
workouts sample watch of course has two
buttons for navigation and a full touch
screen whereas a Fitbit just has one
button and tapping to switch information
cards so the simplicity with the Fitbit
to charge two is kind of nice in a way
it's just everything is just right there
in your face so next up let's move into
the usability round now remember the
acronym kiss this is the round where I
want you guys to really remember it the
most
Apple has always been known for their
simplicity and for their ability to just
get out of the users way just oh just
oversimplifying things to the fact that
anybody can use the products and with
the Apple watch I feel like Apple has
filled and keeping up this long
tradition the value that it adds to your
life does not equal the two $300 that
you're going to be spending on this
product yes you can access apps on your
wrist
yes accounts your steps yes it even
shows the time but the thing that
hinders it the most is the 18 hour
battery life whereas the Fitbit charge
HR 2 does all of these things except the
apps but you're getting three to five
days of battery life and it doesn't
equal to the two to three times you're
going to be using a app on your wrist
it's just not comparable more often than
not I'm going to be honest with you guys
I just pulled out my phone and I would
flip up my wrist to just see my steps so
if I'm just using this for my steps and
the apps that I'm using we're better on
my phone I'm just going to use my phone
that's just human nature we're going to
use what's best and what's most
comfortable to us in that three to five
days that the Fitbit
you can also track your sleep so it
directly affects your life it can tell
you how much sleeker getting how much
you need to be getting when you should
go to bed
that's a value not checking an app two
to three times on your wrist
Fitbit just keeps it simple and it just
works it keeps you on your goals and
that is what's most important keeping us
on our goals that adds value not
checking an app that works better on
your phone on your wrist it just doesn't
add up to me I constantly have to remind
myself what each color wheel means on my
wrist for the Apple watch the heart rate
is right there on the Fitbit HR -
whereas on the Apple watch not so much
you have to go through menus to find out
what your heart rate is also like that
the Fitbit app gives you all these
printouts and all this information about
your life and what your the habits that
you're creating the habits that you're
doing in your everyday life whereas the
Apple watch it just seems like it
everything just lost it is hard to use
coming back to the battery life if you
take off your Apple watch to charge it
which you will because it only lasts 18
hours then it's not necessarily
something that you need to carry with
you every day there's a reason why we
always feel like we need to have our
phone because it adds so much value we
get directions we take our friends we
call family the news we check the
weather keep up our calendars we have
notes
whereas on the watch it's once you leave
it at home one day two day three days 45
days the wood but for me it turned out
it turned into two or three weeks and I
realized I don't need this device and I
started to feel ripped off you know when
I'm wearing the Fitbit charge HR - I
don't want to break that 10,000 steps so
I'm always going to have this thing on
and what I do have to charge this thing
I had charge of like five minutes and
then I get it back on my wrist
as soon as I can and that is a value
that adds something to my life this
thing is your companion the Apple
watch's takes so much power to power the
screen and the touchscreen and the the
processor and they're so focused on that
that they've really forgotten that Apple
is usually about adding value to the
users life the user always comes first
so for the usability round I have to
give it to the charge HR - oh no I think
Apple needs to go back to the drawing
board is simplify the watch and give a
little bit more value get out of the way
of the user the Fitbit HR - the charge
HR - is a life changer this thing will
change your life for the better and
that's what I'm about I want you guys to
have the best life possible not as
subscribe but just as people to change
your habits and be better accomplish
your goals health goals be healthy live
a long life have your family live a long
life so I hope that you guys have
enjoyed this battle don't forget to
share like comment subscribe level in a
different order but there will be more
content like this so stay tuned
