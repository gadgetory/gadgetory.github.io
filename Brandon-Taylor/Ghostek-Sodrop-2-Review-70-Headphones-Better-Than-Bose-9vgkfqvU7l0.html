with another review today we're gonna be
taking a look at the ghost text so
dropped twos now these were recommended
to me by a subscriber remember I told
you guys to recommend me some headphones
and one of my last videos that's what
you guys did and I bought a lot of them
so here we are today we're gonna get
into it
Thank You Jessie for recommending these
to me because I had never heard of them
before
these have a ton of reviews on Amazon
and I was very excited to try these so
let me just tell you guys what I found
today what I like about them what I
don't like what works what doesn't work
so well and we will get into all of that
today but before we begin don't forget
to hit that subscribe button for more
content like this and also thank you to
you guys who have subscribed recently or
just been a subscriber for a long time I
really appreciate all the support
alright so let's start off with the
comfort and design now first thing out
of the box these come with a case a very
hard case which I'm always an advocate
of it lets you protect your product
protect your investment
so that's always a good thing when
companies do that now these are coming
in at about $70 on Amazon they have
coupons sometimes where you can get them
cheaper as well but for $70 the build
quality is actually really good I think
the leather feels great the ear cuffs
feel great I wish it was more of a
circular shape I think the rectangle
shape of the ear cuffs sometimes can
press on your ears and weird ways that
kind of make them uncomfortable but just
adjusting them it really helps out and I
really like that the ear cups
swivel not just up and down but they
also swivel side to side which you can
get a very nice fit with the headband
feels great it doesn't stick out too
much the brushed aluminum on the side of
these headphones also looks great as you
guys can see so yeah aesthetically not
bad I mean the leather does have holes
on it I don't know why they did that
would have just kept it I guess it does
make it a little bit more breathable but
I stink on the headband that could have
just left it normal I think I would have
looked a little bit more aesthetically
pleasing now these also fold of course
to go into the case like I said before
on the right ear cup you're gonna find
the call button accept calls turn on
button at the top you're also gonna find
a volume rocker which doubles as a skip
forward and back track if you hold them
down I did find that some apps like
SoundCloud did not respond to the play
call button as they call it so I don't
know if that's what they intended but
that is one quirk that I found with this
it works on some apps like Spotify it
does work with Apple music it worked but
with some apps that aren't as popular
they didn't work so I think they could
like revamp that or make a dedicated
play pause button stop button somewhere
on here why not why not just add another
button on the bottom side you're gonna
find the USB charger you're also gonna
find an input for the aux cord which is
very nice if you want to use some
wireless or wired it's really up to you
another thing that really impressed me
was the call quality these things sound
great even better than my Bose I have to
say it they sounded better than my Bose
for calls amazing and you wouldn't
expect that out of a $70 headphone but
here we are these things sound great for
calls now the battery life is coming in
at about 14 hours now a funny story I
play with these all night I listen to
them they sounded great I had to burn
them in I had to do some testing I had
made some calls with these headphones to
test them out and I took them to the gym
today
they worked great they sounded great
they blocked out a ton of noise and
weirdly enough when I walked out of the
gym my battery was still at 100% so I
don't know if the battery reader on
these actual headphones what is
communicating to the phone is actually
different than what it's actually at but
in my testing I got at full volume I was
getting close to 20 hours of battery
life with these headphones so even
better this is one time where it
actually exceeds
what the box said and by a huge margin
so battery life on these is actually
really really good the connection was
also super solid I mean I took these
into the gym not one break up not one
static sound or anything like that ever
it was so solid so overall so far the
build quality is great the call quality
is great the battery life is more than
expected and you're paying $70 so let's
talk about the sound so the sound is
where these really really surprised me
I'm not gonna lie to you guys right of
the box these things aren't going to
impress you
but let them burn in I listen to them
for a long period of time and these
started to shine I mean at first the
vocals were super laid back the bass was
always there the bass while we're on the
topic is very full it's very rich it's a
sub bass it's mid bass its upper bass
it's everything you get all of that with
these headphones and I am super
impressed with the bass if you're a bass
lover these give a very nice rich thump
and you guys will not be disappointed
these things destroyed EDM music if
you're an EDM fan this is a no-brainer
for me for rap they're also really good
but it takes a little bit of time for
the mitts and the vocals to actually
come forward they actually sounded a
little bit Hollow at first you know like
those cheap headphones that you
sometimes hear or get from like Ross or
Marshalls or you just buy it just
because it's cheap that's what it
sounded like but after a while these
things really impressed me and I think
overall these are a great set of cans
just for anybody in another area where
these really really impressed me was the
volume the volume gets really really
loud louder than my bows I did a
side-to-side comparison these things get
loud and without any noise cancellation
these blocked out probably more noise
than my bows now it's to be seen how
these actually fare on a plane I don't
think I would go as far as to say it's
gonna block out plane noise but if
you're just using them for commuting if
you're using them for the gym these
things do the job and they
very well another great feature of this
before I close out this review is that
you can hook up multiple devices so if
you wanna hook up your macbook your
iphone you can do that if you want to
have two devices your Android and your
iPhone you can do that whereas something
like the Bose cannot do that and it's
only $70 so Bose what are you doing and
one more thing one more thing is I
accidentally left my phone downstairs I
walked all the way upstairs walked to my
room and these things did not lose
connection whatsoever now its marketing
at 10 meters which is a good distance so
you don't even worry about this if
you're in an office you need to walk
around walk to other people's cubicles
walk around the gym you want to put your
phone down these things are just the
connection is just amazing I cannot rave
about it enough all right so for $70
you're getting the complete package I
mean the only thing I would really
change about these headphones is
probably the rectangular ear cups I'll
make them a little bit bigger so they
could fit more people's ears I know some
people have big ears or medium sized
ears and these might get in the way but
then again they're super adjustable the
sound they sound great the call quality
is great the connection is great
it's all great it's all it's great
all-around guys so for 70 bucks I think
you can't go wrong with these they are a
great budget headphone alright guys so
that is gonna do it for this review
don't forget to hit that like button if
you liked the video don't forget to hit
that sub button if you loved it and I
will see you guys in the next video has
been your boy
try your mother's got the fall but if a
focus on my mind said and though it's
gonna be alright</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
