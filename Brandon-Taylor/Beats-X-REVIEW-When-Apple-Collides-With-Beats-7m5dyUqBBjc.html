with a much requested review from you
guys it is on the beats X the new
offering from beats it's their newest
product in their product line and it's
the first one since Apple came along and
acquired the company so of course we
expect big things from this product have
they delivered I'm gonna tell you in
this review right now but before we get
into it don't forget to hit that
subscribe button if you haven't it
really helped a channel out a lot so you
guys know I love to start off with the
comfort and these things I am not
exaggerating are the most comfortable
headphones I've ever worn for working
out period I did not have to readjust
them at all whatsoever throughout my
whole workout and it's been multiple
days usually with like Jaybirds or bows
I have to at least tenure with it a
little bit with these almost feel like I
forget that they're even in it is insane
I was not expecting that when these
first that announced I was dead scared
for beats because I was like these are
gonna be falling out of your ear just
based on the ads that I was seeing I was
like I don't know I don't think this is
gonna work out we may have a problem but
no these things are ingenious guys
ingenious the band is made out of rubber
it's not made out of hard plastic so
it's not gonna irritate your neck so
during your workouts you're gonna forget
that they're even there another thing
that I had a problem with with other
headphones is that they didn't have a
dedicated mic on the actual line of the
headphone and they kept that in on these
and that is the best idea that they've
ever had over I beats I think it's the
best way to integrate a mic is just to
have it on the line it's closer to your
mouth so that you can talk it just makes
sense now at each end they have the
power on one side and on the other they
have a charging port now the charging
port is a lightning cable which is
really cool if you're an iPhone user
because you can just hook up your iPhone
cable to this there's no need to carry
micro USB cord anymore so that was kind
of smart on their part and I'm glad they
did it although if you're on Android
you're gonna have to carry the cable
around I'm sorry so they come with the
standard tips that we see in all other
headphones there's small medium and
large they also have two sides of wings
I found the smaller size to be the most
comfortable the material that they use
is just very comfortable you forget it's
even in some like j-bird can be kind of
harsh
even though they're getting a little bit
softer they can be a little bit harsh so
I really appreciate that about these
headphones
it's just comfort all around so much so
that you'll forget that they're even
there you won't even have to readjust
them and this is going for two hours of
working out of running on a treadmill
running outside it's just it they don't
move you also come with this cool magnet
on the backside of each one of the
headphones so if you you let them down
onto your your neck so that they won't
slip off and you lose them or you have
to keep repositioning them it just stays
nicely in front of you on your chest one
thing I do wish they would have added
with the remote is holding the down
button or holding the up volume button
to go forward or back that's just a
better way to do things I did notice
when I clicked on the button that
sometimes it wouldn't register the first
time so I'd have to hit it three times
for the sonic go back twice if that
makes sense moving on to the sound now
beats has really been cleaned up by
Apple they have a very clean signature
before with Beats the main problem that
a lot of people had were at the higher
volumes there's a lot of distortion and
Static that you would get not so much
with the newest Apple versions of the
beats they sound great guys they sound
very rich emotional they give you if
you're into rap rock anything it just
brings out the emotion in the music and
that's what you want in a workout
headphone you know you don't want
something sometimes that's so accurate
while you're at the gym you want
something that's going to get you moving
get your heart pumping and help you get
through that hard work and that's what
the beats X do they help you
get through your workout now at the
highest volume I did notice that the
highs did get a little bit harsh on my
ears at least so keep that in mind but
it wasn't too bad and I'm still hoping
that after I break these in a little bit
more that the sound will kind of balance
out and that harshness will go away now
for the battery life the battery life is
really good guys its standard eight
hours I got the eight hours they charge
really really fast five minutes of
charging will give you two hours of play
that is incredible because we've all
been in that situation where we get to
the gym and our headphones aren't
charged and then we have to wait and
maybe our pre-workout is kicking in or
maybe we just are anxious or on a time
crunch so we just need to get the
workout over but we don't have music so
that has been a problem for me in the
past and with this that's just
eliminated I can get five minutes two
hours of play and have my whole workout
covered within those five minutes of
charging so battery life is an A+ so now
let's talk about the connectivity now
they have that quick connectivity using
the w1 chip you just have to hold it up
turn on the device hold it up to your
phone and it connects so that is a very
nice feature just makes it a little bit
easier of a installation for you I mean
I've never really had a problem which is
going into the settings and getting what
my headphones are that I want to connect
but it simplifies connectivity to your
phone so it doesn't really hurt right
it's all it's only a positive now with
the w1 chip I did not notice any
distortion or connectivity problems with
these headphones I never had them cut
out on me at all like I said I would
just forget that they were there I just
have to choose the music that I wanted
and it would play period so a lot of
people ask me in the console for okay do
the white ones get dirty yes they're
gonna get dirty especially if you're at
the gym might have gotten a little bit
dirty already so if you're at the gym
just beware if you're gonna get a white
pair just know that that's just signs of
wear it's just it comes with the
territory that you're gonna have some
get on your headphones but you can wipe
it off with alcohol and it comes off but
you know you can never get it back to
how wide it was when you first took it
out the box all in all a great headphone
set I've been enjoying using them and
testing them this week and I have
another video for you guys coming where
you guys will find out do these replace
my j-bird x3 you guys know how much I
love the j-bird ex threes so we will see
if they can do the job can they do it
what do you guys think write in the
comments below so anyways guys that's
been my time don't forget to subscribe
to the channel if you enjoyed this
review and I will see you guys in the
next video peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
