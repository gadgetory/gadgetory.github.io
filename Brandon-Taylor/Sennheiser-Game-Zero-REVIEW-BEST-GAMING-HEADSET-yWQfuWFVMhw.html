with another review today we are gonna
be taking a look at the Sennheiser game
0 headphones now I've been meaning to
try these for the longest time when I
mean long these have been on my want
list for a very very long time but I've
always had like such amazing headphones
even the Sennheiser 5 9 8 I've had the
audio so I never really thought to get a
really good set of gaming headphones now
in the past I've had like the a 40s by
Astro I've had the HyperX cloud twos
high brakes clout revolver s is the
logitech g930 threes so how did these
stand up to the competition let's see
today these are some of the most
comfortable gaming headsets I've ever
tried usually gaming set head says
they're usually like really bulky really
heavy the bands are they cut into your
head things like that these not so much
these are like pillows on top of your
head these you even forget that they're
even on so it's great when you're gaming
for a long period of time I love the
leather ear cups a lot they're very
cushiony they're very comfortable they
don't get too hot which I really like
another thing is they aren't really that
heavy they're very very light so again
they're not going to cut into the top of
your head and things like that like some
of the other headphones do now I went
with the special edition version which
is just a matte black all-black version
I don't know why I just it just stood
out to me so I got that but they also
have a black and red version and a white
and red version no these headphones are
no frills headphones and that's
something that kind of took it back at
first
usually headphones are there including
like an amp some kind of Dolby Digital
or surround sound buttons or quartz or
things like that this has none of that
this has a volume dial on the right ear
cup and on the left ear cup you're gonna
find the mic now the mic is a little
adjustable I wish that it was a little
bit
or I mean you can kind of move in front
of your face and away from your face a
little bit and also flipping it up also
mute the mic so again no frills there's
no buttons to press or anything like
that it just kind of works which isn't a
bad thing in this case now these plug
into your computer via a TRS jack and
also a mic jack and my sound card are
through my asus motherboard sounds very
very good I was actually super surprised
at how good they sound without any
amplification or any software no frills
these sounded better than a lot of the
gaming headsets that I've tried in the
past I think the only hit set that I
would put above these sound wise is the
a 40s by astro those things the sound
stage is just amazing these are a little
bit more closed back these are the
closed back version they also have the
game ones which are more open headphone
but I want it more of a closed headphone
this time and these actually sound
really good the basis thumping I can
actually leave these on and listen to
music I don't find myself reaching for
my thousand dollar pair of headphones as
often because these sound good enough to
get the job done most of the time this
was from gaming to listening to music
without any interruptions
now speaking of sound profiles and what
they sound like they sound very bassy
they actually have a lot of clarity in
them and that's something that I'm very
surprised a lot of the companies that
are putting like Dobby digital and
things like that into their headphones
they sound very bloated they've sound
very over emphasized and these stay true
to the sound that you'll be hearing in
your games and in your music so I really
really enjoy these these are probably my
second favorite in terms of just overall
sound quality so overall we will see how
well the build actually holds up in
these headphones I'm hoping that they
they really really hold up over time
I've seen pictures where people have
broken them but I do think that these
will hold up the hinges feel very nice
so if everything goes right with these
headphones the mic just sounds very good
in game is very full your voice sounds
great hey guys this is a test of the mic
let me know how I sound down but
so a great Mike great sound great build
quality well we'll see about that
but so far great build quality very
light I'm just loving this that except
these headphones they're also foldable
if you want to put them away or store
them somewhere so these are really no
frills no exciting Dobby digital things
they just run great through your
computer and they sound amazing so the
prices of these headphones is pretty
competitive
I found these for about 125 they are
usually going on sale for about 150 to
160 which in my opinion you're getting a
great set of headphones just in general
audiophile headphones here you're
getting a great mic you're not getting
any of the frills and yeah buttons and
all that we're here for a great
experience for our games and for our
music so and this delivers on all fronts
the soundstage is good enough where you
can hear people behind you to the side
of you and hear your world around you
it's a little bit more closed but what
are you gonna do can't have everything
right so anyways guys I love these
headphones the games zeros by Sennheiser
you guys did it again sennheiser sponsor
me baby because these are amazing
alright guys so that is my time I hope
you guys have enjoyed this review let me

headphones or any headphones in general

gaming headset or anything like that let
