to the first dope tech under 50 video on
the channel now every month I'll be
doing one of these videos detailing some
of the more budget-friendly accessories
because I know sometimes the prices
can't get a little bit crazy on the
things that I've been reviewing so I
wanted to make it up to you guys and
your wallets by making a top 5 under 50
video every month and the tech in these
videos are gonna be things that I
actually use or things that I actually
deemed worthy of your guys's hard-earned
cash now there will be links to
everything in the video posted down
below so first up we have my current
desktop speakers that I use every single
day the creative lab pebbles coming in
at $25 these really impressed me before
this I was using $400 speakers but I
felt like I wanted a little bit more
space and something more minimal and
these round minimal speakers fit the
bill I think they look amazing and for
25 dollars they'll have your desk
rattling from the amount of bass that
they put out so they plug directly into
your computer sound card and the USB
port powers them so I like that as USB
powered because it allows you to free up
another space on the wall you don't have
one more thing to plug in which is nice
like I said the sound quality on these
is insanely good for the price I watched
movies I listen to music on these and
they have been nothing short of amazing
for twenty-five dollars it's actually
ridiculous alright so this next one is
kind of a fun one but very functional it
comes in at $12 and it's a keyboard
slash desk volume for those of you who
eat at your desk this mushroom desk
cleaner will be a godsend it operates
off two double-a batteries that load
into the top then you just run this over
your keyboard or your desk and it will
suck up all the debris that falls in
between your keyboard like hair food
animal hair all those good things we
picked up by this cleaner for me I use
it every single week I try to do it at
least twice a week and to keep my
keyboards clean they've got some
bristles on the bottom that helps with
like brushing and getting some of that
dust off of your keyboard the third item
on the list is the rhombus 7.1 surround
sound
headset coming in at 22 to 27 dollars
the way I found out about these is my
friend one day was talking over discord
and I was blown away by his mic quality
I knew immediately he upgraded his mic
I thought he spent well over $100 for
some boom mic or some desk
mic I don't even know and turns out he
had this cheap 22 to $27 headset now me
you guys know that I'm a big skeptic of
headsets so these actually have to be
really good for me to actually recommend
them they come in various colors like
red and blue and have an amazing braided
cord that your cup and headband have a
lot of padding as well the material is
faux leather on the ear cups and the top
is not the highest quality but what can
you expect for $22 they've got these
huge 50 millimeter drivers inside that
sound better than a lot of gaming
headsets well over the hundred dollar
mark I'm not biessing you guys you
really have to try these to understand
what I'm talking about
so anything whether you're a gamer or
you listen to music it has a lot of bass
that will like have your headphone
rattling which is nice and again the
thing that really stood out to me about
this headset was the noise cancelling
microphone that makes you sound like you
are in a sound booth let's drop a sound
test for you guys right now what's up
guys is bt here and for $22 I think this
mic doesn't sound too shabby especially
for the price and if you're on a budget
you don't want to spend a hundred
dollars on the headset you just want
something that works this is a great
option it also has a controller on it
which I forgot to mention which has a
volume control on there as well as
switching the mic off these also come
with a one-year warranty so if anything
happens to them you are covered and I
know that can be a common problem with
these cheaper headsets is that they
break so it's nice that they give you
that one year warranty so I feel
confident recommending it to you guys
next up for 50 dollars we have an age as
a 33 keyboard a great budget no-frills
keyboard that gets the job done it's got
a very compact shape allowing you to hit
the function row faster they've also
moved a function key up by the f12 which
I've never seen before so that will take
some time to get used to it's
lightweight and it has
a USB mini port now at USBC but for $50
looking you do it's plug and play and
it's also got 18 RGB modes using the FN
+ f8 to switch so this keyboard is like
a tkl without all the space in between
like the function row and like the arrow
keys and all that it's got double shot
injected molded key caps which feel
great for the price don't expect PB T at
this price point but if you're on a
budget look no further than the a jazz
833 it comes with these like optical
blue switches that offer a similar
experience to the Cherry MX Blues let's
drop a sound test for you guys right
about now I mean either you love blues
or you hate them I'm in the middle I
can't do my own this time so sorry guys
sorry to disappoint maybe in the next
video also you can't put key caps on it
because it has a non-standard control
and arrow keys that are a little bit
bigger than the normal ones
now you can't put some like rubberized
tie hockey caps on it if you want but
overall this keyboard is just one stop
shop you have to kind of take it for
what it is for 50 bucks I think it's a
great pick up if you like blue switches
next up we have these owie come aid
Mouse bungee now this is something I
always use whether I have a pair cord or
not it just keeps your desk neat and
allows for constant cord length at all
times now I've been using this one for
about 3 plus years and unless I go
completely wireless in the near future
I'll probably be using it for another
three years now at the top of the spring
it's got a place for the cord to hold
the cord and then at the bottom it has
one as well and this allows for constant
tension so if you do take it too far the
whole bungee is not going to move with
it it's gonna give you some leeway there
alright guys well I hope you guys have
enjoyed this first installment of the
dope tech under 50 if you guys do end up
picking up some of these items or if you
already have them let me know what your
experience is down below don't forget to
