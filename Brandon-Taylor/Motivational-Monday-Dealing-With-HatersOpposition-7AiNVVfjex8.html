with another motivational Monday today
we're going to be talking about hate
adversity opposition from just other
people in general in life right we
always have those people that see you
doing good they see you happy they see
you having things they see you
accumulating new things try new things
and they feel jealous and they want to
take you down a peg and this week the
reason i'm talking about it is because I
dealt with it last week at my work and
it made me realize it made me sad first
and foremost that people or as a society
feel the need to bring others down and
sometimes you kind of think that it's
about you and you think why me why are
these people I'm a good person why are
these people coming after me and that's
exactly it because you're a good person
there's always going to be opposition
guys I'm Tony right now no matter how
successful anything as long as you're
trying to do something in life and be
better and you're happy and you're
living your life to the fullest you know
I wake up at seven I work at eight
thirty I get off of work at five I go to
the gym at six I get out of the gym at
eight I come home I edit until 12 or one
and then I go back to work and then
people at my work are hating little do
they know that I'm doing all this work
I'm doing all these different things and
they can't even imagine right so when
they see my group at work doing really
well everybody's smiling everybody's
happy they want to bring you down a peg
because they're unhappy or they're
overworked or they're stressed and just
because you're happy doesn't mean that
you're not working hard and that's my
point is that everything is surface
level guys there's a lot of work that
goes into everything everything that we
see we buy even the products there's
I'll think of all the hours and hours of
work that go into these products that
i'm reviewing and this is people's work
you know and that is in a sense amazing
in itself so the next time you come in
contact with people like this just feel
almost sadder be empathetic towards them
that life has brought them to this point
things have happened to them where they
feel the need to come after you for
being happy youtube comments I get I see
in other people's YouTube comments I'm
like who says these things who like
literally who does and says these things
in real life like what kind of person is
that and it's sad but at the same time I
almost empathize with those people that
wow that's the that's what they think is
right that is the way that they think
the world should be and what I want to
say to you guys the guys that are you
know supporting me and I see you guys in
the comments giving me good feedback and
I can tell that you guys are happy
people just off of that and what I want
to say to you guys is don't let anything
change that don't let anybody change
that nothing anybody says or does to you
always stay true to yourself always be
good do not stoop down to to their level
I'm telling you guys you'll be much
happier right now I saw the person that
was hating this week on my group and I
was smiled at them I had a conversation
with them and I just wanted to give them
good feelings because I empathize with
them so this week if you have people or
in the past if you have family members
friends co-workers people in your
classmates almost find it funny laughs
be empathetic with them and live your
life knowing that you're happy you can't
even be mad but you don't have time to
be mad or sad because we're so happy
so this week just remember that and in
life just remember this point that I'm
making to you guys something that I
really had to come to grips with this
week and it's sad but at the same time
it makes me realize how fortunate and
how just how fortunate I've been in my
life to have the things to do the things
to work hard to try to accomplish my
goals and not be afraid not be afraid so
there it is guys go out there kill it
this week and I will see you guys next
Monday
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
