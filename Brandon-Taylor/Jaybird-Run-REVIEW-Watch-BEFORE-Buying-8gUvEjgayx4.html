but jaybird you kind of forced my hand
what is up guys is BT back here again
with another review today we're gonna
take a look at a j-bert run headphones
jaybird has always been one of my
favorite go-to companies for wireless
headphones so when I saw that they had
completely wireless headphones it's like
hey I am all in whatever you guys make
I'm down for so let's see what they came
up with so I just want to start this
review off by saying you guys know that
I am a hundred percent honest in my
reviews and I would never want you guys
to buy anything or something that's not
worth your hard earned cash with that
being said this review is going to be a
little bit different than my others I'm
not gonna start with the comfort and
design which is amazing by the way and
also the sound quality that we've all
come to expect from jaybird it's there
it's really good the quick charge
features their charging case is amazing
solid all around but and this is a huge
but these headphones have a glaring
problem that trumps all the good about
them and that is the connection it is
terrible and it's unacceptable in my
opinion especially when you're paying a
hundred and eighty dollars for these
headphones the way they connect is buy
the right piece it connects to the phone
and then from there your left ear piece
connects to the other one during my time
with these I experienced flickering from
ear to ear from left to right which was
super distracting during my workout I
could not get a good workout and I
almost ran to my car to get another pair
of headphones they were rendered
completely useless in the gym so I see
why they call them the run headphones
because they can only be used outside on
a run outside not close to anybody where
they won't fail even at work when I was
just walking by people that had a phone
I would lose a signal to my headphones
and my songs would be breaking up like
crazy I couldn't even enjoy my music my
high hopes have been
and I didn't want to make this review
but hopefully j-bird will see this and
correct this product because it's not
fair to us especially paying $180 the
money for these is insane I hate to say
it but Apple seems to have perfected
this completely wireless tech from the
beginning with the air pods but the form
factor is not the best for workouts so
maybe Bose will be able to change this
with their new headphones I can't
recommend these I've tried them with my
Android my iPhone everything for
instance I had two of my phones in my
pocket earlier today and I had was
trying out the Jaber friends right so
what happens the one my Android phones
started interfering with my iPhone and
it was just all bad until we get
confirmation of a new firmware or an
update through their software and fixing
these issues I mean there's no reason
why we should be in 2017 getting delay
in our YouTube videos which is what the
freedoms and these runs have it just
makes me feel like I wasted one hundred
and eighty dollars and I'm sure you guys
out there too when you spend that kind
of money you expect a certain amount of
quality with your headphones or whatever
you're buying so I've really jaybird if
you're watching this please fix your
products put better Bluetooth in there
you guys have a V best sound you guys
have the profiles that can change the
firmware switching from device to device
which is genius your comfort is way up
there as they're smart about your tips
your wings and all that please like this
is the one thing keeping you guys from
passing the boses the apples in the
world you guys these right here could
have been the product of the year I kid
you guys not the product of the year I
was about to give these a rave review
until I started getting the break up
other than that these things are perfect
they fit in your ear flawlessly better
than any other headphone that I've tried
trust me
the sound is there the profiles are
there it's just the connectivity it's
just it's not usable and with that
hope that they are able to fix this
problem because this is just
unacceptable all right and I can't have
you guys my subs buying this product yet
alright guys so I didn't want to make
this review it is super negative but I
hope that this constructive criticism
can help jaybird make a better product
next year because they have the winning
formula they just need to put it
together alright guys so that is my time
has been your boy BT don't forget to
subscribe for more quality content like
this you know I always got your back
with the honest reviews no BS so we're
gonna keep going with this I got a lot
more reviews coming up I got some
battles coming for you guys that you
guys have you the subs have requested so
be on the lookout for that this coming
week alright guys and I will see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
