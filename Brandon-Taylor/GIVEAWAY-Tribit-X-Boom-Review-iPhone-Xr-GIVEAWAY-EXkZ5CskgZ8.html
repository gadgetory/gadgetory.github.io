another review now I get asking my
comment sections all the time what are
some great budget brands that I should
be looking at and for me tribe it has
always been a super solid and they sent
me out their tribe it X boom speaker
recently I've been trying it over the
last few weeks and this thing has been
amazing so I definitely wanted to share
this with you guys and also too they
have an iPhone XR giveaway that's right
the new one that's coming out and I want
to give you guys a chance to win so find
out later in the video on how you can
win one of those phones and before we
begin guys don't forget to hit that
subscribe button for more content like
this so one thing that I love about
tribe it is they always give great
quality at a fraction of the price and
that is no different with their
excellent speaker this can compete with
the JBL charge 3 they have very similar
specs and they're designed very similar
they sound very similar so why not go
with a version that is $50 cheaper this
thing is coming in at $70 and the JBL
charge is coming in at about $120 so
you're getting a great value with this
speaker but more on the speaker on the
front you're gonna find the volume
rocker you're gonna find a press play
pause button and a skip tracks you just
hit it twice just get backwards of track
you just hit it three times and I found
it to be super responsive the build
quality on this thing when you hold in
your hand you can definitely feel the
heft it doesn't feel cheap at all the
material that they use on the outside is
very nice so this is also ipx7
waterproof so you can take this thing to
the beach or the pool and I demonstrate
earlier I just put this thing into a
bowl of water and it works perfectly
fine afterwards on the back side you're
gonna find a power button the bluetooth
pairing button and an extra base button
which I know a lot of you guys will love
and I'll get more into that when we talk
about sound there's also a aux cord and
a charging port for this speaker another
thing is they have a silicone strap on
the top where you can hook this onto a
deck
during a party so that everybody can
hear the music you know the speaker
doesn't have to be down low
and the sound will get muffled and
things like that but we'll get more into
the volume of this thing later because
believe me listening has some power and
then on either side you're gonna find
the passive radiators given that bass
now for the sound this thing really
impressed me because one thing that I
can always tell whether a speaker or
headphone is cheap is by the mid tones
by that muffled just gunky muddy sound
that the vocals get I can barely hear it
if sound staticky and we as human beings
can notice right off the bat whether
somebody's voice sounds weird so that is
one thing that I always stress is that
the mid-tones have to be good and with
the speaker the mid-tone is really
really good I really enjoyed using the
speaker the bass on this thing is
amazing
the highs don't get clipped so if you
want to listen to classical music
listening that's a really good job and
not only that it has a lot of power the
volume of this thing also impressed me
and this all combined with the 360 sound
that's right so you can hear this from
any corner of your room or if you put it
in the middle of the party you just want
to put it right in the middle of the
table and just have it play while you
play cards or just hang out with your
friends you need some background music
this thing really does the job really
well and I just love it so much another
area where this thing is amazing is 20
hours of battery life so that is more
than enough time for you to get enough
usage out of this thing and probably
days after this thing will last you a
long time at 20 hours it has a 5200
milliamp battery that is high-quality
and I haven't noticed any integration of
the battery or any quick turn offs with
the speaker it's been solid the whole
time so in conclusion guys this speaker
is amazing you get great build quality
you get that waterproof you get the
extra base you get the clear mid-tones
there's a lot to love about this speaker
not to mention that 20 hours of battery
life I mean wow so first thing you have
to do is subscribe to the channel which
if you aren't already I mean what are
you doing second thing I want you to do
is go to their Facebook page and the
Instagram page and respond to the post
that they made on there
about the iPhone XR and from there
you're entered to win easy as that
simple enough and they will run this
until September 29th so you have a long
time to enter or to change your mind or
whatever you want to do but yeah good
winter guys why not I want you guys to
win an iPhone XR alright guys so that is
my time don't forget to subscribe like
share and comment on this video save
your friend some money and tell them
about tribe it and I will see you guys
