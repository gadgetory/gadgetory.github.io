with another review today I'm mad at
myself guys I'm mad because I wish I
would have tried these headphones sooner
these being the Sennheiser HD one on ear
wireless headphones I never got around
to picking them up before primarily
because of the price I mean four hundred
dollars for on ear headphones The
Audacity of Sennheiser guitars that much
how could they do that to us well that's
what I was saying before I bought them
what sparked me to buy them is that they
went on sale over twenty dollars but
knowing what I know now I would have
bought them for at least $400 as well so
let me tell you guys what I found out
today and why I believe that to be true
but before we begin don't forget to
subscribe as I have a few partnerships
coming up that I think you guys might be
interested in and that is thanks to you
guys supporting me and I will be trying
to return the favor to you guys by
getting more headphones out to my sub so
don't miss out make sure your sub also I
believe this is going to be the last
review of the year so I just want to
take the time out to say thank you to
everybody who has supported the channel
this year I appreciate each and every
one of you guys
in the packaging you'll find a nice case
it almost feels like suede they are
calling it Alcantara
which is a mix of 68 percent polyester
and 32 percent polyurethane you'll also
find this material on the actual
headphones themselves but we'll dive
into that a little bit later also in the
packaging you'll find a 2.5 millimeter
cord a USB charger and airplane adapter
which is nice for those of you who
travel the actual headphones themselves
are solidly built
they feature this gorgeous stainless
steel on the headband where you can move
the ear cups up and down to adjust to
your head size the ear cuffs and the
headband both feature that Alcantara
material I mentioned earlier the
material feels a little bit weird at
first and I thought it would be
uncomfortable on the ear cups on first
touch but they are actually really
really comfortable with on ear
headphones the problem you can run into
is that they get really really hot and
the pressure sometimes can be annoying
but not with these these apply a good
amount of pressure but don't kill your
ears by any means I can't wear these for
extended periods of time without ear
fatigue the hinges on the HD ones they
fold and are super sturdy as well I'm
always worried about the little court
that companies let hang to create that
old-school headphone aesthetic look but
not with these the court feels very very
strong it feels like you can survive a
lot of punishment all I know I love the
design of these headphones they are just
gorgeous to look at
so skeptical let me tell you guys $400
for on ear headphones yeah they better
be blowing me out of the water because
anything less than that and I'll be
disappointed but why do these deliver
these things are crystal clear
ridiculous what's in Heiser has managed
to do with these headphones is just
simply incredibly HD ones with the aptX
bluetooth technology only adds to how
great these sound vocals are right in
your face the bass rumbles like nothing
I've tried recently it's a different
kind of bass usually when I try
headphones somewhere along the way
either the high suffer the mid suffer or
the lows something always suffers for
instance if the mids are good the bass
is going to be held back or any
combination of those three it's like you
can have your cake but you can't eat it
butts in Heiser have served you up a
nice slice of cake and you can eat it
guys I don't know why I always talk
about cake maybe I should get some soon
what do you guys think they've managed
to balance everything perfectly without
the need of an EQ whoever you are out
there and whatever you like these will
blow your socks off guaranteed this is a
new standard for wireless headphones
just simply incredible I was throwing
everything at these guys from rap to
classical and everything in between
I know majority of the subs love bass
and let me tell you guys these things
blow beats v-moda and Sony out of the
water in the bass category the sub bass
on these is like nothing on the market
right now if you're looking for bass
these are the ones you need I mean just
wow I think I can go as far as to say
these are the best sounding on ear and
quite possibly the best sounding
wireless headphones that I've tried all
year but it comes at a price I almost
can't believe that these headphones are
even real oh and did I mention that they
get super loud I know some of you guys
loud music yeah I know these things just
have everything but with that loud sound
comes a lot of leakage so keep that in
mind the one area where I feel these
fall short is northern cancellation
I don't feel that it's there to be
honest with you guys
Sennheiser claims to have something
called noise guard technology in these
headphones to reduce outside noise but I
don't think it's fair to compare these
to something like a Sony or Bose in this
category so the one bad thing I have to
say about these headphones is the noise
cancellation the battery life is rated
at 22 hours and that's roughly what I
got from my testing I ran them at high
volume and I just let them sit in the
corner and they hit it so another area
where these headphones really shine is
the call quality is just simply amazing
the HD ones include a voice max
microphone in them which will have
people thinking you're holding the phone
right up to your head
in conclusion you know guys I'm still
mad at myself but a little less than
before and that's primarily due to the
fact that I've been wearing these 24/7
to make up for lost time I've gone back
to all my favourite music from this past
year 2017 and we listened to them again
using the HD ones on ear headphones I
just want to apologize to Sennheiser for
not believing in you guys you guys keep
killing it on all fronts even when you
move into the wireless headphone realm
the one flaw that these headphones have
is the noise cancellation if they can
fix that I think they will be the
throning Sony for me as the best
wireless headphone making company it's
gonna be interesting 2018 make sure you
guys are subbed let me tell you alright
guys so that's gonna do it for this
review
I've really enjoyed making these reviews
for you guys this year I'm kind of sad
that this year is over but I'm looking
forward to it new year new goals better

very very safe New Year's guys it's your
