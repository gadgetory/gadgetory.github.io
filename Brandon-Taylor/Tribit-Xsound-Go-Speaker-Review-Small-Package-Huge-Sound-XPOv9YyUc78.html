again with another review today we're
gonna look at the try bid x sound go now
this speaker was sent out to me a couple
months ago I've been using it like crazy
and almost forgot to make a review on it
so today we're gonna fix that I'm gonna
tell you guys why I've been using this
so much over the past few months but
don't forget to subscribe if you haven't
already there's more content coming out
and it really helps the channel out so
yeah sub if you haven't alright so let's
take a look at the design of this thing
now on the top you're gonna find the
power button the Bluetooth button the
play/pause button and you're gonna find
a volume up and down as well now what I
love about this thing is the buttons
feel great they're very snappy they're
clicky
they've held up over the past few months
so I am very impressed with the build
quality of this speaker and I took this
to Coachella recently and we were
fighting with our neighbors they had a
block rocker and that's one of those big
speakers you know one of those I don't
know like 12 by 12 inch speakers and
this thing kept up my other one couldn't
so it was very nice to have such a
powerful speaker within a small
form-factor
the only complaint that I really have
about the design of this thing is that
it's not a 360 design it doesn't go all
the way around it doesn't shoot out
sound everywhere so you kind of have to
put an angled in a corner somewhere to
kind of get the sound to blast all over
your room or your campsite or outside or
at a function or a gathering or party
for your family things like that so
that's the one complaint I would may put
speakers on both sides or have more
speakers or make a circular design of
this speaker speaking of the speakers
these things are great I love them I
mean they just there's so much bass with
these if you grab this while you have
music on it literally like well you can
just feel the speaker's working and I
just
love that feeling if the battery life is
also great and it charges very fast as
well while I was out at Coachella
obviously we don't have a lot of power
outlets I'm camping I'm out and I really
needed this thing to charge fast and it
did it got the music going you got the
party started so I'm very very thankful
for this speaker it's a great speaker
now it also has a little cord here you
can hang this on things so I hung it up
on our tent up top and I just let it
hang and I let it play music and night
it was very very lovely let me just tell
you guys that so a lot of functionality
with this speaker it also has an aux
input so if you don't have Bluetooth or
you want to save some battery just plug
in and aux into this thing and it works
like magic
so overall the try bit X sound goat is a
great speaker it has a great base it has
great clarity and you're getting this
all at the great price of only 36
dollars that is just incredible and I've
been loving this thing it's gone
everywhere with me recently it while I
was moving out of my last apartment I
just played this thing it got me going
so great speaker gets super loud great
form-factor all I thing is I want to
make it maybe a 360 design to have it
blast in every direction so that
everybody can hear but if you place it
correctly you can get the same effect
all right guys so that is going to do it
for this review and definitely pick one
of these up you know for your family for
your kids even if you just want to have
it like one in the kitchen that's cool
too so don't forget to Like share
