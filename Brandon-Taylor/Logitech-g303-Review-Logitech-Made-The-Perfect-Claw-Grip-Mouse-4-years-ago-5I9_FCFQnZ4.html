to pose this question to you all why on
earth did Logitech stop making the G 303
Daedalus apex it's a lightweight Mouse
and has a 3366 Center and a great claw
grip shape in my opinion so what gives I
believe it was discontinued around the
same time that the G Pro came out as a
replacement for it because so many
people were complaining about the shape
crapping their hands and I could see why
because it's not a one-size-fits-all
Mouse it has these very defined edges
and I can see how that can hurt your
hand especially if you're trying to palm
grip it or even a fingertip grip it
sometimes I believe that Logitech wanted
to make something more Universal and
more comfortable for everyone but I kind
of beg to differ because for most people
they want control we want control right
guys over there Mouse and the g3 o3
offers that and then some in my opinion
so today I'm going to be going over why
I think Logitech needs to bring back the
g3 o3 and some improvements that they
can make moving forward from that old
2015 model now the price of this mouse
can vary because it can only be bought
used right now when it came out it was
only $70 but now you can find them for
that price it's not higher and I think
that price is really driven by shroud
one of the best FPS players to ever walk
this earth
so naturally everybody's gonna want this
mouse so today let's figure out if it is
worth it so let's start off with the
build quality and the design of this
mouse it's coming in at 87 grams
I'd like to see the Logitech maybe shave
off a couple of more grams maybe 80 75
70 would be perfect for this Mouse in my
opinion it's got six mouse buttons two
on the side a scroll wheel a deep
on the top which is slanted back so if
you reach your index finger back it'll
catch on that little slant there which
is very nice the side buttons are near
the edge of the mouse at the top of the
slant and it kind of feels awkward
sometimes to press them but it's not
horrible it's got that old logitech
scroll wheel that's smooth I think if
they were to remake this Mouse I think I
would like to see like a ridge scroll
wheel like on their newer mice like a
Jeep pro or a G 305 let's drop an early
sound test for you guys because I know
you love them so much we got the mouse
one in two we got the side buttons got
the DPI button you have to scroll wheel
button I do some scrolling for you as
well oh yeah like I said earlier this
mouse has a diamond shape with six sides
that you don't really see too often and
for a lot of people this brought a lot
of discomfort in the past on the front
two side panels they have a nice matte
coating with a nice slant towards the
bottom footprint where your thumb pinky
and ring fingers go on the back it's got
a glossy shine through RGB cage that
looks pretty sick in my opinion it's got
those hexagons back there I don't know
if they were on the hexagon height
before a final Mouse but they're
definitely on there I love this caged
RGB look it's very distinct and it makes
this Mouse stand out you know that this
is going to be a g3 l3 when you see it
it's also got the RGB Logitech G logo on
the back and then at the very bit of the
mouse the part that sits into your palm
it's got a slight roundedness to it to
give slight comfort so let me get this
out of the way right now guys this mouse
is a hundred percent mate for claw grip
while you can use other grip styles I
don't feel like they'll be optimal it's
almost impossible to get a palm grip on
this mouse the back isn't big enough to
hold the whole size of your palm that
diamond shape is very tapered so it's
very hard to get your whole palm on
there as well for a fingertip grip I
feel like it's more doable than palm
grip but I feel like the corners
the diamond really get in the way and
those are the reasons why I think this
Mouse is the best for claw grip or
hybrid cloud grip users the good thing
about claw grip is that unless you have
freakishly large hands your fingers can
bend a little bit to accommodate for the
clicks the diamond shape size of the g3
o3 making join this mouse with your
thumb and pinky amazing as demonstrated
here now if you found the g pro or the g
305 or any of his variants too slippery
or too smooth I think that the edges on
the G 303 might be what you guys are
looking for now whenever I mention
Logitech's braided cord people get their
panties in a bunch and they always ask
me why it is that I hate braided cores
well you can't convince me that they're
good let me show you guys what I mean
look at this it's fraying over time this
stuff is on a break down over time it's
stiff when you press against it you are
definitely going to want a mouse bungee
when you have any of the logitech 488
cords the six mouse feet are actually
really really smooth Logitech might have
to go back to these stock feet because
they actually feel great on cloth and
hybrid pads it's rocking a knee to
Dallas apex 3366 sensor I hope I'm
saying that right this features a delta0
optical sensor which minimizes
speed-related accuracy variance no I
don't know if this is just marketing
mumbo jumbo or what but the sensor has
been performing perfectly for me it's
super accurate I have a feeling that the
Dallas Apex ish was just like a
precursor to their newer hero sensor
which is one of my favorites currently
the DPI goes up to 12,000 dpi I
experienced no spin outs with this mouse
as well super solid all the way around
now the Logitech G hub software is my
favorite you guys know that it has a lot
of bugs that won't show your mouse
sometimes you have to restart it just
for your massive show up so there's a
lot of things that go wrong with it but
overall I feel like they are kind of
fixing some of the bugs because I
haven't had any of those problems lately
so I have hope for them Thank You
Logitech for the updates but anyways
guys in the software you can actually
control the RGB the dpi and if you want
to customize the buns you can do that as
well everything that you need is gonna
be fair like always overall the
performance of this mouse has blow me
away and left me questioning
why this mouse was taken away from us so
soon gone too soon right it was only
introduced in 2015 and after using it
for the past month I feel like this is
not just quick it's built for speed with
the edges allowing extreme control for
clock abusers out there
I repeat claw grip users for most people
I think that they won't find it
comfortable and me personally my hands
did get a little bit crampy after a
while but after a few days of gaming
with his mouse my hand got used to it
because I came from the GU old school
and that's the Ergo Mouse so when you go
from like a ergo Mouse to a straight
claw grift Mouse there's gonna be some
discomfort and this mouse it's built for
speed it's built for performance so
comfort kind of takes a backseat in a
way and that just comes with the
territory but if anything they should
make this Wireless and or just remove
that braided cord and put one on it like
the G pro hero and put a newer scroll
wheel on it and I think a lot of people
would come running back to this Mouse
afore they ever did release it so
Logitech from us mice enthusiasts to you
please rerelease this mouse because we
need it alright so thank you guys for
watching I hope you guys have enjoyed
this review it has been your boy bt
