another review today we're gonna be
taking a look at the final Mouse ultra
light Pro now I got the sunset edition
it's that beautiful orange look I love
it now the first thing you guys might be
saying about the bat are why are there
holes in this mouse aha that is where
the innovation comes in because Mouse's
around this size do not weigh 67 grants
but this one does
most weigh around 90 upwards to about
120 grams which is just crazy so this is
a breakthrough in terms of weight and
the thinking is a lighter mouse is gonna
help you aim better it's gonna help you
snap on to a bonus better and just be
able to a maneuver around a lot more
than any game that you're playing so
today I'm gonna be telling you guys a
little bit about why I love this mouse
this thing has replaced all my other
mouse's avid Teta Mouse's as a gene I
know three of the g7 oh three I have the
G Pro have the SteelSeries rival have
all these different Mouse's and this one
takes the cake so let me tell you guys a
little bit about why I love this Mouse
but before I begin don't forget to hit
that subscribe button for more content
like this so one of the first questions
you might be having is can you fill the
holes on this Mouse when you are laying
your palm on it and the answer is no
these holes just disappear they're very
smooth and they're not really like
jagged edges to where you're gonna be
feeling them did however feel like the
slope on the back is not that great for
claw grip I felt like I can feel the
holes and there's not much of a butt to
really put your palm there and rest it
and kind of maneuver although you can
use claw I don't think it's the best
finger tip and also palm work great with
this mouse I've had to kind of adjust my
claw grip and make it more of a hybrid
palm grip with my fingers just relaxed
and that has worked great for me the
comfort is just amazing I can game with
this thing for hours and not be foot
at all let me tell you guys I mean at
all zero fatigue it's gonna be
protecting you from wrist injuries so I
feel like this is a worthy investment if
you are a heavy gamer so outside of that
the coating on this thing is amazing
it's some kind of hybrid rubber rice
coating that just feels great in the
hand
I've even eaten and then used the mouse
and actually got some food on it and it
cleaned off right away it didn't leave
any oil it didn't absorb anything to
make it feel different it feels like the
day that I got it
now this mouse is great for sniping it's
great for tracking it's great for
projectile the main games that I play as
overwatch and I play a lot of hitscan
and I also play a little bit of ferret
now Hanzo since it's in the meta and
what I noticed is switching from my
Logitech G Pro over to this mouse I
didn't have to adjust for long it took
me only about thirty minutes to really
get to this mouse whereas other Mouse's
that weigh a lot more the weight
distribution is kind of off it takes me
a couple of days to really really get my
aim to back to where it was before
whereas this I was popping hits within
30 minutes it was with ease and that is
just something that I've never come
across using tons and tons of Mouse's
over 20 Mouse's now so I have to say
that the lightness really does play a
big part not only because of like the
weight distribution and things like that
but also too like adjusting to the mouse
it helps you so much side bones feel
great and the left and right buttons
feel great as well the best way to
describe these mouse buttons is
consistency it feels like they don't
change ever
when you click once it's the same and
next time the next and the next
the only gripe I really have about this
mouse is the mouse wheel I feel like the
ridges should be a little bit bigger and
it just doesn't let give you a little
bit more haptic feedback I don't really
know sometimes when I'm scrolling the
will or if it's scrolled so that is one
thing that I could change about this
mouse another thing that I could change
is the DPI button I wish it there was
some kind of software or light on the
mouse to show okay you're at 800 you're
at 1600 3200 or 6400 things like that
somebody that just picks out this mouse
is not going to
unless you're like a veteran unless
you're like a veteran shooter computer
user and you know what the DPI's kind of
feel like or you're used to your dpi
it's really hard to adjust and know what
setting you're at so you could be at
anything so yeah that's one thing that I
would add outside of that it is a great
mouse
now the ultralight pro also has the 3360
which is the top-of-the-line sensor has
no liftoff distance problems or spinning
out or anything like that this thing is
flawless you can feel comfortable and
confident that this thing will not let
you down in-game cord is also very very
nice it's braided and it's not like the
logitech braided where it's just
dragging this thing I could not feel it
on my mousepad at all not on my
SteelSeries not on my Logitech mouse
pads this thing worked flawlessly and
this is also going to be great for you
guys that have low senses because you're
not gonna have to get fatigued like
throwing around a hundred grand mouse
this 67 grams just disappears it just
becomes kind of like a just your arm
playing it's just like your brain is
just I can't explain it enough to you
guys so if you guys got the mouse and
you're looking for reassurance that you
got the right Mouse yeah you got the
right Mouse I know these things are sold
out right now and again I'm not
sponsored this video is not sponsored at
all but they should be coming back I
don't know when I know they just sold
out again these things are selling like
hotcakes and now I see what the hype is
about it's not hype it's reality so yeah
there you have it this is a great gaming
mouse when they come back in stock you
gotta get one you gotta try these out
guys
this thing is coming in at about 80
bucks which I guess is another negative
but when you think about it you're not
gonna get any wrist injuries arm
injuries shoulder injuries from throwing
around a heavy Mouse so that's also nice
it's a great mouse against the BT Seal
of Approval alright so thank you guys
for watching if you have any more
questions let me know down below I'll be
sure to answer you guys and I will see
you guys the next videos been your boy
sleep
