with another review today I have a new
comparison for you guys that I wanted a
year ago when I was making a decision
between these two gaming headsets and
that is between the HyperX cloud twos
and the astro a40 s they're very popular
and odds are if you have searched for
some gaming headphones you have come
across either one of these headphones so
I thought hey why not give you guys the
review that I wanted a year ago because
hey now I have a YouTube channel and I
can do what I want so sound is one way
you can get the edge on your opponent
now with the surround sound in these
headphones you can get that edge
finally you can hear people behind you
and friend you to the side to the left
to the right that is a very important
feature to have and hey if somebody's
just using some Apple earbuds to play
games you're going to have the leg up
and vice versa if you're not using
gaming headphones and somebody has 7.1
they're going to hear you before you can
hear that so let's start off with the
surround sound and who I think has the
better surround sound now of course the
HyperX cloud twos have a little button a
7.1 button where you can turn on and off
this feature of Dolby Digital 7.1 but it
is very very artificial it sounds like
you're pressing a button to turn on the
7.1 it doesn't sound like it's in the
headphones and you could tell it's
something that is created when you turn
on this button
at first it bothered me coming from the
a 40's but after time I kind of got used
to it and having that closed back design
with the isolation is very very nice you
don't want to have these cupped on my
head
I can't hear anything it's very muffled
now moving on to the Astro a40 s these
really remind me of an open-back
headphones they have a wide soundstage
where you can hear people like 50 miles
away on the game hypothetically
and you can hear bullets whizzed past
you and it's within the headphones the
technology is already in the headphones
there's nothing to turn on except for
plugging these into the mix amp which we
will get to later but it feels more
solid it feels very nice the sounds the
booms the explosions they sound right in
your face they smack you right in your
face giving you that immersion so in one
headphone we have isolation in the other
we have amazing soundstage which one do
you prefer I prefer the soundstage
because they let me feel like I am in
the world it makes me feel like I am in
a 360 world and I can hear people over
here over there and it just feels more
accurate
it doesn't feel artificial like the
HyperX clouds so this round is going to
go to the Astro a40 s now let's move on
to the mic test I have recorded a mic
test for you guys for you guys to check
out the sound quality of each of these
mics so here we go
testing testing one two three this is
the hyper x cloud to headphones
testing testing 1 2 3 this is the Astro
a 4 headset let me know what you guys
think of these so what did you guys
think did you think the HyperX clouds
were better or did you think that the
Astro a40 s were better me personally I
like the HyperX clouds just a little bit
better the mic sounded a little bit
clearer kind of more accurate whereas
the azure a 4 D sounded a little tinny
and a lot of people have commented on my
headphone mic when I am playing during
games using the a 40 s so there's one
feature that really distinguishes these
two headphones and that is the remote
with the HyperX clouds and the mix amp
of the astra a four days now first let's
start with the HyperX clouds remote now
the remote on these is very nice it has
a mic on and off switch which I really
appreciate so if somebody burst in on
you playing you could just mute the mic
and you don't get embarrassed also have
a headphone increase volume decrease and
you also have a mic increase in decrease
so it gives you a lot of control over
what the headphones can actually do now
here's the difference the Astro a40 s
have a mix app and this gives you even
more control than the HyperX clouds to
remote now the Astro a40 s
mix app it allows you to turn up the
sound and down the sound and it also
lets you turn down the game or turn up
the voices of your teammates so it gives
you ultimate control I'm not just your
headset but the actual game and that is
the biggest difference between these two
it just looks cool just sitting on your
desk it's like a standalone little
device where you can plug in I plug in
all my headphones into this device to
get to my computer so I don't have to
reach around the back of my computer and
try to plug in my actual headphones it's
just nice to have that so you gain a lot
of accessibility you gain a lot of
features just by using this mix on the
mix am also lets you connect optical out
to let's say a ps4 and I found that to
be very nice it has very good quality
the setup for the a 40 s is a little
tough with the ps4 I will say that you
have to
do a lot of settings tinker with the
settings to get it to work properly and
a sound properly your mic to work
properly so if you're mainly getting
these four console gaming's just be
aware that you're going to have a lot of
tinkering to do whereas on PC you're
going to be able to just plug and play
now with the HyperX clouds the remote
plugs USB into your ps4 the seven point
one works it also works with the PC so
either way you're good on that account
this round I feel like is a little
unfair because you have the mix and
versus the remote and of course mix amp
wins just for functionality there's so
much more functionality and it gives you
so much more control over your gaming
that that is my pick for this round now
we kind of did this review in Reverse I
usually start with comfort and design
and I really felt like the mic and the
surround sound are the premier features
of any headphone you can buy for gaming
so I'm just going to briefly talk about
the comfort now the HyperX cloud twos
they're really tight when I first got
them they were clamping to my head and
it was hurting my jaw but over time they
loosened up and become very comfortable
the top band is very nice it has leather
cups it also has a leather band up top
which sits down on your head and it
feels very nice
so overall after a while once you break
them in they feel great now keep in mind
they still cause a little bit of
sweating because of the leather and your
skin contact and all that so be aware
that's something that irritates you stay
away from the HyperX clouds Actros on
the other hand have a swivel design
which I very much like because you can
have these on just if somebody's talking
to you just backing us up if that wasn't
a good demonstration let's try this
again put them on if somebody's talking
to you you could just flip on your ear
cup and you get hear what they're saying
okay cool got it I got the command we're
going to attack okay cool boom done so
if you're playing in a land a situation
or anything like that
the Astros I really like they're a tad
bit bulky I will say that and they have
a lot of hard plastic hard edges to give
it that kind of gamer look at first I
didn't really like it and it felt very
heavy but I've gotten heavier headphones
so I feel light almost at the end of the
so they're not too bad just keep in mind
there are heavier than the HyperX cloud
- so the a 40s also come with these
cloth ear cups and they bead a little
bit but not too bad it's it's a soft
cloth so you don't have to really worry
about it irritating your skin which
there's more padding in the top I will
say that I was sort of more padding
because sometimes these little hard
edges of the plastic really hurt so
that's something that they should
probably look into just making the whole
band just cloth why not so the comfort
and design round will go to the HyperX
cloud tubes now in conclusion who do I
think won this battle hold on I give it
to the Astro a40 s these have been my
main workhorse for gaming they haven't
done me wrong and I doubt they will do
you guys wrong they are more expensive
coming in at about 200 to 250 whereas
you can find the hyper X clouds for
about 60 70 to 100 so if your budget is
an issue by all means the HyperX cloud
twos do an amazing job they're an
amazing value I'd say they're probably
the best bang for your buck these are
just if you want that step above if
you're not just a casual gamer you
actually spend some time behind some
controllers or behind a keyboard and you
need a good set of headphones so at the
end of the day I would go with the Astro
a40 s they also sound great with music
movies so you can't really go wrong but
with the a 40s alright guys so thank you
guys for watching I appreciate each and
every one of you I will see you guys in
the next video peace it's all angel just
won't
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
