what's up guys bTW here and this is the
review of the g7 oh three hero version
now like many of you when logitech was
teasing this I thought it was the new
Wireless G 303 or at least with a 303
hero but we got the G 703 hero and I was
like you know what this is kind of a
money grab but lo and behold I got the
mouse and they actually did make a
couple of changes to this Mouse so today
I'm gonna be going over what I love
about the G 703 hero Edition and why I
think it's one of the most underrated
mics that's coming out this year and the
best wireless or go mouse that you can
buy currently also I want to go over how
you can hold this mouse because I know
that hump kills a lot of you guys out
there I found out a way where you can
hold this and have it be comfortable as
a pump user alright guys so starting off
with what's in the box you'll get the G
703 hero which carries the same shape
the same dimensions the same colors on
the outside it looks like the same Mouse
also in the Box they have a Brita
charging cable I mean come on Logitech
you know help me help you okay you guys
were doing so well with the G pro
Wireless non braided cable and then you
keep going back to this braided cable
that nobody wants I mean I guess it
protects the cable over time but for
most people let's say you have to charge
it and you're in a bind and you don't
have another Mouse around and you forgot
to charge it overnight you're gonna be
forced to use this braided cable and it
just sucks so the G 703 is a
right-handed Mouse it's got that ergo
design where it has grooves on the right
side and the left side to kind of force
your hands into a more comfortable
position even though the shape and
dimensions are the same this mouse is
actually twelve grams lighter than the
original G 703 light speed so now
instead of 107 grams you are now down 12
grams to 95 grams which is greatly
appreciated and I think this makes this
Mouse the G 703 hero a lot more viable
for a lot of people the side grips like
I mentioned in my lot
to take top three gaming mice video are
some of the best in the game if not the
best you can quote me on that I'm going
on record in saying these are my
favorite side grips on any Mouse on the
market currently so when you have a
mouse that's 95 grams having amazing
side grips really really helps to negate
some of that weight if you have a heavy
Mouse and then a slippery Mouse at the
same time you're done for I don't care
how good your aim is that Mouse is not
going to be controlled to its maximum
potential on the bottom it's got the
same three Mouse feet it's got one in
the middle around the sensor and it's
got one at the front and one at the back
now let me just tell you guys I am very
thankful that I have an extra set of
hyperglycaemia stock feet yeah I am very
thankful that I have those now I don't
know if I've just been spoiled but these
just did not perform that well coming
from my old G 703 I can definitely tell
the difference with this mouse so after
this review I am gonna be taking these
off as soon as possible and putting on
some hyper glides the mouse one and two
if you guys have been watching my videos
are the standard for me I compare every
Mouse that I get to the clicks of the G
703 let's drop a sound test for you guys
right about now uh-huh yeah got it do it
for the G 703 this thing has to be one
of the best on the market it's not so
light that you're gonna miss press it
but they're so light that you can click
heads with ease they've also got these
gigantic two side buttons on the side
let's do a sound test for you guys right
about now so good it is very hard to
miss these big buttons on the side and
that's one thing that I love about the G
seven of three is how easy it is to hit
these side buttons the scroll wheel in
the past with the old G 403 s and G 703
s there's a lot of rattle and things
like that there's no rattle here let's
do a shake no rattle there okay that's
good now let's do a quick test this one
is nice and clicky I do wish when
scrolling the scroll wheel that it was a
little bit more defined it's a little
bit too fast for me
I would like something closer to like
maybe like model oh let's say on top of
the mouse you're gonna have the DPI
button where you can switch your dpi
on-the-fly
me personally I usually just disable
this because I always miss press it and
then my mouse cursor or my gun and game
just goes all over the screen and yeah
it's not a fun time so I've seen a lot
of posts about the mouse hurting your
hand or getting cramps and I was there
okay
this mouse works best with claw grip
because that hump it really shoots your
palm over that hump and then your
fingers come down on the mouse one and
two and the front of the mouse so for
you palm grip users out there I have a
solution for all of you guys that have
tried this mouse and it wasn't
comfortable so what I tried to do when I
first got this mouse was that I put my
palm right where the G was okay right
where that hump was thinking that that
was the right place to put it
no that's not it because that will give
you hand cramps and discomfort and
you're not gonna like the mouse so what
I did was I had to modify it a little
bit so what I did was I put like the top
25% of my hand and I put that on the G
okay and then your hand kind of drapes
over the back and then what you're gonna
want to do is I find that a 1-3-1 grip
really works well with this mouse and
you have that right ledge on the right
side where you can rest your ring finger
a little bit and then get a very precise
aim with it I I really like research
this and I was looking at players that
use this mouse like Joe knack from the
NYX L and I was looking at how he held
his mouse and that is how he did it
so I tried it this way and I've had
amazing results I can game with this
mouse for hours and it is super
comfortable so you can use fingertip
grip as well with this mouse but it's
not ideal because it has such a huge
groove on the left side I'd like to
recommend the g pro Wireless for you
fingertip grip users out there this is
more of a claw palm grip in my opinion
and it is a medium sized Mouse it could
be a little bit on the bigger side but
I'd say it's right smack dab in the
middle of being like a medium sized
Mouse so it'll work for a lot of people
and if you have large hands you can make
it work as well with the grip that I
stated earlier the 16 K dpi of the hero
sensor can be changed and the Logitech
software it also has a place where you
can change the buttons and customize
those as well
you can also custom
the RGB on the mouse but I mean my hands
covering my mouth 90% of the time so I
don't really care too much about it but
to each their own if you want to change
the RGB you can do that as well
so this new hero sensor is also more
power efficient so you get 35 hours over
the old 24 hours of the original G 703
light speed you can also use this with
the power play pad but I haven't had the
best experience with it because the
cloth kind of comes up from the plastic
so I usually don't recommend people to
get it and for 35 hours you won't have
to charge this that often anyway so I
think you'll be good with just going
with the mouse and charging it the
normal way and using the mousepad of
your choice that's gonna last you a long
time speaking of which not only does the
hero perform amazing in game it performs
on every single surface that you can
imagine whether that's an artisan
 CAI a Raiden or my new personal
favorite the artisan 0xl soft I aim so
well with this Mouse I feel like I have
total control and that Wireless side
grips the sensor everything just clicks
on all cylinders with this Mouse so I
can wholeheartedly recommend this mouse
to any of you guys out there that's a
claw or palm grip user with medium to
large hands if you have smaller hands
you might want to check out the G probe
Wireless I think that would be a better
fit for you like I said I think with all
of the weight hype and all that I think
shape and grip really takes like a back
seat but Logitech has done a lot right
with this mouse it might seem like oh
they're just trying to do a money grab
this thing they're charging 100 bucks
which I think it's the same price as the
old one I think the old ones maybe like
80 bucks and this one's like a hundred
bucks so I'm glad that they didn't go up
to the $150 range which they could've
because they make the best Wireless on
the market right now but they didn't do
that they gave us it for $100 they lower
the weight to 95 they listen to us on
what okay it's got that same great shape
so if you love the original one but
maybe the G 703 Lightspeed was too heavy
for you so I think the G 703 hero is
gonna be the most slept on Mouse of the
year you can quote me on that
because everybody's in this craze of
weight but this shape the sensor
everything just works here like I said
easy pickup for 100
alright guys so that is gonna do it for
