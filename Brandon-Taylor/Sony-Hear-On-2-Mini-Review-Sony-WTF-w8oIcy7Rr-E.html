with another review today we are gonna
be taking a look at the sony here on 2
minis a little brother to one of my
favorite headphones ever so do these bad
boys carry on the legacy of its older
brother let's find out today
before we begin don't forget to hit that
subscribe button for more content like
this and it really helps up the channel
so in the box there is nothing new here
there's going to be a carrying case a
3.5 millimeter jack
and a USB charger now the one thing I
noticed when I picked up these
headphones is how much they rattle I
mean listen to this they rattle a lot
the build quality is not of the standard
with what the here on Tues the bigger
brothers feel like these they carry some
of the same characteristics I mean they
carries the same colors the metal band
is the same which is very nice the
headband is very comfortable at the top
the push in the faux leather is great on
the ear cuffs the same material but
there's something that they took away
from this that makes it less solid and I
don't know what it is but something
about this thing just creaks and rattles
and that's one thing that I will give to
the beats solo threes is that even
though it's a step down they still keep
the same hinges and they still keep the
same build quality that the rest of the
beats products have with this I feel
like they downgraded it so much that it
kind of made the product a little bit
bad for build quality so Sony bring you
back a little bit you know put more
build quality into these headphones so
that they last and I think you'll be
okay moving on of course they have taken
out the touch controls which is another
big thing from the Sun here on Tues I
mean I kind of didn't expect them to
keep it but it would have been nice here
you do get some very nice buns on here a
volume rocker a press play pause and
accept calls button and then on the
other side you have
a power button the input for a 3.5
millimeter jack and for the USB so they
really just dumbed down the Sony here on
Tues to the point where it's almost too
much and I feel like they probably
should have added in a little bit more
quality a little bit more features to
make these feel a little bit better
because they are coming in at $150 it's
still not cheap right so that's no
excuse to make a bad build quality
headphone so let's talk about the sound
quality now these do have the same 1.5
seven inch dome driver that the older
brothers have but something's not right
here
these do not sound that good the base is
there the mids everything is there
right but there's no power behind it
there's no power to drive that sound
home now don't get me wrong the base on
these is really really good I really
like it okay I just wish that it was
louder the max volume on this is just
abysmal it's almost like the low volume
on the Sony here on Tues so for some
reason there's no power being brought to
these headphones to make them what they
should be it's like they're being held
back by Sony for some reason like they
didn't put enough electronics in here to
drive them properly now when I plug them
in to my deck and they actually sounded
really really good which leads me to
believe that yeah
Sony you need to work on the Bluetooth
connection for these headphones that
being said these do sound good with like
rap they do sound good with vocal music
they sound really good it's just that
there's no power behind it and so I
can't really recommend them for sound
quality they just don't sound that good
I mean they have the ESEE which upscales
the low quality music up into a high
quality music file but still like the
powers just not there so recently I
think I've reviewed the TREB labs e2s
and I think those even sound better for
a third of the cost of these so
sunny what are you doing so I know the
next question that people are gonna ask
me is how do these sound compared to the
solo threes and you know what the soul
of threes blow these out of the water
the solo threes sound great okay I don't
care what you guys say I don't care what
you beat satyrs say the solo threes
sound great
yeah said it with that being said the
call quality sounds good
the battery life is at 24 hours which is
really good
everything is here except for the power
and they stripped away what made the
Sonia here out to great I mean they
still have the app or you can change the
song profiles create your own adjust the
surround sound but the power just isn't
there to drive these home the power
isn't there to make these what they
should be and live up to the Sony
quality so Sony go back to the drawing
board
the h8 hundreds they need work okay in
the second version of these things I
want to hear some power okay I wanna
hear some power Sony so make it happen
and yeah that's gonna be it for this
review if I were you guys there are
plenty of other headphones that are
cheaper that sound and have more power
than these so skip them alright guys so
thank you guys for watching don't forget
