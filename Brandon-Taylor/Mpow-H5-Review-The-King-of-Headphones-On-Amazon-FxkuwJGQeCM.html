here again with another review today
we're gonna be looking at the king of
Amazon in pal and their h5 headphones
now these were sent out to me by them to
test them out they haven't given me any
instructions on what to review or
anything to talk about so today I'm just
gonna give you the lowdown on whether
these budget ANC headphones are worth it
over like Sony and Bose or should you
just save up your pennies and go with
Bose and Sony in the long run so once
you go down into this price range for
ANC headphones you see the quality and
the build quality and the comfort just
nosedive completely either it's just too
rigid or the comfort just isn't there
you can't wear them for a long time
these are some of the first ANC budget
headphones that I've tried that don't
feel like they're gonna break after a
week so with that being said these do
feel a little bit more rigid than a Bose
or Sony or Sennheiser just even like
adjusting the headband while it's on or
off just isn't as smooth as some of
those so you kinda it kind of goes with
the territory that that's gonna happen
when you have these kind of headphones
the ear cups aren't as forming to your
ear or your head as they would be on
like a Sony or a Bose they don't have
that memory foam that's nice and
comforting that you can wear for like 20
hours and not even like notice that
they're on anymore it's not that
comfortable but guys these will do a
great job if you just want to travel for
a couple of hours I think if I was
traveling for like 16 to 20 hours I
think I would actually need a break from
wearing these for a little bit in
between somewhere in there the ear cups
are these faux leather and on the top of
the headband there's this nice faux
leather again just a very nice
experience for this budget range of
headphones in this price point these are
also foldable and they come with a pouch
where you can store these in as for the
controls on the left hand side you're
going to find the volume rocker the
bluetooth pairing button and power
button so on the left hand side you're
gonna find a place to charge these with
a micro USB cord now this is another
place where they kind of save money as
there's no USB C or quick charging that
you would find in like a Bose or a Sony
and that just comes with the territory
of this range and this
price point of headphones I don't really
mind it too much because the battery
life is actually pretty good
you get about twenty five hours with ANC
on and you get thirty hours with ANSI on
and in Wired mode I've been using these
for the past two weeks five days of
working out two hours a day that's about
20 hours and there's still at about 70%
so I think you can actually get a lot
more you can squeeze a lot more juice
out of these headphones on the right
hand side you're gonna find a ANC switch
for turning on and off the noise
cancellation which is a nice feature to
have you don't have to go into an app or
you don't have to have any buttons or
things like that it's just a nice switch
you can tell if it's on or off they also
have a 3.5 millimeter jack cord where
you can just plug this into an aux cord
and just plug it straight into your
phone if you run out of juice so another
place that really gets hit by the budget
and all the costs is the noise
cancellation and in these headphones
that is no different I feel like these
are actually on the upper echelon of
budget headphones but still not as good
as like spose and Sony so you take it
for what it is
I mean if you're just a light traveler I
would say go for these these are plenty
good enough for like jimang or just
traveling on a subway but if you're
going on like a plane and you're gonna
have that humming noise and all that
yeah it's not gonna cut it the volume
does get really loud so it does really
save these headphones and some of that
lack of ANC technology in here these
kind of just play like a passive like
here your background static noise and it
just blocks out everything that it can
and so it's not the best experience but
I think it will get the job done for
fifty five dollars you can't really
complain so guys I listen to the 21
savage album and the post Malone song
Wow and these headphones like blew those
out of the water let me tell you that
bass is just nice and tight the mids are
actually able to like shine through all
of that bass usually with budget
headphones you get a lot of muddiness
and it's not really listened Abul it's
not really enjoyable you just have like
muffled sound none of that everything
can coexist in these headphones they are
a little bit close and too tight for me
though there's not
really much sound staged it just is what
it is they just present the music to you
no frills no extras no over-the-top
sound it just is what it is that's the
best way to put it and the volume is
very very loud so for those of you like
me who listen to a lot of EDM and live
sets that are like recorded with very
low volume these will actually do a
really good job for you
the trouble is also nice and rolled off
there's no harsh tones no high notes
really get in really like kill your ears
none of that there's no fatigue with
listening the only fatigue that comes
with these headphones is really just a
comfort and not having those memory foam
pads but other than that I can listen to
these for an extended period of time
especially for the gym these do a really
good job of just getting you pumped
there's no extras or no frills or
anything like that
so nothing expecting any of that but if
you just need a solid pair of headphones
for the gym or just for traveling and
you want to just throw these around yeah
why not these will be just fine so here
is a test of the microphone what's up
guys it's Petey here this is a test of
the microphone let me know what you guys
think down in the comments below I
actually think this microphone sounds
really really good guys probably better
than Sony so in power I don't know what
you need to do but you need to get in
contact with Sony for the 1000x and
fours because this mic needs to be in
those headphones you can also control
Siri and Google assistant with the mic
so it makes controlling your music very
very easy alright guys so in conclusion
these are an amazing set of budget
headphones probably the best that you
can buy for $55 I think that they really
like maxed out their budget for making
these headphones maybe even like
extended it or whatever the top of what
they were supposed to spend to make
these because I feel like the parts and
the quality of like the sound the noise
cancellation the mic they're all either
average or above-average and not to
mention they have that faux leather on
the top and on the ear cups that's
actually pretty good compared to some of
the other budget options out there so
guys if you're in the market for a
budget pair of headphones to supplement
like your bows or your Sony you don't
want to take those to the gym pick up
the empower H
because I think they are a solid pickup
for $55 alright guys so let me know your
guys has thoughts down below have you
guys had an experience with em pal do
you have the H fives what is your
experience is it the same as mine is it
different I'm curious
let me know alright guys it's been your
boy bt saying peace don't forget to like

see you in the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
