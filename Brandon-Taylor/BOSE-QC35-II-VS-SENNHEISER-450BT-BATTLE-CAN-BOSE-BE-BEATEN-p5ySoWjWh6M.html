the battle between the Sennheiser 450
BTS and the Bose qc3 fives to give you
guys a little bit of background on
Sennheiser it has been a mixed bag for
me with their bluetooth headphones I
love their HD one series and the 440
BT's but I found myself less and
impressed with their top-of-the-line pxc
550 headphones the Bose gives you 35 s
on the other hand I grew to love over
time and have become a staple headphone
for traveling combined with good but not
great sound great comfort world-class
noise cancellation today I will be going
over the differences between these two
headphones and which one I think is the
best
before we begin guys don't forget to
follow me on my social medias and
subscribe for more tech reviews if you
haven't already now one thing I noticed
upon grabbing the Sennheiser 450 bt's is
how light and sturdy they are the cups
are smaller than that of the Bose qc3 5s
and they kind of smush your ears and
make them kind of hot which I was a
little bit disappointed in the comfort
of the 450s
is just decent at best at the end of the
day though I found that nobody can
really touch the outstanding build
quality of the bose qg 35
they're lightweight they have leather on
the ear cups and are super comfortable
and feel super premium the Alcantara
that they use on the headband itself is
actually used on yachts and luxury cars
and it definitely feels like you have a
portion on the top of your head let me
tell you guys wait what now the Bose
gives you 35 s are great for long
periods of listening whether out a plane
or at home or even at the gym which I do
sometimes with that being said I do like
the trigger button system of listen has
a 450 BTS sliding up and down skips
tracks in either direction and pressing
it plays or positive music whereas the
bose qc25 sustainer 3 button system is a
little bit dated and pressing the middle
button while better than most can
brothers so 2 clicks a set of 3 for
skipping for instance the carrying case
for the Bose qg 35 is better as it's
more protective than the bag that the
sennheiser gives you but we are
comparing a $300 a pair of headphones to
a $200 pair of headphones so you give up
some luxuries here and there this round
though I do have to give it to Bose for
its amazing comfort it real
does make the difference and allowing
you to enjoy your music for a longer
period of time sound wise these
headphones are completely different but
great in their own way depending on what
you like
soon Heiser does have the cap to an app
which allows you to change the equalizer
to your liking the only problem is it
only works with music stored on your
phone and play through cap tune or title
music services so right there you're
ruling out about 90% of music streaming
listeners which I don't like that being
said the bose qc25 offers no equalizer
at all Ellie's not one that you can see
because they have an equalizer that
bounces your headphones no matter what
volume you're at that's contained in the
actual programming of the headphone
which is nice the Sennheiser has a
gorgeous sound signature that is super
warm and bacey
and because of this the vocals are a
real standout with these headphones the
bose QC 35 have no slashes though as
they aren't great all around you they
don't do anything particularly
exceptional but they do a lot of things
right the bass is there the vocals are
clear the high end is decent if you can
listen to music that can take advantage
of the mid to low end like jazz rap EDM
R&amp;amp;B pop and things like that then go
with listen has a 450 PT's but if you're
listening to rock these might be a
little bit warm for your taste the both
QC very Phi's will be more suited for
you if you're into rock and all of the
genres are that listed with all this
being said I do feel like my winner for
this round is the 450 BTS and let me
tell you why even though bose reaches
more in John Torres the 450 has a
distinct sound signature that bass
lovers will love and it does it really
well and I know like 99.9% of you guys
out there are bass lovers the mic on the
Boesky 235 has a google assistant and
amazon alexa command button the mic is
also top notch for calls the sennheiser
mic is decent but not the best so this
round will go to the Bose q3 fives the
noise cancellation is world class on the
boesky 35 it's the best plain and simple
Sony has more options but when it comes
to actually blocking out noise I found
that Bose is amazing for planes so with
that being said I wanted to test the
Sennheiser's to see just how good they
are when compared against the best and
to my surprise actually kept up really
with something that they call noise
guard which is just a fancy name for
their version of noise cancellation that
being said for 20 dollars of 450 BTS can
keep up with a 350 Bo's so if you wanted
to save $150 you could definitely do
that and be just fine during flights the
battery lights are very similar the 450
BTS have 19 hours and the bose qc25
narrowly edged it out
coming in at 20 hours so I guess I have
to give it to Bose even though that hour
probably won't make or break you you can
also listen to these without battery
with the supplied cords but you'll lose
noise cancellation if the headphones are
turned off after using the Bose PG 35 s
for a while I have experienced some
hang-ups out of nowhere and it's usually
when I first turned on the headphones
but after that they're usually
rock-solid
the Sennheiser is on the other hand have
no issues in the gym or crowded places
even when turning them on it's always
been rock solid for me so for this round
soon Heiser wins because both sometimes
I don't know I get little weird things
happening with the sound or with the
static things like that both headphones
are great headphones for my personal
usages lately the bose qc25 have been my
go-to but at 350 they can be a bit much
for some people and that is where the
450 BTS come in they have a better sound
signature than their bigger brother the
PX c5 50s with similar noise
cancellation technology so I see no
reason to really upgrade to the PX C's
unless you really really want that
switch off your club future otherwise
these have a great sound signature that
really brings a great base grade noise
cancellation they're decently
comfortable and light with a great build
quality all at the low price of $200
which is a steel in my opinion the
overall best keyword overall is still
the bose QC 35 I do enjoy the 450s
immensely but you know the book skis
good for 35 they are just a complete
package but if you're looking to save
you can't go wrong with the poor fifties
that being said thank you guys for
watching and if you could be so kind as
to drop a like if you enjoy the video
and subscribe to the channel if you
haven't already
