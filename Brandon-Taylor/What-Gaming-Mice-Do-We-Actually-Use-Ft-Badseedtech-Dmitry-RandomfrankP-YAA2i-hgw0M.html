the collaboration you guys have all been
asking for today we've got my brother in
the house Brian P better known as Batsy
Tech another amazing tech youtuber here
on the platform we've been talking for a
couple of months on how we could make a
dope collab video that you guys would
all enjoy while at the same time adding
value and what we came up with was our
most commonly asked question what Mouse
and what keyboard do you guys actually
use on a day-to-day basis because we
review so many products you can kind of
get lost in what we're actually using on
a day to day basis but then we were like
hmm how can we make this even bigger how
can we make this even more special for
our viewers so we were like you know
what we're gonna need some help so we
went out and recruited our personal
favorite youtubers in the tech space I'm
talking goat status youtubers to make
this video even bigger even more special
for you guys and for the culture we
wanted to do this for the culture and so
we recruited some of our favorites and
put them in this video to make a huge
clap for you guys so I hope you guys
enjoy this video this video is huge so
what we did is we split the video up my
videos gonna cover the mice and then
head over to bat seed Tech's channel to
check out what keyboard we are all using
alright guys so enough talking let's
start off this collab right about now
yeah I'm Bryan P from Betsy tech and my
favorite Mouse right now and for a while
now actually is the sow a Davina s1 in
gloss blue with a head size of 20 point
five centimeters from palm to fingertip
and ten point five centimeters across
the Davina s1 is the perfect size and
shape from my hand this is due to its
raised trigger areas its girth and its
shorter length giving me plenty of room
for vertical fingertip correction the
3360 sensor is on point and there's no
RGB no software and all the adjustments
for dpi and polling rate are on the
bottom of the mouse out of reach keeping
the top controls super clean and simple
it's not my favorite scroll wheel but
the side buttons are about as good as it
gets great size and positioning mine is
modded with a pair of cord from para
flex cables and a set of hybrid lights
plus the gloss coating and their blue
color scheme love it I test a lot of
mice I own all the top mice and I always
find myself coming back to this one you
can get this mouse in blue and pink
gloss and now you can get it in Sally's
traditional matte black coating as well
it's available for like 60 $9.99
Addison I get asked a lot why do I use
this over the model oh and the main
reason why I use the s-1 all comes down
to the height of the body the s-1 just
fills the hand a little better for me
personally even though I love the scroll
wheel and the overall look of the model
oh and it plays plenty fast on my choice
for Mouse surface that's the Helios XL
hard surface from glorious pc gaming
race it measures 16 by 18 inches it's
ultra thin at 0.5 millimeters really
fast and doesn't give me any issues with
friction when I'm arm aiming it's got a
sticky silicon adhesive back to keep it
in place it does where your mouse speed
faster than a cloth pad will but for me
it's totally worth it it's also super
cheap too at $15 for the lords version
and $20 for the XL I actually go back
and forth between this and the amp 500
from Oris and I do like the idea of a
full desk matte looking really hard at
their glide 38 what I can't say is that
even 400 dpi feels fast on the Helios
and I have to move to 800 to get that
same speed on the amp so if you really
want the flexibility of being able to go
really low sense and preserve your mouse
beep go with the amp it just costs two
and a half times as much for me
personally I'm still noticeably more
accurate at 400 dpi on the Helios big
shout-out to my guy bTW thanks so much
for having me on bro and until next time
stay up what's up guys I'm random Frank
P shout out the BT again for having me
on this video and for most of my viewers
out there you guys know and I'm not
afraid to admit it I'm a hardcore fan of
the g502 I love it
I don't care it's heavy it's been my
go-to mouse since it came out and now I
have the wireless one on the filming and
gaming setup that I use behind me
because you know it's wireless cat the
desktop clutter down however since it's
released there's been this one Mouse
that has stolen my heart a bit and it's
the glorious pc gaming race m√°talo
I pretty much love everything about this
mouse from its shape there ascend cord
is like cotton candy so it makes the
mouse feel wireless they have these G
skates on the bottom so it's just
buttery smooth whatever surface you use
this on just overall a really solid
Mouse well not real exciting comb
cutouts but you know what I mean so one
of the big things about the model oh and
it comes with those cutouts is the
weight
this is 67 grams they have other ones
out there in different
ishes like glossy white and black as
well and the glossy versions are an
extra gram at 68 grams but using and
holding a 68 gram mouse or 67 grand
mouse is really something social when
you have it paired with their ascend
cord and the G skates when you're gaming
it really does feel Wireless and for the
RGB lovers out there yes it does have
the three zone RGB lighting with a strip
running down both sides of the body and
the scroll wheel is illuminated but I
just keep it a solid color to match the
rest of my set up and this goes along
with my mouse pad and the kind of setup
I have secretly behind the scenes and
the mouse pad I use is from novel keys
it's just called the camping desk mat
actually got it on mass drop and I love
the look to it it's just it's something
different than just you know a plain
mouse pad it's subtle the cloth texture
is real nice it pairs well at the mouse
and it just fits in with my setup so you
couple all the features with the
lightweight design and everything and
FPS gamers out there I think could
really really take advantage of this
mouse because it is so lightweight your
flicks can be on point for all those
headshots but the one thing about this
that I really respect glorious for is
the pricing these are super affordable
at just 50 dollars for the matte color
finish with the glossy finish being an
extra $10 at fifty nine so super
budget-friendly
and this was all around a great mass
like I said since this came out I have
not stopped using it love the model oh
and that's what I've been using for the
past I don't know well over a month now
so again I'm Randy Frank P hope you
enjoyed guys and shout out and thank you
to bt hello good people I'm Dimitri from
Harlequin ox and I have a full drawer of
mice okay I do change your up
periodically doh
so my top four favorite currently are
the rival three tab from steel series
the g3 of five the G Pro wireless and
the mouse that's currently on my desk as
the glorious model oh it probably does
not need too much of an introduction
because I feel like all the hype has
been sort of justifiable and to be
honest ever since launch I've been
really happy with it especially at the
price points 49 or $59 depending on your
color choice the 3360 sensor is an
absolute winner
I don't need macro buttons or weight
adjustments because the lightweight
nature of 67 grams is
fantastic for my personal playstyle for
FPS and going back to anything like the
G pro Wireless that is still only 80
grams already feels heavy that is a
weird concept to say that an 80 gram
Mouse feels heavy but in comparison to
the model oh it does now the shape has
everyone had pointed out is a copy of
the FK one by Zoe that fits me perfectly
I love the trigger feels and browser
buttons are fine the shoelace cable is a
bit thick but it's very light and works
with my bungee just fine of course that
honeycomb cutouts revealed that interior
lights bill that I absolutely love and
it especially looks good on the white
model and I don't have any reasons to go
back to any of my other mice for daily
use because the model Oh for me
is basically perfect we will see how the
interior stacks up in the long term
because of dust and particles and stuff
but so far there are like little things
that I can see on the interior but
they're not really affecting performance
as for my mouse mat I'm using the
Corsair mm 300 extended I like it
because it doesn't reveal any scratch
marks like any other black mouse puck
will do and it's a really good size for
my keyboard too but it is quite thick
and the threading itself isn't my
favorite for gaming I prefer the
SteelSeries qck series for precision and
it like just glide smoother but if they
made something bigger that spans my
entire desk I would a hundred percent
use this over the m 300 so that's my
mouse and mouse mat combo thanks Brandon
for hosting hope you enjoyed all right
guys it's BD here and my weapon of
choice for most of the past year has
been the Davina s2 then I moved onto the
mat black Davina s2 and then the Beast
that is the G wolf skull came out and
that changed everything for me it's
lightweight at 66 grams with exceptional
build quality has two pair cords in the
box it's got a comfortable ergo shape
for long long sessions of gaming it's
got an amazing price at $60 a smooth
scroll wheel amazing side buttons the
mouse one and two are super responsive I
honestly couldn't go back to the s2
after some of the insane flick shots I
was hitting with this mouse so since I
test a lot of mice I can actually
fingertip grip I can claw grip and I can
palm grip really really well
I just takes me about a day to adjust
with this mouse I do a 131
it is just absolutely stable my shot has
never been so crispy with this mouse for
my mousepad of choice I've been sticking
with the Mad Catz glide 38 extended
mousepad it's got a textured 3d surface
for more tracking information it's got a
hybrid silicon base that lays flat and
stays in place a spill proof and durable
what more could you want as a wise man
once said all things must come to an end
and thus we are at the end of this
collab video I know sad times I'm sad
too and now we all have a challenge for
you guys we want you to tack pictures of
your setup on Twitter with the hashtag
summer setup and we'll be actually
retweeting some of our favorite setups
