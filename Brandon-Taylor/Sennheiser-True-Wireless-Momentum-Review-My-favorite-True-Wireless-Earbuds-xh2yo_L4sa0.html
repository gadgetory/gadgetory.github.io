review of the Sennheiser true Wireless
moment tones now I've been using these
earbuds as my daily drivers on the go
over my airpot twos for the last couple
of months and I wanted to let you guys
know my experience with them in the box
you'll get a charging case that's made
up of this great cloth material I've
never felt or seen another true wireless
charging case like this one the charging
case is very pocketable and easy to
carry around in the time that I've been
using them they've caught so many
people's eyes wanting to know what they
are on the charging case it's got a
button and a battery indicator on the
back to show the level of the case also
in the box you'll get three sets of ear
tip so you can get the right fit and a
USB C charging cord for charging the
case the headphones are this nice black
with some silver accents I like to look
at them overall but that doesn't really
matter to me what matters to me and most
of you guys out there is the Comfort and
these deliver on that they have this
smooth plastic construction that kind of
twists and locks into place in your ear
now these are a little bit bigger than a
lot of what's out there including like
the job rose or the air pods but the
comfort is still like incredible like
I've never felt like these were gonna
fall out once they also block out a ton
of noise I've been startled so many
times too many to count
people just walking up and tapped me on
the shoulder and I just jump it's been
crazy so these block out a ton of noise
this also makes them amazing for the gym
as you can enjoy your music distraction
free and really focus on your workout
these are ipx4 rated making it sweat
proof the left earbud controls your
music one tab plays or pauses the song
two taps is the next song three taps is
the previous song holding down the left
will lower the volume now holding the
right will actually increase the volume
one tap accepts calls or calls up your
voice assistant like Siri or Google
assistant two taps rejects calls or
enables the transparent hearing now the
battery life is rated at four hours
which is around what I was getting and
then
you get two extra charges giving you
about 12 hours in total I would like to
see some times of push for six hours to
be competitive with the Apple earpods
especially when they're trying to push
for another hundred dollars over-the-air
pods now the mic quality is actually
really good people can actually hear me
unlike some of the other true relish
earbuds out there that's what always
kept me going back to Apple and never
leaving them you know people might hate
on the air pods but for calls there's
nothing better so let's drop a sound
test for you guys right now on the mic
quality on these earbuds what's up guys
bTW here and this is a test of the
microphone on these Sennheiser true
wireless earbuds let me know what you
guys think down in the comments below on
like how they sounds is it - bass e does
it sound Hollow
let me know down in the comments now the
sound is where the true Wireless
Momentum's are really really shine now
these are some of the most well balanced
true wireless earbuds on the market they
bring that great Sennheiser sound they
are a great all-around ur with their
default sound signature there's a lot of
bass for you bass lovers out there and
tons of clarity without the harshness in
the treble the smart app also allows you
to EQ these even more so if you want
more bass mids or highs you can do that
as well and you guys know me I'm a huge
fan of this because you aren't stuck
with just one sound signature because as
we all know all music isn't created
equally
classic music needs a different profile
than wrap wood one thing that I think
they should change is the equalizer
setting now when you move it towards
like the bass and affects the mids and
the highs at the same times I wish you
were able to just affect one at a time
I think that's easy with like an app fix
that's more of an app thing than the
actual headphones themselves also in the
app you can control transparent hearing
which allows outside noise to come in so
that you can be aware of your
surroundings this is magic because
before I turn this on I couldn't hear a
thing around me so this is gonna be key
for stopping and talking to people in
the gym without having to take out your
earbuds or if you're on a run outside
and you need to hear your surroundings
for safety issues another thing that I
love about these true writers earbuds is
that they don't break connection in
crowded places this is something a lot
of companies haven't perfected yet and
Sennheiser is one of the few
many there's very few that have really
nailed it down with this Bluetooth 5.0
there's no delay when watching YouTube
or videos on your phone to pair them all
you have to do is hold the right in the
left at the same time for five seconds
and it pairs to your phone now the price
for some might be a turn-off but if
you're looking for the highest sound
quality in true wireless earbuds look no
further it's got all the features you
could ever want including an EQ great
fit touch controls voice assistance and
most importantly a great mic went on the
go alright guys so that is going to do
it for this review don't forget to Like

see you in the next video it has been
