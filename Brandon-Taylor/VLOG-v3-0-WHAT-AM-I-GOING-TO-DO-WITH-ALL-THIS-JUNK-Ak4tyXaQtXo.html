vlog today we're gonna go do some arms
we're gonna go to Ikea have some fun you
know like he is always fun right I'm
gonna get some food I don't know what
yet but that is the plan for that is the
relative plant it for today we'll see
what else we can get into but I need to
first and foremost I got this new
dresser this beautiful dresser from
Ashley Furniture and I have all this
junk that I need to organize so IKEA
please help me right now I'm gonna head
to the gym and then afterwards we're
gonna go back to you see you guys a
little bit no you may be thing isn't
that the shirt you wore last Saturday
yes it is but the way you know it's a
different day it had different kicks on
but they are tied
alright so in the vlogs I kind of want
to give more in depth tips or just ideas
throughout the day maybe to give it a
little bit more value in these vlogs so
you guys get something out of it
this is just not pure entertainment you
learn something while you're here so I'm
about to do arms now when I do arms I do
priority principle what that means is
you want to do the body part that's
lagging first so that's biceps with less
triceps do that one first hit it hard
and then switch over to the next workout
to the next body part so that is a tip
that I have a lot of people they do the
body part that looks best first which I
don't get or they switch off the do
bicep tricep bicep tricep bicep for me
it doesn't work and I before I did that
and I never really got any good games
and I recently started seeing really
good games because I started doing my
biceps first my triceps have always been
pretty good I just started doing my my
biceps first because they were weak and
they're lagging and now I'm kind of
filling them out and my arms look twice
the size that they did before so take
this tip use it with any workout if your
lower back is better than your upper
back workout your upper back first if
your lower chest is weaker or doesn't
look as good as your upper chest do the
Lord chest and then go from there
all right guys so I will see you guys
after I'm finished so just finish the
workout the AC was fucking broken so I'm
sweating as hell right now I had to cut
my workout short because I was just so
so sweaty and I was just exhausted like
I was going through my the motions of
working out you know we've all been
there we're just going through the
motions and you're like fuck like I'm
not getting anything out of this you
know you do your best but at the end of
the day sometimes
you just gotta listen to your body and
not to say that I'm like giving up like
I'm not giving up
it's just I'm gonna come back and fight
another day I'm wearing down the triceps
today got through biceps halfway through
triceps so with that being said I am
gonna finish triceps tonight this is my
favorite album at the moment the focus
John belly in he had a song with Zedd
beautiful now so you might know him from
that but go check out this album is
called the human condition it's really
good I listen to it in the gym at work
in the car everywhere and I'm not sick
of it since its came out which is about
a month now and I still rocket every I
listened to his CD every single day
definitely go check him out
we're here
as you see from my videos have a lot of
shoes something about getting this and
just putting them all under my bed we
think 9 bucks
might do it I'm trying to decide between
these lights
kind of a cool little decoration or they
like to stand these ones over there I
can vlog because my hands are free so
trying to figure out like right now
don't know which ones to get shit out
this one I made the mistake of getting
this one last time that was a mistake it
is it's okay but it leans over quality
isn't that good definitely don't
recommend that one you saw the vlog last
time you know I was looking for some art
well we are in the art section and the
price is not too bad so let's get
something oh it was a successful trip to
Ikea and not a lot of organizing stuff
although I did not find paintings I
remember their paintings being a lot
better before they were not good and I
don't want to just buy something just to
have something up on the wall I want it
to be something that I love or like at
least if not love Mike yeah so that
didn't work out so well but I got a
drawer a mountain drawer for my desk
which I need I got organizer for my
shoes which I need and I got some lights
for my Phillip Hughes which I'm going to
do a review on soon or probably today
since since I got these light stands
that is that I'm gonna head home I don't
know I'm gonna get some food I'm
freaking hungry I'm gonna get some food
at least and after that we're gonna set
up all this stuff set up my room make
some videos renovation is almost done
it's friggin hot frigging hot moving
around all this stuff does not help let
me tell ya my chicken with you guys I'll
show you guys the finished product once

think so there she is anyways we got a
meal here meaning this is my cheat meal
some bread rice salmon that was a
grilled and yeah I haven't eaten since
you saw me last to the gym it's almost
seven o'clock so I'm pretty sure I need
this right about now so I will see you
guys in a little bit here's a tip if you
workout get a little cross the ball if
you work out get a foam roller these
things work magic for sore muscles
tightness even just sitting at your desk
even if you don't work out get one of
these roll out your legs your back it's
a free massage well you buy this and
then they're free after but you know you
get what I'm saying so get one of these
I have to be I'm not sure what brand
