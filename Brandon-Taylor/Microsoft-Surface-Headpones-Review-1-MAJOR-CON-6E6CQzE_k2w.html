crop top down
what's up guys it's Beattie here and
this is my review of the new surface
headphones from Microsoft now you may
know the surface line from their tablet
and laptops well now they brought that
over to the headphone game I'm not sure
why they did that but I am sure glad
they did because that means more
competition for Bose and Sony and at the
end of the day that can only benefit us
if you know what I'm saying
so at $350 these are a direct competitor
to the bose qc25 s and the sony 1000 XM
threes and the sennheiser pxc 550 s they
have that grey sexy minimalistic look
from the surface line that I absolutely
love the ear cups are nice and soft they
remind me a little bit of the bose qc25
s just not as big and open as those so
the headband is adjustable but I would
not recommend these for people with big
hits because these are quite a small
headphone and the clamping force is
pretty hard I can only wear these for
about three to four hours before I need
a rest and I have to let my ears breathe
because these are so tight but in turn
that does give you a lot of isolation
with these headphones so up top they
have this plastic material for the
cushioning that is very similar to the
beats solo threes and studio threes and
that's quite disappointing for $350 I
expect that from beats but not from you
Microsoft you can do better than that
come on especially when your competitors
like Bose is putting up Alcantara which
is used in like yachts and premium cars
like Porsches and Sony's putting in
leather and you can only put plastic the
left out controls the noise cancellation
and the right dial controls the volume
and these are both buttery smooth these
headphones just have that elegance
factor that other headphones don't have
tapping the headphone on either side
pauses and plays a song tapping twice
skips for tapping three time skips
backwards I've had no issues with the
controls on these headphones they work
perfectly and they work all the time so
also on the right ear cup they have a
mute button I'm not sure why they put
that in there but okay why not I mean
paint hurt and there's also a place to
charge by USB see and the box you'll
also get a case which is very nice free
travelers out there to protect your head
they also have a 3.5 millimeter jack if
you want to just plug this into a DAC or
your phone for connection you just hold
the power button for five seconds and
your pair you can also connect up to two
devices simultaneously over bluetooth
which is actually pretty cool but it's
just not implemented that well because I
will get static on one device when I try
to use - speaking of unpolished and
unfinished I feel like the Cortana app
that is for iOS and Android is not very
good you can dictate to your calendar
you can see what the weather is you know
all the fun stuff that comes along with
virtual assistant but the main thing
that we all will be using this for is
music and they are advertising this as
working with Spotify but it doesn't
actually work with Spotify yet it's not
supported let alone Apple music and
title you know the big ones that most
people are using instead you know what
they give us I Heart Radio and tune in
stuff that probably like 1% of the
population uses so one thing that I feel
like they did really well on this
headphone is the mic I'm gonna drop a
sound test for you guys right about now
all right it's B T here I'm coming to
you guys from the surface headphones
right now let me know what you guys
think of the mic down below I actually
think this sounds pretty good so what
did you guys think I actually think that
this is one of the top sounding mics on
the market at the moment so so far so
good these headphones are pretty decent
so far but the one thing that sinks
these dead in the water is the battery
life 11 hours for $350 is not enough
Microsoft what are you doing we deserve
more than that you cannot travel with
these some of my trips are 16 hours what
am I gonna do for the rest of the 5
hours I cannot listen to music I cannot
watch movies so they really need to put
in battery life that is more worth the
price I mean when your competitors like
Bose and Sony or drop in 30 hours 20
hours that's double and triple the
amount that you have in these headphones
so what are you doing Microsoft you
can't come to the market with 11 hour
battery life these aren't a set of
earbuds only Airbus can get away with 11
hours not full-sized over ear headphones
to me this is a deal-breaker and I know
it will be for a lot of you guys out
there as well now the noise cancellation
is actually pretty good I think it's on
par with Bose actually it's not as good
as Sony okay Sony is the king for this
year and noise cancellation and sound
but close second i would say Bose and
Microsoft were neck and neck it's gonna
block out most noise it's not gonna
block out like snapping or things like
that but over time it does do a good job
of blocking out your ambient noises like
plane noise and like nature sounds if
you're in nature and you want to block
that out the sound of these headphones
actually surprised me a lot they
actually sound pretty good they have
that warm
bassy rich sound signature to them if
you were to put on these with the QC 35
s back-to-back they would actually sound
very very similar they have that same
richness that same detail that a lot of
people love the treble is nice and
smooth and rolled off there's no
sharpness there for like classical music
but it does give you a lot of detail the
soundstage is actually pretty good on
these headphones it's a lot wider than
the bose qc25 in my opinion so the genre
set these go best with our like EDM of
rap R&amp;amp;B jazz classical things that
really benefit from that warm sound
signature the genres that I found so so
or like the rock and B metal because I
mean those need more of an analytical
sterile sound to them so yeah definitely
go with these if you're one of the 4
mentioned genres alright guys so we've
come to the end of the review now do I
think that these headphones are worth
$350 and I have to say no they are not
worth the $350 yet the battery life are
really wholesome back when there are
competitors on the market with three
times the battery life the sound just as
good and have like Google assistant and
Siri
support so why even bother with the
surface headphones well if you are in
the Microsoft ecosystem if you have like
a surface laptop or anything like that
you don't mind the 11 hours of battery
life you just want something to match
everything else sure go ahead go with
the surface headphones knock yourself
out but if you want to get a better deal
go with the bose qc25 so go with the
sony 1000x and threes because they are
just better all-around headphones it's
just not there yet guys but I think in
future versions I think that Microsoft
and their surface headphones - maybe can
actually get it down with these
headphones alright so thank you guys for
watching I will see you guys in the next
video it has
been your boy BT don't forget to like
share comment and subscribe share this
video if you loved it and I will see in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
