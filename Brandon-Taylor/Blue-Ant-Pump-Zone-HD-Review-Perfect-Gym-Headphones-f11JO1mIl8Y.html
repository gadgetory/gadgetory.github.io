again with another review today we're
gonna be taking a look at the blue ant
pump HD headphones now this is another
subscriber requested this guy has been
asking for it for a long time so I
finally picked them up and I'm here to
give you guys my thoughts on them today
but before we began to forget to hit
that subscribe button for more content
like this it really helps a channel
really helped me grow lets me know that
you guys are liking the content so thank
you guys so much so these are coming in
at 70 dollars which I feel like is
fairly reasonable for what you're
getting the build quality on these is a
fairly decent one thing that I do not
like about these is that they have the
cord on the outside you know I'm not a
big fan of that because it can get
caught on things it's easy way to short
your headphones so unless it's a really
really reputable company like a v-moda
or Bose yeah don't even bother putting
the cord on the outside because it's
probably gonna break right now these do
come with the case to protect your
investment which I really like I always
like that they are of course foldable
suit that you can put them in one thing
that I did notice what these headphones
is the comfort is a little bit lacking
now these do have bacteria killing
technology on the ear cups which is nice
if they lay on the ground at the gym or
outside or anything like that they will
protect your ears from my ear infections
and things like that which is really
cool I've never seen that before
definitely like that but the problem is
I feel like these are over ear
headphones but they're not big enough to
go over your ear so I felt a lot of
pressure on the top of my ear it was
very hard to get a decent fit I just
kind of had to get used to it over a
long period of time yeah definitely not
a fan of the fit so if you have a small
head these can be for you if you have
small ears these are gonna be for you
but if you have anything over that and I
can't really
a fan of the comfort and design on the
East one thing that I really do like is
the volume controls and the way you
control your songs now they have the
play button the Skip track buttons all
there they have the volume rocker there
as well everything within reach and it's
just very easy to navigate songs and
things like that so I really really
appreciate it how easy the controls are
on these headphones and again I don't
know what it is but they have this
breathable leather on here faux leather
of course so when you're sweating it
kind of alleviates some of that heat
these were actually pretty good in the
gym heat wise I didn't notice any like
heat or discomfort from heat using these
headphones so that's a plus yeah overall
kind of disappointed with the fit and
the comfort I do understand that they
want these to be tight since they are
gonna be used for you know working out
and things like that you don't want them
to fall off which I totally get but I
think they can scale it back or at least
let the adjustable headband come out
more I really really wish there was more
settings on here to allow you to get a
better fit it kind of goes only so far
very small adjustable headband which I'm
not a fan of the call quality was just
okay you know the battery life is
amazing though it has 30 hours it also
sleeps if you're forget to turn them off
and I a lot of the times forget to turn
my headphones off after the gym I'm dead
tired I get in my car and toss them to
the side and I kind of forget about them
and sometimes the next day I'll go to go
to the gym and they're at 0% so it's
nice that these have an auto sleep
method to kind of help you with that
problem so of course we want to know
these are supposed to have megabase in
them
do they have megabase I would say that
they don't have as much base as
something like the school candy crush or
Wireless or the Sony 950 in ones not
that high of bass not that much bass but
they do have a good amount of bass these
have a nice rich base to them but the
rest of the headphones kind of flat so
it's like the bass is so colored and
nice
then you get up to the mids where the
vocals live and these just kind of drop
off and then the hi is kind of just
taper off they're not really there they
sound really flat so imagine just a ton
of bass but everything else is suffering
and the clarity isn't there I like these
they get really loud the volume gets
really loud for those of you who
actually go to the gym and need to block
out a lot of noise these do that and
then some right and the volume is great
so one thing I really like but outside
of that I mean there's a good for hip
hop rap EDM R&amp;amp;B things like that but
outside of that if you're looking for
something with vocals or you're looking
for something with a lot of trouble or a
lot of clarity yeah pass on these the
connectivity was actually really really
good as you can imagine going into the
gym these are made for that environment
so I never had any problems with these
headphones breaking up or losing
connection or anything like that they
also feature NFC which is nice if you
want to just tap your phone with an
Android phone or things like that also a
great feature these also have a PT X and
AAC for transferring music so you're
gonna lose less that quality when these
are streaming through the Bluetooth so
I'm sure you guys want to know are these
worth the $70 are they a reasonable
reliable pair of headphones for the gym
now let's say yes and no okay they have
a lot of good features but I think the
comfort issue especially when you're
working out it can be a distraction
which I don't like the sound I feel like
there's better options at this price
point even like the ghost ticks so drops
those are sounded amazing so I think
you've gotta fix the fit issues with the
if they can kind of fix some of that
sound give these a more lively or
emotional sound to them which will help
you push through workouts as opposed to
like a flat profile I think these could
be a great workout headphone in the next
generation but for now I would say pass
on them for now there's a lot of other
options out there for 70 bucks
an even cheaper
yeah this court outside also really
concerns me for you guys so if that were
to break I can't really recommend them
for you guys so yeah I would pass on
these don't hate me for saying that but
that is how I feel about these
headphones thank you guys for watching
that is gonna do it for this review
