review of the ducky one-too-many now in
my last video the final Mouse a lot of
you guys had questions about what
keyboard I was using I know I kind of
showed it off a little bit here and
there and you guys were getting excited
about it so I thought I would do a
review on it you know I'm a man of the
people so I got to give you guys what
you want so today I'm gonna be going
over what makes this $100 60% RGB
keyboard so amazing so for those of you
guys that don't know out there or have
never heard of ducky they are one of the
most reputable mechanical keyboard
companies on the market currently they
make some of the best quality keyboards
that will last you for years in the box
that he is gonna give you a USBC cord
some extra key caps they give you out
random colors so you might get yellow
green blue red I got the yellow
thankfully because that color just looks
absolutely sick on my desk they've also
included a year of the dog space bar
which looks absolutely sick when the RGB
is shining through it so let's talk
about the build quality and aesthetics
of this keyboard now on the bottom it's
white and on the top it is black it has
RGB of course and I'll get into the
customizations you can do there now this
keyboard is very slim and it is
lightweight as well they've also
included some double shot pbt keys and
for those of you who don't know what
they are let's just say that these are
the best keys that you can get on the
market I know a lot of companies like
Razer and Corsair they use ABS and they
get that nasty shine on it so you'll
have none of that with these keys these
keys will last you a very long time guys
and they will look like the day that you
got over so on the underside of the keys
they actually have a lot of commands
along the bottom row as you can see here
they've given you control of like volume
if you're missing your media keys
they've even given you a way to control
your Mouse with this keyboard you don't
even need a mouse to work a computer
with this keyboard isn't that amazing
now they took away the numpad and they
took away the arrows and the arrows was
the hardest thing for me to really
adjust to
because you have to hold down the
function key and then hit i j k l for up
a left down and right and it took me a
little bit of time to get used to i'm
not gonna lie to you guys I would often
hit my desk or I would go off the side
of the keyboard looking for the arrow
key and it was quite embarrassing
luckily nobody was around thank you so
the keyboard feet aren't adjustable you
can have a low flat on the table you can
have a medium or a high I go with the
high because I like to see all the
little commands along the bottom row of
the key caps now the switches that I use
personally are the Cherry MX Reds I'm
gonna drop a sound test for you guys
right now oh yeah that's some good stuff
right there alright guys so yeah I used
the Cherry MX res because they are
silent and they also are linear so I
find that my brain works better when I
bought them out on the key a lot of
people who are like typers might want to
go with the brown keys because they have
a tactile bump and if you don't go all
the way down those are better for you I
know a lot of pros like T foo and some
other people use brown switches me
personally I like right so not only do
they come in red and brown but they also
come in like black clear silent red
there's a ton of switches and it's a
personal preference what your switches
are I have used blue in the past I've
used brown I use red and I always come
back to red so with the 60-percent
keyboard they're taken away a lot of the
keys and at $100 you might be saying
brandon well what is the point of having
a 60% keyboard when I'm losing all my
keys it's gonna be uncomfortable well it
does take a little bit of time to get
used to I'm not gonna lie to you guys it
took me about two weeks to fully get
used to using the arrow key with a
function key that being said once you do
this keyboard is fully functional guys I
promise you you can actually use the
macro key to adjust or put any key
wherever you want or any keystroke to
any key that you want on your keyboards
so you can assign multiple multi media
keys or commands for your games there
are so many options that you can do to
kind of fill the void of losing all
those keys so one con about this
keyboard is the macro system I wish it
was a little bit
easier to navigate for you novices out
there it took me about two days to
really understand and use it correctly
so that's a con for me I wish they would
actually explain it a little bit more or
make it a little bit more user-friendly
or maybe I just don't know how to use
tech I don't know for me though I would
recommend using autohotkey it's a little
bit more user friendly you can download
this program and have it boot up with
your system and it works just the same
you could put like ctrl shift and one
for like multimedia and things like that
so that is another option that you have
when you switch over to 60% keyboard so
another benefit of having this keyboard
is that you don't need all that nasty
blow where like Razer synapse oh my god
that software just Oh hate using it oh
man
mmm it makes me not want to buy razer
stuff I don't know about you but it
makes me not want to buy razer stuff
knowing that I have to use Razer synapse
but that's a story for another day
for this keyboard you hold down the
function key and the Alt key and T and
this switches between the modes they
have most like rainbow spiral raindrop
reactive and you can also control like
how bright the different reds and greens
and blues are it's also fully
customizable because you get to also go
through and change each color of each
key so if you have like a blue and red
setup you can change half your keyboard
to red and blue there's just a ton of
customization or if you want like wass a
different color you can do that as well
there's so much customization with this
keyboard they also have games on this
keyboard what who does that so they also
have like minesweeper on here so you
just keep hitting keys until you finally
land on a mine you know you don't want
to land on the mind but if you do game
over so it's cool if you want to run
that during queue you know at fortnight
or over watch whatever you play that's
cool with me you know I'm not here to
judge whatever you play that's cool
they've also got dip switches on the
back to change the order of your
function ctrl alt and Windows keys
that's another cool feature so you can
really make this keyboard what you want
with the 60% keyboard you're losing a
lot but you're also gaining a lot of
customization and it I think it almost
pays for itself because of the space
that you save on your desk so for you
low sensitivity game
out there like myself this thing is a
godsend because it is just simply
amazing not having to bang your mouse
into a the side of your keyboard or even
having to worry about it
I don't have to worry about it anymore I
know that it's not gonna hit the side of
my keyboard anymore so guys if you guys
have been on the fence about whether to
get a ducky one too many I would say go
for it try it out get a 60% keyboard you
never know this thing is game-changing
let me tell you I think this actually
changed the game more for me then my
mouse did I hate to say it so definitely
pick one up right now because these
things are a hot commodity they're
selling out like hotcakes you can
pre-order one now but I think the
pre-orders even go into January right
now so definitely try to get one as soon
as you can because this thing is amazing
and they're selling like hotcakes
because they're just that good hotcakes
hotcakes hockey table as a tongue
twister mmm okay anyways guys thank you
guys for watching it has been your boy
BT I'll see you in the next one I know
if you guys are wondering what my setup
is you know it looks a little bit
different now I changed it so I'm gonna
be doing a setup tour very very soon
giveaway soon on the final Mouse on
Saturday so if you're watching this if
you made it to the end you got a leg up
on the competition alright guys I'll see
you the next one is when you're bored BT
