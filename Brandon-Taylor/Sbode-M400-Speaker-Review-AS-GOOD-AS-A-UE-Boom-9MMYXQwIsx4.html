with another review today we're gonna be
taking a look at the S Boat M 400
speaker now the company was nice enough
to send me out a sample of their speaker
and I've been wanting to get more
speakers on the channel because I know
you guys just don't want to be listening
to headphones all day blasting your ears
so this is a great escape from just
all-out headphones all the time so let
me tell you guys a little bit about this
speaker today now keep in mind all these
opinions are my own they're not paying
me in any way that just send me a sample
of this to test and they also are gonna
provide a promotional code for you guys
to get a discount as well now right out
of the box what I noticed is that this
thing is very light and that means that
you can hang this thing on
tents you can put on a table and not be
worried about it that is something that
I really like where my ue boom by
logitech that thing is a very very heavy
i found that it would always like knock
over or it would you know kind of be of
a hassle to bring along with me now i
found that the ue boom would be a little
bit too heavy sometimes and that would
lead me to not bring it with me it
wasn't that convenient so it's nice to
have a light speaker that i can just
toss in a backpack and not have it
weighed me down
now as for the design of this speaker
you're gonna find a power button you're
going to find a bluetooth and call
accepting button you're gonna find a
press play pause button a volume rocker
which also doubles as to skip forward
and back so to skip forward you just
hold down the plus sign it to skip
backwards you just hold down the minus
sign easy enough you hold down the
positive or you hold down the negative
to either go up and down in volume I
wish it was kind of the other way around
I wish to skip songs you just hold down
the positive and to skip backwards you
hold down the negative but it takes a
little bit of a learning curve coming
from some headphone
that are built that way but that's just
a minor minor thing and it takes a
little bit of a learning curve but
you'll get through it ask for input
you're gonna find an aux cord input
you're gonna find a USB charger which
you can plug into your computer and then
it also doubles as an SD card reader
kind of strange but can't complain why
not why not have an SD card reader in
here can't hurt right you know maybe
you're on vacation you got a MacBook Pro
you want to hook this up you plug the SD
card into here what do you know you have
SD card reader why not as for the design
now they have these two subwoofers on
either side which are very nice it's
kind of cool to kind of just press this
in it's kind of fun
it also rumbles really well the bass
response on this thing is very nice and
what really impressed me is the mids now
a lot of speakers when you use them
they're very muddy and the vocals are
the first thing that suffers now most
speakers can actually get pretty loud
but they lose sound quality as the
volume goes up this thing I felt like
kept its integrity all the way through
which was very nice and it can I would
say satisfy like a backyard hangout or
if you want to just listen to this
inside in your bedroom or in your living
room this is a great option now this
thing is also IP X 6 rated so you can
bring it by the pool if you want it's
water-resistant if it dunks in for a
little bit just kind of fumble it and
throw it back out and hope for the best
but for the most part they say that it
is IP X 6 so I believe them I think this
thing will work even if it gets wet
another cool feature of this thing is
that you can also hook up to speakers so
you can take one and have it on the
right have another one of these on the
left and actually have a stereo system
using both speakers which is very nice
so if you're at a party or you want to
set up and you want more sound more
loudness you can put this on one side of
the room put the other one on the other
side and have a stereo experience which
I really like now the rechargeable
battery is coming in at 8 hours which is
also very nice can't complain I couldn't
find any information on how fast it
actually char
just but in my experience it does charge
very fast it has a battery indicator
here which is very nice a lot of
speakers don't have that it'll just give
you some beeps or out of nowhere and
what do you know your speaker is dead I
like that it gives you a warning about
when your speaker will die a que when
the fun is gonna stop another cool
feature on the speakers that it also has
an FM radio searcher which is very nice
you can listen to the radio with this
and I haven't seen that on a lot of
speakers so you're getting a lot of
value with the speaker honestly for 50
bucks you can't really go wrong and I
will provide you guys with the promo
code if it isn't down there it will be
down there at some point and I will let
you guys know so overall I am very
impressed with this speaker it gives you
a great value at fifty dollars with the
promo code it's gonna be less I hope and
you're getting tons and tons of value
whether that's the sound whether that's
the FM whether that's the SD card reader
there's a lot going on here and I think
it makes it worth it so if you're a
party animal you like to party buy pools
this is also gonna be great for you if
you just like to chill at home it's
gonna be for you if you like music in
general this thing will not do you wrong
in my opinion so definitely check out
the s-boat m400 again these are all my
opinions I really like the speaker it's
very solid so I hope you guys have
enjoyed this review let me know down in
the comments below whether you're gonna
pick one up or maybe you are in the
market for a speaker or maybe you
already have a speaker let me know down
below or if you just want to say hi i'll
say hi back alright guys so thank you
guys for watching don't forget to Like

video and I will see you guys in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
