in the crack of your car
it's going alright so today's topic is I
decided going to be about it's gonna be
about adding instead of subtracting now
some people you don't want to think okay
I have to start dieting I have to you
know get in shape so i can't eat these
certain things right and in our mind we
don't like loss right you kind of have
to know yourself we don't like to lose
things we think well if i do this i
don't know if it's gonna be good or not
but I'm going to lose doughnuts pizza
when I'm comfortable with whatever it is
the spaghetti I don't know so you think
damn i'm gonna have to lose all all
these things and that's scary and so you
may not want to it may stop you from
doing what you want to be doing or the
new the new thing that you want to add
into your life and that's where you have
to think of come from a mentality of
gaining so in adding into your life so
what you have to do is think to yourself
what how can i ask what can i add what
kind of foods can add into my life what
kind of new habits can i add on to my
life already so maybe you say okay i
want to add chicken and broccoli like I
just had so let's say you want to add in
this isn't this that doesn't mean
technically that you can't have pizza
donuts or whatever it just means that
you're adding in something new to your
life all right you can still have those
I mean you can technically still have
those things right technically you still
have them but now you're going to add in
chicken and broccoli for lunch every day
you know you may still have a pizza on
cheat day a donut whatever but the
simple fact of just some it's all how
you phrase things
if you say that you want to add
something in its better than you're
going to lose something because when you
think you're going to lose something and
you're not sure what lies on the other
side sometimes you're going to go with
what you know the pizza and donuts so
try this out try it try this different
way of thinking let me know how it goes
so I will check in with you guys later
i'm also going to do a video supplement
soon cuz i got a whole pretty much
taking like all not all new supplements
but I kind of switched up a couple
supplements key supplements so I'm gonna
put you guys up on that I've already if
you see my instagram i've already put up
about the pistachios and i love the salt
and pepper you probably seen it here
already so I mean you're already ahead
of the game so that that and i will
probably i'm thinking now that i think
about it maybe i will do a video on my
gym gear what I wear to the gym what
kind of shoes clothing yeah pants shorts
whatever that I think look best and
we'll probably look best on you and to I
also got a new hydro flask these things
are amazing up on my BCA in here and to
keep some cold all day all day while I'm
at work I could just sip on this apana
during lunch it's great I hope you can
add in something into your life add in
things onto your already great life you
know with I'm sure life's already great
so if it's not you add in better things
you're going to get better results
I'm going
you
I'm going to live
