are my top three gaming mice for early
2019 now I'm gonna be compiling a list
at multiple times during the year of my
top three mice at any given point to
keep you guys updated because as we all
know there's some crazy gaming mice
coming out so I can say that these are
the top three now but in a month or two
when like the glorious Odin comes out
that it makes 518 what the hero sensor
comes out this list might change
dramatically so I wanted to make this
list now before everything comes out to
give you guys a snapshot of what is the
best at the moment now you might have
your personal favorite a mouse that
really really works best for you but I
can confidently say that you should try
one of these three mice okay at some
point in your life even if you have a
mouse you already love so let's stop the
talking let's get into who I think are
the top three gaming mice and these
aren't in any particular order I just
ordered them the way I ordered them why
not
so the first Mouse we're gonna cover is
the G Pro Wireless now this thing
shattered a lot of barriers around what
a wireless mouse could be it's
lightweight at 80 grams it has one of
the top sensors in the Logitech hero
sensor which is very power efficient
lasting you up to 60 hours of battery
life Wow I mean I can't remember the
last time I've had to charge my Logitech
G Pro it's got this ambidextrous shape
that is great for claw and fingertip
grip it's okay for palm grip you can do
that because it has enough of a hump for
you to do that
but this is really like a fingertip and
claw grip Mouse now my hands are
eighteen point five by nine centimeters
and it fits like an absolute glove if
you're bigger than that I think this
mouse will still work for you if you're
smaller than that it'll still work for
you they did have some problems with the
mouse one and two and from my testing
you really have to like push them in a
certain way for that to happen it never
affected me in game they have great side
buttons that are easy to reach and they
just work the mouse feet are good and
glide is well there's no hyper glue
for them yet so keep that in mind if you
love hyper glides the one con about the
G Pro Wireless is the price it's a
hundred and fifty dollars that's a big
yikes but it is worth it for all the
great materials that they put into this
mouse so next up on the list is the
final Mouse air ninja air 58 now this is
a great mouse it's lightweight if that
50 grams it's got a nice pair of cord
it's got a thirty 360 sensor and in my
opinion it is one of the best organ ama
Kreis on the market for gaming it's got
a nice low profile shape that you can
just lay your hand on it and just start
gaming you can also claw our fingertip
grip this mouse but for me those grips
go best with like an ambidextrous Mouse
like the G pro Wireless or the next
Mouse we're going to talk about but for
palm grip the final Mouse has everything
beat I think the second-best would be
like the Zowie EC 2b which is like a
close second the mouse 1 and 2 are very
clicky and crispy some of my favorites
of any Mouse the side buttons I do wish
that they were a little bit further back
to make them easier to reach I feel like
I kind of have to like climb my hand of
the mouse to actually get to hit the
forward button on the side but that's
just a minor thing it never really
affects me in game so yeah final Mouse
gets a lot of hate but this is one of
the best mice on the market if you can
find one last but not least is a new
entry that a lot of you guys have been
asking me about and that is the Zowie s
2 now from the king of shapes
Zowie comes their new design the S to
upgrade it with the new 3360 sensor
which is what a lot of people got on
them before because they kept that 3310
sensor in there for the longest time and
people were hating ok it had smoothing
literation just wasn't good but now
they've come back with a 3360 sensor
they've got some of the best Mouse feet
on the market those big huge Pat's they
brought them back which is always a nice
feature to see the zombie mice have
always been great for plug and play and
they put a dpi and a pulling rate button
on the bottom so no software needed here
the cord on the Zowie S 2 is good it's
you know it's not a paracord but you can
paracord
and making Galli which is what i plan to
do in the near future but in the
meantime this thing will suffice
especially if you have a mouse bungee
the mouse one and two are very crispy
the side buns are very crispy and easy
to reach which is a plus the one con of
this mouse that people just don't like
is the glossy coating now you can get
used to it I've gotten used to it and it
has become my most used Mouse currently
but I can see where people don't like it
because it can't be slippery especially
if you have hands that are like purse
parading consistently so that could be a
problem keep that in mind if you plan on
getting this mouse but if you do this
thing is an absolute beast for a shape
it is great for claw grip and fingertip
grip because of the length of it the
shortness of it makes it amazing for
fingertip grip it just stays out of the
way so if you look down in game right it
will actually stay out of the way of
your palm which is very very nice now
you can palm grip this mouse and lay
your hand flat on it you know like a
straight up palm grip but I don't
recommend it because this thing has a
very aggressive shape with a nice butt
in the back mmm look at that thing and
it has a very nice slope in the bottom
to kind of make it very precise like
almost like you're holding a pencil and
you're riding the death of your enemies
oh my god that was corny why do you guys
watch me alright guys so that is gonna
do it for my top 3 gaming mice for early
2019 expect this list to change but for
now I am going with these three try one
of these out if they don't work for you
yeah you can actually call me I'll give
you my number you can call and yell at
me but I feel very confident that one of
these three will work for you if you
need a detailed overview of each one of
these mice I'm gonna be dropping a link
down below so you guys can go check out
my full reviews of each one of these
mice but until then guys until the next
video it has been your boy bTW don't
forget to Like share comment and
subscribe and I will see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
