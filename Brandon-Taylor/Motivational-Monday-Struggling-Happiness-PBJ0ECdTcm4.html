with another motivational Monday today I
want to talk about everybody's favorite
topic and that is happiness what makes
us happy did a new car new clothes new
relationship what makes it happy today I
want to help you guys create some long
lasting happiness in your life and what
I found and what you guys already know
to be true is all the material things on
the surface level of things that we
think makes us happy the only make us
happy for minutes at a time maybe an
hour you play with it in the next book
female is just under your bed or in your
closet wondering what's next and that is
not real happiness real happiness comes
from struggling we think struggling and
stress is that but it's actually a very
important part of life we want to
struggle the thing is you have to find
what you want to struggle about what's
important to you what are your goals
what are your aspirations that is what's
going to make you happy by struggling
and going through something messing up
failing that should make you happy right
on the other side of that those failures
and your mistakes there's happiness
think about a time when you guys failed
you came back and then you accomplished
it or you kept going through that goal
that happiness is very long-lasting and
it will stay with you the rest of your
life so even we all recall times in our
life even if you don't see those times
right now we all look back even in like
elementary school you want to a spelling
bee or you were in a math club and that
you're proud of things like that that
really just stand out to you and you
look back sometimes like man that was
great even though those elementary
school is still kind of boost your mood
right you become happy and that's what
we have to do now continuously struggle
stress out go through your goals and
then create new ones we're only happy
when we're creating problems do you ever
notice in your life maybe you're
creating problems about the wrong
things maybe it's time to start creating
problems about the right things you will
see much more growth within your life I
think a lot of times people will get
caught up in the wrong problems the
wrong attitudes and then what happens
they end up wasting their lives and the
problems that are worth struggling for
and at the end of these problems after
you solve them there's happiness and
then it lacks for a little bit and then
next thing you know hey I have another
problem that I need to solve now that I
saw this one this created another
problem in another and another and
through this we become happy you don't
have to take my word for it set a small
goal this week smash that goal and as
soon as that doesn't change your mood
see if that doesn't change your whole
week I can't I can't make this stuff up
guys and I think a lot of you guys know
it to be true that this and I think a
lot of you guys know it to be sure that
this technique does work it works and
sometimes we just need to see it and
really think about what we're actually
here to do what problems are you going
to create but you can solve making
humanity better etc etc whatever your
goals are whatever is important to you
whatever goals you have sent that's
worth struggling floor alright guys so
thank you guys very much for watching
and I will see you guys next video I
don't get to kill this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
