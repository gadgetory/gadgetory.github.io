with another review today we're gonna be
looking at a sleeper pick one that I
came across I don't know how I was just
on Amazon searching one day look around
and headphones and I saw this sony came
out with the new pair of headphones so
my guess is as good as yours when these
came out but it looks like it was
sometime in April and these are the CH
700 ends now these things have just
blown me away I'm surprised that these
aren't more broadcast
phones and they're coming in at $200 so
let me tell you guys what I found over
the past a week of using these
headphones but before we began to forget
to hit that subscribe button for more
content like this so one thing that I
want to establish before we start this
review is that these are a no frills
headphone these things are just straight
right at you they are what they are no
frills no extra cases no nothing they're
just headphones and they work so that is
going to be the theme of today's review
and starting off with that in the box
you'll find that there's just absolutely
no case
so for travel or things like that you're
kind of on your own now these come with
a aux cord and a USB cord as well which
is very nice the design of these
headphones not picked up the blue ones
they also have a black version as well
but they have leather on the top faux
leather on the cups and these things
feel amazing it's not as good as the
leather feels on like the sony 1000 XM
2's but they are pretty good now one
thing that you'll notice coming from
some of the other Sony headphones is how
big the ear cups actually are these
things are oval shaped and they're
really really big so for those of you
who have big ears these are gonna be
great for you I found at least to be
really comfortable although at times
near my jawline I did get a little bit
of fatigue from pressure but that is the
pressure created by these headphones to
try to give you a closed-off experience
using the noise cancellation so speaking
of noise cancellation these do a really
good job in the gym of blocking out
noise now some noises do get through but
I'd say they're better than most
also when compared to the other Sony
headphones like the 1000x m2s or the
sony here on Tues which are started my
favorite headphones the noise
cancellation here doesn't have as many
mode so it doesn't have like the ambient
modes or anything like that you can only
turn it on and off so what I said about
no frills comes in here as well there's
no frills this thing is just noise
cancellation and it works you're not
going to be able to tailor your
experience but it just works
and I also plated a lot of static in the
background when I was playing my vinyls
I just let the static kind of play to
try to block out some noise and it did a
fairly good job all those
time's it did come in a little bit
coming back around to the bill quality
the headband feels great it doesn't feel
like it's gonna snap it has that metal
Sony headband that's usually standard in
all their headphones and I know some of
you guys out there have had them crack
but I have never had a Sony headphone
break on me or crack now most
importantly I know you guys want to know
how is the sound and bass heads these
are some of the best Sony headphones for
bass I like this better than the Sony
xb9 50 in ones even they sound amazing
the bass is just it hits you without the
need to even touch the eq and when you
touch the eq they get even better and
one thing that i really like about these
headphones i don't want to stress is
that they keep their clarity the treble
the high-end stays the same no matter
how much bass it's like you can have
your cake and eat it too as i always say
with these you have the bass you have
the treble you have the mids
everything is just layered very very
nicely it's very separated unlike
something like the 1000x m2 which can
get muddy at times and even the sony
here on Tues i think are a little bit
better and speaking of which I noticed
that Sony uses the screen material this
mesh material in their headphones now
instead of like on the 1000 xm2 skylake
cloth and i think that really adds to
the sound it lets the sound from the
driver just come out and hit you whereas
with the sony 1000x and twos
it can't get muddied and a lot of people
complain to me like brandon what are you
doing why are you recommending these
when they sound muddy well this is kind
of Sony's answer to that problem and I
think this will be fixed in the next
version of the 1000x in threes so yeah
these sound great with all genres
whether that's jazz classical you know
for the trouble if you want to hit some
bass get your wrap your EDM everything
just sounds amazing and one thing that I
really really like about these is the
volume these things get astronomically
loud and I know a lot of you guys have
complained in the past boss Sony's
headphones being low in volume these do
not suffer in that let me tell you
everything just sounds great there's no
distortion at the high end anything like
that when you turn up the volume now
a really nice feature of these
headphones is they come with 35 hours of
battery that's more than the 1000 X and
twos at 30 hours and that is just
incredible 35 hours I mean when do you
really have to charge you sings I
haven't had to charge them and it's been
over a week that's how long they last so
if you're worried about battery life if
you're a person that doesn't like to
charge their headphones if you're a
person that likes to travel a lot or is
on the go a lot these are gonna be a
great great option and in standard Sony
form the call quality is also amazing
create no problems whatsoever I'm sure
you guys if you make a lot of phone
calls these will do just fine
so let's finish this off by talking
about the controls which I really like
as well
now these use the Sony trigger system
not the touch which is also really
really nice I love the trigger system
where you can just slide it to one side
to go back slide it forward to go
another press it in do pause or play
your song it's one of my favorite
methods because it just works you never
have to really mess around with it like
you do some touch controls and there's a
really a learning curve with touch
control so it's nice to just have
something that just works right out of
the box low learning curve you also have
a noise cancellation button as well
which you can turn off the noise
cancellation as you go or as you see fit
now this does affect the sound quality a
little bit and it gives you a little bit
more clarity there's not that active
noise cancellation going on in the
background that can cause some haziness
sometimes speaking of which one more
thing that I want to touch on is that
these have adaptive noise cancellation
so it's not the kind that just plays and
white hiss nose no these actually listen
to your outside surroundings and block
out everything so again these are
surprisingly good I mean you get the
sony sound you get the app functionality
you lose a little bit of the noise
cancellation functionality but if you're
not really tinkering with it anyway so
you're not losing anything you get 35
hours of battery life and they're very
comfortable so it's a win-win and I can
really recommend these for you guys that
don't want to spend the money on the
1000x m2s these aren't a very very good
option alright guys so thank you guys
for watching I hope you guys have
enjoyed this video and I will see you
guys in the next one has been your boy
