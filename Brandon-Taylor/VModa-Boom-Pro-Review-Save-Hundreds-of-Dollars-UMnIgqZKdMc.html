again with another review and today
we're gonna save you guys thousands of
dollars whether you're a gamer or a
businessman or everything in between
this is gonna be for you guys this is a
really cool add-on to any existing
headphone that's right you can use your
beats your son√≠s your V motives and
anything that has a 3.5 jack
now what this add-on does the v-moda
boom Pro is it adds on a way to get
crystal-clear audio for your voice for
calls for gaming for any voice of
communication so what you do is you plug
the 3.5 jack of this v-moda boom Pro
into your headphones and it turns any
headphone into a gaming headset
instantly so you can imagine you don't
have to buy that gaming headset or
another headset to make calls with you
can now turn your Sony's or beats your V
Moto's into a great sounding voice
communication headphone so you can bring
that same bass and the same booms to
your gaming which is amazing and you
don't have to buy another $150 to $200
gaming headset or even look around you
can just say you know I'm gonna buy
great set of bluetooth headphones like
the v-moda cross Bay Wireless two and
then you can just add this boom Pro on
to it and then you have a great gaming
headset so you plug one end into the
headphone and then you plug the other
end into either your phone or it comes
with the V splitter where you can plug
it into a mic and output for your
computer now one thing that I really
love about this is the remote now it
allows you to control the volume a
straight from the remote and it also
comes with a way to mute the mic which
some gaming headphones don't even have
so that's a really cool feature that I
really like it also has a clip where you
can clip it to your shirt also really
nice the one thing that I will say about
the build quality is that the the mic
even though it's steel and it's very
flexible is very movable sometimes I did
find myself during a heated game or what
just touching my face not
that mic out of place so it I wish it
was a little bit more stiff in a way so
that it wouldn't move so much when you
move it but then it has its pros and
cons because with that same movement you
can also put it into mini positions by
your face so now I'm gonna do a mic test
for you guys just to show you guys what
it sounds like so here we go let me know
what you guys think down in the comments
below
testing testing one two three this is a
mic test let me know what you guys think
down in the comments below about how
this sounds I think it sounds pretty
good and a lot of people have commented
that actually sound better than some of
the gaming headphones that I have been
wearing lately now before we go I just
want to just one more thing with these
they also cut out a lot of background
noise and I know a lot of people out
there have been asking me in my comments
oh how does it cut out the background
noise yes these do I live by a street
and these and there's cars always going
by me and these cut out a lot of that
background noise I had my window open
while I did that mic test and did you
guys hear any cars the proof is in the
pudding this without a doubt for thirty
dollars this thing is amazing it will
save you hundreds of hundreds of dollars
and you can use their existing already
amazing Bluetooth gaming headphones so
what I do is I bring my V motors out
during the day I wear them throughout
the day you know listening to music
while I'm out traveling things like that
and then it's nice to just come home and
I can just plug it in to the 3.5 jack
and then there you have it I have gaming
headset right there ready for me to go
and I can just turn on overwatch and get
it cracking alright guys so go out and
buy this thing if you haven't already
the link will be in the description
below and as always guys like comment
share and subscribe if you really
enjoyed this video save your friend some
money tell them about this review and I
will see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
