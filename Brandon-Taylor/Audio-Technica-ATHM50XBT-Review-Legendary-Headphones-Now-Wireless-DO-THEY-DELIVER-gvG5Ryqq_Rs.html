I'm super excited because we have a
classic in the house a legend if you
might but with a twist now
audio-technica has just revamped their
classic headphones 280x m50x headphones
now with bluetooth capabilities I'm
super juiced to give you guys this
review now this is what we've all been
waiting for so now that they are here
how did the new m50x bluetooth
turn out has audio technica made history
again with these headphones find out
today so let's start off with the
comfort and design they keep that same
classic design of the black with the
silver trimmings it looks just as
gorgeous as the day I first set my eyes
on them about five years ago the m50x
Bluetooth keep that same amazing build
quality as the originals you can really
beat these things up and not skip a beat
get it on the left ear cup you have a
volume rocker and play/pause button
where you can skip tracks as well
there's also a power button and a
pairing slider near the front of the cub
and this presented a problem for me it's
very hard and confusing to navigate the
control system on these headphones
sometimes especially since the buttons
are on the flat side and not clearly
mark where you can fill them with your
fingers and things like that also on the
left ear cup you have a 3.5 millimeter
jack the 3.5 millimeter chord has a
controller and a mic which is a nice
touch and there's also an included USB
charger the headband is comfortable and
the leather cups still clamp to your
head giving you that true close back
experience some people might not like
that added pressure but this actually
keeps you from needing noise
cancellation because nothing gets past
these ear cups in conclusion amazing
build quality and comfort if you like
closed back headphones for the design of
the new Bluetooth Patrol's I wish they
were a little bit better but they aren't
bad but I mean let's be honest they're
not necessarily great then 50 X's are
known to be some of the most balanced
headphones for audio engineers and music
enthusiasts they feature a 45 millimeter
aperture driver which is incredibly
detailed for the price of $200 guys I
kid you not these are the
sounding Bluetooth headphones that I've
tried this year in my opinion and they
are only $200 that is just an incredible
deal these are closed back so you won't
get that open back spaciousness but in
turn you gain that close back bass and
power all instruments and vocals sound
that much stronger coming from a great
set of closed back headphones from Frank
Ocean to Calvin Harris to Pink Floyd
these reproduced music so well acoustic
songs also sound buttery smooth I feel
like I'm riding on a musical sheet of
the musicians playing their instruments
simply amazing what's better is that you
can actually plug these into a DAC app
as well and get like an audiophile type
system going on at home if you want
audio technica really nailed it with
these headphones I must say I'm
thoroughly impressed but I think that
you guys will be too once your ears get
a hold of these bad boys the battery
life is rated at 40 hours holy crap not
only that but you get amazing sound on
top of it so you get to enjoy that
amazing sound of the m50 exes
for 40 freakin hours I wasn't expecting
that I always think it may be like 15 to
20 kind of like v-moda you know they
kind of stress having really good sound
quality and not much on the like
bluetooth and battery side so it's a
really nice that they've coupled this
with an amazing package they're really
trying to give you a legendary headphone
with these set of cans the call quality
is good enough for most applications I
wouldn't say it's the best but I would
say it's definitely on part with
slepping like Sony but not as good as
Bose the connection is rock-solid in
crowded areas these also feature aptX
for you Android users out there and AC
for iPhone users and it's rockin
bluetooth 5.0 I tell you guys Audio
Technica pack these things full with the
best technology they really want to make
history with these headphones and quite
frankly they did these make v-moda sound
like a children's toy in my opinion the
m50x BTS are a statement headphone and
they've left a great impression on me
