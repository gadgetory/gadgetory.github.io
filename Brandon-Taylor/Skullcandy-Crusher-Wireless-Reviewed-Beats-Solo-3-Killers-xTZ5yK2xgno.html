with another review today we are gonna
be taking a look at the school candy
crusher wireless headphones another much
requested headphone by you guys now the
school candies have been known for their
crazy amount of bass more so than the
Beast brand but what I really appreciate
about the school candies is that they
were one of the first brands to really
bring crazy amount of bass at a low
price I used to buy them all the time
for the gym and the motional charge that
I would get from the bass well just give
me that push to get through the gym and
get through all my sessions with ease so
for that I am forever indebted to them
so how do their school candy crush your
wireless headphones stand up in
comparison to some of the big dog
companies out there today I'll give you
my thoughts on these headphones and help
you guys with your purchase before we
get into today's review don't forget to
subscribe for more quality content like
this so in the packaging you'll find a
micro USB cord a 35 millimeter jack a
carrying case and of course the
headphones I really enjoyed the
packaging of these headphones strangely
it gives you kind of this dark a grungy
feel and it's it's kind of eerie to be
honest with you but I like it when it
comes to protecting your headphones I
always prefer a carrying hard case but
most companies at this price point of
$180 are giving us just a bag and I
guess that beats not having anything
just so you can protect your headphones
from scratches now they come in two
different colors so black and the white
and tan version both look great in my
opinion but I went with the all-black
because I love low profile headphones
these are over ear headphones with full
other cups and foam on the inside this
is probably some of the best foam
padding inside of Erika I've ever felt
on my ears super cushiony super soft the
band is made of metal which is great for
helping it last for a long time they
also put this little dip on the top side
on the underside of the headphones so
that when you stretch them out it won't
cause a crease and your headphones which
is nice because I've run into that
problem with the Beats Studio 2 point
nose they feature a plus and minus
button in their actual shape so it's
nice to find when you're rummaging
around on the ear cups you can kind of
find where the volume rocker is and on
the other cup you will find a bass
slider but we'll get into that later now
for the negative
I don't like that they put the cords on
the outside of the band and because
these can get caught on things and
causes short maybe I'm just paranoid and
worried about it because in the past
I've had to replace a lot of school
candy your buds do too short so the
cable feels good but I am still kind of
skeptical because of this also the band
is super super tight it creates amazing
isolation but I fatigue very fast with
these I have to give them a rest after
about an hour so that might be a
deal-breaker for some of you guys out
there so keep that in mind go
candy base there is nothing else like it
let's just say that not the Sony extra
base is not the v-moda is not the beats
these will have your eardrums rattling a
light that you can control how much base
you can add with the slider because
without that these would be almost
unlistenable with some songs from my
findings you can listen to rap hip-hop
R&amp;amp;B EDM with the slider all the way up
but rock classical jazz the bigs just
mixed a song sound hollow so for those
genres I turn it down or halfway down to
get the best sound and keep the base up
and without the bass up these actually
sound really good to my surprise and
that might surprise a lot of you guys
out there these actually sound out of
the box pretty good now they did take a
couple of hours for them to burn in and
they start to sound very smooth after
that but they were kind of harsh out of
the box with the bass slider all the way
down these can compete with the BMO's
and Sennheiser's of the world
adding the bass slider just makes them
so fun and that sometimes Trump's
top-notch sound the highs are nice and
controlled the mids are more neutral on
these I think they kind of focused on
the highs and the mids in a good way and
making those great so that when you
slide the bass lighter up it kind of
balances them out to make for a great
experience now before we finish with the
sound I just want to say that yes these
do get very loud these will satisfy a
lot of you out there
oh no I'm very surprised at these
headphones so these sound great guys the
Bluetooth on these is also great they
have a great signal there's no delay
when watching movies or YouTube like
some of the other headphones so this is
where this pair of headphones really
does
Skullcandy has put 40 hours of battery
life into these headphones with no W and
chip from Apple they are really trying
to kill the beat so low threes off with
these headphones and from my findings
they really have and I think these are
what most people are looking for when it
comes to bass and just adding that
battery life on there really puts them
in competition and really passes a lot
of people with that 40 hours of battery
life so what do you get when you mix a
bass slider great highs and mids great
battery life and there are some decent
comfort into there you get the
Skullcandy crusher
Wireless a great set of headphones
coming in at $180 these things are for
people looking for a fun experience I
think that most people looking at the
beat soul of threes should be looking
here for a fraction the price you get
the bass that they are truly looking for
they do have some comfort issues but I
feel like they will be working on those
in the next generation of these
headphones but this is a great start and
I'm excited to see how they can improve
on these alright guys so that's my time
it's been your boy BT reminding you to
keep it fun achieve your goals work hard
