throw them out guys bTW back here again
with another review today we're gonna be
looking at fitbit's first attempt at
stepping into the bluetooth wireless
headphone game and that is with the
Fitbit fliers coming in at a $129.99
Fitbit is already killing the wearable
tech game as it is so I was very excited
to see them bring that fitness knowledge
over into the headphone arena so how did
these stack up against the top dogs in
the workout arena the Jaybirds and the
boses of the world let's find out today
but before we begin don't forget to hit
that subscribe button if you haven't
already for more quality content like
this trust me I got a lot more reviews
coming all right so let's talk about the
comfort and design in the box you're
gonna find the headphones a carrying
pouch the standard wingtips and they
also have added in these fins that we're
gonna talk about a little bit later the
earbuds himself have a nice feel to them
the materials that they use the cord to
the metal accents on the side of the
earbuds are all real standouts to me the
remote feels similar to the beats X but
a little bit more solid feeling and less
movable parts has the press play button
it has the volume up and down rocker as
well at first sight these looked like
the long-lost little brother of a Bose
sound support Wireless and I thought
that they would fit similarly I thought
they would fit kind of the same but they
are completely different in the way that
they fit into your ear please use the
standard silicone tips that you just
press into your ear canals
unlike the Bose I just sit outside of
your ears and then use these fins to go
into the crease of your ear
I found these fins to be just absolutely
horrendous and I almost gave up on these
headphones when I first got them almost
immediately I almost want to just pack
them up and ship them back but I calmed
down took a breath I lifted the box
these wings are the saving grace of
these headphones and I think that they
should just throw out the Finn idea but
because larger small these just do not
fit well and I would imagine unless you
have a very specific ear shape that
these will fall out for you too with the
wings though they are some of the most
secure and comfortable headphones on the
market right now I kid you guys not I
can't work out with these and maybe
adjust them maybe a few times and that's
all I need
Fitbit also integrated a cord shortener
on the back but I found that this causes
more efficient and Lisa the ear buds
falling out as opposed to just leaving
the court hanging on your neck so these
are the perfect workout headphones in my
opinion as far as fit and comfort goes
let's see how they fare in the sound
round sound boy oh boy let me just tell
you guys you don't even need any custom
vq profiles for these you don't need any
fancy apps no nothing these things fly
out of the box fitbit flyer fly get it
just incredible is what i'm trying to
say they have two modes their signature
mode which is incredible right out of
the box balance is very warm listening
to guitar strings is an absolute
pleasure with these headphones mints are
a little bit more laid-back in this mode
but still the cleared is there even in
the highs and this signature mode is
what I use most of the day then when I
want a little bit more of a bass boost
for that emotional charge in the gym I
switch over to their power boost mode
and you do this by just pressing the up
and down volume buttons at the very same
time this in turn will bring up the
lower end including the bass and
bringing up those knees making them more
forward and making them an absolute
snack for your songs with vocals you can
tell that they make these headphones
with workout enthusiasts in mind I push
through my cardio with ease they worked
great on my bike on treadmill that
worked well on Stairmaster they work
well with doing dynamic jumps
all of the above just perfect oh and did
I mention that the soundstage is
absolutely bonkers best sounding ear
buds that I've had the pleasure of
trying out by far artists like Major
Lazer Chris Brown scissor Mumford &amp;amp; Sons
all the sound super mind-blowing with
these gear buds one thing I could see
people asking for is more volume but
these do get loud enough to block out
most noises in a gym during rush hour
which is when I go the connectivity is
solid as no interruptions to be seen
with these no lag when watching youtube
videos the distance on these is really
good again they made these with workout
enthusiasts in mind and as you guys know
out there we like to keep our phones in
our bags and our gym bags or off to the
side so that it's not bouncing around
and falling out of our pockets during
our workout or our exercise so having
that stable connection is a must in
these things deliver battery life I got
a solid 8 hours of battery life
I love the voice prompts that they give
you for example the Fitbit lady will
come on and say less than 15 minutes of
battery life so there's no surprises
when you're in the middle of your
workout and you hear music cut out when
it looked like you had two hours of
better life on the little battery icon
on your phone the bass boost mode does
drain more battery life keep that in
mind I got about 6 or 7 hours using that
mode so keep that in mind if you are
gonna use it now the call quality I'll
let you guys decide what you think of it
down below alright guys so we're
checking out the sound quality on the
mic let me know down in the comments
below what you think of the call quality
alright alright so disregarding that
Finn Fiasco I just want to forget all
about that that I encountered when I
first got these headphones switching to
the wings made these headphones my
favorite workout headphones this
they combined security comfort and
amazing sound for a winning recipe if
this is how they're coming out of the
gate with their first edition of these
headphones I'm excited for fitbit's
feature in the Bluetooth wireless
headphone game
Fitbit amazing job these are a must own
in my opinion if you workout they
definitely get the beatty seal of
approval and I'm so glad that I picked
them up and that I tried them out yeah
and I cannot rave about them enough just
throw away those things alright guys so
thank you guys for watching that's all I
have for you today hit that thumbs up if
you enjoyed and sub if you loved and I
will see you guys in the net</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
