review of the logitech g930 5 the
updated version of logitech g930 3 now I
did have the g930 3 but I never covered
them because they weren't that good to
be honest with you guys I'm just gonna
you know I keep it honest here on the
channel they weren't good and they
didn't make it to the channel I didn't
see a reason why they should be reviewed
I don't really feel like they were worth
it now a logitech is coming back with
the g9 35 at a hundred and seventy
dollars oh that's a big hike so
especially when there's like the hyper
cloud X twos and all those out there can
these compete are they worth that extra
dime these are wireless and they do have
that 7.1 so let's see if they are up to
the task of uh you know helping us kill
some noobs so let's start off with what
they have in the Box now they have a 3.5
to 3.5 millimeter jack cord in there and
that is so you can plug it up to your
ps4 your Xbox or your Nintendo switch so
you get some versatility here also in
the Box is a USB charger so you can plug
it in and use it while you're charging
the headphones and also the headphones
themselves I do like that these have a
hidden compartment to put your USB C
receiver into on the left ear cup which
is nice so when you're storing them or
you're traveling you can just put it
into the air cup and you're good to go
you won't lose the charger no last year
I wasn't impressed with the g9 33 is
because the cloth Pat's or just
horrendous they were scratchy they were
stiff they didn't really form it just
felt like you had two big blocks of
cloth on your head and it wasn't
comfortable this year they've gone with
some leather that is more comfortable
the padding on it feels exceptional one
thing I will say though is that the
stitching hurts it hurts it's not that
comfortable it kind of presses into your
ear and I'm kind of hoping that over
time these will actually break down and
break in to have them be more
comfortable over time I actually think
that Logitech chose the wrong size for
the ear cups they made it big up top and
small at the bottom I don't like the
feel of it I would rather it be small
the top and big at the bottom I don't
know if that's just a personal
preference but I feel like that works a
lot
and is more comfortable also on the
ear-cups you've got some RGB lighting
now this in my opinion just isn't worth
it you're not gonna see it while you're
gaming I mean it looks cool when it's on
your desk but it only lasts for six
hours with the RGB on and twelve with it
off so there's no reason to run the RGB
you're just cutting your battery life in
half and for twelve hours for six hours
that is just not acceptable for 2019
battery life standards now you can
control this with the logitech Hub
software and you can change it from like
breathing and all that type of modes
yadda yadda yadda you're just cutting
down your battery life that's all I hear
when I look at the list of RGB on there
also on the left ear cup you've got
three programmable buttons you got the
volume scroll and you've got the power
switch now the build quality this year
isn't ask creaky as last year it
actually feels kind of nice there's not
much sound coming from it when you twist
it let me give you a demonstration right
now
last year it was way worse than this
this isn't that bad at all it feels like
they greased some of these hinges this
year so yeah pretty good job this year
and Logitech listening to us and kind of
changing that creepiness the padding up
top here is really really nice it's
super spongy this part is the most
comfortable part of the whole headphone
and these aren't too bad for weight
they're not that bad as well on the
right ear cup you actually find a
battery door so you can actually change
out the battery if your battery ever
dies on you so that's kind of cool you
can change out that rechargeable battery
it's got a stainless steel headband up
there covered in plastic as well I think
that leads to it not being as creaky as
last year and also they've got a
microphone on the left ear cup as well
which you can flip out and flip in and
it also bends to your mouth and extends
so kind of some cool touches here with
the microphone and we'll do a sound test
and all that a little bit later don't
you guys worry I'm not gonna leave you
guys hanging so the wireless
capabilities are really really nice
these cover up to 15 meters guys so you
can walk around you can go to the
bathroom you know flip that mic up and
take a number two if you know what I'm
saying come back to the game like
nothing happened and it's kind of nice
you know sometimes not having to worry
about oh shoot where's my cord you know
we've all been there where we get up
from our chair and our headphones snap
down it's really cool that this is
wireless the wireless receiver just goes
into your PC and it just works
I've had no interruptions with the
wireless been completely happy with that
aspect of these headsets all right guys
so let's talk about one of the most
important aspects of any gaming headsets
the sound that spatial awareness being
able to place enemy footsteps to hear
them coming before they even know that
they're coming towards us that's what we
want right we want that 7.1 DTS super
surround sound that these offer us the
g9 35s offer us we want it right well
guys let me tell you these are
absolutely doot-doot for a hundred and
seventy dollars I want to hear you
walking towards me that's it I want to
know what direction you're coming from I
want to know before you even know it
before you even turn on your PC I want
to know that you're turning on your PC I
want to hear it but no I don't hear
anything it just sounds like I have a
regular pair of headphones on now I went
into the settings I put it too wide for
the soundstage I did all these I tried
to tinker with the equalizer which is
just terrible
it just completely destroys the clarity
any clarity that there was in these
gaming headsets so I don't know the
software doesn't really match up with
the headphones now I don't know if the
actual technology of the headphones is
enough to par I mean they say there's 50
millimeter drivers in here they should
be you know packing a punch but I've
heard better for way cheaper
you know the hyper clout x2s for
instance why not why wouldn't you just
get those over these there's no reason
not to and save yourself a hundred
dollars music does sound decent it's
clear there's clarity with these
headphones but again if you touch that
equaliser you're done for so I really
think that Logitech needs to go back to
the draw
bored I know that they can do it it's
just a matter of them putting in the
effort to put it into these headphones
to make them you know do some research
Logitech do some research figure out
what these other top people like astro
or HyperX SteelSeries find out what
they're doing find out what they're
doing because they're doing it better
than you so yeah for the sound for
surround sound for gaming these are just
average to below average especially for
the price that you're paying they're
below average the one saving grace of
this gaming headset is the microphone
this thing is absolutely money I think
they put all that money that you're
paying for it into the microphone not
only if there's like flipping it up
actually turn it off but the clarity
that you get with this it's just
astonishing now I talked to my friends
on discord and they told me that this is
the best mic that I've ever used on
discord so that's saying a lot so if you
want the best of the best mic you know
per se maybe you don't really care about
the sound maybe you don't really care
about that spatial awareness this gaming
headset might just be for you so what
that being said let's just drop a sound
test for you guys right about now what's
up guys this beatty here and this is the
test of the microphone let me know what
you guys think down below my friends say
this is the clearest microphone I've
ever had but you guys are my friends too
so let me know down below so what did
you guys think do you think that is a
clearest microphone that I've ever
tested on the channel let me know down
in the comments below alright guys so
that is going to do it for this review
of the g9 35 from Logitech it's a miss
for me I wish that the sound and the
surround sound really delivered all
those promises of the 7.1
DTS super surround sound marketing you
know extra whatever or whatever they're
calling it whatever they're doing over
there it's not working they need to go
back to the drawing board maybe do redo
their software maybe redo the actual
drivers and the headphones maybe just
steal some drivers from like HyperX or
something whatever they got to do but
for $170 it's a big likes for me it's a
pass alright guys so thank you guys for
watching don't forget to Like share
comment
it has been your boy beat teeth don't
wait I already said that well where are
we right now guys help me out help me
out I'm just gonna say peace I spin your
boy BT Sam peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
