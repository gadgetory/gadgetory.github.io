won't clean it in the church isn't any
point to which the hurt them off and
lamps jeezum none of these what's up
guys is BT here and this is the review
of the Sennheiser HD one in-ear wireless
earbuds you guys know me when wireless
earbuds have a neck band they really
need to impress me to make me want to
recommend them to you guys a few things
have to happen the neck band has to be
comfortable and not move around whether
that's from doing like light daily tasks
all the way up to the heaviest workouts
the sound also needs to beat out
something without a neck band or else
it's not even worth it and they have to
have a great battery life so do these
$130 Sennheiser HD ones check all the
boxes necessary for me to recommend them
to you guys my subs find out today let's
start off with the Comfort in design now
the ht1 neck band is very very
comfortable and does not move around
when working out it's light and
unobtrusive on the inside of the neck
band you'll find the power button which
also connects the Bluetooth the volume
rocker which doubles as a way to skip
tracks when you hold down either the
plus or minus volume buttons for a
second the middle button also accepts
calls and plays and pause your music
the buttons are tactile and easy to
press while maintaining enough stiffness
to have them not be pressed in on
accident while you're working out and
things like that the leather on the neck
band is very comfortable and does not
get hot or tug at your skin while using
them you can also store these in this
applied case which is nice and
low-profile making it easy to store in
your bag when traveling the earbuds are
very very comfortable and come with
three sets of ear tips which are all
great I love the stainless steel look of
the earbuds it just makes it look super
premium and they look like they would be
heavy but they are quite light which I
like and I have never experienced them
being tugged out or falling out on their
own one thing that I think Sennheiser
should add to these is like a magnet on
the backing so that while the earbuds
aren't in use you can actually snap them
together connectivity is great you can
use NFC to connect them to your phone
you can also connect bluetooth 4.1 which
I haven't experienced any drops or lad
thing like that while watching video
it's perfectly fine AAC for iPhone of
course an apt X no HD for the connection
types here I can tell the difference
between the AVT X and the AAC aptX just
sounds better to me it could be my mind
playing tricks on me but I don't know I
feel like I can hear the difference I
don't know what do you guys think can
you guys tell the difference between
like AAC and apt X and aptX
HD let me know in the comments below
another thing that I get asked a lot in
my comments is do these connect to
multiple devices and yes the HD ones can
connect to two devices at once you can
do this by just connecting both via the
Bluetooth so I'm gonna do my mic test a
little bit different from now on I'm
gonna just give you guys a test of the
mic and let you guys hear the audio that
I have taken with it
and let you guys be the decider of
whether it sounds good or not because
sound is subjective you know maybe I
think it sounds good but you guys don't
think it sounds good so here we go
alright guys I am coming to you guys
from the HD ones right now let me know
what you guys think of the sound
download tin you got some may you see
how does my voice sound would you use
these for phone calls or would you trust
these to make business calls important
calls the battery life is rated at 10
hours which is amazing in my opinion and
that's in line with what I was getting
the HD ones charged with a micro USB a
full charge takes about 1.5 hours which
is great now the sound is where these
really really impressed me the imaging
on these earbuds is exceptional they
really live up to that HD name because
it sounds like you are looking at a 4k
HDR screen if that makes sense great
separation not an extremely wide
soundstage but enough to satisfy you
the mid-to-upper base is where these
really really shine and it does a good
job of letting everything else shine
whether that's the mids or the highs
it's also raised in the mids and in the
treble is giving you that clarity in the
vocals and in trouble if you need that
thumping bass maybe look elsewhere but
if you want some good quality bass that
I think will most likely satisfy most
people and enough control treble to make
rock and classical songs sound amazing
then look no further than the HD ones I
must say that the issue ones are a
really
good set of wireless in here earbuds I'm
glad that I got the chance to check them
out they check all the boxes for me
whether that's comfort sound battery
life making these an easy recommendation
to you guys and at only $130 I do wish
that they had magnets and of course
noise cancellation but these get a nice
seal so noise cancellation isn't really
necessary here and you can kind of save
on the costs alright guys so thank you
