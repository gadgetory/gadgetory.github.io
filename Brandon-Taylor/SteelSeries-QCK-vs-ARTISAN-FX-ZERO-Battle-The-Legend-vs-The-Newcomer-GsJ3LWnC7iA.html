the battle between the SteelSeries qck
and the artisan fx0 mousepads
and i wanted to do this to kind of show
you guys the differences between the QC
k the legend i think every one of us
will have one of these or own one of
these in our lifetime versus the new kid
on the block the artisan that has all
these different weaves and great bill
quality on the website of the artisan
zero it actually says that this is the
closest mousepad to the QC k but I kind
of beg to differ and I'm going to go
over the differences between the two
today and which one you should get so
there's a huge price difference here the
artisan is 4,000 yen or $40 and the QC K
is $20 so about half the price so is it
worth it to even get the artisan at this
point so the dimensions of the QC k are
450 millimeters by 400 millimeters by 2
millimeters thick the dimensions of the
artisan or 490 millimeters by 420
millimeters by 4 millimeters thick so
about double the thickness of the QC k
low sensitivity people are going to love
the XL size on the artisan it just gives
you a little bit more breathing room
around the edges the QC k doesn't have
stitching around the edges and we all
know that they start to come up after
some time maybe after a year maybe after
a couple weeks maybe you get some
bubbles in your mousepad that's not
gonna happen with the artisan this thing
is stitched around the edge and it's
some of the best that i've seen on any
mousepad now some people don't like
stitching and i know some of you guys
out there don't because you've told me
but i really feel like it adds to the
durability of the mousepad I also like
the minimal branding on the artisan 0fx
as well compared to that big still
series logo that we all become a cousin
to that I think our brain just kind of
warps it out and just sees it as being
all black but that thing is huge if we
really look at it the key CK has more of
a standard rubber base whereas the
artisan fx0 has a non-slip base and this
thing it's been so so for me this is
actually the best non-slip base on an
artisan mousepad that I've tried it
actually stays in place better than any
other mousepad that I've actually tried
from them so I'd say they're about the
same in that regard they both stay in
place very very well
when talking about performance I really
want to stress consistency in gaming we
all want to be consistent and I noticed
pros they would like switch out their
SteelSeries mouse pads on a like regular
basis and that's to keep consistency in
their gaming they don't want a worn down
mouse pad and we all know we've all had
a qck where the middle gets all brown
and nasty and just sweaty
it's just gets all nasty it doesn't look
good on your desk right you want to
throw it out and then you gotta buy
another one so what happens that $20 I'm
gonna turn into 40 it's gonna turn into
60 it's gonna turn into 80 before you
know it you're gonna be spending well
over what the artists in cost and the
artisan will actually last you a longer
period of time so there's no denying
that the qck is a really good mousepad I
mean pros even use it til this day
because they're so used to it it's been
ingrained in the gaming culture and
society for the longest time now it's
just here it's not going anywhere but
that doesn't mean that there are
durability issues and consistency issues
and for all of us that aren't sponsored
we're left with buying multiple of these
mouse pads because they get worn down so
fast
now the qck actually feels faster and it
glides a little bit smoother than the
0fx
the 0fx is a slow controlled surface
this thing it glides it's very very nice
but there's a lot of stopping power it
really reminds me of a Zowie GS are the
original version if you really like a
control mouse pad this mouse pad is
gonna be for you but over time as we
know the qck really starts to
deteriorate it almost like you're it's
almost like you're rubbing a hole into
the middle of your mousepad with your
mouse and it's not a good feeling
it becomes scratchy and I don't know it
just doesn't feel right something to me
about it just doesn't feel right and I
know some of you guys out there have had
that same experience overall I think you
can't go wrong either way but if I had
to choose it would definitely be the
artisan because you're going to save
more money over time spin the 40 now the
4000 yen and get the good one or else
you're going to be replacing the
SteelSeries over and over and over again
unless you're a person that is just
has to have the SteelSeries and that's
been your jam for like the longest time
so be it but if not let's try out the
artisan fx0 and 2019 guys because i
think it is worth the money in my
opinion alright guys so that is gonna do
it for this video don't forget to Like
share comment subscribe and we are also
twitch streaming now guys and I will
link it down below I'm trying to do it
every Monday and Tuesday about 8:00 or
9:00 PST so go on there for some quality
gameplay or just me getting owned one of
the two is gonna happen but yeah I'd
love to see you guys there
don't forget to Like share comment and
subscribe I already said that I will see
