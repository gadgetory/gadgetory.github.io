gonna put this in the speakers on right
now you see the lights let's put it in
what's up guys is Beattie here and this
is a review of the Tribune Mac sound
plus speaker the bigger brother of one
of my favorite budget speakers ever now
tribe it is one of those sleeper
companies that I think could be huge one
day and that's why I cover the products
to be honest with you because they make
really great products that are
comparable to like the mainstream
companies like Bose Sony and JBL these
speakers usually run for about $99 but
they currently have a sale on Amazon for
$56 which is a steel in my opinion so in
this review I'm gonna be telling you why
I think this is one of the best if not
the best budget Bluetooth speaker on the
market period so let's start off with
the design of this speaker it comes in
black and it has a nice weight to it but
not so heavy that it would make you
think twice about bringing it along to a
party they've got a nice matte finish
around the outside of the speaker and
it's also ipx7 rated waterproof meaning
it can be submerged up to one meter for
30 minutes and still work perfectly fine
let's test it out shall we let's put
this thing to the test I think I have
something that might do the trick
let's see you guys
all right I think this is gonna do so
I'm gonna submerge this oh it's kind of
heavy
don't try this at home all right want to
put this in the speaker is on right now
you see the lights let's put it in all
right so we are putting it in yeah let's
twirl it around a little bit push it
around whoa let's see if this thing
works well let's hope I'm gonna look
either really stupid for doing that or
really smart because this thing is
amazing so let's press play we gotta cut
it off because I'm gonna get a copyright
strike for that anyways guys I don't
know if you can see on camera but I was
sweating a little bit during that
testing well I don't know how good of an
idea that was I'm all wet now for the
rest of this review but as you can see
this thing can be submerged underwater
you can have it and like humid weather
and it'll work perfectly fine for you on
the back of the speaker you'll find the
charging port that charges via a
microUSB it also has a place for an aux
course so if you're gonna connect this
directly to your phone or some other
device you can do that as well and both
courts are provided with the speaker in
the Box up top you'll find the controls
containing the power button a Bluetooth
button a volume rocker and an
exceptional bass button the buttons feel
a lot smoother than past tribal speakers
and they give you this nice satisfying
click is anybody else obsessed with
clicks like me I don't know is that like
a computer guy thing or just a weirdo
thing I don't know let me know am I the
only one let me know down in the
comments below one area I feel like
tribe it could improve on is a string
that holds up the speaker I don't feel
too confident in the court it is already
loosened on me a little bit when I
played around with it but not so much
that I felt like it would completely
fall off the hook I'm just more worried
about like overtime at
it's been hung a couple times that it
might get too tight or too loose that
being said the string is very functional
for hanging up at parties so that the
sound doesn't get drowned out when it's
like at below or like on a table
somewhere and you know people are
talking and then your music is drowned
out what I love most about tribe it is
unlike some other budget speakers when
you put this thing up to max volume
there is little to no Distortion
just good clean sound and not only that
the max volume is ridiculously loud
probably too loud for me to play into my
microphone I think I would blow out my
microphone because it is just that loud
when I play this in my room
I can hear it downstairs in my kitchen
clearly when using the speaker even
though it's blasting out in one
direction you can actually hear it
coming through the back as well and it
gives you a nice 3d sound I don't know
how they do it but it just comes out and
it like comes around the speaker I don't
know if that makes sense but that's what
it does and I was surprised at how well
the speaker went like facing a different
way it sounds great coming from the
other side I don't know you get it the
tribe it max sound plus is so good that
it's been my speaker of choice when I've
just been like chilling around the house
listening to music filming these videos
I've just put this on put some music on
and just got to work the exceptional
bass button warms up and increases a
low-end without being too obnoxious like
some other companies let's drop a sound
test of the speaker right now
all right now this is the song without
the exceptional bass on
now as you can see that extra bass was
very slight but it's enough to where if
you're listening to like EDM a rap or
any other bass heavy songs that it would
give you a nice little bump in the bass
without being obnoxious
now vocals are another area where budget
Bluetooth speakers often struggle
sounding muddy or distant but not with
the tribe in Max Plus it brings out
tonality and rappers and singers voices
the trouble is very polite to say the
least
turning off the exceptional bass or ex
bass will allow the treble it's time to
shine a little bit more though overall
guys for the price I don't see any other
speaker beating the power of this 24
watt speaker the battery life is also
amazing coming in at 20 hours it matches
some other big brands like the JBL
charge 3 but at a half of the cost so
amazing value here the range on the
speaker is up to 100 feet so you won't
be tied to sticking near your speaker if
you are DJing a party which I have been
guilty of you know we're all a
self-proclaimed DJ when it comes to
partying and having a bluetooth speaker
so at 56 dollars to try Big Mac sound
Plus speaker is an exceptional budget
speaker as a matter of fact I think this
just might be the best Bluetooth speaker
for the money period it's got everything
you could ever want in a speaker from
great battery life to amazing clarity at
high volumes so I'll be dropping a link
down below where you can pick one up I
carry mine around with me everywhere
because it seems like most places when
I'm going to that beach or a park or
anything with my friends I feel like
everybody just forgets about the music
and they're like dang I should've
brought a speaker well guys I bring my
tribe it speaker and it does a job and
then some alright guys so thank you for
watching that's gonna be it for this
review I hope you guys have enjoyed this
review and definitely check out the
speaker do not sleep on this company
mark my words they are gonna be big one
day because they just have amazing
quality for the money alright guys it
