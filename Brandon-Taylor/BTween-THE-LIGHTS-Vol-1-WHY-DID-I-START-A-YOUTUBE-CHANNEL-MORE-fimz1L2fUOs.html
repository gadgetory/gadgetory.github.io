finally time to give away that Bose
micro as well as answering all of your
guys's questions that you guys have for
me in that video so the first question
here comes from filming CEA's besides
being a professional charismatic
heartthrob what is your day job well
first and foremost Thank You Phil what
is my day job well I work in a lab at a
biopharma company and what we do is we
manufacture drugs for like cancer and
things like that trying to save the
world you know what I mean
so bucho main asks what made you start
youtube well I started because a lot of
family and friends were asking me about
fitness stuff they wanted to know what
my routine was how do I do certain
things and they always want to work out
but people would like flake out so I
thought why don't I just make videos so
that they could just see on their own
time and they can go and do the workouts
I can carry the workouts with them and
things like that so it really was like
for family and friends at first and I
was only getting like 23 views per video
then one day I said you know what let me
do a review on the j-bird x2s because I
really love these headphones I think
they're perfect for working out and at
the time I was in fitness so it kind of
went together I did the review it kind
of blew up I mean like 600 views and I
was like wait what's going on so I was
like maybe I could be onto something
here you know I never plan to get into
tech but YouTube kind of took me that
way and I've always been in headphones
I've always been into sound I've always
been in the computer so it just kind of
made sense to me that life was pushing
me in that direction so that's where I
went so any of you guys out there you
know you may have a plan but don't be
scared to go off the beaten path because
sometimes you never know where it might
land you I mean it landed me here with
20,000 subs and I could not be more
grateful for the journey so far so sob
hanpan Diaz what are your favorite
peripherals well I'm assuming that
you're talking about computer
peripherals so I want to just say that
my favorite is the ninja err 58 right
now and the ducky went to many before
that I was using the Leopold 750 our
keyboard both of these keyboards are
amazing I'm loving 60% keyboards once
you go 60% you don't go back so II
Carlos asks what is your favorite fast
food place well my favorite fast food
place has to be in and out if not in and
out I really left chick-fil-a so product
X OS G is this is a weird question but
what my do you use your voice sound suit
well before I was using a rode ntg-3
which is an amazing mic it's a little
bass II but it does give you that very
soothing sound to your voice right now I
just updated to the Sennheiser four one
six I sold off my rode ntg-3 because
this one was on sale during Black Friday
and you Holden s what is your personal
favorite portable bluetooth speaker and
what are your favorite headphones well
my favorite portable speakers one that
I'm giving you away the Bose micro
that's why I'm giving you away because I
think it's that amazing
there's bass there's clarity and yeah it
just can't be matched for the price my
favorite headphones are the LCD 2s from
Odyssey and my favorite earbuds are the
campfire atlas I'm gonna do a review on
the campfire Atlas very very soon but
these things are the best ear buds you
can buy they come in two costs are
expensive at $1,300
yikes I know but yeah they're amazing so
Duncan BS what are your favorite TV
shows PS - office well my favorite TV
shows are like power I love Game of
Thrones Game of Thrones probably like
hands-down one of my favorite TV shows
of all time I also love a lot of anime
like one piece in the route oh so I
chill ology has asked what is your
favorite tech piece you have reviewed
and I think it has to be the surface go
that machine is just unmatched by
anything on the market right now it's
amazing from top to bottom it's just my
favorite it's my favorite thing that
I've reviewed this year it was a tougher
view because it was my first laptop
tablet review and I was super nervous
about you know putting it out to you
guys but the response was great and yeah
it became one of my favorite things to
review so Jack Smith asks MJ or LeBron
MJ LeBron is amazing though I'm not a
LeBron hater
so xof asks have you ever had a moment
in life where you just look at what's in
front of you and feel so nostalgic like
the feeling you get when you look at
Christmas streetlights oh it's Christmas
already
so a time when I really get nostalgic is
when I go to concerts music really
brings me back to like when I was
listening to it for the first time and
that's one thing that I really love
about headphones and music and things
like that is that it transports you to a
time and place in your life or what you
were doing at that time
and I went to the jay-z concert and like
he was playing like Big Pimpin and all
these other songs and it just brought me
back to when I was younger and yeah
jay-z has to be one of my favorite
rappers of all time to rue us as do I
pay for all my own stuff well coming up
when I didn't have many subscribers you
know I had to pay for everything myself
and I looked at it as like an investment
into the channel I would often like sell
off things you know people would be like
battle this headphone versus this
headphone well I can't because I had to
sell it off to get these new headphones
so there's a struggle when you're like
just getting into YouTube of everything
has to be self-funded to get off the
ground but now recently a lot of more
companies are like reaching out to me or
I reach out to them and they see you
guys like responding very positively to
my videos which I can't be more thankful
for and they're down a sponsor the video
or send me out the product so thank you
guys my success is really tied to you
guys
Fabian Palacio as what's your workout
split I'm curious when I see fit people
in the tech gaming community and how did
you get into tech and fitness stuff well
I got into tech and fitness you know at
different times I'd always been in the
sports but I kind of dropped off when I
went to college I gained the college 15
the the 15 pounds where you gain when
you go to college you know you're off
doing your own thing I only knew how to
make like pizza and like chicken nuggets
and things like that so I got fat and
what I had to do is I was like you know
I got to a point where I'm like what
happened to me so I went I figured out
how to eat healthy I figured out work
out splits and I just did everything
from the ground up and it's led me to
where I am today
it's a lot of trial and error so never
give up on your fitness journey even if
you don't feel like going to the gym on
a certain day just go like most days I
don't feel like going after work but I'm
like you know what I'm gonna go have the
worst workout ever
just as long as you go nine times out of
ten I have a really good workouts even
when I do say that so how I got into
tech well I was always into video games
you know I had like a second Genesis
Nintendo had a Playstation I've had
every system known to man I was really
into gaming
so it just kind of translated over and
then I was always in the pcs I'm like
worse per minute so everything just kind
of tied together as well as like me
listening to music I was just sit in my
room singing with my headphones on with
my Walkman yeah so it it all has come
together into the
YouTube channel and it's kind of like
made me think back and look and be like
men all this time throughout my whole
life the signs were there that this is
what I should be doing and now I'm doing
it so Luke Richards ass Congrats man
huge milestone only been watching your
videos for a little while now and really
appreciate the quality of your videos
including the video quality and the
camera shot you use what is your biggest
influence in your overall shooting style
okay so the number one channel that I
watch and that I just love and I kind of
modeled myself after is Hart we're
Canucks they've helped me so much in my
journey like they really give back to
the tech community as far as like their
setups what they do for lighting and it
really helped me really up my quality a
lot and as far as what lenses they used
and all that so they definitely have
made a huge impact on my channel and the
shots that I get and like as far as like
framing and using the Third's they have
made a huge huge huge difference in my
quality of my videos that I make also of
course like mkbhd Jonathan Morris and I
like all these guys I watch all of their
stuff I don't really I try not to model
myself after somebody too much where I
lose my own style I think I just love
that vibrant color look and very like
bokeh these crazy low apertures and
things like that I really like that look
so you kind of just mix and match from
other creators and make it your own
style so Aaron Cohen asks when did you
fall in love with the shuffle and you're
talking about like EDM shuffling so I
dance and I do a lot of things outside
of like YouTube videos and I kind of put
that into some of my videos if you go
back to like the Sony review I put some
shuffling in there but I used to go to
like a lot of EDM xand raves and things
like that and I really loved dancing
I've always loved dancing all my life so
I was able to put that into like
shuffling and things like that so going
and like mastering something new I'm
mastering a new dance that's how I
really got into it and I love the music
I love cascade who was my favorite DJ so
that's really how I fell in love with it
so tell us what's your favorite monitor
well my favorite monitor is the one back
there it is the Alienware 34 I forget
the number
but it's an ultra-wide it's curved and
it has a 120 Hertz so it has the best of
everything I use it for content creation
for gaming it's just a beast you don't
need multiple monitors you just need
that one
monitor back there she also asked what
camera do you use to shoot your krispies
videos while I'm shooting on a7s2 with a
24 to 70 millimeter G master 2.8 lens I
also use a 55 one point a for those
bokeh shots and I also use a macro lens
that's 90 millimeters and 2.8 for those
like super close-up detailed shots so
quantum 9 asks what's your favorite
video that you've made and what about it
makes it your favorite I either like the
quality style the product you reviewed
etc so to answer this question I think
it is the sony here on 2 video that
video i got to show off like my dancing
as well as my video skills and
everything like the aerial b-roll
everything just went very very smoothly
and it turned out to be one of my
favorite videos of all time so the last
question of mine answer is from oni Appa

series yes I did so I love anything with
its own universe whether that's Marvel
Star Wars Harry Potter Game of Thrones I

like planet and like Star Wars I really
really enjoy that and like the Jedi's I
