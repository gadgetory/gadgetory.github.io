video because I do not want you guys
buying beats during this Black Friday
Cyber Monday sales that are going on I
know I know it can be very very tempting
when they take $150 off of the Beats
Studio threes and things like that today
I'm gonna be going over what I think are
some of the best deals that are worth
your money this Black Friday and Cyber
Monday
Black Friday can be somewhat random
sometimes so some of the headphones I
will be listing I want you guys to be
able to look out for
I'll also be finding and posting deals
on my Twitter so make sure you are
following me there at bt unplugged
usually this time of year Black Friday
Cyber Monday I use it to splurge on a
juicy set of overpriced headphones so
I'll be dropping a video on all my
pickups alright so let's get into it
the Sony's usually drop about $50 on
their headphones so I'm expecting to see
some of the same as Black Friday meaning
you can potentially get the 1000 X and
3's for $300 I've been seeing the 1,000
XM twos on sale but I would save the
extra pennies and just go with the 1000
X and threes on sale
another way to get everything here on
sale is through eBay they usually have
like 10 to 15% off coupons off the whole
site so you can just get your more
expensive headphones on there also from
Sony I've been seeing the CH 700 ends
now these are a top recommendation from
me and they're going for $99 at Best Buy
in a couple of other places if you guys
want to save money and you want
something that sounds as good as like a
$300 headphone and actually acts like a
dig a world-class noise cancellation
from Sony also a lot of people ask me
what's better the here on Tues or the CH
700 hands and quite honestly I tell
people whatever cost less because they
are very very similar alright guys so I
think the best deal of this video is the
qc25 at $115 which is an amazing price
if you don't care about Wireless and the
capabilities that come along with that
you just need headphones with noise
cancellation these are a perfect pickup
I believe Best Buy an amazon will also
have them at this price as well also the
QC 35 tubes are on sale for $2.99
Dell I think best buy and Amazon will
probably be matching this as well
stellar pickup you guys know it's one of
my favorite headphones for traveling so
if you're buying them for a traveler or
your traveler yourself you can't go
wrong with these man Bose is just coming
with the deals they also have the Bose
sound sport Wireless $4.99 at Best Buy
great price for these earbuds they are
actually one of my favorite workout
headphones of all time you can't go
wrong with them great battery life great
fit just all-around great workout set of
earbuds while we are on the topic of
workout earbuds also on cell is the
j-bird X threes they offer similar
performance to the X fours and can be
half or $70 less for 60 bucks at Best
Buy this holiday season it's a
no-brainer for me as their EQ and fit
options are just out of this world
one of the best workout headphones in
the game will have to just wait and see
if they actually drop the price of the X
fours I highly doubt it though because
they are so new okay so if I cannot stop
you from buying beats you say BT I'm
gonna do what I want to do I'm buying
beats I don't care what you say you
can't stop me well at least let me point
you in the right direction I think the
power B's 3 is at $89 at Target and Best
Buy are an amazing deal if you are
playing like very very strenuous sports
or you're doing Crossfit these things
just do not move whatsoever and have
amazing battery life at 12 hours you've
been warned but these are the only ones
the only beats products that haven't
broken on me and actually sound halfway
decent now if you're like me and you
want to splurge one of my favorite
brands is Odyssey and they have a sale
going on right now where you can get
like the LCD twos which are my daily
drivers for about 550 these are my
in-game headphones for home and I can't
imagine something sounding better to my
ears
we'll just have to wait and see as there
are many many more headphones to test
they also have the I sign tens and 20s
on sale I can recommend getting their
lightning cable version to get some of
that amazing EQ functionality for you
iPhone users out there and at only $160
I signed tens are some of the best
earbuds on the market they are wired but
that says a lot because these are really
The Dropper 65 T's will also be on sale
for $89 I mean I paid $190 for mine so
this is a great deal for those of you
who want a true Wireless experience
these earbuds were one of my favorites
this year and I would say that they're
one of the only companies that is up
there with Apple earpods right now they
have better sound and a better fit but
they are lacking in the battery
department but for $89 so you can't
really beat this now the air pots are
also on sale for one hundred and twenty
nine dollars in select places honestly
this is the price that they should be on
a regular day but you know Apple is
gonna do what Apple wants to do there
also have a sale $30 off at new egg as
well now the bear dynamic dt8 80s should
be going on sale I'm not sure where or
who will have them but I'm guessing that
Amazon will be and they will be a steal
they can actually compete with my
thousand dollar headphones at a tenth of
the cost so let's hope they make it a
twentieth of the costs on Black Friday
and Cyber Monday last but not least
there's another headphone that should be
on your radar and that is my prodigal
child the m50x BTS I'm not sure if these
will go on sale since they are so new
but let's hope because these are an
amazing set of cams all right guys so
those are the headphones that I really
think deserve your money this holiday
season for Black Friday and Cyber Monday
let me know if you guys want me to do a
video on like speakers or something like
that for Black Friday and Cyber Monday
if you guys have any more questions on
deals feel free to message me on this
video or on Twitter and I'll be sure to
get you the best deal possible
well what's in my control what I can
actually do I mean I can only point you
in the right direction but hey it's
better than nothing alright so don't
