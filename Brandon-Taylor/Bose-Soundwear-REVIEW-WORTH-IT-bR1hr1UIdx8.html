with another review today we're gonna be
looking at the boats sound where speaker
now I when I first saw this thing I
thought why would anybody want to wear a
speaker why wouldn't anybody just get a
set of bluetooth headphones or get a
Bluetooth speaker and just be done with
it I thought it was gonna be gimmicky
but on the contrary this thing is
amazing so let me tell you guys what I
think about this product because I think
this is an amazing new product so it's
simple enough there is a neck band
speaker it comes with a USB charger the
controls on the left side you'll find a
bluetooth pairing button and the power
button on the right side you're gonna
find the volume rocker and a press play
pause button skip tracks accept calls
etc on the right side now these buttons
are very easy to find so don't worry
you're not going to be lost trying to
look for the controls and things like
that these are easy to find they're easy
to press they're easy to get what you
need done now they have a cloth cover
around the actual neck band and when you
unzip it
there is a charging port for the USB and
also if you want to replace this you can
replace the cover two different colors
if you want to be trendy or fashionable
I don't really see a reason for that as
I mean unless you're walking around your
neighborhood I wouldn't be wearing these
out in public or to the gym or anything
like that but these are great for home
use
now the actual speakers are very very
good they shoot right up into your ears
right here it gives you a nice left and
right stereo surround sound very
immersive experience I like that the
bass rumbles during like rap songs and
jazz guitar strums feel great it gives
you a little bit of a rumbling on on
your neck and it's but it's not too
strong where you're gonna be like
choking or discomfort anything like that
trust me this thing is very very
comfortable I was really impressed by
the quality of the audiobook playback
with these because I listened to a lot
of audiobooks they also have a dial in
the actual app where you can
change how much presents you want the
presenters voice to have which is very
nice in the app you can also see the
battery life and connection to whatever
device and volume but that's about it I
would have liked to seen a EQ or
something in there both make it happen
you guys can do it but yeah coming back
to the sound these sound great with
everything they sound great with
classical rap jazz I was listening to
some folk music with these just to get
the full spectrum and I was not
disappointed there is very little
distortion with the neck band with the
speakers on either side which is really
really good I try to listen for that
speaker hiss and it's there slightly but
it's very very miniscule and only at the
very very high levels which you don't
really need high volume with these
speakers now you may be singing why do I
need a neck band speaker and what I like
about this is that it stays consistent
no matter where you are in comparison to
your phone or wherever you know if you
use a Bluetooth speaker a normal one you
might sit in a corner and then you may
might not get the same experience over
in the other side of the room as you
would with a neck band the neck man you
take it everywhere with you and it's
just consistent sound no matter what and
that's what I love about it you can even
lay down with these I love just laying
down listening to some great music and
they're good for you know being at home
alone they're good for those situations
where you don't want to be closed off
from the world maybe you need to hear
your outside surroundings like when
you're doing a walk or just around the
house you're home alone so it's a niche
product but it works so well that I
think that it's worth a shot there's
different things for different
situations and this is for a certain
situation in my opinion if you are a
person that is home alone a lot or you
live alone or you need to hear your
surroundings or anything that go with
this the battery life is also really
good it's coming in at 12 hours that's
enough for a half a day and the charge
is really fast as well 15 minutes of
charging will get you 3 hours of
playback which is really really nice so
all in all this has great sound
great comfort great design and also the
call quality is also great it has a mic
on here as well and it also vibrates
when you get calls so that's also a nice
touch so again if you don't want to have
that closed off experience from your
environment these are a great great
product to have so yeah wearable
speakers I mean I could be down for this
I'm liking this one so far I've been
using this a lot for cleaning or getting
things done around the house or making
these videos even I'll just wear this
and it gets me pumped and going when I
want to just get ideas and do these
videos so so far this is added great
value to my life and that's what I'm all
about is adding value and I think that
this can add value to your life as well
so definitely check it out if you are in
the market go to a bose store try it on
see that I'm not lying the sound is
great and I will see you guys in the
next video but don't forget to Like

video for more content like this alright
guys see you in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
