with another cooking episode today we
are making some healthy pizzas and today
I want to focus on finding healthy
substitutions for maybe foods that we
might go to that are easy so like pizza
something that we all crave who doesn't
like pizza seriously if you know them
tell them tell them to watch this video
and we're going to make them a believer
now anyways today we have a protein
pizza so this is a pizza you can heat up
at work and it'll still taste great you
can have it maybe half now half later a
quarter now a quarter later and kind of
plan out your meals and keep your
metabolism high so this pizza is all
around just a good option to get all
your micronutrients macronutrients in
and I really like this pizza when
cutting even so we're going to get into
how to make this thing already let's do
it so let's start off with what you're
going to need to cook all this you're
going to need six to eight ounces of
chicken whole wheat pita for the crust
pizza sauce or tomato sauce it's up to
you tomato sauce has a little less carbs
in it so it's a better option if you're
really trying to watch those calories
and your carb consumption and also
you're going to need some light
mozzarella cheese some mushrooms and
spinach now for the vegetables these are
what i like the mushrooms and spinach
but you can also pick up whatever
vegetables that you like whether that
onions jalapenos sardines i mean it's
really up to you what you like so that's
the beauty of this is you can kind of
make this pizza what you like not a one
size fits all you can fit it to your
liking and that's going to enable you to
want to eat it more often okay now with
all that being said we're going to move
in to the chicken prep now one big
seeker with chicken is you want to
hat your chicken dry I never used to do
this now we put the seasoning on it
would fall off and it the chicken
wouldn't have any flavor once I cooked
it because it was just melt off so Pat
your chicken dry this will keep the
seasoning on and it'll keep some of that
moisture in the chicken now I like to
slice my chicken instead of dicing it
because it gives it a little bit more
moisture to the chicken and it's not dry
so that's the reason why I like to do it
that way I like to then season my
chicken with Montreal chicken seasoning
now you don't have to use this seasoning
again you can use whatever seasoning
that you like whether that's just salt
and pepper no salt and pepper if you're
really watching your sodium consumption
it's really up to you what you want to
do with this pizza I like to cook this
in a skillet with olive oil or coconut
oil here I'm using some olive oil just
because it's what I had available either
way it works just fine so you want to
just cook it until the chicken is white
obviously you don't want to have that
pink chicken and get sick so don't blame
me if you don't cook your chicken
properly now after this I like to dice
up the chicken to make it a little bit
more easier to put it on the actual
pizza and you can fit more and kind of
maneuver it around the edges and things
like that from here is pretty much
self-explanatory you're just going to
lay out some cooking paper which I
really like because it allows you to get
the crust really crispy crispy AF and
just like a regular pizza would so it's
not all soggy is not feeling like a PITA
crest anymore now you can also just lay
it on the rack but I prefer it this way
just to keep the mess contained when you
put it into the actual oven now you're
going to lay the base the press the pita
bread on to the cooking sheet and then
you're going to add the pizza sauce base
or your tomato sauce tomato paste I
should say
and leave I like to leave a little bit
of room around the outside edges for
grabbing you know you don't want to have
messy hands while you're eating this
especially if you take this to work now
you're going to add on the cheese this
cheese doesn't have any carbs in it so
you can do what you like and it's really
low in fat as well which is really
really nice I really like this cheese
again you can use whatever cheese you
like depending on your macros or how
you're feeling that day if it's really a
cheat day you can do Mexican shredded
cheese whatever you like that's all so
amazing it's up to you next up you're
going to add the chicken to fill the
whole pizza and then after that you're
going to add spinach and the mushrooms
to the top of that and then if you want
you can add a little bit more cheese on
top or just leave it as is it's really
up to you and then you're going to want
to preheat the oven to 400 degrees now
once you get to 400 degrees then you
want to place the cooking sheet into
with the pizzas of course into the oven
on the middle rack and let it cook for
10 minutes then check on the pizza to
make sure that the crust is hard it's
not burnt you know like you don't want
that unless that's your thing it's
really up to you but I like to about 10
minutes is about the right time for me
you can leave it in there a little bit
longer if you like it that much more
crispy after that after it's all
beautiful and golden the cheese is all
melted and Louie and gooey and it just
looks like something you would see on TV
on the cookie network
it's beautiful then you can cut it into
four pieces now I do this because you
can take each slice and do what you want
with it so you can have half the pizza
now half later or if you want you can
have a quarter now a quarter in two
hours another quarter in another hour
just to keep your metabolism going so
you're not stuffing your face and this
is a really good strategy for weight
loss just to keep your metabolism
burning it's like a furnace as long as
you're feeding that fire it's gonna be
all good if you if you don't feed it
that fire is going to burn out or if you
feed it too much it's gonna go crazy
right so keep that furnace at a nice
level all day the macros for this pizza
drumroll please r 46 grams of protein 33
grams of carbs and 12 grams of fat can
you believe that can you believe that
and it tastes like the real thing this
is also great if you want to pack it up
for lunch for the next day you can bake
two pizzas for pizzas at once and just
leave it for the next day it's just as
good the next day I kid you not it's
crazy guys let me tell you the pizza
turned out amazing just so you know I'm
not kidding I ate it is eatable at least
you know that it's eatable anyways thank
you guys for watching I hope you guys
have learned something I hope you guys
will make the pizza let me know down in
the comments whether you made it or not
and how it tasted how you like it if you
added your own vegetables to it what you
like it's really up to you to play with
what you like and the things that you
like which is what's great about this
recipe is that we all have different
tastes and you can put that into the
pizza and it'll taste amazing no matter
what you put in there alright so just as
long as you're not putting like donuts
stuff like that on to the pizza you're
you're gonna be okay for your diet
alright guys so thank you very much for
watching I will see you guys in the next
