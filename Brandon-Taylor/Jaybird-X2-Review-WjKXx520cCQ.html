couple of days because as you know or
may or may not know my beads got ran
over in the street so I got to the gym
and I was like we're in my headphones I
thought I had them around my neck and I
get back to my girlfriend's house and
they're on the ground smashed somebody
ran over him I don't know if I ran them
over when I got into the car whatever
but I was in need for some new
headphones and that's what I got here
these bad boys right here I don't you
can see that the chamber x2's i'm at the
the ones xjx ones and i wasn't too
impressed with them and took them back
and got the power beats so this year
decided to get the X to the upgrade I
feel like they made them a little bit
lighter the battery life is amazing i'm
just going to tell you guys the non
fungal that scientific i'm just
going to tell you straight up from a
body builders perspective from person
that Jim's all the time six days a week
how these are and after using them for
about three days now they're perfect
they stand in the air they block out
noise if you use the little foam tips
i've been using silicone ones by use
them before and they kind of fell out
but but the fun ones are what you want
and the wings to keep it in your ear
I've never had them fall out and you see
this little X comes with these little
Clips right here and what it does is it
it just allows it to go around the back
your head so these things never move
they never get snagged on anything they
never like I never feel them on my neck
with the beats the court would hang down
and as soon as I will turn my head they
would kind of pull it a little bit with
these that's not exist i don't know if
you guys can see but it just it stays
like right on my head so I mean
literally if I move there's nowhere I
mean it's all my it's literally like
attached to my head and looks
and I really like that so yeah I use
them for a couple days the sound is
amazing and actually has salad stage so
which the beets didn't have the beats
were louder but at least have a good
salad stage and the sound overalls
better so what's going to happen is you
can hear in front of you back you hear
the different instruments with these
headphones which I really appreciate the
beasts were just loud which I appreciate
to you know when you're doing want to go
get hyped you know you try to hide
yourself up for a good set you know your
turn your music up loud and that's what
I like these the sound is just it's good
you could make out all the different
instruments the beats everything like
that and in that case I feel like it's a
little bit better it's personal
preference if you like louder I'm just
gonna be real if you guys go with the
beats but if you like good sound and
these get to a pretty good level I mean
I don't want to hurt your hearing anyway
so this might be a better bet and we'll
see what else i need to say about these
um yeah and they're just perfect for
working out they never cut out they
connect to the bluetooth which I haven't
said yet and I got this neon color it's
a as beautiful as you can see if I'm
kind of matchy today so it's kind of
cool you know gotta stay fresh to the
gym because if you look good you're
gonna do good um what else and the
battery life I mean the battery life is
where it really excels over the power
beats the park days I would have to
charge them after one use and I don't
know that's just because the the loudest
of the music that I had or what but I
had to charge them every day because
I've had a photographer they crapped out
on me right at the end of my second
workout with these you only have to
charge it once for maybe four days but
make sure you turn them off because they
don't turn off by themselves I hope you
guys have enjoyed this short little no
 approach review to the jaybird
x2's they're great for working out if
you lift
you know if your serious bodybuilder
definitely look into these over here the
beads give him a chance I got them on
sale for 130 I think they knew these
earrings about 180 which I mean I
probably wouldn't do wait till they go
on sale for 130 they're definitely worth
it or you know if you have the money
just go ahead and splurge I mean they're
worth it and you know if you're serious
about working out if you love music like
I do get my shot hope you guys have
enjoyed this and I will catch up with
you guys soon I'm just little update i
am going to be hopefully having more
videos out soon I haven't I'm sorry guys
I haven't had anybody to really fill me
working out and I don't want to keep
posting back workout so um I'm gonna try
to get something up for you guys very
soon I've been working out with
different people so I mean they should
be data record me so all right I'll
catch up with you guys later please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
