today I'm gonna be taking a look at the
j-bird freedom tools now I slammed them
last year for having the charging
battery dongle heavy remote and a shoddy
build quality and a lot of people said I
didn't know what I was talking about
until they went and bought them and they
returned to my review saying I was right
what do you know I hate to say I told
you so what you guys have to understand
is I actually love j-bird a lot I'm not
sponsored by j-bird I haven't got these
for free but the ex ones where my first
pair of wireless bluetooth headphones so
if anything I should be biased towards
them
but I can't lie to you guys if something
isn't worth buying I'm gonna tell you
guys
so did j-bird fix some of the nagging
issues in the tubes let's find out but
before we begin I want to tell you guys
I just started this new Instagram for
this channel which I'm going to be
posting a lot more on so follow me on
there and also subscribe to the channel
if you haven't already now that that's
out of the way let's see what's in the
box in the box you're gonna find three
sets of wings small medium and large the
USB cord a battery pack and the carrying
case the new wing slash tips are a huge
improvement over last year's silicone
they feel nice and flexible but sturdy
enough to keep them in your ear I do
wish they kind of had phone tips to kind
of keep the smaller sized earbuds in but
these do a decent job the tips aren't
one piece now which was a huge problem
with the ones as the fin would slide
down the smaller size earbud also this
year's version features a speed fit
which is pretty much like a built in X
fit which is really nice because I
always recommend people to use the X fit
and that is because it keeps the cord
off your neck and it creates less
friction on the back of your neck one
thing to be worried about is the over
here design while I feel like it is the
best fit it can short out your
headphones guys like with the freedom
ones which I don't have anymore because
they're broken they broke within the
first month that I got them I said this
in my first view and again people didn't
believe me until they bought them and
they tried them for themselves and they
find out that what I said was true
well this year they've lightened the
remote and the overall quality feels a
lot nicer the volume blends just feel
like clique year materials feel a lot
nicer
but speaking of buttons I like the style
of Jaybirds
where you hold down the plus or minus
volume buttons to go forward and back in
songs during your workout they stay
secure which is a plus I did have to
readjust them a couple of times so they
aren't as good as something like a beats
X but they get the job done I think
these are gonna be best for like bikers
or people that need to wear them under a
helmet these are probably worse for
runners because I still believe that
while they did decrease the size the
weight I do feel like they do still
bounce and they do come out for running
I will still going to j-bird X 3s or
maybe even the new j-bert free review
soon ok so let's talk about dongle gate
for a minute now you get four hours of
battery life on a single charge
ie about one or two workouts and another
four hours with the battery pack with
the battery pack on it doesn't seem as
bad as previous versions and it didn't
seem to make the earbuds fall out like
before but that being said I just don't
like custom dongles if you lose this you
can't listen to music for how long a
week two weeks three weeks what about
those people who this is gonna be their
only headphone this is it they're just
gonna be out of luck so we're still
would integrate any way to charge even
if it you don't have to have it on the
pack but just straight on to the
headphone on to the remote that would be
best
I don't know if that's gonna make the
the remote heavier I don't know jaybird
can we make this happen I think so okay
let's talk about the sound definitely an
improvement over the old freedoms I
would go as far as to say they sound
better than the jaybird X threes let's
just say that they are vibrant and full
of energy
even in their default flat profile they
sound great great separation for an
instrumentals giving you a 3d soundstage
I can't believe they put so much power
into these bad boys they're like a
little chihuahua just small
and tenacious j-bert is running the
wireless sound game with their app being
able to change the custom profiles which
is just amazing I always come back to
them now if we could just convince
j-bird to make a over ear headphone oh
my god that would be clutch do you guys
think would you buy it let me just tell
you everything from Keith Urban and
Rascal Flatts to little Aussie vert and
jay-z everything just sounds amazing on
these I took off the freedom twos I took
them off my head I held him in my hand
and they started rattling that's how
much bass these things have and you
wouldn't expect it in such a small
package but it's there and in case you
were wondering here are my settings for
the j-bird app increase based increase
missed just like I like it
simple overall I put these in my top
three might even be number one for sound
at least but we'll have to see now won't
we
hint hint before we move on though guys
I just want to say yes the volume does
get really loud and it's very satisfying
one thing that I do feel like is kind of
lacking is the isolation there's not
enough isolation for me for these
headphones I tried all the different
tips and it's just I wish there was a
phone tip to kind of keep these in place
more block out more sound and I think
they would have a great winner on their
hands so connectivity I am really
disappointed I've been getting breaking
ups everywhere it doesn't matter if I'm
by myself at home if I'm at the gym
everywhere and it just hasn't happened
once it's happened probably every like
10 minutes or so and I'm kind of baffled
about what's going on with these
headphones I mean even like the cheaper
budget headphones that I use don't break
up anymore but what's going on maybe I
got a bat copy I don't know what's going
on right now j-bird can you help me so a
battery life you get four hours with the
standalone and you get another four
hours with the battery pack keeping in
mind the size and giving them points for
lining the remote this is actually
really good in my opinion for what it's
worth it's nice to have your headphones
charging without being tethered to a
cord that being said how do the Apple
earpods
have five hours of battery-life and they
are small little things right small how
you cannot fit more than four hours into
this remote I don't get it
the call quality has improved guys I
will let you guys decide for yourselves
let me know down in the comments below
what you think hello guys I am talking
to you guys from the j-bird freedom twos
let me know down the comments below what
you guys think has a call quality so
that about wraps it up for the new Jaber
freedom twos so do I recommend these
earbuds I would have to say yes for most
people a definite yes for people who
bike and for people that are wearing
helmets on a day to day basis these are
gonna be great for runners guys not so
convinced I think you guys can go with
the j-bird X 3s or something else so
bounce from the cord from the remote
it's just it's still too much and
especially with a charging clip I mean I
found myself I ran out of battery at the
gym today and that never happens but at
least I had the clip with me but I could
also see myself losing the clip at the
gym it has its pros and cons it just
depends on whether you're willing to put
up with those cons to get the pros which
is like the amazing sound in these
headphones so I'll leave that up to you
guys for me personally what I buy them
again yeah I would for me I don't know
I'm probably gonna return these because
I think I got a bad copy with the
connectivity I don't know what's going
on hopefully it's just a fluke but we
will see maybe I will do an update video
on these so if you've gotten to this
point in the video and you're still here
hit that like button if you haven't
already and subscribe my goal this year
for the end of the year it's just to
build a community for you guys to come
chill talk be positive talk about things
you love talk about the headphones you
love or sound or music so knock
yourselves out in the comments I'm
always in there to with you guys so let
me know what you guys think down below
and I will see you guys
