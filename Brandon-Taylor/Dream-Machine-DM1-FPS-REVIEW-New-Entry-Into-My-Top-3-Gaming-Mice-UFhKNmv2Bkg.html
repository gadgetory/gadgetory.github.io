of these Pub because uh she's actually
kept - what's up guys sweetie here and
we are back I'm back from vacation from
Japan and I brought a little treat with
me the dream machine one FPS mouse now I
came across this mouse and the famous
Akihabara store - tsukumo that's how you
say it but I found it in there I put my
hands on it they actually had all the
mice out that you could like ever dream
of and then you just get to try each and
every single one of them I tried the
dream machine one FPS and this thing was
an absolute dream it fit my hand like a
glove so I left and I went home with it
but as you know try and get in store
that's one thing and actually bringing
it home and using it as another so today
I'm gonna be giving you guys my thoughts
on this mouse so if you guys don't know
dream machine is a European company that
specialises in eSports mice these are
geared towards the eSports professionals
out there by the way guys I actually did
some vlogging while I was in Japan when
I was visiting these text stores so if
you guys want to see a vlog let me know
down in the comments below and I will
edit it and I will put it out for you
guys to check out some of these crazy
tech stores in Japan so let's get this
out of the way right now because I know
this is the first thing people are gonna
ask the elephant in the room what is the
weight and the weight of this mouse is
83 grams which is around what I like
personally I like 80 gram mice anything
below that I feel like is negligible for
me I play the same anything above it
starts to get a little bit wishy-washy
for me personally they come in a couple
of different colors like black white red
and a black and white version as well
now the coating on this mouse is glossy
but it's matte but it's glossy heat and
sweat does not affect this mouse at all
you're not gonna sweat like you would on
davina s to Mouse or easy to be Mouse so
this mouse is ambidextrous in size it's
similar to the s2 but a little bit wider
on the sides and it's actually a little
bit more comfortable for me because I
don't have to like clinching my hands or
my fingers in to hold the mouse so it's
kind of nice it's kind of nice just
having to relax my hand when I was doing
claw grip so it's really really good for
those of you guys out there that liked a
relaxed claw or a relaxed palm the shape
of this Mouse really brings back
memories of like the SteelSeries sensei
and that classic shape so if you love
that Mouse you're gonna love this one
it's great for all of you claw grip
users out there like myself palm grip is
also good if you have smaller hands if
you have like bigger hands or medium
hands figurative grip is absolutely
amazing because they have these little
grooves on the side on the right where
your thumb would go and on the Left
where your pinky would go it allows for
amazing control when you are fingertip
gripping so for those of you guys out
there that our fingertip grip users this
mouse is a godsend the sides are nice
and matte it's not glossy so you get a
little bit more grip there the mouse one
and two feel also good let's do a click
test because we are back this is the
first video back so you know we got to
do the clip test oh yeah it's good to be
back now the mouse one in two buttons
are actually Kawano buttons and these
are some of the best on the market the
scroll wheel is also very nice it's
rigid but not too stiff it's great for
like browsing and gaming unlike some
other mice the side ones are good but I
feel like they could be better I'd say
they were just average they'll get the
job done if you want to like buying your
melee or like your push to talk to your
side buttons it'll work just fine the
DPI button is up top and I like it
because it's kind of hard to press I
don't know about you guys but I always
miss press my dpi button and mid-game
I'll be doing like ten thousands or
three I don't even know 3600 spins and
all this crazy stuff and like I'll be
wondering like what happened and it's my
dpi button so I really like that they
actually made it hard to press in but
it's not so hard that it
you know you guys get what I'm saying so
there's three feet on the bottom of the
mouse and they're pretty good they're
not hyper glad good but they're good
they also have something on here called
a shoelace cord and this thing is
amazing it's not as good as a paracord
but it is a really good for a stock
mouse cord so Logitech and all these
other companies with their braided cords
or whatever kind of cords they need to
take note that at least put one of these
shoelace cords on your mice if you're
not gonna put a paracord on there pretty
please don't make me back so another
thing is that the DPI button actually
changes colors so you can actually
customize these colors in the software
as well which is really cool I haven't
seen that on any other Mouse so if you
want your 400 to be red or blue or green
you could do that you can also have it
do other effects like breathing or just
keep it at static which is nice there's
also a way to change the polling rate
from a 1,000 to 500 to 250 and a hundred
twenty-five Hertz it's got an amazing
sensor on here it's got that Pixar 3389
and it is accurate as this is as good as
the hero sensor it goes up to 16,000 dpi
which is amazing the liftoff distance is
one point eight millimeters which is
super low and great for first-person
shooters so in game performance of this
mouse is super snappy guys you guys will
not be left wanting anything more it's
super precise and with that shape with
that amazing shape you'll be hitting
shots and you just pick up this mouse
and just go that is what I love about
this mouse you just pick it up start
gaming it didn't take me any time to
really adjust or get used to this mouse
I just picked it up and it was just
natural so if you guys are looking for a
mouse at ambidextrous Mouse you haven't
really found one maybe the s2 is a
little bit too small they asked one's a
little bit too big or you don't like the
glossy coating
I think the DM 1fps Mouse deserves to be
picked up especially for 55 euros that
is very competitive with today's market
I think that's roughly maybe around
sixty to sixty-five dollars of us and I
think that's perfectly in line with the
materials used on this Mouse you don't
have to
add a pair of cord to it you could just
use that shoelace cord and just be done
with it it's a plug-and-play Mouse and
you just go so will it enter my top
three that's to be seen we got a lot of
mice coming out guys this is only the
beginning this is gonna be a crazy
summer let me just tell you guys so many
things are coming out this is just a
start and this is definitely my top five
did it break my top three will see soon
alright guys so thank you guys for
watching let me know down below if you
want to see that japan vlog or if you're
thinking about picking up a DM 1fps it
has been your boy bt don't forget to
