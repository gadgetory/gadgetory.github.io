another motivational Monday today we're
going to be talking about fear and the
effect that it has in my life and how we
can beat it now fear can keep us from
attempting new things and stepping out
of our comfort zone because fear of
failure fear not being good enough fear
is lost so a lot of the times the fear
is just thinking that if we go out and
try something we're going to lose we're
going to not only fail at this but we're
going to also lose something at the same
time but we don't think about what we
have to gain so that's one step in
beating fear is to think about what
you're going to gain by doing certain
things that you want to do don't think
so much on the lost side because you
know there's a chance that you may lose
something there's a change may not but
oftentimes we over exaggerate what we're
going to lose as opposed to what we have
to gain now another kids that I have
with deal fear is and this is the i
think one thing that can change an old
perspective on fear what we think about
fear let's say I'm going to lose my job
you don't think about what comes after
what we would do after so just this one
fear a very bold general statement that
we take a real thick as fact and we
don't think about okay what would I do
next what I do after I lost my job what
would you do would you then go right
away update your resume put it up online
make it look all fancy and then get some
interviews with in that same week two
weeks months who knows maybe have some
savings to fall down maybe you can't go
out to eat all the time but for right
now you have money in the bank and you
can sustain yourself into
that next job so challenge yourself if
not and then once you once you go to
that next level you're going to see hey
look it's not that bad okay huh that's
it and then you're going to feel better
it's kind of soften that fear if I'm
going to be is harsh it's not going to
be as big and scary as you think it is
so whatever fear you have what is that
you want to approach a girl that say a
lot of you guys might want to be a
person growth so hmm there's going to be
fear of failure what if she rejects me
okay so if she rejected you then what
would you do would you like me over like
your mind makes you think or which is
just go on and live your life and forget
about it by the next day so then your
spare okay sure just to me okay now what
am I going to do it okay maybe I can go
talk to the other girl that's been
looking at me you can see on that works
done instead we let it sit there we you
won't approach that girl to God
opportunity lost right so think in terms
of what you have to gain but it's on the
other hand she likes you guess what you
just gained a new friend or love
interest whatever you guys want to do so
these have just been a couple examples
of how you can use this technique to
defeat clear and how to progression
relies so guys try this out this week
let me know how it goes in the comments
below and I will see you back in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
