with another review today we're gonna be
taking a look at the HS 70s buy Corsair
now these are a wireless 7.1 surround
sound headset for gaming and these
things have completely blown me away I
want to see today can these beat my game
zeros by Sennheiser because I've been
using those for months now they're
corded but as you know as all gaming
headsets have those long cords that go
to the back of your computer they get
tangled in your chair when you try to
get up and all types of problems so can
these fix that problem we will see today
but before we begin to forget to hit
that subscribe button for more content
like this upon putting on the HS 70s
onto my head and turning on some music
first and foremost the bass and the
clarity just jumps right out at you so I
knew that once I would take these into
game I would get that same performance
and that's what I got I got amazing
sound quality the separation between
your teammates and the actual game
sounds is very very nice very smooth
very separated so you will never miss an
important call they also include an
equaliser in their IQ software and this
thing works like magic so if you guys
aren't happy with the way they come out
of the box you can go into these
settings and change them and it's just
super easy so one thing I always forget
to do is charge my headphones and the
USB cord that they provide is so so good
it's long enough to whether you want to
put at your computer you can charge it
while you use it which is another nice
feature while we're on the topic these
last for 16 hours which is another plus
I mean you shouldn't be gaming for 16
hours plus anyways so once you take them
off just plug them in charge them and
they'll be ready for you the next time
you want to go the mic on these are also
really good I'm gonna drop a sound test
right about now check it out
better than like Astros or hyper exes
these things are the real deal so what'd
you guys think that's not like a robot I
think I sound pretty good and the
clarity on these is amazing so your
teammates will be able to hear you with
these headphones if that's a concern of
you another area where these really
impressed me was the range now you can
get up and do other things in your room
while you queue for a game which is also
very nice so you never really miss a
beat and when I would get up sometimes I
would almost swipe for a chord trying to
make sure it's all the way in my chair
and I realized you know what I don't
have to do that anymore it's nice just
to have these I can get up at any time
walk around go to the bathroom make sure
you turn off your discord though before
you go into the bathroom people don't
want to hear you taking a so with the
wireless I experienced no lag no
breakups these things are rock solid and
for $99 you cannot really complain the
build quality on these is also
exceptional as the band feels really
nice they feel very durable I like that
they are very sleek they're not really
trying too hard like some gaming
companies to make these look like gaming
headphones these look very sleek they
can be on your desk and add to your
setup now the leather and foam cups on
these the memory foam that they use is
so so nice I love it the mic is also
detachable so if you break one you can
get a replacement which is also very
nice they also have a volume control on
here which is solid they have a mic off
switch which is also very nice and also
they have a power button and on the top
of the headband they have this quilted
material which kind of reminds me of my
grandmother's quilts but it still works
very well it's very comfortable and I
have no complaints there the hinges seem
solid I do wish that there was kind of a
bigger size for people with bigger heads
but I think this should fit most people
all in all though these are an amazing
set of gaming headphones I have been
enjoying using them I've enjoyed the
freedom of not using that cord the
thumping bass the separation and these
sound as good as some of my $400
headphones so if you guys are in the
market for a gaming headset these are my
new favorites these are going to be my
daily drivers for when I overwatch I
thought gives award and all that good
stuff
so definitely go with these the HS 70s
check them out there by Corsair
exceptional headphone that's all I got
to say so I'm gonna leave it at that
thank you guys for watching so much it's
been your boy BT
