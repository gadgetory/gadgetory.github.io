with another review today I'm gonna be
taking a look at the highly anticipated
Bose sound sport Wireless free after the
disappointing jaybird run release can
these really be the savior of the
completely wireless workout headphone
realm find out today if these 250 dollar
earbuds are worth that hefty price tag
in this review but before we begin don't
forget to subscribe it really helps a
channel out and it helps me do more
giveaways content so for the comfort in
design in the box you will find three
sizes of the stay here plus tips a USB
cord charging case and the headphones
the stay here plus tips are the same as
the sounds for wireless so if you found
those to be unusable these won't be any
better for you me personally I find them
to be very comfortable and I forget that
they're even there most of the time
which enables me to enjoy music for
longer periods of time as well no
problems with them coming out over time
either with a lot of wireless earbuds
the cord just gets in the way especially
with the original Bose sound or Wireless
they tend to fall out because they were
tugging on your neck but remove that and
you have no problem these earbuds just
do not fall out the stay here plus tips
are just simply amazing
they don't go all the way into your ear
like other silicone tips but I find that
they create a good seal to keep most
outside noise out the case is big don't
get me wrong but it is pocketable and
it's still pretty hefty in comparison to
something like the air pause but hey
what can you do you have indicators on
the inside of the case to show when each
earbud is charging on the back of the
case you'll find the USB charging port
to charge the case as well these earbuds
are comfortable as hell but they do
stick out a lot like the regular bose
sounds
Wireless so that could get in the way if
you're using a helmet for biking or
doing a lot of exercises where you're
racing your hands over your head yeah
you see the problem one thing I do love
about these is they added the volume
controls as well as the press play pause
button whereas most companies they just
have a power button on and maybe if
you're lucky the pause play button they
are also sweat resistance for the
heaviest of sweaters out there Bose has
you covered so they say so overall for
the comfort and nobody does it better
than Bose I'm sorry they just always
come out with these amazingly quality
comfortable headphones all right so
let's move on to the sound the first
thing I will say is that these things
have some serious power behind them they
get really loud the loudest of any
completely wireless headphones out right
now I can leave the volume at about 50%
to 75% whereas other headphones I have
to crank that thing up to the max just
to get the same sound range truly
impressive the character of these
headphones is like all the other boats
fairly neutral but can get booming with
the right songs very full and vibrant I
found the bass to be lacking for EDM I
was left missing that little bit of
extra mm to song but overall songs with
extra bass tended to bring out the bass
and these headphones like songs from
egos or Gucci Mane these are amazing
jazz earbuds let me tell you probably my
favorite genre to listen to on these
headphones followed by classical rock on
these is just so-so it's still missing
that little bit off from the drums but
they still are pretty good all I know
I'm really digging the sound of these
headphones are very neutral but very
full sounding if that makes sense so
let's talk about the battery life five
hours seems to be like the upper echelon
of battery life right now for completely
wireless earbuds at the moment and these
things are right up there so excellent
battery life considering the amount of
power they have - yeah that's pretty
good
you also get an additional two full
charges from the case which gives you 15
hours of playback 15 minutes of charging
will give you another 45 minutes of
playback when you're in a jam which is
decent now the connectivity and this is
where I have to
think Bose this is where Jaber got it
wrong and Bose is killing it the
connection on these fries is rock-solid
even in crowded gyms these things are
solid there is however a slight delay
with videos but I am willing to
sacrifice that for completely wireless
earbuds Aztek is bitter I do believe
that this delay will go away but this is
a good starting point for this kind of
tech the app also lets you find your
earbuds if you ever lose them which is a
nice feature to have my recommendation
just put them away in your case put them
into your bag and be done with it don't
leave them out because that's just a
recipe for a disaster don't say I didn't
warn you so the call quality is a little
bit weird only one ear answers calls
which I find to be a little bit I'm on
the fence about especially when you have
both in it's a little weird to have one
with somebody's voice in it and the
other without so I wish they just added
where you can listen to people talk to
you on both earbuds overall voice
quality sounds are really good though
people could hear me better than most
completely wireless headphones except
for the air pots
those are in a whole nother League for
call quality in conclusion these earbuds
are amazing leave it to Bose to fix the
wrongs of the j-bird debacle and bring
quality to completely wireless earbuds
these are going to be great for weight
lifting running biking if you can fit
them underneath your helmet and just
everyday listening I love having another
great set of completely wireless earbuds
that I can take around other than the
air pots that I could just run around
town with without hearing the whole
world it blocks out way more sound so
that's very nice anyways guys thank you
