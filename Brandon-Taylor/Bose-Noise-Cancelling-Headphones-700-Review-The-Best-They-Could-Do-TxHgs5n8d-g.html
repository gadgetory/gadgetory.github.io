the review of the Bose noise
cancellation 700 headphones Bose finally
made changes to their noise cancellation
lion for the longest time since about
2014 they've been using that same kind
of model and same kind of look to their
headphones that the qc25 had when they
went up to the QC 35 they actually kept
the same shape and look of the
headphones and then they released the QC
35 2's with just Google assistant but
kept the same design so today they
finally came out with a new design on
their headphones a new minimalistic look
and also a hefty price tag to go with it
at $400 Oh Bose what are you doing baby
anyways guys we were gonna check out and
see if these Bose 700 headphones aren't
worth your hard-earned cash and look at
some of the differences and how they
stack up maybe against some sony 1000 X
and threes which I believe are the top
dogs at the moment so starting off with
what's in the box you'll get a storage
case the headphones a USBC cord and a
2.5 to 3.5 millimeter aux cord now this
is proprietary so if you're out and you
lose the core which I lost my QC 35 cord
you are just gonna be out of luck and
that kind of sucks I wish they went with
a 3.5 to 3.5 I mean why would you not I
mean it just kind of seems like the
obvious choice but let's go with a 2.5 I
don't know who makes that decision but
it was a poor one they've also upgraded
from a USB micro to a USB see now in
this new design so next up let's talk a
little bit about what's changed about
this new design now they've got a
different head band up top which I don't
like they usually use Alcantara which
was used in like Porsches and the
expensive yachts they put that on the
headband it was so comfortable it felt
great to the touch it actually felt like
you were getting a $350 pair of
headphones instead they put on a band
now right that is very similar to like
what you would find on a Beats Studio 3s
and we all know beats cuts corners when
it comes to cost so I think that they
cut corners when it came to this
headband
top and it's not as comfortable in my
opinion the band is flexible which is
nice I mean you're gonna just twist it
all around it's not gonna snap on you
which is nice so that's a cool thing
they also have these adjustments on the
side where you can move it up and down
and it kind of just stays in place
there's no clicking or anything like
that very smooth and it goes with that
new minimalistic design it really feels
like bows like they went down on their
quality which I don't get because Bose
has always been seen as that company
that was like the apple of headphones
right when it came to like build them
the materials that they used so it's
kind of out of character for them to do
something like this they've also changed
the button layout from that old system
to now they have three buttons on the
right ear clip you're going to have the
power button and voice control on the
left hand side you're gonna have a
preset for your noise cancellation from
like 0 5 and 10 they've also got a way
for you to control your music so swiping
left to right is for songs you can skip
tracks that way tapping on it will pause
to play the song and going up and down
will increase or decrease the volume now
let's talk about my biggest
disappointment with these headphones and
that is the comfort all right the bose
qc25 s from me took the cake when it
came to comfort and bose has always been
known for that no matter what they put
out the comfort was always their first
priority
now with these the clamping force is
there and I would get ear fatigue right
especially with a noise cancellation
headphone eye leaves were my favorite
the QC 35 s were my favorite headphones
for traveling when I would travel
overseas to like Hong Kong for 16 hours
I would forget that the QC 35 s were
even on my head they were great for
music listening for watching movies on
the plane just great all-around
headphones and they just felt amazing
with these after an hour maybe even 30
minutes my head starts to get fatigued I
want to like take them off I want to
rest my ears and it just doesn't feel
like Bose these don't feel like a bose
pair of headphones to me and the one
reason why I used the QC 35 s over the
Sony 1000x and 3 s was for the comfort
right for short distances the Sony's
were better for long plane rides the
bose qc25 s were better
so they kind of took away the one thing
that they did better than anybody else
and said here we're gonna raise the
price tack and take away all the comfort
aspects of the headphone which I don't
get the one place where the clamping
force does actually help is when you're
working out with them they're not gonna
fall off your head the noise
cancellation does feel better I like to
blast mine all the way to the top
setting of 10 I usually test these with
a fan in the background at full blast to
kind of emulate what a plane would sound
like in real time and it does a great
job of just eliminating everything
another thing that it did really well is
when I was snapping all right I couldn't
hear my snaps and usually with
headphones like the one that was in X
and threes and the old QC 35 I could
actually hear that
snapping so it's nice that they actually
improved on their already good noise
cancellation it blocks out voices so for
those of you guys who are working in
offices or at the gym this is gonna be a
great tool for you so that's one area
where I think they did actually make
these better the headphones now charged
with USB see they give you 20 hours of
battery life which is the same as the
old one I would have liked to have seen
them be competitive because Sony is
running their 1000 X and 3's at 24 plus
hours so I would have liked to see maybe
30 hours to really destroy Sony and be
competitive they also gave you quick
charging where 15 minutes will give you
3.5 hours of playback so if you're like
me and sometimes you forget to charge
your headphones these can be a lifesaver
so let's drop a sound test other
microphone right now Bose is known for
having some of the best quality mics in
their headphones so let's check it out
though so guys bTW here and we are doing
a test of the microphone on the Bose 700
series let me know what you guys think
down below I have a fan actually going
in the background to see if it's gonna
block out some of that noise so let me
know what your thoughts are down below
I'll leave it up to you guys as to
whether you think it's good enough for
you to use they're also running
Bluetooth 5.0 and I've never had an
issue with bluetooth headphones from
Bose so these are no different there's
been no break ups even in crowded areas
you've got a 33 foot range on these
which is nice I've got
just leave them in your gym bag or leave
them at the bench while you go pick up
weights or if you want to just have your
phone and the overhead bin I don't know
why you would do that but I don't know
it could work so let's talk about the
Bose music app now I had a ton of
problems with this thing I tried it on
my iPhone I couldn't get it to work or
really find my seven-hundred headphones
so that was disappointing so I moved
over to my pixel three it worked it's
kind of lacking in features like there's
no EQ or anything like that but you can
control the noise cancellation which is
nice but any time you make a change it
actually pauses your song briefly so I
didn't like that aspect of it and Bose
just let us affect the EQ you know if
you want to be competitive that's what
you got to do nowadays
so let's talk about the sound a little
bit not much has changed in my opinion
they sound very similar to the QC 35 so
if you're looking for a sound increase
here or sound buff or a better sounding
headphone yeah look elsewhere these
aren't gonna do it for you but if you
love the Bose sound signature I think it
is not offensive to anybody it does a
lot of things well works with every
genre you just show them to a friend it
might be like huh
okay these are nice you know they're not
gonna blow you away but no matter what
else listening to tame impala EDM rap
post Malone everything sounded great on
these headphones
it's not gonna be mind blowing like I
said but it'll do the job especially
when you are traveling and things like
that you can't bring your Sennheiser HD
800 SS on the road with you these are
gonna be a decent companion for travel
it's not gonna satisfy the audio files
out there it's not gonna be
groundbreaking but it does the trick
alright so my final thoughts on these
headphones is to save your money get the
bose qc25 they're more comfortable
they're about fifty two hundred dollars
cheaper and they sound roughly the same
the noise cancellation is only slightly
better here and I don't think that it's
worth that hundred dollars more in my
opinion they really missed the mark when
it came to comfort and they used cheaper
materials in my opinion as well so I
didn't like that it's it's a miss for me
you know it's a miss you know like
yeah it's it's a Miss I feel like they
could have done so much more in these
last five years than to just kind of
make this this isn't bosz thats not Bose
quality I'm sorry it's just not alright
so I hope you guys have enjoyed this
review thank you for your time thank you
for watching I appreciate every single
one of you guys join the discord if you
haven't already and I will see you in
the next one it has been your boy bt
