with another video today I have a great
budget set up for you guys it's coming
in at 20 dollars and I guess that's a
budget for this economy and for this day
and age that's kind of the budget range
but will hear me out this thing covers
everything I need is something that can
game I needed something that can listen
to music and movies I needed something
that could do it all in most gaming
headsets out there right now they can
only do one or two things really really
good so I was on the hunt for a real
good system that could just do
everything from what I edit it's not
gonna sound bloated when I watch movies
it's gonna have that Boeing bass when I
listen to music it's gonna have just
amazing vocals bass treble everything so
today I'm gonna share with you guys what
I found
but before beginning guys don't forget
to hit that subscribe button for more
content like this so let's start off
this audiophile budget system off with a
DAC amp the heart of any system now this
amplifies the signal from your computer
it turns the zeros and ones and to sound
in your headphones so you really need a
good one to get a clean audio signal
some of you guys out there may have it
just plug into your motherboard and well
it may sound okay sometimes that's not
enough to power your headphones this
deck amp features 600 ohms worth of
power and this thing can power most
headphones on the market today I even
tested my Odyssey LCD tubes which are
some of the hardest headphones to drive
and these drove them just find it
actually added a little bit more bass
compared to my Odyssey dexhart which is
designed for the LCD tooth so we have a
$75 amp that performs just as good as a
$700 amp and it has a little bit of bass
on the low end so it's amazing it's a
great value it has software that can
make your gaming surroundings more
spacious which is also really cool I
like that that you can like have an EQ
and there where you can up your bass and
things like that so it's a really great
value there's lots of plugins as well on
the front you have a headphone in a
microphone in as well as a dual
microphone itself on there so if you
just want to skip having a microphone
when you game and you don't care about
having the cleanest sound you can just
use the mic on the sound blaster itself
which is really cool on the back you'll
also find some RCA outs and the optical
out so there's a lot of different
options with this deck and I really love
this deck if you're running PC or Mac
it's all the same it works for both next
up let's talk about the headphones now
what I love about this setup is that
each one of these pieces really punches
above its weight class these necks
headphones can easily be $500 I mean
it's just insane the amount of sound
quality that these have I've tested them
versus my other fostex Odyssey my
Sennheiser's and these things are
amazing at seventy-five dollars and that
is the audio technica
AD 500 X's now what's great about these
is that they have this great headband up
top actually there isn't really a
headband there's just two kind of
plastic cords going across the top and
then I have two Pat's on either side to
pad your head I'm at first I was a
little bit skeptical of this design but
after getting used to it
this design is amazing it's actually
hard for me to go back to heavier
headphones like my Odyssey LCD - so
comfort with these is amazing these
cloth pads are huge the drivers and
these are huge so you get that huge
spatial awareness when you wear these
headphones and especially with the DAC
camp when you turn on that monitor mode
you can definitely hear enemies from far
away or where they are in special
awareness to you
I can literally wear these headphones
for ever because they are that good and
what I love about these is there are
very accurate for editing so one thing
that I noticed was like my coarser HS
70s is that they were very bloated on
the bass so when I would edit my voice I
wasn't getting the proper sound
necessary out of my computer with these
it's very very close to being accurate
and it doesn't sound too weird that's
the main thing that I want it I don't
want it to weird movie sound amazing
and there's actually great bass with
these and this is where the Omni really
pairs well with these headphones because
it brings up the bass and these
open-back headphones so open-back
headphones they will leak a lot of sound
keep in mind but they do a good job of
keeping that special awareness for
games and movies and then you got the
good editing as well so to test these
headphones I tested them on jay-z's
album 444 incredible the vocals are
super clear and don't forget about that
base where the Omni really helps these
open-back headphones come alive the
treble on every song just sounded
amazing these are a great all-around
ehrgeiz you will not be disappointed
I mean don't take my word for it test it
out $75 amazing okay so so far we spent
$150 so if you want to stop there you
can if you're happy with that if you
just want to listen to music there
movies and you're okay with the Omni you
can do that if not if you want to take
it up a notch you want a really good mic
go with the mod Mike from Antillean this
thing sounds crystal clear guys it is
incredible it's one of the best gaming
mics that I've ever used period on any
headset now a lot of headsets out there
gaming headsets which I don't really
understand I'm still trying to
understand to this day is why do they
suck so bad honestly
why do they suck I'm still trying to
figure that out but this mic the mod mic
this thing sounds great I'm gonna give
you guys a test I'm gonna stop talking
here's a test of the microphone alright
guys so here is a test of the microphone
let me know what you guys think down on
the comments below so what did you guys
think this thing in my opinion sounds
really really good right now I'm
recording it to my rode ntg3 up here and
you can kind of tell the difference
between the two mics this is a $700 mic
this one is a $50 mine but anyways how
you use this mic is you stick this
little metal piece on the side of your
headphones it could be any headphones
that's what's great about this and then
you can use these clips to clip each one
of the cords together so from the mic
and the headphones together and run it
to your computer so it stays nice and
tidy and you have an amazing mic simple
as that you get to use any headphones
that you want alright guys so that is
gonna do it for this gaming audiophile
setup if you whether you edit whether
you play games whether you watch movies
these headphones in this setup the DAC
eeeh
and the mic can do it all I'm telling
you guys try it out for yourself don't
believe me go out and try it yourself
if you really want to save money and you
want it to be really really budget go
with just a headphone and the DAC amp in
my opinion if not get the whole set you
won't regret it and it can possibly be
one of the last things that you buy for
your audio setup you can just be done
after this and honestly I'm really
really happy with this this is actually
my main setup at the moment so guys if
you want to save money don't a skip all
the gaming headset save all the trouble
because those just break down over time
they're not well made you can upgrade
the system as you go and that's the
beauty of it as well you can switch off
the headphones you can get a new mic and
your new dak camp whatever you like but
it's a great starting place if you want
just great audio all the way around
alright guys so thank you guys for
watching it has been your boy bt don't
forget to subscribe like and share if
you haven't already save your friend
some money and I will see you guys in
the next one in your boy bt saying peace
