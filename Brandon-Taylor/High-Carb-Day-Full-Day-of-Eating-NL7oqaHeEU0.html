it's be teeth and I decided to do a all
day full day of eating so right now know
if you can see it's kind of bright my
brightness is kind of up but I'm at ihop
so I'm going to take you guys with me
and show you my car both day this is
going to be a high carb day and I hit
him anywhere between 270 and 300 grams
of carbs I really my body really
responds to carp so i can't really
overdo it like some people go four or
five hundred so to 82-72 300 so what I'm
looking at so far sure you get past some
of my favorite you guys know I love
pistachios so I some salt and pepper
participa pistachios from trader joes
which are amazing highly recommended so
I'm gonna tell you guys in there let's
roll see you inside
yes
three sausage two egg Jasper three bacon
two pancakes
okay here the macaroons for magazine see
any programs come oh ok so in the last
clip we saw kind of went over and fat a
little bit um you know it's like but I'm
not too concerned about it because one
thing is I haven't worked out yet so
I'll be able to use to burn off lot of
that fat and he'll can I get a little
bit more colors so just looking on the
bright side of things like yeah went
over the amount that I really wanted to
hit but later on you can kind of make up
for it like I'm going to have chicken
which is low in fat I'm gonna have
cereal which is low in fat so just
keeping it low for the rest of the day
got most of my fat now before my workout
later on I'm going to move talk more
towards carbs and protein so all in all
all is well all is right in the world so
it's just kind of I just want to like
say that because I can know like a lot
of people maybe mess up in the beginning
of the day or like for me like
calculating it and it didn't come out to
what i thought i was going to come out
two things happen but you have to look
at the bright side work with what you
have I can't uh need the food all I can
do is work out more maybe add five more
minutes of cardio you know like it's not
that big of a deal honestly and today is
a high carb day anyways high calorie day
so more colors the better you know it
will shock the body it'll help me to
reset so looking on the bright side it's
not a big deal you know just in case
people or wandering or ask me in the
future like what yeah it's so much fat
we have fat now but I'm gonna show you
guys later what I'm going to have
and it's gonna all even out it's all
gonna make sense so anyways that's it
for now I'm gonna go back to work now
and after that hit the gym hard hard
hard I'm ready ready hard copy right
chest day Monday it's gonna be a good
day so I'm ready yeah so next time I see
you will be my next meal which is
probably going to be around five o'clock
as promised I'm back it just work out a
little frustrating because I couldn't
get any tricep machines so I had to kind
of make do and just you sometimes it
just doesn't work out the way you wanted
to work out but dimma best kept going
push myself so with that being said now
it's on to back on with the full day of
eating so about nine o'clock been
snacking on nuts before my workout as i
said i was going to do now i'm going to
show you guys what I'm gonna have right
now okay now we got three ounces of
watermelon two patties I'm gonna put the
macros right here um yeah just kind of
keeping it simple I mean I don't like to
go too crazy with bread or anything that
I still keep that out so i have two
patties here i'm just some mustard on
there and i have some hold up hold up
hold up ah flavor god garlic lovers on
there so with that being said I'll see
you guys in a little bit I'm gonna have
some cereal already have one Bowl which
I didn't catch I'm sorry guys so I had
one bowl of cookie crisps now I'm going
to have this and then later on I'm going
to have probably some pops cereal just
to pry pops and cookie crisps to try to
get up to 300 grams of carbs because I'm
pretty behind right now
I'm guessing I'm around earlier i was
around like 83 so probably right now i'm
at about 120 so I got some work to do so
let me get started on this and I'll
catch you guys later alright guys we got
60 grams of pops here I think that's
about was it fifty four grams of carbs
so can have that that's some 2% milk

struggling right now can't really you

not so yeah all right last bowl cereal

that to get me to my protein for the day
