the bose soundlink micro waterproof
Bluetooth speaker it's a mouthful its
bose a small but mighty speaker it's
affordably priced at $100 and obviously
after hearing that you might be thinking
Brandon that is not affordable at all uh
well to that I say yes it is it's
affordable by both standards alright so
leave me alone it comes in three
different colors black bright orange and
midnight which is the one I went with on
the speaker itself you'll find the
volume buttons and the play pause skip
track buttons the power button is up top
as well as the Bluetooth connection
button and while you're up there you'll
be able to see the battery indicator and
wait did I mention this thing is
waterproof ipx7 to be exact so let's try
it out alright I have a bowl of water
here we're gonna test out the speaker
and see if it plays afterwards okay
let's see I hope this thing is okay
after leave it in there for a little bit
okay
it's submerged okay and let's see if it
works still sounds the same
nice so if you're planning on taking
this thing to a pool or to the beach
you're gonna be a-ok if he gets pills on
it anything like that this thing is
gonna keep working there's also six
hours of rechargeable battery of this
thing I do wish that there was more
namely around about twice as much at 12
hours but six should be good for a day
at the beach or at the park it also
comes with a tear resistant silicone
strap that you can put on a bike or hang
up during a party so that everybody can
hear the music and it works really well
I like the how tight it is and how it
doesn't really hang and flop all over
the place it actually stays in the place
that you want to put it at the angle you
want as well I also love that it works
with your Amazon echoes your series your
Google assistants because as we all know
the Amazon echo products while they are
good they sound decent but they aren't
the best for music the sound that comes
out of the speaker is amazing to say the
least it has some of the best clarity
I've ever heard out of the standalone
Bluetooth speaker and it definitely
packs a punch for how small this thing
is all right so let me play something
for you guys so you guys can get kind of
an idea of what this thing sounds like
turning up a little bit me think it's
loud alright so I hope you guys can get
some sort of sense of what this sounds
like in real life from that I'm not sure
we'll see once I go into post so let's
go over a rundown of the pros and cons
of the speaker it has great colors great
sound stellar rugged and waterproof
design with all virtual assistants
working on every platform imaginable
what more could you want
cons though I think it does need more
battery bose come on I know you can do
it but otherwise guys I want to say that
this is probably one of the best
products that has come across my desk
and a long time I mean that this thing
has blown me away I just can't keep my
hands off of it it's that good alright
so a thank you guys for watching and if
you would be so kind to drop a like and
subscribe if you haven't already it
would be much appreciated it's been your
boy BT and I will see you guys in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
