with another review today we're gonna be
looking at the Trev z2 now Trev lab was
nice enough to send me out a pair of
these headphones which I've been testing
all week gladly might I add these things
are incredible and they come at a low
price of $70 so today I'm gonna get into
why I've been grabbing these for the gym
over every other headphone that i have
even sony's included these things are
the real deal now these are the first
pair of headphones over ear headphones
that a company has ever sent me in the
budget category so I didn't know what to
expect really I went in with the
skepticism to say the least a lot of the
times just back in the past when I used
to get the old school candies they
weren't that grade so I was really
excited to finally try out a pair of
over ear budget headphones and these if
budget headphones are sounding like this
then Bose Sony and all these other
companies are in trouble because at $70
these sound incredible the bass is
really really good and the volume is
amazing if you don't want to bring your
$300 pairs of Sony's to the gym bring
these and these are a great substitution
especially since my beats just died
I've been grabbing these every single
day for the gym the bass is good the
treble is good the mids are good there's
clarity all around there's the
incredible detail for this price point
and that's something that took me aback
so anyone that is hesitating on the
sound profile of these don't have to
worry you don't worry at all these
things are also very very comfortable
they stay out of your way they're very
lightweight the cups feel great the
leather doesn't get too hot all the
things you would need in a great gym
headphone or any headphone for any
reason the this just has everything one
area where I did feel like it could be
better is the clicking on the headband
now adjusting the headband did feel a
little bit you start to feel that $70
price point there as opposed to
something like a Sony WH one
XM twos which is just super smooth but I
noticed what these did really well is
they kept the adjustment that I chose
very well it's very sturdy whereas on
the Sony's and stuff like that it would
slip or in my head or not move around or
do things the band would adjust by
itself because it's so lacks the button
system on this thing works flawlessly
they have a place to charge it for your
USB they have an aux cord that you can
plug in as well which is very nice and
then they have a noise cancellation
switch now this noise cancellation is
not the best and at times I felt like it
got in the way of actually hearing my
music so I usually would turn it off so
they would produce a little bit of white
noise which would lead to a little bit
of sound aggression in my song so I
sometimes would turn it off when it
became too noticeable but for the most
part I was able to leave it on in the
gym either way these block out a ton of
noise and see on or not the battery life
is also incredible on these I was not
disappointed one thing that I did notice
is that when I would charge them in my
car I usually drive from work so I go
from work to the gym and that's usually
when I charge my headphones so I plugged
these in and usually by the time I get
to the gym with other headphones that
have quick charging usually I have about
50% 60% with these the battery was still
low and they have a little warning that
tells you that the battery is low so I
couldn't take these into the gym I think
one time which it was just too annoying
but for the most part it has 35 hours it
recharged them properly to a wall
instead of like a car charger then these
charged very fast and also to the last
long time 35 hours is ridiculous
especially for this price point
now the Bluetooth experience was also
amazing with these I never had dropped
calls or dropped my connection with my
phone ever I really enjoyed this and I
wasn't expecting that usually with
budget headphones that's the first thing
that happens your Bluetooth breaks down
when people come around with their beats
or their fancy Sony's or bows and you
got these budget ones on you get
breakups
one more thing that I do want to add
you know for the company to ask for my
opinion on the uses I wish the logo was
a little bit smaller they have the logo
here they have a Tribble app on here
they have Z - they have Tribble app
again on here so I really like
minimalistic branding on my headphones
just maybe a little trip lap symbol here
on the bottom you don't need it
everywhere else and I think people would
get the picture and that's something
that I really like and I think that
might turn people off from them again
these are amazing and I've looked past
the logo issue I've been using them
every single day but if I could design
these myself I would kind of just take
it down a notch on the logo stuff so
yeah overall for seventy dollars you
can't beat this these are amazing and
sometimes they always have deals on
Amazon I've seen this brand a lot they
have deals here and there so if you can
try to pick up a pair if you want
something you already have Sony's or you
already have Bo's or something like that
you just want a pair that you can just
abuse take to the gym it's sturdy
the connection is great the volume is
great there's bass the clarity is there
these have everything that you could
possibly want in a gym headphone so
definitely check them out again the Trib
lab z2z tubes yeah alright guys so I
hope you guys have enjoyed this review

headphones and I'll be sure to answer
