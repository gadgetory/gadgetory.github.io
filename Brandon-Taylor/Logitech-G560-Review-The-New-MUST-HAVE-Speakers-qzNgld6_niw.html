with another review now I know a lot of
you guys out there have been asking me
for more speaker setups you know you
don't want to be listening to headphones
all the time so I decided to pick up
logitech's newest speakers these things
are a bass lovers dream let me just tell
you that I was blown away by these 240
watt speakers so if you're a bass lover
stay tuned let's get into this review
these are amazing so for the setup you
just plug in the right and left speaker
into the subwoofer which then sits on
the ground now this subwoofer is
straight-up amazing and this is where
all the bass comes from now the
subwoofer points to the ground that's
right so you're gonna get a lot of
rumbling a lot of shaking during movies
or gaming or even just music listening I
mean these things just Rumble the heck
out of your house it's insane guys so if
you live in an apartment building these
might not be the best for you because
your neighbors are gonna be complaining
so on the right and left speaker you're
gonna find RGB lighting now this is
Logitech's like sync technology and this
takes different portions of your screen
and it makes the colors show up on the
speakers so that's kind of cool I mean
you can kind of see and visualize in
game with what's going on outside of the
game around you I don't really use that
too much I really like to just stay with
the breathing or I actually like the
audio visualizer which just pops and
changes color depending on the music or
what I'm doing in game and it's nice
because if you have a lot of Logitech
products you can actually have your
whole system be flashing different
colors and at the same time and it just
looks very beautiful now on the right
speaker you can actually control the
volume which I really like and you can
also cycle through the different color
modes whether that's breathing or
visualize you're in things like that
they look very modern I like the inside
where the lights are on the RGB and I
also have a little RGB light on the back
as well which shoots out onto the wall
so you got get a full range of lighting
with these I do wish that the subwoofer
did light up that would be kind of cool
just to have like your whole setup just
be lighting up and at your ground at
your feet now another thing that I
really really like about these speakers
is that they can connect through
Bluetooth as well not just USB not just
by aux 3.5 millimeter jack but by
bluetooth is so if you don't hook up a
phone an iPad a MacBook you can do that
and cycle through it with ease which I
really really love so it just gives you
a ton of flexibility it gives your
system a ton of flexibility these things
at $200 are just amazing it is an insta
buy for me especially if you're a bass
lover and you love like rap in raw even
rock even like classical music sounds
good on these and in the actual Logitech
software you can change the EQ which you
know I'm a big fan of you can change the
lighting and things like that so all in
all these are just an amazing pair of
headphones that I think most people if
you have a set up if you're looking for
a great set of speakers even just for
movie watching to gaming to music it
just nails everything and you can kind
of make it what you want with the
equalizer as well now this does have
Dolby Digital but I found it to be like
just okay doesn't really enhance the
sound so much where it just makes it
that much more mind-blowing but I did
like that it gives a little bit more of
a 3d sound with those I feel like it's
kind of bloated and it's very software
oriented so you're not gonna get the
full Dolby Digital experience like you
would if you had separate speakers like
a 7 speaker setup but for a desktop
setup you cannot go wrong with this 3
speaker setup these are amazing so guys
if you're in the market for some
multimedia speakers for your desktop for
your laptop or your phone check these
out because they are really really good
and they're gonna be
a staple and my setup from now on
alright guys so that is gonna do it for
this review I hope you guys have enjoyed
this review let me know down below if
you guys are planning on getting some
speakers anytime soon or if you have
been eyeing these already or if you plan
on getting them let me know down below

you in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
