his waist man ridiculous menustration
man guys I've been slacking on my vlogs
I mean it's been about two weeks and I
haven't posted a new one now I've
recorded stuff but I would forget to
keep recording throughout the day so I
stopped very strong and then towards the
end of the day it will just dip and I
didn't feel like it was a good vlog I
didn't feel like it was the best I can
do today I'm gonna challenge myself and
we're going to have a good blog so with
that being said we are starting the day
my new iphone 7 comes tomorrow I don't
really need it I don't really want it
but I have the jump program so why not
why not I get it cuz either way I'm
gonna be losing money so at least this
way makes it the jump a little bit worth
it even though Apple didn't really put
out anything that crazy so yeah we are
gonna head to the apple store to get a
iphone case now go get some abeles
favorite treats and then you know what I
need to meal prep I need to meal prep so
we will go get some food for meal
prepping I'll take you guys with me
through all this stuff you ready guys
I'm also going to be taking back this
wallet as well just didn't work out for
me I don't know something about it just
alike so I'm just gonna keep my wallet
loving this fall weather it's very it's
cold but it's warm I love it I love love
love autumn winter maybe it was because
i was born in winter I don't know but
that is just my preference I like it
more than summer I don't like being hot
and uncomfortable and sweaty while going
to the beach is fun can't go every day
what color should I game tonight so they
didn't have the color I wanted the cocoa
but this one's actually pretty nice this
blue ocean sea color so I went with this
and I fixed my sayings I thought my
camera was broken for a second but the
last pieces of footage might be a little
dark but I think I got it fixed so with
that being said this is the case that I
got this iphone 7 plus case silicone so
now that's done we're going to head over
to petco get bellows some new treats and
then I'm going to head to Trader Joe's
and get some food for the week call it a
day
also this parking lot is insane
look at this I can't even back out right
now this is crazy I came too early
usually I come around six o'clock so
this is just all bad right now people
are just blocking me and the lake next
to me into this parking lot anyways I'm
gonna go down to IT down the street and
then I'm gonna head over to Petco and
that'll be that t is now my favorite
place on earth forget about this and
then people I t that is the new happiest
place on earth i chi green tea has boba
lai chi jelly like tea green tea amazing
