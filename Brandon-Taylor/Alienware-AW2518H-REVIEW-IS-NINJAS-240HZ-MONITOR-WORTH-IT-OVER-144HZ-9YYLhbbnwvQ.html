review of the Alienware aw 25 18 H full
HD monitor now what's so special about
this 25 inch teen monitor is not that it
has a 1 millisecond response time nor is
it the fact that it comes with g-sync or
freesync nor is it the fact that ninja
uses it but that it has a native refresh
rate of 240 Hertz and a 16 by 9 aspect
ratio now this is my first 240 Hertz
monitor my monitor before this was
actually an Acer predator 27-inch 165
Hertz for reference so I wanted to
really test this and see if it's worth
using over some of the other options on
the market and if I can actually tell if
there's a difference so today guys I'm
gonna be letting you guys know what I
found when it comes to this beast of a
monitor and to see whether it's worth
that $500 price tag now in the box
you're gonna find a display cable a USB
3.0 upstream cable and a power cable as
well as the monitor and the monitor
stand now in the past I've used
Alienware monitors and all of them have
this in common this ugly big monitor
stand that just spans your desk taking
up so much space alien where I didn't
need a whole alien spaceship on my desk
it does have a slot where you can run
your cables up the back but if you're
using like a large or excel pad or a
extended mouse pad like I have on my
desk right here it actually gets in the
way I definitely recommend getting and
monitor arm for this monitor especially
if you don't have that deep of a desk
like I do it the stand will allow you to
actually turn the monitor left and right
and up and down and also turn it around
into portrait mode but what I didn't
like is if you want to move this monitor
closer to you obviously those little
feet or stands or whatever are gonna get
in the way of you gaming so kind of
defeats the purpose you're putting out
this amazing game
monitor yet you have something that
won't get in the way of gaming Alienware
what are you doing
as for the ports on the monitor you're
gonna have a display 1.2 and audio out a
headphone jack up front and you're gonna
have four USB 3.0 it's two of which are
right up front underneath the Alienware
logo on the front of the monitor it's
also got one upstream USB 3.0 port on
the back and what upstream does do or it
allows for is for your monitor to
actually act like a USB hub so you can
connect whatever you want transfer data
use a mouse whatever floats your boat
outside of that this monitor has
amazingly small bezels around the edge
which I absolutely love and it's got RGB
on the backside of the monitor that can
be customized which is actually pretty
cool the menus have the usual suspects
such as brightness and contrast with
different gaming presets I'll leave
everything at normal I leave the
response hyman normal because we started
to move up to like that fast and super
fast it really messes with the image and
the monitor becomes too unstable in my
opinion now this monitor is ATM panel so
you're gonna get the best viewing angles
when you're looking at this thing
straight on it's got 160 to 170 degrees
for the viewing angles and I found them
to be not bad but it's a TN panel it's
not gonna be like a VA or IPS so for
most people this won't be a problem
because you're gonna be looking at this
monitor straight on so yeah you don't
have to worry about that because this is
a gamer focused monitor yeah I don't see
you like going down or going to the left
or having this angle you should have it
straight on and having that 240 Hertz of
goodness straight in your face
it's got contrast ratios of 1,000 to one
which is decent for a team panel it also
has 400 nits of brightness and a
resolution of 1920 by 1080 I do have to
say that this is one of my favorite TN
panels that I've ever used because of
the colors the blacks don't look washed
out or faded like some other panels that
I've used in the past it almost has that
IPS feel to it but not quite overall
though I must say that the picture
quality on this is actually really good
I might be eating my words in a little
bit when I try some of the other 240
Hertz monitors but for now this panel
has blown me away and it's picture
quality is actually pretty good I've
actually done some color grading on my
with this monitor and I think the colors
turned out pretty great it's also great
when you want to watch movies or you
know you wanna watch some of BT's
YouTube videos
shameless plug I must say though I do
miss having 1440p as it makes everything
just looked a little bit more sharper
but this monitor is really focused
towards the eSports professionals out
there and people that really take gaming
seriously and don't really care about
sharpness they just want to have that
performance
now this monitor does have G sync and
that smooths out and eliminates tearing
if you've ever used the G sync monitor
before you know that it is night and day
when you're using one that doesn't have
it so let's move on to the million
dollar question can I tell the
difference between 144 Hertz and 240
Hertz and I think I've come up with the
best description on the difference you
know going from like a 60 Hertz to 144
Hertz monitor your eyes will see a
significant difference it'll look overly
smooth and it's a whole new world when
you go from like a hundred forty-four
Hertz to 240 Hertz your eyes are less of
a factor and it becomes more of a
feeling when you're playing you'll have
more frames to work with per second so
when there is actually in a game let's
say you drop from 240 FPS to 200 FPS
it's going to affect your gameplay less
and if you are using a 144 Hertz panel
where you have 144 FPS and dropped 280
FPS during an intense battle that's when
you actually definitely see a difference
in overall smoothness and it can't
affect your gameplay and shots causing
you to be less consistent overall in
apex personally I would get stuttering
when my FPS would drop below 100 FPS you
know in the shots but not anymore I
found that I've become way more
consistent in my shots since getting
this monitor and that's just facts for
reference I am using a 1080 Ti and
you'll want to use at least a 1070 to
get the most out of this monitor my
tracking in overwatch has become God Tyr
instantly and I hadn't played that game
in months
okay well I'm still trashed but still my
eyes enjoyed every second and I couldn't
believe my eyes at how well I was
tracking targets it was just simply
amazing it's like you can see exactly
where your opponents are with no input
causing you to be more accurate and more
consistent in game if you are playing
competitively or you're just a
competitive person like myself this
monitor is definitely worth looking at
going up from a 240 Hertz monitor from
144 Hertz monitor you won't really
notice a difference but once you get
used to the 240 Hertz
you'll definitely feel it when you move
back down and refresh rate personally I
think most people will be perfectly fine
with 144 Hertz monitor but if you are in
the market for a new monitor and want
the best of the best experience with
little to no impact I really think this
monitor is worth looking at just don't
expect to be blown away but instead look
to feel the difference and see your
consistency as a whole go up as a whole
I can't say my accuracy did go up once I
got adjusted to this monitor
even in Kovacs so alright guys I will
see you guys in the next video thank you
guys for watching for all your support
thank you for liking sharing and
commenting I will see you in the next
one it has been your boy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
