series that I'm starting called well
building my new PC with the last episode
being a setup tour that you guys have
all been asking for so make sure you are
subscribed to catch the entire series
I'm gonna try to explain PC building
from my perspective and give you guys
some insight as to why I chose the parts
that I chose and hopefully give you guys
some ideas for your own building as well
this has been a long time coming as my
PC is now four years old and it served
me well but I needed something a little
bit faster for my new video adding raw
files that are just killing my PC right
now
now that PC that's been in the back of
my videos for the longest time now which
was custom built by me like four years
ago could have easily lasted me another
two years if I was just gaming but video
editing has just been kicking its butt
lately this video was sponsored by Oris
i went to them with the idea because so
many of you guys were asking me where to
start when it comes to PC building or
you're either on console and you want to
get into PC but you don't want to spend
like two thousand dollars for a prebuilt
computers so I want to make this as easy
as possible and simplify the process as
much as possible without overloading you
with information to start I would head
over to PC part picker as you can add
all of your parts to a list and it
checks the compatibility for you and it
adds up your pricing so it makes
everything super simple another thing
that I do is I'll go to the forums and
check for similar builds with a budget
and for my needs so if I'm doing a
gaming rig and my budget is $800 I can
go search for a topic on that and they
somebody will most likely have a list
already made for you and from there you
get a good baseline and then you can
tweak and add to their build as you see
fit and then you have your PC links to
everything will be in the description so
if you guys want to build my exact PC if
you want to have that bt pc you can go
in the description and everything will
be there for you okay so starting off
with the processor I went with the Intel
I 999
k-8 cord 3.6 gigahertz processor that's
capable of turbo charging up to 5
gigahertz now Intel is personally my
favorite CPU maker call me an Intel
shill but they've always been solid and
reliable for me AMD is another great
processor manufacturer as well
especially when you're on a budget
another reason why I chose Intel over
AMD is for the quick sink capabilities
which is huge when I'm encoding and
decoding my footage in Premiere Pro I
personally like to go big on the
processor and video card and then build
around those two things and then having
a good CPU cooler is key the one I'm
using here is gonna be the Auris a TC
800 which has a copper direct pipe which
dissipates the CPU heat there's also
some water-cooled options as well out
there that I've used in the past from
Corsair it just comes down to your needs
and what you are comfortable with
usually your CPU cooler will come with
some thermal paste but I always like to
get my own and the brand I've always
gone with is the Arctic MX for your
motherboard is the heart and soul of
your build and one place where you do
not want to skimp out on trust me on
that
the stability of your system really
really depends on it I cannot stress
that enough
now gigabyte aurora's has always been in
the discussion for making some of the
most stable boards on the market the one
I'm using here is gonna be the z3 90
Master it's got built-in Wi-Fi which I'm
a big fan of it's got a ton of USB ports
including a USB see which is key for me
with all the peripherals that I test
it's got dual and two connectors which
is awesome because that can reduce
clutter from having some big drives in
your system it accepts ddr4 Ram which
goes up to four thousand two hundred
sixty-six megahertz
it's got a 2x copper PCB which provides
lower temperatures better overclocking
better power efficiency and lower
impedance over like a 1x that normally
you would see on most motherboards also
when picking out a motherboard you want
to make sure that the chipset matches
your motherboard to the processor that
you are buying in this case I'm using
the LGA 1151 chipset alright so I get so
many questions about video cards and
which one you should go with now me
personally I've always gone with
Nvidia's is because they've solid they
work with everything my video program
uses the
of course for rendering in my old PC I'm
rocking the 1080 by Nvidia from gigabyte
actually and the video card that I went
with this time was the 28 er T X and
that contains Nvidia's newest technology
which is that ray tracing technology
which provides realistic lighting by
stimulating the physical behavior of
light to put it simply this is gonna
make your games look that much prettier
and if you guys couldn't tell already
I'm a fiend for aesthetics so I'm
excited to see the benefits of RT X as
more and more games are taking advantage
of this technology and I'm gonna let you
guys know if I can actually tell the
difference but from what most people
were saying there is a slight increase
in visual so I'm excited to look and see
it for myself alright so there are many
types of hard drives out there from the
thick disk drives those thick boys you
got the solid-state drives which are a
little bit smaller well a lot smaller
and then you got the envy and ease which
use PCIe ports rm2 ports the hard drive
I'm using is the RS RGB a IC nvme SSD
one terabyte it's got Reis beats up to
30 480 and write speeds up to 30 80
megabytes per second I usually put
Windows OS and games on SSD and then I
use the bigger standard drives those
thick boys for storing files the RAM or
random access memory that I went with is
the four sticks of our srgb ram at 3200
megahertz
ram is another place where i've run into
a lot of issues in the past and it can
really make or break your system so guys
I cannot stress this enough do not skimp
out on the RAM it will crash your system
like none others spend a little extra to
get that reputable brand it's not worth
the headache please believe me the
amount of RAM that you need really
depends on your usages I run a lot of
random pendant programs so I'm one with
32 gigs of ram I think that around 16
gigabytes is a good middle ground though
if you want to be safe alright so
there's nothing sexy about a power
supply so it's easy for people to skimp
out on it but I've had people and
friends skimp out on this only to have
their system constantly reset on them
and they're wondering what's the problem
and this is another part of the process
that's really easy to go cheap on
trust me I know but spend the extra $10
or so to get a good one the one that I
went with was the 80 gold RSP 850w now
PC part picker is great for picking a
power supply and knowing how much
wattage you need because it'll show you
how much power your system will take to
power it I like to go a little bit over
my knee to power just so I have some
overhead just in case and if I want to
like upgrade in the future I have that
leeway there the case that I'm using is
the Auris C 300 glass case I love being
able to see inside my PC so I've always
had glass sides on my cases if you
didn't tell I love it I love RGB the
main thing to look for when buying a
case especially when it has a glass side
is how easy it is to route your cables
to your motherboard without it looking
like a mess and this one has a lot of
openings for that you also want some
good air flow which is key and
ventilation and this one checks off all
the boxes for me so yeah I'm gonna be
using this case alright guys so that's
gonna do it for my parts this I just
want to share some of my thoughts on the
process of picking parts for a PC I hope
that I was able to share some new
insight for you I know there's a lot of
build videos and part painting videos
out there and I just want to do
something that I could share some of my
knowledge that I've learned over the
years so coming up in the next video in
the series I'll be walking through my
build process step by step to help you
guys out hopefully it makes sense we're
gonna go through this together if the PC
doesn't turn on if it doesn't boot we'll
go through it together and troubleshoot
it together alright so thank you guys
for watching it has been your boy BT
don't forget to Like share comment and
subscribe and I will see you in the next
video okay
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
