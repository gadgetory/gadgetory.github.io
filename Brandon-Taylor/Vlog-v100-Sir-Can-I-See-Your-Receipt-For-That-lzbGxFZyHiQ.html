out again and it fit so and I the thing
is like I literally had it to donate and
it was in the bag and I was like I had a
second change of heart and it worked out
because I've been wearing this like all
summer so
sometimes it's good to keep your clothes
but sometimes good to get rid of stuff
like if you know you're not going to
wear it don't keep it and why would you
do that there's no reason this shirt was
almost what's the saying was never
