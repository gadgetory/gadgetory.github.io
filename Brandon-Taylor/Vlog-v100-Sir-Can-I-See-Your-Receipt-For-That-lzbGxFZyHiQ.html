it's Saturday as you see I'm not in my
normal Carmen my dad's car because my
car is in the shop my check engine light
has been on for a while and I went on
vacation and I just got put off and
today I'm finally dealing with it so
that's going to taken care of i'm
currently on my way to the gym as you
can see funny story about this shirt or
this cut off from nike i was actually
going to throw this away this is
actually an old old combat shirt but i
was like mmm it's summer let's try it
out again and it fit so and I the thing
is like I literally had it to donate and
it was in the bag and I was like I had a
second change of heart and it worked out
because I've been wearing this like all
summer so
sometimes it's good to keep your clothes
but sometimes good to get rid of stuff
like if you know you're not going to
wear it don't keep it and why would you
do that there's no reason this shirt was
almost what's the saying was never
almost was never it was a shirt wasn't
gonna be here I'll think of the same
later alright guys I'll see you guys in
a little bit i'm gonna go train arms now
each the reason when i do abs nowadays
my one of my abs cramps up and it hurts
like hell and i have to stop doing app
so i'm gonna have like one ripped app
and like my pictures and videos now so
just so you guys know my middle right
app is going to be ripped as fuck and
the rest are going to be playing
my camera came all the way back just to
take you guys with me
you

stolen we finally found one on how long
did that take it's like 25 minutes but
we had to pay back east because last
time he made me wait so so easy for
watching this I don't want to hear it
when we see your heart like right here
behind a car waiting and somebody gets
into the car
and you have to back up is it the person
behind you thought or is it your spot

small world just ran into one of my old
coworkers I was at his job he was a
manager I was at his job for her about
three months before the shutdown it was
a start-up so it's cool seeing old
people take both not old people did you

really like last-minute decision to give
bella she turned out to be a great dog
and I just thought this week I'm like
I'm so lucky that we got it was like
meant to be and couldn't imagine not
having having her so that's its roots a
weird feeling like I almost kind of
chickened out almost like hell maybe we
shouldn't get a dog or maybe you know I
can't handle it but now she's here like
