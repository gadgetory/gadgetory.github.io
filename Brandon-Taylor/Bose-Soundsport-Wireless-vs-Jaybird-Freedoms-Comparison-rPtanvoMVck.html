have a dogfight between the two Titans
the new Bose sound support wireless and
the j-bird freedoms this is going to be
a battle to the death who do you think
won
who do you a pause a video player you
think one down in the comments below
tell me if your right now let's begin
alright now I've done an extensive
extensive extensive tests on these for
the past two weeks I've taken both to
the gym I put one to my pocket listen to
one taken one off
put another one back on and at the gym I
mean people probably thought I look
crazy but you know I wanted to do kind
of like a comprehensive comparison for
you guys so you guys can make the the
best decision decision because you know
it's a lot of money to spend and you
know we're not all Balaji we can't have
both I mean that's just how it goes so I
want you guys to get the best bang for
your buck all right now let's start off
with the comfort now each one isn't
perfect but I'm gonna have to give the
this round to the Bose the Comfort on
these is just amazing these sitting they
sit on the outside part of partner this
is that they sit on the outside of your
ear right they don't go into your ear
canal so sit up outside of your ear and
I give just enough seal to give good
bass all right so you get a really good
bass response with these it was its very
booming alright we'll get to that later
in the sound in the sound comparison but
what I noticed is with the j-bert and I
used the over here because these you see
how small they are so you would think
that these wouldn't hurt your ears but
after a while Matt my ears were getting
fatigued which means like I had to like
take him out for a little bit or you
know I had to readjust them multiple
times so I go with this style I go over
the ear alright
and this is the style that I found to be
best with these with the comply tips you
don't have to use the wings or anything
but this is where the problem comes in
it's a different style these go into
your ear ear canal right in it you roll
it and then it expands into your ear so
you're going to be getting a more
isolation with these but but there's
going to be less comfort so if if
Comfort isn't an issue you don't care
really
then go with these but what I found is
here's looking here's a point I found is
when you have these in your ear right
for sports so you have them punched into
your ear what happens when we work out
we start right and you know you can when
you do that your job will be up and down
it affects your ear canal right and it
begins to shimmy this out of your ear so
over time these became loose so that's
not good if you're cycling or if you you
know you're going up and down and you're
going like that and you have to readjust
them push them back in constantly and
that's what I found I don't I constantly
had to push these back in and it was a
pain you know it really it really took
away from my workout like you said you
know in the game the workout you know
you're trying to get adjusted that's
fine when you have headphones but after
a while like you just want to work out
you just want to like be in the zone you
want to you know be doing burpees you
want to be jumping up doing planks and
all this and you know and what are you
doing all that and when you're reading
bouncing up and down you're like that
these are going to start to come out I
don't care I don't care what anybody
says like if they're gonna have to
reposition these no matter what I'm
telling you you cannot go through a
whole workout without readjusting these
it's not going to happen I'm going to
tell you that right now it's not
happening in a such because I want to
like these so much the sound is
good alright now that that round the
comfort goes to the boughs for sure
now those stay here tips they are just
it's like a gel material and it just
sits into here and here's another tip
when you get these push them don't just
sit them outside your ear kind of push
them in a little bit and that will give
you a seal all right you're going to get
a lot more base and you're going to get
a lot more isolation before when I first
got them I was kind of like sitting
there and it would kind of I think got a
lot of ambient noise from the outside
world and it wasn't as pleasurable and
as an expert as pleasurable experience
for me so when I did that it made a huge
difference so do that if you have the
boast do that try it just push it a
little bit more towards the front of
your face that makes sense all right
now let's let's talk about the sound now
like I was saying next up this next
category I'm going to tell you the
benefits of both and you can kind of
choose which one you like best
now these have more of a flat sounding
more accurate sounding sound to them
they're they're not very the highs
aren't very high the lows aren't very
low the the mids aren't really you know
higher low you know it's all it's flat
it's flat you know what I mean and it's
a it's a flat sounding headphone and
they kind of combat it that by putting
in the app the my sound app where you
can change your EQ and turns change I
should change the firmware so you can go
to any program and it will change but
I'm going to tell you why this is kind
of a pain why this kind of backfires
it's because when you do that listen I
change it to my EDM setting right and
then I go and some rock or rap comes on
now I have to go and stop my workout go
into the app and change it to
that other setting that's good for that
for that genre alright now that takes
time and that takes effort and it takes
a little bit for the this software to
change to actually change the EQ on the
headphones alright so when it's just
taking time out of your workout alright
so not only what these are you
readjusting you have to readjust the EQ
and we'll get to the rest later but I'm
just going to say that's two things with
this now with these I'll say these have
a really nice base the best way I can
explain it is it's booming the base on
these is booming it like like not
vibrate so much that you know if you
vibrating you have it in here it's going
to like make you feel weird these have a
very like booming loud full sounding
bass when you kind of push them in like
I said and I really enjoyed these when I
I was like I said I was wearing these
back to back in the gym so wear these no
were these these these listening half
the songs rest of the half of these and
what I found is the base on these is
better in the loudness even with the EQ
if I turn the bass all the way up on the
EQ it still cannot compete with this and
even then it kind of distorted now with
these the soundstage so you can hear in
half soundstage so you can hear it
fronting and back you in the middle
alright these have a little less
soundstage but you can hear all the
instruments you can hear everything but
this one is just it's really nice like
if you're going to be movie watching or
you enjoy like classical music it might
be this one might be for you but this
one it had beau says they have like a
active EQ and it's so like data just to
the music so you know I've been
listening like Frank Sinatra
Drake you know anything Tiesto I was
into it all so and this changed with
each with each genre that I listened to
no that's one less thing I have to worry
about one less thing that I have to
worry about in the gym whereas this one
I have to change the EQ you know like
it's more work you know you sometimes
you just want to set it and forget it
you know the infomercial you just want
to set these in your ear
and you want to forget it all right so a
sound I prefer these so if you like bass
if you like nice and full sounding rich
if they're very clear alright these are
clear but when you start messing with
the EQ you start it starts getting a
little distorted I started hearing a
little hissing noise so it kind of
distorts but I will say when you do use
the silicon tips you do get a get better
bass response the problem is the silicon
tips do not stay in your ear and they're
hard to get a seal I'll tell you that
right now next up we're going to talk
about battery life battery how can we
forget battery life now let me start by
saying that battery life is important so
what I will say is today I start off
100% at the gym
I left 70% when I was wearing these I
would leave the gym and it would be at
20 to 30% I would say all right now it
has the charging clip alright it has the
charger clip but I will say that even
though it has a charging clip it gets so
heavy these already I'm telling you
these already want to move out of here
and I wanted to give it the benefit of
the doubt because this is pretty light
the remote is pretty light but after a
while after bouncing up and down but you
know when you're cycling and you're
going side to side you know you can
already see the the remote is swaying
right
this is just going to keep on until it
wedges out of your ear and I constantly
felt like I had to readjust or
reposition them you know and I felt like
at any moment they would just pop out
you know judging by the times and
whatever and listen to them on loud so
usually when coming you say oh eight
hours of battery-life lunch
you start getting higher in volume or
you have more bass or whatever that
number increases not so the case with
these I feel like it almost increased so
great job beause I really like that and
on these you know the the Charter clip
just it's not practical and I almost
lost the charging clip already and I was
freaking out I was looking all over my
bag I was looking all over my car and I
was just thinking like if I lost this no
more music no more what would I do
email them and like have to pay more for
for proprietary charging clip I don't
think so
so I don't want a day after day have to
worry about where's my charging clip is
are these charged all the way because
they can't last in the gym that takes me
80% in the gym for two hours do I want
to keep every day looking around for my
charging clip like making sure that
that's charged making sure that these
are charged in time for my workout now
I'm not saying that it's not a problem
have four hour battery life but what I'm
saying is at least let me charge charge
this straight up I don't want to have to
do with the clip they shouldn't just put
the had a charging port on this as well
that would just saw I think that's one
thing that a lot of people had a problem
with and I can see why I have a problem
with it and I almost lost the charging
clips said which one neatest thing I
kept drumroll please I kept the bows and
I am happy with these I'm very very
happy
like I said at first I almost wanted to
give these away because the isolation
but honestly they isolate just as much
as these with the composite in the gym
in a loud gym and I really found I kept
coming back to the base and I kept
missing the base when I was usually when
I was wearing the j-bird I was missing
the base from these and it just kept
drawing me back so I am going to keep be
keeping the bows and I will be seeing
the Jaybirds back I hope this has helped
you guys thank you guys for all the
positivity in the my last videos and I
hope that you guys will be able to make
a very informed decision because of this
so thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
