another review today we're gonna be
taking a look at the hype machine that
is the Microsoft Surface go I don't know
if you guys have seen but my timeline my
subscription box has been exploding with
Microsoft go review so I decided to
check it out and see what all the hype
was about so today I'm gonna tell you
guys what I found what I like about the
surface go what I don't like about it
and who I think it's for but before I
begin guys don't forget to hit that
subscribe button for more content like
this okay so as I have been traveling
more as you guys know I have been
wanting more of a lighter device that
can bring along and I have been actually
thinking about getting an iPad pro or an
iPad but I just never pulled the trigger
so when the Microsoft Surface go came
out I was like you know what this might
be a good opportunity to check out a
hybrid between a tablet and a laptop
because there's a lot of things that you
can't do with the iPad I mean there's
some sites that you can't even go to if
you don't have a proper OS system so
these are productivity machines first
and foremost these are great for emails
great for writing great for students and
things like that don't expect to be
gaming on this I know I've seen videos
when people are gaming some like that
but let me tell you guys this thing can
barely run YouTube without lagging a
little bit so it really makes me
skeptical about what kind of games you
can even run maybe low low setting games
but this not what you buy a surface go
for so there are two models you can go
if there's a $400 kind of budget option
and there's a 550 model which is the
better option in my opinion because you
get an SSD in there you get more space
and you get more RAM everyday processing
power it will be better overall now
these don't come with the keyboard but I
think the keyboard is essential because
it just makes all the difference I mean
you can type on the screen but I've
never been one for doing that I think
it's kind of gimmicky in a way I'd
rather have a physical keyboard if I'm
gonna have and type on like a
or a left hop now the keyboard is a
little bit on the small side and it does
take a little bit time to get used to
but after you do get used to it it is a
pleasure to use really was scared of the
trackpad as well I mean coming from like
something like a MacBook where they have
all these crazy gestures and it just
makes going through the OS super clean
super fast I was worried about that
first and foremost and it was not a
problem the trackpad on this thing is
great you can swipe to send all your
apps out you can swipe left and right on
webpages which is also nice so there's a
lot a lot of functionality with the
trackpad and this thing is an additional
$99 on top of what you're already paying
but I think it's well worth the price so
I know about you guys but when I browse
I have multiple tabs open and this thing
tends to struggle in that regard and
that was one thing that really took me
aback when I first started up the
machine I had used the family members
iPad before and the experience was very
smooth that animations are very smooth
but I feel like using this device the
surface go it was actually kind of
choppy in some areas even like
minimizing and maximizing YouTube videos
actually lagged and I feel like as
somebody as an as a consumer like you
guys I would want my device to be fast
right out of the box so that hypetrain
it really came to a screeching halt and
I was like wait a minute what is going
on with this device I thought
everybody's raving about it it's this
great device they love it and I thought
to myself as people being paid what is
going on here
so I updated my machine and everything
was great after that it ran a little bit
smoother there is a little bit of
choppiness here and there so they have
something out here called Windows s mode
and that pretty much puts in like a hat
mode kind of like a phone like an iPhone
and like an Android kind of thing where
you have to get things from the app
store but I didn't like it you can
switch this off but it actually takes
you updating your surface go to actually
be able to get that functionality so
after all this after that experience I
was wondering why are people
recommending the surface go so I said
you know what I'm not gonna pass
judgment on it I'm gonna carry it around
with me for a few days and see how it
goes and to my surprise
I actually love this thing as well
giving all its quirks and everything
like that
this thing is gold its money and I
believe is due to the form factor the
keyboard acts as like a case like a
protector to predict the screen so
everything just feels very nice like you
can take it around to a coffee shop I've
taken it to work and it's so discreet
like I can email I can email you guys
respond to comments and things like that
on the go I just hook up my phone to a
hotspot to this thing and it just works
really really well I find myself getting
more work done because I can bring this
thing in more places than not whereas
like sometimes you don't need all that
power from like a MacBook Pro or a Dell
XPS you know you just need something to
get the job done and have something we
can type things out and things like that
you don't wanna be on your phone because
sometimes your thumbs get tired and
things like that so you need that kind
of hybrid to kind of bridge the gap and
that's what this thing does a fish set
niche in between like a phone and a
tablet and a computer which I really
really enjoyed the bezels did take a
little bit of time to get used to as
they are pretty big but after a while
they disappear because you know you're
just focusing on your work you're
focusing on your content and it kind of
gets out of the way but at first if
you're coming from something like a
MacBook or a Dell SPS you're like what
in the world is going on the webcam is
dope as well it has a five megapixel
front facing camera that is 1080p HD and
it has an 8 megapixel rear facing
autofocus camera with 1080p as well both
are really really good in my opinion and
as you guys have seen them probably
everybody else's reviews these things
look great they look better than like
mac books or JL SPSS and things like
that so the fact that they were able to
put that kind of webcam on this device
really really speaks to what they were
trying to do and what they are trying to
push the market to which is like an
affordable tablet hybrid thing
can do it all now the speakers are just
okay I mean they get the job done I mean
what more can you expect from a device
like this and the last thing I want to
touch on that I really like is that it
has a USB C port and you can plug in
like a monitor you can plug in SD cards
you could plug in other devices like a
mouse and things like that and I really
really enjoyed that that's something
that the iPad cannot do so that Hybrid
is really really bridges the gap between
computer and iPad another thing I want
to talk about is the stand the stand is
also so nice you can put this on your
lap I like that it doesn't move no
matter what position you want to put the
stand in it is super solid whether
that's on a table whether that's on your
lap every single place like I have not
had it move or slide down on me
whatsoever so amazing build quality on
this device so at the end of the day I
think this device is worth checking out
because it bridges that gap it does a
lot of things really well you know it's
not the most powerful machine in the
world but you get it for what it's
supposed to be for which is productivity
getting work done on the go so pick one
of these up I don't think you guys will
regret it but do keep in mind you need
to update you need to turn off the S
mode and everything like that to get the
full functionality of that hybrid tablet
laptop thingamajiggy so yeah excellent
device I'll see you guys in the next one
that's Benny boy beep t don't forget to
subscribe like and share on this video
I'll see you in the next one
we've
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
