don't know if I promised this but I
think I promise that I will show you
what my pre-workout is so without
further ado I know I said I would talk
about this product right that was a very
video pleasing like but this is carnage
in and this uses is a carnitine a couple
of different forms of carnitine to
change your fat into energy and I really
felt like this is working so I put two
scoops of this fucking five in the scoop
the windows real quick one this is a
little baby spoon but to all right so
got water remember I was going to have a
gallon of water today so making sure
so I did a 14 ounces of water in there
what else do we need boom see 450x love
this stuff let's get all dusty in here
scoop it at
then one last thing we have a h2 this is
a pump intensifier team of all so we're
going to do one scoop of that and this
is just to keep my pump increased
strength focus in zone zone in focus so
has a couple different things in here
and i really like it especially like
when I'm cutting and you know you're
losing all your you're not having as
many carbs so you're not as pumped so
like this is a good way to keep your
pump in the gym and not be looking like
shit you know you diet you want to look
good you want to you know why you work
out you know you want to like how that
motivation you know you have that
success in the gym and you see it you're
going to want to continue it so I was
trying to motivate me seee like plumper
field filled the consequence of your
product for that probably only product
i've tried for this so i have all this
i'm going to drink this
I'm gonna drink this and I'm hitting
shoulders today so definitely need that
pump I like that pump and we'll just see
for I feel like it's always consistent
I've always found c4 to be consistent
I've tried to switch other pre workouts
and I keep coming back to it because
other ones just kind of died off or I
don't get that same feeling as c4 and
ce4 is always consistent like I always
feel a little something other other
companies like I tried it just it
wouldn't work it would work me one or
two times and that was it you know and
what's the point you have 30 40 servings
you're stuck so check out the 50x check
out the Hema bowl check out the carnage
in by evil Djinn stuff works from what I
could tell I'll let you I mean I'll let
you guys see pictures soon enough but
yeah i'm gonna kick my workout and kill
it my last shoulder day so I really got
to focus get my mind right before i head
in there and do the damn thing more
videos coming soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
