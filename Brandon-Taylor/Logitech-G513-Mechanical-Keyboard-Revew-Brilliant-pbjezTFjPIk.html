again with another review today we're
going to be taking a dive into the
mechanical keyboard world and we're
gonna be checking out the latest and
greatest from Logitech the Logitech G
five one three tactile keyboard now this
thing is amazing so let's just get right
into this review and guys before I
forget don't forget to subscribe for
more content like this because there's
gonna be a lot more coming very very
soon so immediately taking this keyboard
out of the box I noticed that nice
brushed aluminum look that I just love
it's just brilliant guys it just looks
so great on any desktop with any setup
it just looks amazing on top of that
you're getting some RGB keys in there
and they also give you a couple of extra
keys that have like indentations in it
if that's what you like me I just stick
with the default ones so one thing that
I like about this keyboard is that it
has a USB connector on the back and this
thing is fully functional so you can
plug in your phone you can plug in
another Mouse you can plug in anything
you want and have full functionality
through your computer almost like having
another USB port so that is just
something that I haven't seen before or
at least that I have an experience so
that was a nice breath of fresh air now
this is a full keyboard it does have a
numpad which is a little bit weird for
me now after not having one I kind of
have to spread out my arms a little bit
to kind of get to my keyboard and my
mouse but that's just a minor
inconvenience and something that I've
gotten used to over the last week of
using this keyboard now another great
thing about this keyboard and another
selling point for some people is that
this thing comes with an amazing wrist
pad this thing has a memory foam in it
it's almost like a leather material I
don't think it really is genuine leather
but it feels a very nice touch the only
complaint that I have about the wrist
rest is that it gets a little bit hot
after a while compared to like some of
the plastic
counterparts that you may see with other
key bullets so sometimes when it gets
too hot I just take off the wrist rest
and put it to the side but the thing is
very solid it doesn't attach to the
actual keyboard like some of the plastic
ones do and I've had those in the past
and they break but it's so heavy and the
wrist pad feels so nice and premium that
it stays in place it doesn't move around
on your desk so that was something that
I was kind of worried about with it not
connecting to the extra keyboard but I
haven't had any problems with it at all
so how is it for gaming I think this
keyboard is an amazing keyboard for
gaming the switches on these things or
Romero G tactiles
are great it's almost like a cherry red
and mechs going down and then a cherry
Brown coming up it gives you a little
nice tactile like feedback on the way
back up and it just lets you know that
you press the button I have the Leopold
cherry red MX and that thing is just so
soft that it's like pillows it's like
pressing air and sometimes you don't
know whether you're hitting the keys or
if you actually accentuate it if it
registered and it's nice kind of moving
to this Romero de tactile switch that
kind of let you know whether you press
it or not so that is something if that's
something you're looking for this is
exactly it and it gives it to you
without causing a lot of strain on your
wrist it doesn't make you tired from
typing on it like some of the other
Cherry MX s that I've tried in the past
oh yeah and did I mention sync has RGB
which can be controlled through your
computer that's always nice you can do
like breathing modes you can do a audio
visualizer mode which kind of flares up
when sound happens yeah is there's all
type of stuff depending on what you like
I usually just go with the wave the
general wave and you can control the
speed of that and everything so it's
very very nice
so all in all this thing is coming in at
$150 which is pretty steep for a
keyboard but the brushed aluminum on it
the wrist pad with the memory foam which
I feel like a lot of the price is coming
from that the keys feel amazing you get
the extra USB port on the back for
plugging in whatever you want and get
full functionality out of it sometimes
guys is
the little things in life and this is
one of those times and this keyboard has
got me with the little things and it
does the little things really really
well alright guys so if you guys have
been looking for a keyboard check this
one out if you already know of a better
keyboard or what keyboard you're using
