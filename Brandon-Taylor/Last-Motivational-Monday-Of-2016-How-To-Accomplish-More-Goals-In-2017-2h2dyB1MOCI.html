with another motivational Monday today
I'm going to talk to you guys about goal
setting you know it's a new year new
year new me you see all these different
memes on people's Instagram Facebook
whatever we say we look at them and we
say yeah right because we know for
ourselves you know not always do we stay
with our certain goals at the beginning
of the year to the end of the year but
that's okay I've done a lot of research
and this past year I made a lot of
different changes in my life and I've
actually progressed a lot in this past
year so I'm going to share with you guys
what I did to kind of accelerate the
process for myself and what worked for
me now you guys can take some of these
things see if they work for you but you
know it's better than nothing right now
one thing that you want to do is write
it down there's something about riding
it down that just feels really official
don't writing in your phone right here
on the take out a piece of paper write
it down it could be some scratch paper
or whatever write it down look over the
list and then you know what you can do
you can toss that list and i want to
tell you why because most people i see
they write down their list they post up
on the wall and that's that and that's
fine but what I like to do is I like to
write it down I don't even look at that
piece of paper again I pretty much just
throw it away because as the year goes
on your goals are going to be changing
they're going to be going to morph into
something more specific they're going to
morph and take it on different shapes
and sizes so you can't just say one list
at the beginning of the year when I
haven't done anything that I need to do
exactly this in the end it may be some
form of that but it may change you know
my goal for next year is a hundred
thousand subscribers it's a big goal and
your goals have to be big if you're not
thinking in
terms of a big picture you need to be
thinking larger than life because even
if you don't hit that goal then you know
what you may fall a little bit below and
then what you I get eighty thousand
subscribers I get 50 I get 20 that's
still great right and then what I like
to do once I write down my goals is I
like to visualize I like to think and
sit down and picture myself having these
100,000 subscribers and how I'm
interacting with them what kind of vibe
I'm going to be getting off what kind of
videos I want to be putting out what
kind of quality i'm going to have I
think about all these different things
it's not just all I want to have a
hundred thousand subscribers that would
be nice no I'm looking in detail I'm
thinking about what kind of person i do
need to be what kind of person do i need
to be for you guys to have a hundred
thousand subscribers right so visualize
sit distraction-free no music to sit
even maybe even take a walk take a walk
and think about your goals visualize
them the next is is using your
subconscious mind to help you out for
your advantage all day we have this
self-doubt knocking herself down and
then it gets ingrained a termite oh I'm
not good enough I'm not this I'm not
that they're this and it gets we're
sending all these messages to our
subconscious mind it doesn't
discriminate it'll take anything and
then we say it enough time so we start
believing it we think oh this is a
common thing I keep hearing it it must
be true so use that to your advantage
keep like I say you can throw away that
paper but write it down again write it
down again revisit them rewrite it out
you know let it morph into something and
write it in a new way every single time
and then your subconscious mind will
start to soak that in and absorb it and
start believing and then you're going to
be picking up steam and then you're
going to accomplish your goals and
you're gonna be back okay then what's
next right so it's a it's a it's a
snowballing effect start the snowball by
writing it down and by visualizing if
you're having a bad day write down your
goals remind yourself of what your focus
should be focused on if you're getting
caught up in petty stuff then
no it's time for you to write your goals
and the last thing I want to say is when
it comes to go riding it doesn't have to
be some epic holier-than-thou attitude
like I need to be helping people but at
the same time it can't be about I need
this nice car there has to be a balance
we're all complicated people we're not
just black and white we're gray there's
a gray area there's we want this car we
went out this house we want shelter we
want to look after our family or friends
and also too we want to help the world
we want to make it a better place we
want to give give give and there's
always this bouncers there's almost like
two sides there's our petty self and
there's our higher self and that's okay
so whatever mode you're in trying to
accomplish these goals some days you
need to go to your petty self to get
yourself motivated hmm I really want
that body so I can show off or hmm I
really want to push myself in the gym to
push through my goals and to teach
myself that I can endure pain and that I
can push through my goals in the cops my
goals see how it's two different things
but they both work and on some days you
may want the petty some days the the
higher self may take over and say look I
want to gain something I want to grow as
a person from this workout see how it
works so some days you might need to
switch it up don't just do one or the
other it has to be both in knowing
yourself and no one would kind of mood
you're in try both if one isn't working
stop try the other alright guys so I
just want to leave you guys with that
for going into the new year I will be
posting another motivational Monday next
Monday for you guys so stay tuned for
that but I do want to say before the
year ends that I really really
appreciate all of you guys in the
comments that you guys have been leaving
and you know just pushing me I mean you
guys really do push me to make good
content and to keep it up and to work my
hardest and you guys hold me accountable
the winner of the Jaybirds posted that
he was very thankful for the Jaybirds
and
and that he was proud to be a subscriber
of mine so that kind of you know warm my
heart and you know that's what it's all
about is just giving you know take take
take you know get it like getting stuff
you know we get it right oh great and
then put it to the side you know when we
give and we when we can make somebody's
day that is worth more than anything so

has helped you in any way and I hope
that you guys get all the success in the
world and then you guys are able to make
your dreams come true so thank you guys
