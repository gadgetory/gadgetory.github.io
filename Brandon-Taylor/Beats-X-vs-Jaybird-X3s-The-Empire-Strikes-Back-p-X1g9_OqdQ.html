going to the gym without you no never
you've got your favorite gym hat on
you've got your favorite gym clothes on
sure you're not going to the gym what is
up guys is BC back here again with
another battle today we have a battle
between my two favorite headphones
currently at the moment and that is the
j-bird a three is you know the chance
that's been digging graves for all other
workout headphones recently on my
channel and the new beats X we have a
challenger we finally have a formidable
Challenger to take on the j-bird X
threes but it's going to take a lot to
to take away the title of king from the
jaybird x threes
well in the battles let's see who takes
the crown of best workout headphone 2017
first let's start off with the comfort
and design now I feel a lot of people
ragging on the jaybird x3 but see other
reviews just people saying that the
jaybird x3 they're not given the x3 is
the credit they deserve the X fit works
guys it just works and I helped one of
my subscribers get a good sense by he
was using the wings and the phone tips
and he just couldn't get a good fit so I
said take off the wing just use the
phone tips and they should work just
fine in the worked out for him these
things if you use the X fit work really
well if you try to have it hang on your
neck they will snag and they will rip
out whether you're jogging I know I see
people like to wear like that but it
they just don't work like that I know
they say that you can we
like that but it doesn't it doesn't work
so use from the ex fit
I found the David x-rays to be very
comfortable only a couple of times a
workout did I have to really fix them
and put them back into place I say maybe
once or twice nothing to make me feel
like how these are becoming a hassle now
of course they come with a silicone and
the phone pitch both work great for me I
switch off every once awhile when I want
a different kind of sound that the base
from the silicone is just better than on
the phone with the David x3 so now let's
talk about the fit of the beats X guys I
have to say without hyping it up these
are the most comfortable headphones on
the market the most comfortable and the
most secure so if you're a runner the
beats X are going to be for you because
these things do not move the only time
that I take these out or that they're
going to fall out for me is when I take
them out to talk to somebody talk to my
workout partner at the gym that's
literally the only time they've gone out
on me and I run outside I've run on
treadmills I've done Stairmaster I've
done a list of climbs done everything
I've done weightlifting with these and
they just do not move somebody had a
question about oh do they get away for
squats no they do not
it states out of the way and if it does
you can just reposition it up above the
bar and it's okay now one thing that
Jaber did right that beats did not do is
they make them sweat proof the jaybird
expertise are swept whereas the B techs
are not but I have a caveat to that
because this morning this very morning I
dropped one of my headphone but from the
beat X into my coffee that's right I
dropped it into my coffee on accident
and I said oh these are not waterproof
they're not even sweat proof these are
done but I was wrong
I cleaned off the silicon
and these worked perfectly no static no
problems no nothing they just work so I
don't know maybe it's magic I'm not
going to complain I'm not going to ask
questions but these were different
coffee and they're still here so for
this round I have to give it to the beat
ex just because they are just so
comfortable so secure that you just do
not have to worry about them and they
will please everybody from workout
enthusiasts to profit to weightlifting
to marathon runners whenever you got to
do the b6 will get you there so in a
sound aspect I know in the past beats
have been beaten down they said Oh too
much bass it's too staticky there's a
lot of distortion but Apple has cleaned
up the beats brand a lot this is a new
beats it's a new beats a new year new
products and beef is here to stay guys
let's drop all that 2016 in the past and
move on the 2017 where's beef is doing
great thing now the B ticks sound great
as a box they sound very warm there's a
lot of emotion there and that's just
something that you need for your workout
you need that emotion you need to get
emotional during your workout to get
through that workout because we've all
been there on that last set where it's
just grueling you just want to leave the
gym and then that song comes on and you
really feel it like I am a tiger comes
on and you really feel it you feel that
bass you feels a vocal hit your soul and
you just go for it so all in all the
beats X they have great men great bass
the treble the highs get a little harsh
in some songs maybe rock so that's
something to look out for they're very
bright sounding but that's okay that's
something that I can overlook so now
let's talk about the j-bird x3 sound now
they sound very flat on the box and the
b6 sound better out of the box a lot of
people might put all the j-bird
expertise and think oh I wasted my money
so in sum I found out you can take the
j-bird x3 / signature and color it
however you want like a painter you can
make the
sound however you want so anybody out
there can Casey's headphones and say you
know what I want more bass I want more
mids for vocals and then you have a
motional headphone or you can you don't
like a lot of Asian on the bass head
fine take out the bass so I'm confident
more people will like the profile of the
jaybird x3 just because you can make it
what you want
they have great channel stage so even if
you like instrumental TDM these are
right up your alley
let's get questions like which one is
louder and people like black me for
saying this headphone is not loud enough
but hear me out I listened to a lot of
live sets and sometimes they aren't the
best quality or sometimes you have lower
quality music that needs to be boosted
up a little bit right it's not the
loudest so to even hear it sometimes
then music sounds like good listening to
a little mouth so it's great just to
have the ability to go higher if needed
doesn't mean that you're going to use
that volume it's just when needed I can
go higher and in this case the jaybird
x3 go higher so that's something you're
looking out for the beat X get as loud
as I say the power beats 3 whereas a
David x3 is get loud not super loud to
the point that it hurts your ears but it
gets loud enough gives you enough room
so that if you have those quiet songs
you'll be satisfied so who ends the
sound round I give it to the Jay bird x3
because for one the louder for 2 they
have this my sound app and it's great
you can make it however you want so they
are my winner in this category so let's
talk about the battery
now the Jay bird expertise last longer
than the beats X for me at least even
though they're both rated at 8 hours I
still found that the David x-rays lasted
longer so the different x-rays lasts
longer they also take longer to charge
whereas the beats X they don't last as
long but five minutes of charging will
get you two hours of play and we've all
been there where we're sitting in our
car we want to go work out and
our headphones and up 10% 20% that's not
enough to get us through our workout
throw these on a charger and you're good
to go in five minutes if your
pre-workout needs to kick in or your
coffee needs to kick in let it kick in
charge these and then going to the gym
and kill your workout so let's talk
about the elephant in the room and that
is the charging port for the j-bird x3
the charging clip this thing is just
stupid guys I don't know why they did
this they said it easily on this big
remote put a micro USB charger I don't
get it I don't get why they did that
meanwhile Apple smartened up and put a
lightning cord so those of us with Apple
iPhones will be able to just plug in our
lightning cable and we're good to go no
problem so if you're ever in your car
and you're like oh crap I'm on my way to
the gym already oh wait I can just
charge these with my iPhone charger
where as a jaybird oh crap
I don't have my charger it's at home you
can't stop it target you can't stop at
Walmart you can't stop it any grocery
store and pick up a jaybird clip it's
not happening your headphones are done
yes either drive back home or just work
out without music and to me that's a
little ridiculous they need to take that
idea and put it in the trash that needs
to go next j-bird exports that needs to
go so in the battery round even though
the jaybird x-rays last longer the quick
charging ability of the beep X Trump
that and just not having to deal with
the charging clip the b6 win this round
let's talk about the connectivity I
haven't had any interruptions with
either one of these headphones at the
gym period that goes without saying but
here are a couple things that you guys
might want to take into consideration
and that is that the b6 when watching
video is more accurate than the jaybird
x3 so on my s5 and
iPhone 7 plus the beat X fact milk
issues with video whatsoever
the j-bert x threes on the other hand
there's a little delay it's very slight
and if you really have to be looking for
it and be conscious of it and maybe now
that I told you guys I messed you guys
up but but for the connectivity I have
to give it to the v6 for that reason now
the beef X features a w1 chip on top of
all that and that just allows for quick
connecting to your iPhone device a
little bit easier so just for ease of
use and for the video I have to give
this round to the beat X now one thing
that I like that jaybird did that I feel
like these needs to do in the next
version of this headphone and that is
that the volume up and down buttons act
as forward impact on the tracks that is
the best way to change a song not
hitting three times on the middle button
or two times to go forward it just
doesn't work it's not very intuitive and
when you're in a workout or you're on a
run it can be very disheartening when
the song to straight-up stops because
you didn't hit it quick enough or in a
way that the phone recognizes so in the
future beats at that feature so let's
end this review off with call quality
now I have to say that both of these
headphones sounded great
Jeffers for the longest time for years
and years they slacked on the call
quality and I think with a jaybird X 3s
they really improved but it's still not
quite there there's a little bit of an
echo still when you're on phone calls
whereas again the connection with the v6
it's just fast so if you're a person
where call quality is important to you
go as a beats X so in conclusion to make
a long story short the beats X are your
winner after beating the power beats
threes the great handsome after beating
my past favorites the both sound support
wires
finally the j-bird X threes have met
their match and what it came down to for
me is comfort I always go back to if
they're comfortable you're going to
listen to them for a longer period of
time you're going to enjoy music for a
longer period of time and in this case
you're going to be able to workout worry
free of your headphones popping out of
you so the b6 are your winter from the
comfort to the sound to the connectivity
to the call quality everything is just
excellent with these headphones they're
in my opinion these are a must-have
because they're going to go a long way
the only way I wouldn't recommend these
is if you're a huge sweater and you know
that you just drench your headphones go
to j-bird X threes there's still a great
headphone in fact I'll probably switch
off between the two headphones once in a
while alright guys so don't forget to
