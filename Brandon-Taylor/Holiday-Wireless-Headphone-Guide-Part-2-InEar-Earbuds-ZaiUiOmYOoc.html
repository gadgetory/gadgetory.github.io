with part two of my holiday guide this
time we're gonna be doing in ear earbuds
which is where I got my start when I
started reviewing headphones so yeah I'm
always partial to in-ear earbuds now
this year we saw a lot of true wireless
earbuds come onto the market a lot of
which failed in my opinion when they're
charging 200 to 250 to 300 dollars for
true wireless earbuds and they can't
even connect to your phone or when
there's video delay I can't really
recommend them and there's only one that
I can recommend but we'll get to that
later so I'm gonna give you guys a
rundown of my favorites of this year and
ones that I think people will enjoy
coming in at number one I have the beats
X now these are probably my favorite in
your wireless earbuds of the year
they're comfortable they're lightweight
they work in multiple situations whether
that's a gym work commuting they work
everywhere neck band is just super
comfortable I love wearing it I can just
leave it on it doesn't move this is how
a neck band should be made they have 8
hours of battery life which is very very
solid they connect with the W on chip 2
iPhones so if you have an iPhone user
these are clutch with Android 2 they are
also very good they block out a lot of
noise as well these are gonna be great
for college students gym goers anyone
really and that's why I put them at
number one because they are an
all-around headphone grade in every
situation and I think most people will
be satisfied with them only coming in at
about $99 this holiday season so a great
price and a great steal now this is the
one beats product where beats made it
from the ground up this didn't come over
from beats by dre so this is designed by
Apple
it's solid it's good it just worked
coming in at number two I have dental
floss or as some people may know them as
the air pot these things get a lot of
flack for how they look how the case
looks like guys these things just work
at $160 they're the only true eyeless
air bus this year that I can recommend
because they work with video there's no
delay the connection is rock-solid
whether you're on iPhone or Android so
no fear you can get these for any user
on any platform and with the charging
case you're getting over 24 hours of
battery life which is amazing and the
call quality is actually one of the best
on the list as well so coming in at
number three I have the j-bird X threes
now what makes these different than any
other headphone on this list is that it
has sound profiles this changes them
onboard so you can take them from one
device to another and they just so if
you're a bass lover you can take that
and not have to just eq's on your
macbook or your phone or your android it
can go around to each one of these
devices and stay the same and have the
same exact it's the only thing that
really sucks about these is the dongle
and I can see people if they have
younger kids losing them so I don't
recommend them for people that lose
things easily but if you keep track of
your stuff and your gym goer these are
gonna be great for you and they also
come with a ton of different fits which
I love so whatever style you like
whether that's on the neck or on the
back of the head the X fit it just works
and you can find a fit it's a little
finicky in the beginning but you can
find it and I believe you can get these
for about $100 right now which is an
amazing value coming in at number four
we have the Bose sound support Wireless
these things are amazing the stay here
plus tips are some of the most
uncomfortable ear tips you can get and
these will sit on the outside of your
ear so for you those of you who don't
like jamming silicone tips into your ear
these are a great alternative you get
that silicone enos with the secureness
of the wing but without all the extra
stuff
being jammed into these are gonna be
great for the gym for running I love
them they let in a little bit of sound
which is why I say they're great for
runners because you need to hear your
outside environment so if you're looking
to buy these for a college student I
would probably advise against it because
students need to focus they need to tune
out everything and these let in a little
bit of sound so if they go to the
library not the best now these are
coming in at about 130 dollars which is
down from the original price of 150 so
amazing value here I love using these
they're super comfortable and they have
some of the best bass on this list these
things are booming the sound on these
the clarity that you get with these is
almost unmatched by anybody else on this
list so Bose really tops it for sale so
coming in at number five I've had a lot
of people reach out to me about these
earbuds and those are the power beats
threes now you may be saying Brandon I
thought you said beats suck in your last
video don't buy them for anyone that's
true but I also said that there's two
that I would do that with there's two
that with by the beats X and the power
beats three let me tell you why power
beats three come with twelve hours of
battery life that is just unheard of in
the in-ear earbud Wireless game so very
good job by Apple by adding that in
stellar battery life for those of you
who forget to charge a lot or are on the
go a lot and don't have time to sit down
and charge Picasso these are gonna be
best for the gym for people that play
basketball they are some of the most
secure on the list these things do not
fall out because they have the clip
Apple cleaned up the sound a lot these
aren't very muddy like the older
powerbeats twos so Apple kind of took
these cleaned up the sound added a ton
of battery life and lowered the price to
130 but beware guys if you're gonna buy
beats be careful of where you buy them
from please do not buy them from us
there
or fourth or fifth party they're just
bad buy them from a reputable source
whether that's best by Amazon but make
sure it's not a third party target you
want to buy them at places that are
gonna have the real deal because I see a
lot of people to come on my videos and
I'll be like well this is happening or
they already broke or they don't sound
that good yeah because you probably got
fake ones so get the real deal test them
out and let me know how it goes and I
think you'll be surprised at how good
they are compared to the powerbeats2
also these are gonna be great for
renters because they just don't move and
they don't have to worry about them
falling out or one year messing up their
stride so for those of you that have
runners or people that you know do a lot
of rigorous sports these are gonna be
great I just want to throw in an
honorable mention and these are gonna be
great stocking stuffers guys and that is
the tribe it X color headphones they
wanted me to test them out they didn't
pay me or anything and I tested them out
the materials on these are insanely good
the build quality is just really really
good
and I think they're a steal at the price
that they are at which is about $30 so
let's say you have some nephews or some
sister-in-laws or whoever that you think
might enjoy some music these are a great
alternative because they look like beets
they feel like beets people gonna be
back how much did you pay for these
right a little pro tip people will be
surprised about how much you actually
spent on these don't tell them you could
tell them $100 and I think they would
believe you but I didn't tell you to do
that they have a great sound that can
hold up against anybody on this list
honestly they have great bass there's a
lot of clarity here there's no money
this like some of the other cheaper
headphones definitely a great stocking
stuffer alright so that is my guide to
in-ear wireless earbuds for this holiday
season
remember stay away from third-party
sellers you've been warned I don't want
to hear that you've bought something for
somebody or for yourself and they've
broken down within the first week so
yeah thank you guys for watching let me
know if you guys have any more questions
down below of course there are many
other earbud
that I didn't get to get to but these
are some of my favorites and what I
think people will enjoy if you guys have
any questions about any other in-ear
earbuds or things like that let me know
down below and I will see you guys in
the next video it's been your board beat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
