what I thought was because a
lot of the coverage online of these
Noctua air coolers for thread ripper
basically drew a sort of general
conclusion that these knocks what air
coolers are better than the expensive
high-end liquid coolers that use smaller
cold plates not like this one
but like the ace attack ones so we set
forth to see if that was true and how it
held up because just looking at the
numbers it kind of makes sense to some
extent with a larger cold plate but then
at the same time liquid should make up a
lot of that gap so we wanted to test
coolers that were purpose-built for
thread Ripper against coolers that are
not purpose-built for thread Ripper
before getting to that this video is
brought to you by synergy the software
that lets you share a keyboard and mouse
between multiple systems if you have
limited desk space and multiple
computers to command synergy removes the
need for separate peripherals or a KVM
and works as over the network software
use our link below to get 50% off the
home or pro version with ssl so here's
what this boils down to if boils down to
the phrase the Noctua coolers are better
and there's a few things here I want to
point out one as you'll see in a moment
it's not impossible that they are better
but more importantly what does better
mean and this is getting into territory
where we basically derived some of our
testing methods out of the phrase X
cooler is better than Y cooler because
ultimately you can be better in raw
thermal performance but at the same time
it's not hard to just put a faster
louder fan on basically anything to make
it thermally superior to some of its
competition that doesn't mean it's
better as a product though so there's
also better in terms of value price
proposition there's better in terms of
noise normalized performance this is a
big one so if we set these coolers in
this cooler and the crack in X 62 all
240 DBA output so the fans when spinning
produce about 40 decibels of noise over
the room noise level about 26 which one
has the best thermal performance at a
noise normalized 40 DBA that's the other
aspect of the word better when it comes
to cooling performance then of course
wrong acoustic performance as well at
the high end so that's what we're
looking at we're looking at those things
today and the testing approach here we
will be expanding this as you all know
we have liquid cooler and air cooler
reviews for LGA 2011 or 20 X X whatever
was sockets already for years now and
those charts are big and we've worked on
them forever but thread rippers new so
doing some specific cooler test for
thread Ripper because it is somewhat of
a special platform including with this
inner mac slick tech 240 TR for CLC
probably is a better name on that but
otherwise it's an interesting product
and the Noctua Nhu 14s and Noctua NH u
12s coolers and then we have the kraken
x 62 as a baseline with the round ace
attack plate that really only covers the
dies but not any of the outer surface
area of the IHS we previously showed
that the extra coverage does actually
help quite a bit but also to be fair to
those ace attack coolers because
threader per includes a bracket for them
they'll work they'll keep it within spec
for sure but it doesn't mean that
they're the most effective you really
just mostly want to use them if you lack
another if you already own one and you
just want to put the bracket to use so
for testing here we're doing a different
approach than normally somewhat where
we've got blender and we've got prime95
for our workloads and the difference
here is that we're logging power
consumption down the EPS 12-volt rails
the entire time and that's because prime
and blender can both to some extent
power and load cycle and that we're
controlling for that we're making sure
that the performance is consistent we're
all still in 40 DB a noise normalized
tests we've got manual coverage spread
so this is basically taking a graduated
syringe filling it to a known amount of
thermal paste applying it to the cooler
to have the same amount every time and
then taking just like a little plastic
shovel and manually covering the IHS
with the paste and then we've also got
the same thermal paste for all coolers
we've got power controlled for we're
overclocked to 4 gigahertz at one point
3 5 volts and
it's important because you don't want to
use auto anything because it's not
trustworthy for a test like this and
we're also using TDI for the measurement
so we're not using tea control because
it shouldn't exist TDI is the more or
less the actual temperature of all those
36 sensors within thread rapport a
bridge together as opposed to tea
control which is all those sensors
averaged together with the 27 degrees
Celsius modifier for whatever reason so
reason TDI and I think that's most of it
for the methodology now we're focusing
on the X 62 for the ACE attack
representation it's one of the best ACE
attack made cool is out there it's an
NZXT branded cooler that will be tested
alongside this enter max unit which has
a full coverage plate big difference
there and then we've got knocked a for
the air coolers we'll be expanding other
thread report cooler reviews in the near
future but this will get us started
first to address the concern of
outputting roughly equal power between
tests we clamped the EPS 12-volt cables
during all tests for all coolers then
compared power consumption between runs
595 load cycles at somewhat predictable
intervals shown in this overtime chart
and we can synchronize our data
averaging the only pull data from the
peak cycle the heaviest power cycle
produces the most heat as you'd expect
so we're averaging from that height as
seen in the charts the test aligns well
from past to pass validating that our
testing was conducted under the same
power load each time there's some
variance and you should also expect to
see about a 4% power consumption
reduction from leakage for every 10
degrees Celsius that the CPU drops but
these numbers are largely the same
that's what we want the same is true for
blender which produces a highly
predictable heat load and power load
throughout testing we were able to align
the data to validate accuracy averaging
again from the peak values the first
test is prime95 torturing the CPU at
around 310 Watts load with our 4
gigahertz overclock in 1.3 5 volts and
using 100% fan and pump speeds the enter
mac SelectTech 240 millimeter TR for
cooler performs the best of the lot when
disregarding noise plotting an average
TDI of fifty point seven degrees celsius
over a Meads with the 10-second peak at
around 51 degrees Celsius delta T
this positions the cooler significantly
ahead of the NZXT crack next 62 with a
more limited Coldplay contact area but a
bigger radiator which is at 63 degrees
Celsius over ambient where's cooler in
the test was Dean aqua Nhu 12 as a 120
millimeter smaller version of knocked
was higher performing nagu 14s the 120
millimeter option runs an average TDI of
66 C over ambiens achieving similar
temperatures to the $160 excellently to
cooler but priced at $70 USD the idle
temperatures largely follow the low
temperatures in terms of positioning as
you can see in the chart but overall
there's not a big difference at this low
load level the knocked over 140
millimeter option performs notice ly
better than the 120 millimeter option it
makes sense the 120 has both a smaller
fan and a smaller heatsink as you can
see and so that makes sense in terms of
performance versus the liquid coolers
the 140 option maintains 59 degrees
Celsius over ambient and that's still
roughly 8 degrees warmer than the full
coverage enter max 240 millimeter cooler
but it's 3 to 4 degrees cooler than the
ASA tech X 62 so just to be clear this
one's a couple degrees cooler than the X
62 it's not tremendous likely you've
seen some tests online but it is
definitely there and it's measurable and
it's outside of error so there's a
couple degrees better than the X 62 and
it's it's quite a few degrees worse than
this one but we're not noise normalized
yet so we'll see how that changes once
we do account for the noise levels
because this is quite loud compared to
that when both are at max RPMs makes
sense it has two fans and they're
smaller as far as the ACE tech unit it's
sort of spinning its wheels on the
pavement this is an issue where ASA tech
schoolers with those smaller cold plates
they have the potential to cool it's got
a bigger radiator it's got bigger fans
they're half decent fans it's got the
potential but it can't apply that power
to the road there's no torque there so
that's the problem of this smaller cold
plate and hopefully a stack if thread
ripper is popular enough for them to
produce something for hopefully they
actually make a cold plate that's
threaded per size to compete
a one big thing I question here until we
tear this animatics went down I don't
know if the actual liquid flows through
this entire cold plate area or if it's
just exposed cold plate because it's
entirely possible that performance could
be even better if the channeling design
of the cold plate is specifically made
for thread Ripper and it's likely that
if you for example centralize your pump
in your liquid in sort of the normal
area you would for a cooler but you just
expanded the cold plate like they've
done it's possible there's still even
performance on the table even though
it's objectively the best in that first
test normalizing for noise at 40
decibels should give us a better
indication of whether the liquid coolers
hold an advantage that matters it's easy
to win a test when unconstrained a noise
just put a louder faster fan on it but
for these tests knock to us coolers
we're already operating at about 40
decibels when Max that's their baseline
performance so we didn't need to rerun
them the other coolers though did
undergo lower fan speed testing to fit
the noise profile at 40 DBA with prime95
the kraken f 60 to only increases from
its previous baseline by about 1 degrees
Celsius we're at around 64 C over
ambient now versus the previous 63 C not
a big difference and ultimately doesn't
really change the fact that the cooler
which is otherwise good has become
limited by its own cold plate it's still
acceptable insofar as you could buy one
and use it if necessary but there are
more efficient than cheaper options that
would better warrant to purchase the
only cooler warmer than this is the NH u
12s which again is a 120 millimeter
small air cooler which operates at
around 66 degrees Celsius over ambient
not that much warmer but a bit the
Noctua Nhu 14s tr4 unit keeps the
overclocked to 1950 axe to around 59 C
over ambiens making it about five
degrees cooler than the X 62 at about
seven degrees cooler than the 120
millimeter Noctua cooler at our Maxis
lick tech 240 TR for cooler leads the
pack at fifty four point eight C over
ambiens reduce units previous eight to
nine degree lead over the nagas 140
millimeter cooler to a lead of four
degrees Celsius
animatics cooler technically performs
the best here once again even noise
normalized but is also priced at 130 you
the versus the $80 price of the Nhu 14s
there are other cons to the knock to a
cooler of course but we'll get to those
momentarily for a lower thermal load we
now look at blender with the fans at max
rpm the kraken X 62 maintains a 51.6
degree temperature keeping it still in
the 2 to 3 C range above the Nhu 14s
enter max Luke Tec 240 TR for cooler
keeps the lowest temperature as
previously at 43 point two degrees
Celsius with the Nhu 12s at 60 C blender
at 40 decibels also shows familiar
scaling we're at fifty 4.5 cm x 62 with
the Nhu 14s at 49 C as it was already
operating at 40 DBA
with the enter max 240 cooler a few
degrees cooler than the 140 millimeter
knock to a cooler but it's otherwise
unimpressive in its lead it is
technically superior it's just sort of a
shallow victory that said liquid is
always going to outperform air and
otherwise similar or identical
conditions so there's no surprise here
it's just better at moving heat around
the difference comes in how the cold
blades made and whether the liquid is
actually enabled to leverage its
advantage or whether it's left again
spinning on the pavement then a 212 ass
is rather unimpressive and should
probably be skipped in most cases as the
U 14 s is significantly better at a
similar price there are a couple of
other factors to consider of course for
example clearance this cooler is a bit
larger and even by knocks wasone
admission it's just not going to work
with every motherboard if you're trying
to accommodate a top slot PCIe device so
for our testing when we tested this one
on the ACS Zenith motherboard we had to
take the video card and move it down a
couple slots to the next by 16 slot
because the top one just didn't work it
would collide with this and even if it
kind of makes it kind of clears be
careful because you don't want a bridge
contacts on the back of the cards with
these fins that would be bad so that's a
downside potentially you can use a lower
PCIe slot if you have to you can do some
manoeuvring with these but not a lot
keep that in mind as for the rest though
it comes down to price and performance
technically speaking in the most sort of
pedantic way possible this cooler is
better it's better noise normalized
it's better outright at Full Tilt but
it's 130 ish dollars and this is
something like 80 or somewhere around
there so that's certainly a
consideration there's a consideration of
how much do you need the extra couple
degrees in most instances we're seeing
noise normalized about a four to five
degree celcius improvement max for this
cooler 4 to 5 degrees isn't a ton if
that matters to you you probably know
who you are and you're probably buying
something better than this anyway they
have a 360 option as well we'll test
eventually but it's a good cooler for
something that's got a threader precise
plate it's also enter max which means
that if other companies decide to get
into the game here and produce their own
full-coverage copper plates or liquid
coolers we would expect that there's
potential for more improvement there
enter max is first to market with this
which means that they're probably
cutting corners somewhere I mean I would
expect to see things improve with time
that's just how product development
works even from mentor max so you'd
expect that the future iterations would
improve more but as it stands today it's
really not that distant of a fight
between this and and this one the Nhu
12s I'd say skip entirely unless you're
in a situation where you you really need
that clearance for that top PCIe slot
and you also need an air cooler for some
reason which is also a consideration for
liquid because if you're in a really
tight case and doing something with a
smaller board which there's not a lot of
this thread Ripper because the sockets
so big but that's a potential use case
for liquid there's a smaller footprint
so keep that in mind but there's your
data though as far as my thoughts on
this so 1 into it like I said expecting
that the something like an X 62 which is
one of the best days of tech coolers
would perform more or less equally to
this cooler if not slightly better
because it is a good cooler but the fana
is that quote the cold plate in the
limited contact area really comes back
to bite a Sutekh in ways that surprised
me a bit because what happens is this
one ends up leading by a couple degrees
now it's not as big of a lead as we've
seen some other places but it's still
somewhere in the 1/2
four degree range depending on the test
and the noise levels things like that
once he normalized for noise the Kraken
loses a little bit more ground but not a
lot so that that was genuinely a bit
surprising to me just how much the cold
blade matters we kind of tested it on
knocks or previously between knocks with
coolers but not against liquid and
that's interesting I mean that's
basically that's where stuff like this
companies like NR max who aren't really
tier 1 brands are actually going to have
a chance at making some sales here
because they were early to thread Ripper
with a closed loop product that actually
does perform objectively better than the
smaller circular cold plates of vasotec
products that have been on the market a
while now so maybe this little kit gains
attack a bit and wake them up to make a
full-coverage plate but it depends on if
they think there's volume there to
actually profit on it
thread Ripper is still kind of
developing as a market it's definitely
the biggest upset that we've seen so far
in terms of knocking Intel around but
even at these with the lead that thread
Ripper has in some scenarios it's like
$1,000 part for the high end so it's
gonna be lower volume even if they're
selling more than Intel might be in that
particular segment so keep that in mind
