currently @k skin's booth we're dare
Bauer has a few products to show
including RGB water talk about that in a
moment the main thing here is the power
phase shifts cooler this is actually
going to be a product so although it's
currently in showroom state it's gonna
all completely change in theory you
should be able to buy this by end of
year so we be talking about this and
then also some Novak fluid cooling in
the pressurized system in front of me
before that this video is brought to you
by thermal takes view 37 case the vo 37
focuses on highlighting custom PC builds
with its full panoramic window and
tinted front acrylic and our thermal
testing the view 37 performed reasonably
well when considering its looks focused
build which is partly thanks to the
airflow design and the removal of a
bottom power supply shroud for a balance
of looks and performance check the link
in the description below for the view 37
so for the de barro phase-shift cooler
main thing here first of all there's a
block on top of the CPU of course just
like any other CPU cooling block and
currently there's a 79 20 X in there
it's running about 140 watts so for
performance this isn't just an outright
performer it's got a couple of other
things that going forward rather than
just raw thermal performance but there
should still be some advantages what's
happening is rather than using a Novak
fluid which is a restricted substance
can't sell it in all regions
it's got pfcs in it so they're not using
Novak using something else that they
can't tell me about but the concept is
the same it's a phase change cool and so
as it boils it turns into a gas comes up
this giant pipe here which this will be
smaller later I'll tell you more in a
moment comes up the pipe up here into a
tank and actually if you look inside of
the tank on the bottom there's a window
you can see that where the gas condenses
turns back into a liquid and comes back
down the tube into the block so that's
the circulation ish it's not actually a
closed loop because it's not a literal
loop but that's the idea so you have
phase change goes up here up top there's
the condenser the condenser just
literally copper fins so a five
millimeter plate sits in here between
the tank and this sort of grille on top
and that has
channels milled out in the bottom side
of it the fins on top are attached
currently to 90 millimeter fans these
should be 120 s for consumer they're
going for 240 and 360 sizes for the
radiator but it's not actually a
radiator and then you have fin stacks up
here where again air blows through cools
it down Rican dances comes back down
here this giant thing is not gonna be
here in the final product there are a
couple of basically debug features right
now there's this and this and both of
these will be removed the one over here
is a pressure sensor and then the one up
here is just a valve so basically more
or less a Schrader valve or equivalent
the idea is that anyone working the
booth can change the pressure of the
system by attaching a pump to the valve
and doing a hand pump action on it so
that's more or less it the boiling point
and the pressure are directly related as
one goes up the other goes up and I
think that covers most at pricing should
be about the same as CLC so in terms of
competition you're looking at maybe X 62
glass with kind of 50% fan speeds and
that's for the 240 360 will compete more
with 360s or larger size radiators in
the CLC market again not really meant to
take care of something like extreme
overclocks it's not like a closed closed
loop liquid nitrogen cool or anything
like that but you completely eliminate
the pump which is the primary point of
failure on any closed loop liquid cooler
as we've Illustrated in the past so you
luminate the pump which eliminates pump
noise pump failure pump whine all that
annoying stuff your entire creator of
noise is gonna be the fans which will be
120 is the final product and then you
have control over those they don't need
to be all that fast because their only
job is blowing air through the
continent's the condenser basically and
I think that pretty much covers it this
tube will later turn into a 14
millimeter tube with it's basically a
hydraulic hose later on it'll be black
blended a bit more the entire thing up
here will change it's not gonna be this
thick it'll be closer to something like
maybe 60 millimeters or less and it has
to be mounted vertically though because
you're relying on gravity to carry the
liquid back down after it condenses so I
think that covers it look for it towards
the end of the year and if I missed
anything we'll have an article below
where it'll have some more
formation as for this thing in front of
me so on top of this one it looks like a
standard clothes or a custom lube on top
using ek parts and all that's doing is
attaching to a condenser just like we
talked over here there's a condenser
over here it's just a giant heatsink and
what's going on is there's no vac fluid
so this is a 71 fluid we've talked about
it in the past
it's a 61 degrees Celsius roughly
boiling point for the Novak fluid as the
fluid heats up and boils it turns into a
gas comes up top hits the condenser
condensers cooled by the EK loop and
cools down you eventually get
evaporation obviously off the top and
then condensation where it drips back
down and is functionally recycled so
it's a pressurized system it has a
literal tank inside of the case and you
can even take off the glass if you
wanted to there's another glass wall
behind it for the GPU it's I think it's
a 1080 TI it's an Nvidia part and that's
got a four millimeter thick copper block
on it it's really rough so if you look
at it closely it looks like there are a
lot of scratches this is desirable in
this instance because it increases the
surface area and for something like this
where you have full contact of every
single crevice in that plate because
it's liquid do you end up with actual
functional use of the service area from
those extra scratches so that's the idea
for that one
as I understand it having that copper
plate on top of the GPU does actually
improve performance and a meaningful way
so the dye itself is very smooth it's
also small not a lot of surface area
from raw I correct contact with liquid
so they put the block on there also to
be fair it's an exhibition system it's
for show so that obviously plays a role
as well and that is the I think that's
both the demo systems oh one very
important point you might have noticed
that there's RGB water in these so
because this is a liquid I guess if you
put RGB LEDs in there or an RGB LED in
here which I'm told it took many
painstaking hours by which I mean was
done last minute before the show because
that's how vamp star GB is it ends up
being RGB water so I if you wanted that
you can get it from there Bower encased
gain keep an eye out for more coverage
from the show as always
patreon.com/scishow his action stops I
directly go to store documents access
not and that comes out directly there as
well or check out our Leon Lee coverage
earlier this week where dear Bauer had a
cameo subscribe for more I'll see you
all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
