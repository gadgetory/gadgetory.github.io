showed sapphires alleged RX 470 platinum
edition and RX 460 probably night ropes
as two fans these are leaks it's not
guaranteed their real video cards has
had a fairly reliable recent trend of
leaks so we can probably assume with
some reasonable possibility of these are
actual cards so the RX 470 platinum
edition is basically just from the looks
of it the same sort of cooler design and
face plate as the RX 480 reference card
but change to be a platinum look so it's
silver basically and the 460 as we've
seen in the pictures anyway uses a dual
fan cooler so it's dual push fans not a
blower fan it's more comparable to the
Nitro series I'm not sure if that's what
it's actually going to be called and
from looking at the board photos on the
video cards leaks we can see that the
470 has a 4 plus 1 phase power design
and well allegedly anyway based on the
leaks and that is as opposed to the six
plus one phase design of the RX 484 70s
of course a weaker card so it makes some
sense the power setup it's still a six
pin header on the 470 and then of course
it draws any extra power needs through
PCIe that's pretty normal how these all
these cards work and that's pretty much
all we have in terms of specs from
looking at the cards and we won't know
more until of course the official
product is actually launching in terms
of the 460 there's even less information
on that one did look like they were
potentially two and four gigabyte models
based on the video cards at leak which
we've got that linked below if you want
to see the source documentation for all
of that and that's that's the most we
got so the fans are the push fans and
they might have that same sort of push a
button and you can remove the fan
mechanism that was in the 480 nitro
which makes the RMA process a lot easier
on manufacturers because often it's the
fan that fails so they can just kind of
swap out the fan send you a new fan
then replace the whole board so we'll
see if that's how it works out and these
cards should definitely be in the 100 to
150 market currently that means they
would compete with Nvidia's 950 and
what's left of the 750 Ti but that's
pretty much out the door at this point
so it's basically competing with the 950
unless Nvidia comes out and surprises us
with the 1050 announcement or something
like that in which case that card would
probably fit somewhere this is based on
the pre and previous launch is not new
information but somewhere in the 180
dollar range maybe as low as 150 I would
not expect lower than that unless they
plan to do a 1050 TI or something like
that so we'll see we'll see how it works
out with NVIDIA but as it stands now the
470 and 460 are definitely coming to
market we've already talked about them
the original release dates if you
remember we're mid-july so that was
after the 480 launched by a couple weeks
and end of July obviously that did not
happen and if july i think was the RS
460 mid was 470 so they've been pushed
back we'll have more information for you
shortly in theory on one of those cards
come to market be reviewing them
probably but that's all we have for you
for now so thank you for watching as
always patreon like the petrol video
subscribe for more information I'll see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
