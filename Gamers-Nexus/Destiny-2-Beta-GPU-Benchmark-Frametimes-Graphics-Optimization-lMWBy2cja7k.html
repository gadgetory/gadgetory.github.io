provides a new benchmarking opportunity
for GPUs and CPUs and will allow us to
plot performance uplift once the final
game ships aside from being a popular
beta we also want to know if Bungie AMD
and NVIDIA work to further improve
performance in the final stretch of time
prior to the official October 24th
release date for now we're conducting an
exploratory look at multiplayer versus
single-player test patterns and results
for d2 quality settings and multiple
resolution testing before that we
partnered with LastPass to bring you

at the link below
we front-loaded this content with
research done on destiny 2 to determine
the best test patterns that are
repeatable and reliable and easy to
execute and all that so part of this was
conducting tests and multiplayer and
singleplayer in the beginning of the
game where we wanted to benchmark in
single-player later in the game and ran
tests across the entire 20 minute or so
tutorial campaign that ships with to
determine how performance scales later
to make sure there's not just some early
on really heavy performance hit or
really light performance hit in the game
and then also how does that compare to
multiplayer to make sure we're looking
at a realistic scenario so we've looked
at all of that a couple of things here
first of all this is a beta everything
is subject to change they have about a
month or so until the game finally ships
maybe a month and a half that means that
things can change
MSAA in particular as noted by Bungie
themselves is still under active
development and is a work in progress so
we've actually not used it for this
testing for that reason but that just it
goes to show that this game is under
development
everything's beta these results pertain
to beta and the beta performance on the
driver side and video has game ret are
ready drivers out so we use those and D
has 17.8 2 which is what we used we
asked them what to use and that's what
they recommended and and the may push
more drivers later probably closer to
the official launch of the game at which
point we'll revisit it
and be able to plot the performance
uplift from the beta to the final
version and then hopefully find so many
any visual differences that may exist as
well so that's what this is for this
allows us to see how the game improves
how the drivers improve things like that
and in the very least satisfy an
immediate interest in how the beta is
performing on different Hardware we're
starting with GPS today we have CPU
benchmarks as well there as well go live
not too long after this video so
subscribe for that if you're interested
but let's get straight into the research
part of this before we guess the
comparative benchmarks first of all the
big question was how well multiplayer
and the reality of framerate and
multiplayer is reflected by
single-player if we wanted to run
single-player benchmarks because the
more repeatable and easier to do without
having to wait for matches and maps and
also how this compares to a session over
say 20 minutes or even five minutes
we've got a log that long as well so
this was done with a 1080i sc2 at 4k and
highest settings at first we did this
across a spread of multiple settings and
cards and we'll look at comparative
benchmarks next where we set all the
same configurations for everything's
that is probably comparative but first
we wanted to find what works for a
benchmark this first table shows each
spot measurement against one another
then again the final benchmarking course
overall our FPS range is consistent
there's one lower FPS number out of all
of these which occurred in a densely
packed city street area with complex
geometry we only saw this FPS dip at one
time during the campaign and it seemed
tied to that specific zone when there
was heavy combat and a geometrically
complex area averaging the spot checks
across the entire 20-minute session we
end up at 51 FPS average 45 1% lows and
41 fps 0.1% lows which represent our
frame times in a converted FPS metric
comparatively our chosen benchmark
course selected forged accurate
repetition ended up at 55 FPS average 48
1% lows and 47.5 0.1% lows these numbers
are remarkably close and show that in
the very least our benchmarking method
is representative of the entirety of the
beta intro campaign at these settings
with this card let's look at how this
compares to competitive multiplayer
matches taking spot measurement
across several multiplayer sessions
where and we actually tried to compete
and play the game properly on the
Midtown map we end up with this new
table of results let's put this next to
the single-player results for comparison
the range is 53 to 57 FPS average and
averaging all the spot-checks puts us at
50 4.5 with one percent lows at 46 and
43 FPS 0.1% lows these are close enough
that single player benchmarking looks
accurate to multi player performance in
the beta state of the game with this
particular configuration to get a
broader sense of scalability across the
games various maps and game modes here's
an msi gtx 1050 TI OC edition at 1080p
and high settings our benchmark course
outputs a frame rate of 70 FPS average
with lows at 50 4.7 1% and 53.7 0 1 %
compared to a pair of multiplayer
matches on mid-town once again we see
frame rates of 74 average 63 1 % and 59
0.1 % the difference is approximately 6%
considering the trade-off is
significantly more reproducible results
that's really not too bad you'd see a
bigger range of variants in a game like
Battlefield with 64 players although
it's possible that destiny 2 is final
iteration could show greater swings
across other maps and game modes will
have to reserve judgment on that aspect
until it fully shifts and here's the
last round of exploratory tests
conducted on the rx 580 which were run
as we were finalizing its comparative
results shown momentarily at 1080p and
with highest settings our benchmark
output had us at 85 FPS average 66 fps 1
root sound lows and 62 fps 0.1% lows as
a reminder we're using FXAA here
multiplayer testing put our range
between 67 and 88 FPS which is huge and
largely demonstrates why multiplayer
testing is difficult to do accurately
and averages out to 79 FPS average 66
FPS to 1% lows and 62 fps 0.1% lows
still reasonably close with the final
benchmark output averaging a bit higher
than multiplayer
though there's so much range in
multiplayer results that we'd have to
run another dozen or two times to get a
better idea of the average and now that
we've gone through this we know that the
game is remarkably consistent in its
performance across single-player and
multiplayer and across multiple levels
of single-player
and even multiple test durations we
tested at a intervals of 1 minute 5
minutes 20 minutes and so on with breaks
when they were loading screens in
between and saw that the averages were
pretty much the same aside from that one
zone which was really geometrically
complex but we ended up not testing
therefore the final benchmark because
while it was in a weird spot of the game
and - it didn't match up with the rest
of the testing so the next thing to note
before the comparative section there's a
200 FPS cap on destiny - so it is not
unlimited or unrestrained in the purest
sense of the word but basically is and
this 200 FPS cap means that as we
approach the upper limit of framerate
the cards that exceed 200 FPS will end
up locked to haunt 200 FPS and therefore
will produce lower averages as a results
so if you could exceed 200 obviously the
averages would be dragged up word so
keep that in mind that this mostly well
actually only affects the 1080i for the
most part but it's worth noting as
always we can also only speak to the
results that we've encountered
discovered tested here and this is a
beta game testing leaves a lot of room
for different results if you change the
settings we have a part at the end of
this video talking about a few settings
in particular that were significantly
impacting results so depending on if
people turn those on or off you'll see
major swings in performance and that of
course matters just as much as the
hardware does getting it's a comparative
benchmarks between the GPUs now we open
with 1080p at the highest settings with
FXAA bypassing MSAA as it has known
issues in bungees bug log that's a work
in progress with msaa destiny to beta
proves playable on most Hardware at
1080p even with the highest settings
enabled the 1080i sc2 chart tops here
unsurprisingly with a 168 FPS average
and frame times consistently represented
in 123 fps 1 % and 94 FPS 0.1% we're
bumping into the 200 FPS cap here so
that is going to be a bit lower than if
there were no cap Vegas 64 stock lands
at 123 FPS average trailing the GTX 1080
FTW by about 17% and effectively tying
the GTX 970 SC note again that Andy is
at driver situation may yet mature for
this game so we can only speak to these
results as of the beta
with the 17 out of 8.2 drivers will
revisit closer to full launch as of now
Vegas 64 ties the 1070 and our Vegas 56
hybrid mod isn't far behind at about a
6% deficit to the Vegas 64 reference
card the MSI GTX 1066 gigabyte card
operated a 93 FPS average planting ahead
of the 970 SSC and a fair bit behind the
1070 and rx Vega 56 the many GTX 970
owners can rest assured knowing that
their card is still plenty usable for
the highest settings at 1080p which
makes sense as Bundy did officially
recommend the card in the recommended
specs listing rx 580 performs similarly
to the GTX 970
which means that overclocked our X 480
owners can expect comparable results to
the rx 580 and the destiny 2 beta just a
bit behind for stock clocks the RX 570
follows Andy's trend of showing clock
speeds can account for seed deficits as
the 570s performance would pull close to
the 580 s performance when overclocked
finally the GTX 1050 Ti and rx 560 cards
would benefit from a mixture of high and
highest settings if at 1080p II as they
begin to drag down below the 60 FPS
threshold
speaking of dropping settings here's
1080p with high settings the RX 560
improves by about 10 FPS or 26 percent
and the MSI GTX 1050 Ti improves by 22%
climbing to 70 FPS average remember
we're roughly plus or minus 6% to multi
player performance depending on settings
Maps things like that so we're in good
company at this point this test was it
more for these lower end cards let's
move it along to the higher end with
1440p resolution and the highest
graphics settings and FXAA the 1080i is
knocked down from its frame rate cap
bumping numbers to 105 FPS average
losing about 38% from the 1080p
resolution things are still plenty
playable though scaling reasonably
through the GTX 1080 at 82 fps and Vega
64 at conveniently 64 FPS of iluminati
isn't yet confirmed consider also that
the GTX 1080i leads vega 64 by 64
percent jokes aside rx Bega 64 is
roughly tied with the GTX 970 but the
vega 64 card exhibits were same time
consistency this is at least partly a
driver side issue seeing as the
performance here deviates from Vegas
norm of being closer to 1080 performance
and other games I'll check back once
Andy
is another update likely closer to
launch here's a look at the frame time
plot of Vegas 64 and the GT X 1080 FTW
showing the 1080 FTW is more consistent
frame time output
remember with frame times it's not just
that higher is worse but that more
variance is worse you want the flattest
line possible ideally closest to the
interval of your display alternatively
here's a Vega 56 frame time plot
compared to the gtx 1070 is frame times
showing a similar outcome back to the
1440p highest chart for a moment though
we see that performance starts falling
harder at the gtx 1066 gigabyte card gtx
970 and RX 588 gigabyte card players are
more sensitive to frame rate may want to
drop settings or resolution at this
point here's a look at the drops
settings option just to see how many
more frames we can get out of going too
high there's more room below this option
of course but high and highest look
close enough that it's not a huge loss
to quote downgrade some cards are
dropped from this chart as they were
doing just fine at highest the gtx 1080
FTW runs an average FPS of 126 now and
could hit 1440p with 144 hurts if
dropping settings further the 1080 TI
does this more readily Vegas 64 operates
an average FPS of 106 with frame times
reasonably consistent in this particular
scenario
it seems that Vegas 64 is more sensitive
to one of the graphics settings in the
highest preset which is something we'll
explore later on under this video but
also more as the game iterates with high
frame times improved to a point of being
consistent enough that most users won't
complain though average FPS does need to
climb closer to the 1080 to remain at
least halfway competitive either way
here's a frame time plot of the 1080 and
Vega 64 showing improvement on Vega 64
bridges with highest settings we're
stuck in a wait-and-see cycle on Vega
right now with the present setting being
wait to see if the new drivers chip and
improve things as for the other cards
back to the 1440p high charge
performance remains above 60 fps across
the board with low-end frame time
performance also reasonably boosted all
these devices could handle this
configuration for the most part perhaps
with the RX 570 needing a slight
settings reduction to ensure a high
baseline and/or variable multiplayer
play one item of note the RX 588
gigabyte card improved from 38 FPS
average at highest to 75
at high which is nearly exactly a two
times performance leap the GTX 1066
gigabyte card saw a leap of 62% from
highest to high which although not as
impressive it's still a massive jump
when considering the visual quality
difference ie minimal if using AMD
Hardware it's becoming clear that
running at high settings is preferable
to highest after we get through the rest
of these charts we'll look at the impact
of SSAO on performance to determine if
that's the culprit for the big hit these
cards are taking here's 4k with the
highest graphics settings and FXAA we
only have a few cards here go figure
it's intensive and see that the GTX 1080
is C 2 is playing decently but not as
well as we'd like our multiplayer match
has had us at about 55 FPS average in
this configuration but dropping a few
settings the high would help improve to
a more playable 4k level the GTX 1018 on
TI and Vega 64 are both having trouble
with these settings here's the last of
the comparative charts high is more
playable at 4k especially with a 1080i
FC to CNN immense performance uplift of
71 percent from highest and the Vegas 64
card again nearly doubling and its
performance the highest preset is
clearly taxing in ways which may not be
appreciated
particularly in multiplayer matches when
compared to the frame rate reduction in
exchange this is true for both Nvidia
and ante hardware but is more noticeable
at 4k probably because of the higher
pixel count there's clearly a large
performance leap in some of the spot
checks when jumping between high and
highest settings with Nvidia Hardware
we're seeing 60 to 70 percent for the
GTX 10 16 some of these tests with AMD
Hardware we're seeing 90 to 100 percent
2x increase and saw the benchmarks by
going down too high from highest this is
something we'll explore more in a moment
but Andy's frame time performance
particularly and markedly improves when
going to the high setting where in the
highest it doesn't really do too well to
compete with Nvidia and high it's really
not bad so just if you're an AMD owner
take note you'll probably want at least
in the beta for however long as last
left of it at this point
you'll want to use high rather than
highest if you're having issues with
frame times if you're seeing stuttering
for instance or if you're just not happy
with the frame rate things may change as
the game and
was mature but this is what we know for
now in the interim there's clearly a
benefit moving between settings so let's
take a look at some of those
specifically with the rx 580 and figured
out which set of graphics options has
the biggest impact this chart shows the
RX 588 gigabyte card at 1440p using
highest fxaa as baseline and the high
preset as our target number which is
significantly higher in performance we
toggle the few settings between highest
and high ultimately finding that depth
of field settings are responsible for
about a 38 percent performance hit on
their own as switching to high boost FPS
from 38 to 62 average between the
highest and the high depth of field
configurations 3d ambient occlusion is
also responsible for about 13% of the
performance hit on its own moving us to
44 FPS from 38 FPS average if you'd like
to play on highest settings without
sacrificing too much performance these
are the two options immediately worth
tweaking they seem to presently impact
AMD the most noticeably including the
vega card and the RX 500 series that we
tested here and all that should give a
pretty good idea of a few key things
first of all because this is a beta
because drivers may change for both Andy
and Nvidia destiny 2 may further develop
the thing to take away here other than
performance today if you want to play
today is the variance between
multiplayer and singleplayer
we'll look again when the game launches
but for now it looks pretty consistent
and that's a good thing for benchmarking
purposes and if you want to compare a
single-player forints and then the
difference between graphics settings
particularly high and highest with the
biggest gains coming out of dropping to
high there's a pretty big difference
there and quick side note when talking
about a single player we're really just
talking about the campaign it drops you
into when you start the game technically
that's still multiplayer but it's a
campaign not competitive multiplayer
that's what we're going for here
so anyway competitive multiplayer and
the campaign are pretty close
performance the cards in general at
1080p with high settings everyone we
tested was fairly playable at all over
60fps I think maybe exception of one
and going up to 1080p highest cutoff a
few of the lower end cars but 10 65 80
and up can kind of do it you might want
to drop some settings on the lower ones
for the rest as long as you're at high
settings you're probably okay for most
of the modern cards we didn't get to
test the gtx 960 AMD cards for this one
but we'll consider them once the game
properly launches and more drivers are
out but for now that's your introductory
