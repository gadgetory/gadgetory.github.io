dotnet and what you're looking at right
now is footage of the witcher 3 at its
basically max graphics settings i have a
few things tweaked and it's at 4k
currently of course the video will be
limited to whatever YouTube limits it to
but it is at 4k resolution I'm running
this on to sli gtx 980 s now this is
part of our benchmark so what you're
watching right now is the official
benchmarking course that we've designed
to use in the game this is the first
area in the game that you really reach
and it has a couple of elements in it
that are critical to testing the
performance of video cards under
different conditions one of those things
is water there's water settings in the
game so we have some water here at the
beginning to test that there's a lot of
grass which is very relevant to pc
performance as we found out with GTA 5
and there is a grass detail and foliage
detail item in the options for the
witcher 3 and there's also all kinds of
other stuff like chromatic aberration
and post-processing special effects and
these are things that I will define for
you in an upcoming video just like we
did with GTA 5 where I had a graphics
definitions guide so we'll be doing that
again shortly but first I just wanted to
upload this video of the benchmark or
show you what it looks like what I'm
spending the next few hours doing and
hopefully by the end of the night unless
I run into more issues which i have done
already we will have the full GPU
benchmark online followed by additional
content of the witcher 3 as it relates
to pc hardware so that is all for this
video i just wanted to give you a look
into what the next 24 hours or so of
work will we'll be looking at and it's
mostly just going to be this part of the
game over and over and over and over for
every single video card that I've got
available which is a lot maybe 10 or
more configurations if you like this
content or if you like the content that
will be coming shortly please like
subscribe as always and we do have a
patreon page now I'm trying to start
building that up if you like our content
you like our journalistic approach and
appreciate that we approach things with
a more real look and a less marketing
driven enthusiastic look then definitely
check out the patreon page it helps a
lot I will see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
