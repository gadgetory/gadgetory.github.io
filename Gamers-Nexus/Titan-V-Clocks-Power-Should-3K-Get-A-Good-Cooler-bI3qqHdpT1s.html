the core well we did the Titan V was
actually one of the better overclocking
cards we've worked with this year the
biggest problem with though is thermals
and then to a lesser extent although not
that much power so this is where we're
focusing on the power consumption of the
card the thermals of the MOSFETs the GPU
and the thermal performance of this
cooler which has some slight
modifications over the Titan XP and
we're gonna look at how much room we
have for improvement when moving to our
hybrid mod which is hopefully coming up
soon before we get into that this
content is brought to you by the thermal
take flow RGB closed-loop liquid cooler
which is a three hundred sixty
millimeter radiator plus three one
twenty fans that are RGB illuminated the
if then we'll take it rain fans at that
this is a four point five done a detect
pump which is one of the faster pumps
you can learn more at the link in the
description below so some quick errata
from the teardown video after posting
our teardown video where I basically
said the vapor chamber in here is pretty
much the same as a Titan XP vapor
chamber sends a couple of small fin
differences and differences in how the
rear end of the vapor chamber kind of
swoops up on the side the correction
received was that Nvidia basically
changed the fin stack to be copper as
well so it's not just the cold plate of
the vapor chamber it's also the fins now
that's not that relevant as you're gonna
see in a moment because it's still this
cooler on a high wattage card and it's
power-hungry card it drives a lot of
heat so it's kind of nebulous how
helpful that change is considering that
just moving to a completely different
cooler altogether would probably be the
better move in terms of peak performance
but NVIDIA doesn't tend to want to do
that for their Titan Class cards which
is potentially some mixture of the
audience not carrying or maybe they
don't have the noise concerns or they
put them in rack mount boxes or
something here's what I want to know if
you're someone who buys this or the
Titan XP or any card like that that is a
potentially targeted at workstation deep
learning machine learning let me know
below if there's
you would like to keep this cooler as
opposed to having a better one on there
that might be dual axial for example if
you just have two fans blowing down onto
it in a traditional open-faced cooler
design let me know if there's a reason
for that I suppose exhausting heat out
of a box but if you're doing it at the
expense of choking or GPU significantly
which worried about the show then is it
really worth it that's what I want to
know so we're looking at this card the
cooler and the thermal the sort of
results that we got for everything and
we're gonna start with some clock versus
temperature performance it will give us
an understanding of how the clock
behaves on the Titan v card including
how it down clocks or how it attempts to
regulate itself to control temperatures
prior to diving into thermals we can
start by looking at baseline performance
with Auto settings and then our
overclock and then we'll look at where
the thermal limitations are being
encountered this chart shows a frequency
over time during an automated run of
firestrike ultra extreme and normal
followed by time spy at stock auto
settings the Titan V is operating in a
peak clock of about 1770 megahertz and
gradually diminishes throughout each
test pass which you can see after the
gaps where it falls down to an idle rate
if we begin to plot core temperature
which is the same benchmark you'll
notice that our peaks to 84 degrees drop
clocks almost immediately and what
appears to be inversely proportional to
temperature rise not exactly how it
works but you get the idea these tests
aren't even that long they're less than
a minute each in most cases and we're
still slamming against the 84 degree
while that Pascal and Volta carry the
stock cooler is incapable of keeping up
with the power load generated by the
card when left to self-regulate
let's manually impose a 100% fan speed
for the next round so this chart shows
the complete stock settings except with
a fan boosted to max speed this is
primarily to understand performance and
is not sustainable in any real
environment as noise output for this is
at around 60 DBA
still looking at frequency we see that
between auto and 100% fan curves with no
overclocks at all the frequency picks up
considerably in a few of these tests we
also see differences of up to 100
megahertz and a bit beyond in some
instances that's a lot of performance
left on the table just because we're
using this bad cooler on the Titan V
these data points illustrate that we are
throttling hard on thermals well before
we run into power limits but those are
the next limitation as for how hard that
impacts performance here are the fire
strike ultra scores for the auto card
leave 100% fans beat card and the
overclocked card the stock card pushed a
graphic score of 77 48 points while the
stock card with a 100% fan speed gave us
a couple percent boost about two percent
our fully overclocked card is well
beyond both of these numbers and part of
that is just because we increase the
power target as well so running into
thermal limits giving us a two percent
reduction and then running into power
limits fire strike extreme has the
difference between the stock and 100%
speed tests at 2.7 percent I've seen
here and so the scaling changes based
upon what test you're doing this next
chart shows our overclocked performance
with a two hundred megahertz core and
HBM overclock our court now pushes
toward two gigahertz at times this is
compared to the previous clocks that
were 300 megahertz lower in the worst
cases this performance disparity is from
three different factors we've increased
the power budget eliminating that
concern and have increased the fan
speeds 100% eliminating the thermal
concern we've also manually overclocked
the card and all three of these produced
the chart-topping performance numbers
that we showed in our previous gaming
benchmark video for the Titan V looking
at thermals the fan speed increase helps
prolong the time window before reaching
the clock limiters at 84 degrees and
Beyond
still towards the end of the longer test
we were getting up to around 87 degrees
resulting in clock drops over the
duration of that test at 120 percent
power target though the temperature
target changes to 89 degrees if you just
allow the slider to match with the power
target just to demonstrate the previous
generation this chart shows stock Titan
XP vs. stock Titan V scores the Titan XP
holds a higher clock when both are left
to self regulate but it's still beaten
in most tests by the Titan V you can
learn more about that in our again
previous Titan be gaming benchmarks
video this helps illustrate that the
core count increase negatively impacts
maximum stock clocks that's not
to anyone but is made up for in
benchmarks that can actually leverage
those cores times pi is a good example
and one which leverages lower level
programming to distribute load more
evenly across additional cores to keep
more simultaneous in-flight instructions
going to all of these shaders let's move
on to component temperatures the chart
shows the GPU temperature and two MOSFET
case temperatures measured by
thermocouples that we mounted to various
locations on the card the left side
Center MOSFET runs warmest at sixty
seven point seven degrees with the right
side middle MOSFET at fifty one point
nine degrees Celsius both of these
values are well within spec these parts
can take 125 degrees plus without issue
or without much of an issue other than D
rating and some life span hid and this
follows the trend of nvidia founders
cards typically having more than
adequate cooling for VRMs despite these
somewhat awful cooling for the GPU
itself they do actually do a decent job
at keeping the prm's cooled part of this
is the selection of the V RMS and the
power that the power stages can handle
we've seen this previously on reference
10 series GPUs and the MOSFET
temperatures here are completely
controlled the GPU however isn't we're
bumping against 84 degrees frequently
which means clock regulation over time
this frequency chart from our 30 minute
fire strike burnin shows rapid clock
degradation upon hitting the 84 degree
wall where the cards at stock
configuration automatically regulates
its clock speeds this brings us down
from 1837 megahertz to 1702 megahertz
and is another demonstration of why
Titan V could be so much more powerful
if they just put a better cooler on it
this is sort of a repeat or a broken
record of what we said about Titan XP
when we did the hybrid model on that we
looking into that more shortly well
you're not noise normalize temperatures
is almost pointless as the Titan V just
won't be able to compete with AIB
partner models of lower end hardware
even though lower end in this instance
is a relative reference to the 1080 Ti
still if you wanted to keep a 40 decibel
operating noise level the guard would
throttle down heavily and operate with a
GPU core temperature of 90 degrees plus
with MOSFET hot spot temperatures of 71
degrees plus and that's in open-air with
a case you'd be in worse shape for
almost all instances the MOSFETs are
still fully within reason but the core
is throttling us hard this card runs hot
and also
loud with its 61 decibel max output at
100% which is really barely enough to
sustain the overclock as we had it
configured with the 40 DBA tests it
helps to know our noise levels the Titan
V operates similar noise levels to other
Nvidia reference GPUs we're measuring
about 31 DBA Idol with the average fan
speed under Otto conditions placing us
at around 48 DBA and going to 100% speed
has that 61 overall it's quieter than a
reference Vega cooler but it's still
ultimately inadequate as a cooling
solution 44% puts us around 40 DBA just
for reference to the previous charts
this set of charts will show a total
system power consumption went under
gaming workloads well start with 3dmark
fire strike in this test the Titan V
stock card is drawing 350 watts from the
wall for the entire system comparing
this to its neighbors with the same
system and power supply we're at 345
watts on the Titan XP 381 on the Vega
frontier edition air card and 347 on the
stock EVGA tenet ET ISC to the
overclocked Titan V starts really
pulling down power here pushing up to
440 to watch total systems drawn fire
strike this puts us on par with our
power play table modded Vega 56 with a
liquid cooler which consumes 447 watts
for the system though we've later pushed
that card up to more than 400 watts on
its own measured with a clamp on the
12-volt rails the difference is that we
had a power target of 200% offset on the
modern Vega card and part of this
inefficiency on the Titan V likely comes
down to Volta not being a gaming
targeted architecture with all these
components on the die that go unused
when gaming or benchmarking fire strike
moving on to Ghost Recon wildlands the
Titan VIII system pulls 388 watch one
stock with a Titan XP at about 375 watt
stock remember this is total system
power draw not clamped draw for a
neighbor comparison the 1080 Ti
demonstrates its performance efficiency
at 370 watts for the EVGA sc2 and
overclocking our Titan VIII without any
mods to it at all gets it to around 420
Watts right around where our overclocked
Titan XP landed the power modded Vega 56
card is the most power hungry here at
476 watts for the system as compared to
its stock 332 while total system
seongjun the titan be overclocked system
is Pauline 8.3% more power than the
stock card idle power consumption has
our complete system at around 80 watts
with the card just draw in enough power
for the fan and some signaling that's
pushing less than a couple of watts
through the 12-volt rails going as the
PCIe connectors so the takeaway here is
a repeat of what we said about the Titan
XP takeaway basically ignoring the cards
actual performance capabilities and they
were impressive in some instances
specifically asynchronous compute
workloads DirectX 12 Vulcan low-level
API is ignoring those and looking just
at the thermals it's severely limited
with the current cooler so it's possible
that a company like EVGA could put out
some kind of aftermarket hybrid solution
for example which would solve those
problems you'd have to buy it and
assemble it yourself though because
Nvidia is the only supplier for this
card so there will be no AIB partner
models unless you're buying aftermarket
coolers and adding them and if you're
interested in that let them know because
they're probably not gonna make it
without significant interest any of
these companies there's a three thousand
dollar card and how many people buy that
and then mod it is the question we're
gonna be one of those groups of people
though we are modding it hopefully to be
a hybrid card which means we're gonna
add a liquid cooler to it now the big
challenge here is that the mounting hole
spacing is different from what we're
used to
I don't think it's even the same
mounting hole spacing as the Vega
Frontier addition card and so we're
gonna have to get out a drill and make a
plate ourselves to solve that problem
you also have issues where the HBM is
very fragile and so with the wrong
mounting pressure it's pretty easy to
crack those dies you have to start with
just enough pressure to get contact and
make them stop moving around on the
plate and then go from there but the
cooler itself stock is not impressive
it's actually pretty bad these blower
coolers including the one that it's on
top of they're all pretty bad compared
to anything that you'd want for actual
performance out of the car because it's
dropping clocks it's like a hundred
megahertz off the top just out of the
box basically it's got all this
performance on the table you don't even
have to overclock to get it you don't
need to go into precision and set at 200
yards offset it's just not necessary to
get that extra speed because
the core the GPU itself under boost 3.0
has the capability to push up to a limit
there are three limits with booster you
point out there's power which we're not
hitting there's voltage which we're not
hitting there's thermals which we are
heading at 84 degrees so with a better
cooler just let's just play pretend and
say there's a water cooler on here out
of the box you put it in the system it's
gonna run about a hundred to 100 70
megahertz faster depending on what kind
of scenario you're in with a stock card
how bad your case is how bad your room
ambient temperature is all that stuff
that's a lot of performance you can get
back for basically nothing and then once
you go beyond that it gets the
overclocking and overclocking this card
it's actually going to the positives for
a second it's a very good overclocker we
were pretty impressed with it and after
some mods shunt mods or liquid cooling
mods we expect it'll do a whole lot
better but with a better cooler on there
to start man it be it just be a lot more
impressive of card cuz just in the
gaming results alone ignoring anything
that is bills for in the compute world
the gaming results alone with these
bigger overclocks on the stock cooler we
were seeing gains that were sometimes 20
22 percent higher than the stock card
which is kind of insane in a good way so
it's got a whole lot of room here it's
really easy to push the card pretty far
200 megahertz core and HBM and it's just
being choked by this cooler which is
unfortunate and it comes back to the
question at the beginning of the video
when do you want this cooler as a
legitimate user of this card because I
can think of a few core reasons for
cards that aren't this like let's say
the 10 series the 10 series you might
want to cool it like this or Vega 56
cooler if you are an SI and you want
something that you can roll out easily
repair and service easily and you know
will work in poorly maintained
environments which would be most si
customers probably that would be one
reason another reason would be if you're
using a small box and you need to
exhaust heat out of the entire box like
if you have a radiator that's front
mounted and pulling in hot air you need
to get that out of the case you can suck
it through the video card video cards
not gonna be happy with you but it be
great way to get air out of the case
that's already been warmed so those are
some legitimate reasons do either of
those or does the latter one apply to an
actual user of this card though is what
I want to know and I don't know that
we'll get many answers because I would
doubt that many people are buying one of
these but if you were a Titan XP
purchaser the same question applies to
you as enthusiasts though and this card
isn't really meant for you either
but as enthusiasts looking at this type
of cooler in general yeah they tend to
be pretty disappointing fortunately
there are aftermarket mods we can do is
just gonna take some work and we'll have
a video series on that so subscribe for
