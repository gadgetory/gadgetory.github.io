cases with all the cpus and gpus lately
case isn't cooling haven't gotten a
whole lot of attention really out of any
of the media coverage so we are back now
with a case revival this is the fractal
define c is a relative newcomer to the
market at least in fractals lineup i'll
be looking at that today it's got more
of a stout nature it's professional and
discreet rather than gamer ii so that
means a lack of the RGB LED lighting
grays before getting to the fractal case
this content is brought to you by EVGA
and they're 1080i FTW three icx card the
FTW three will be available within the
next few weeks and aims to leverage its
icx sensors to track vrm and vram
temperatures in addition to usual GPU
temps click the link below for more
information
the fractal define c shifts in two main
variations there's the taller version
which is this one it's still a mid tower
and then one that chops a few inches off
the top to accommodate only micro ATX
and mini ITX boards this is a full ATX
support case so those are the two
options that the second one is the
define mini C and then there's also a
non windowed variant that's got some
extra foam padding in there we have the
windowed variant in terms of competition
the main things to look at would be
things like the be quiet
pure bay 600 which we somewhat recently
reviewed the Corsair 400 Q and 400 C is
sort of a mix in terms of fractals
windowed and non windowed versions and
then the NZXT s340 non elite which is
the oldest out of all those cases all of
those that tend to be in about the 70 to
95 dollar price range including this one
which has an MSRP of $90 the define C
has an emphasis on noise suppression and
at $90 it's got a lot of competition in
the mid tower market the price point
right now is burgeoning with those
options from Corsair njp be quiet
fractal cooler master and basically
everyone else that's a very competitive
price point let's run through the specs
before getting to the review the define
seed measures in at 400 by 2 10 by 453
millimeters and weighs Jeff 6.8
kilograms are about 15 pounds that makes
a define see one of the lighter smaller
cases we've looked at in recent history
and looks are pretty plain with this
case
tall black steel and plastic with
roughly 1 millimetre thick steel for the
motherboard panel construction is good
and materials fit the price with cause
primarily cuts in the form of acting not
necessary extras like the optical drive
limited drive cages and things like that
externally the defined seat is made up
of soft brushed plastic paneling and a
steel side panels with side ventilation
for the single intake van and that is in
the front our version of the defined C
has a window which means no foam on that
side but it does have foam padding on
the other panels for the most part the
windowless version has additional foam
padding on the left side panel and those
side panels for what it's worth
ends out like a door rather than relying
on Eclipse and we like this small
function focus move it's something that
a lot of case manufacturers have started
doing and hopefully they can move away
from the fragile metal tabs the PSU and
drive cage are hidden by a shroud that
covers the entire bottom of the case as
the FC xlvii of standardization a few
years ago but there's one notable change
here the front of the shroud on the
define c can be popped out allowing the
drive cage to be removed and replaced
with a 120 millimeter bottom front
intake fan or a radiator that covers the
full height of the case or both
technically the define C can support
three sixty millimeter radiators in the
front that would be a tight fit and
restricts 3.5 inch drive support 240
milliliters is still perfectly usable
and top mount radiators are also
supported up to 240 millimeters this can
be done by removing the ventilation
cover at the top and replacing it
instead with an included mesh dust
filter you'll want to install the CPU
cooler prior to installing the
motherboard in this case as space is
limited in the enclosure and doing so
after the fact would be a bit rough and
likewise while you're at it try to wrap
those EPS 12-volt cables before
installing the board for the same reason
it does get tight in there once you
actually have components in the system
so do all the pre installation you can
before actually assembling the thing
cable management is done without the
help of a cable management bar instead
resorting to a more traditional rear
panel channeling the define C has one
channel that's 35 millimeters deep and
that's enough to fit really every cable
in the system if you wanted to with the
rest of the side paneling
about 15 millimeters of space still
plenty though the 24-pin should probably
routed through the deeper channel the
define see we're looking at has its
intention somewhere between the 400 C
windowed and the 400 Q quiet version of
the case and then the pure vase 600
which is a very quiet case so somewhere
in that range the two included 120
millimeter fans that are installed on
the define C are in the same orientation
that these six hundreds were would be
quiet 600 that is and it may be the most
valid direct comparison for both thermal
and acoustic tests case fans were at max
rpm for all tests with the defined C and
as always for testing methodology check
the review link below written by Patrick
lates and that's got all the test
methods that we have for thermals and
for noise you can learn more about how
they are conducted there for performance
tests we tested with the mod u vent
cover on and off and the mod you vent TM
is a section of top of the case that can
be removed is a panel that can be pulled
out and thus preserves a trademark just
like the pure bass 600 the fractal
defined C is able to leverage at some
modularity of a top panel so you could
swap in a mesh if you preferred over the
cover for CPU temperatures at CPU delta
T hit fifty five point eight Celsius
with the top open and fifty five point
seven C with top closed which is
effectively identical and well within
test variant the cooler we currently
used for case tests is oriented so that
it upholds air from the front of the
case and exhausted out the back leaving
that no real opportunity for air to
travel upwards then escape at the top so
these results make sense the vent on the
top of the case is nice but there's no
real reason to ever have it open unless
you have a radiator up there or have
mounted exhaust or intake fans at the
top the CPU temperatures are okay but
not incredible compared to our other
reviews the BitFenix Shogun with an
additional 140 millimeter fan on the
front and the SP 40 elite at its maximum
rpm scored similarly to the crackle to
find C but neither we're cooling
champions the front intake fan is
responsible for aiming air at both the
CPU and the GPU in this case and a few
degrees of improvement could be expected
from adding another fan and rearranging
airflow in the front and you do have
capacity to do that we need to buy an
extra fan still the default fan
arrangement is identical to the pure
base 600 s which got a lot warmer with
its tiny and restrictive air intake of
the front thanks to the heavy mesh
paneling two layers of it actually
moving out to GPU temperatures the
downfall of cases with full shrouds is
normally poor GPU temperatures there was
a slight improvement in GPU Delta P with
the top open but that was less than 1
degree and therefore not really a
significant difference it's not worth
the extra dust with the radiator
installed and it's really getting kind
of close to margin of error or variance
within test sort of outside of it but
very close GPU DT was 57.4 Celsius with
the top open at maximum case fan rpm
making the GPU and the define C slightly
warmer than the SP 40 elite despite its
travels and slightly warmer than the
pure base six hundreds best effort of
fifty five point six degrees for hot
GPUs like blower fan arrangements a low
intake fan or replacement of the drive
cage with a bottom intake is something
we consider a must but if you have a
better cooler and can withstand those
slightly higher fan RPMs on the GPU as
then you'll probably be okay
looking at noise now the defined C
windowed version has one fewer noise
damping panel than the non windowed
variety noise levels remain
competitively low regardless of this as
Patrick said and his written review the
defined C is a strong contender in our
quietest cases that don't directly
reference silence in the brand name
category at 34.8 DBA with top closed as
it generally should be and fans at
maximum rpm which they might not be in
fact the only case which beats the
defined C at a comparable fan speed is
the be quiet
pure bass 600 which has specially
designed fans that still rotate about
130 rpm slower and bares a warmer
interior this isn't a flashy or exciting
case but it's well-made and logical
which I suspect might be the highest
praise to fractals ears that's sort of
what they do in terms of GPU thermals
you could run into some issues
especially with those warmer blower fan
setup to where you really don't
generally get above 50 to 55 percent fan
speed on the native
serve for the fan but if you're running
anything decent and are okay with a
potentially higher GPA fan speed if you
want to sustain those higher boost 3.0
enabled clocks on nvidia or higher boost
clocks on AMD then it's not a bad case
the thermals are really the only weak
point here and that's not an uncommon
thing when we look at cases that are
somewhat silent by design or not in this
case it's a pretty quiet case 34 35
decibels DBA output on the bench is one
of the best performers so they have done
well in that category it's also discreet
it's got some professionalism to it that
would allow you to put the case in an
office if you want it to but if you want
something more flashy clearly this isn't
the right case for you there are plenty
of other options and we've reviewed a
lot of them so you can dig through the
channel or the website for those in
terms of these define C on its
positioning at $90 the price seems about
right it competes very directly with a
be quiet
pure bass 600 it's pretty close to the
400 C and Q it's about five dollars
different not 100% the same market but
close enough that if you wanted a mix of
performance and silence we would
definitely encourage looking at the 400
series Corsair cases because they're
strong competitors to this the define C
is well priced for anyone who wants a
smaller footprint case it's definitely a
stout unit and compared to some of the
other things we've looked at lately and
it's also a good fit if you want
something that is objectively quiet it
is again one of the quietest cases
thermals not great as stated but you
could definitely deal with them consider
buying a fan with this case and throw it
in the front and then offset the
positioning a bit so that you can align
one of the fans better with the GPU and
one better with the CPU you'd be in
pretty good shape overall and might even
be able to drop an RPM which would mean
that you wouldn't really gain in the
noise category overall well built one
shortfall being thermals is not a bad
thing you can find at links in the
