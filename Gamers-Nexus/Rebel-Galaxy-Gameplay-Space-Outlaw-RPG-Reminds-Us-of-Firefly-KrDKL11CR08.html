donna and today we're talking about
rebel galaxy which is a space RPG in the
truest sense based in sort of an outlaw
ridden territory out in space the
universe is entirely randomly generated
and it is single player so it's really
nothing like a lot of the space games
currently out and currently pending
release unlike the simulator games
including star citizen and elite
dangerous and all of that ilk rebel
galaxy is more of an RPG in the
traditional sense it is more comparable
in that regard to something like fantasy
RPG where you've got your character you
advance them and you upgrade their
equipment stuff like that it's more like
that less like an intense simulator to
this end rebel galaxy is very accessible
the controls can be packed onto a
controller so it's it's not really using
the whole keyboard like a lot of
simulators do like star citizen does and
there's nothing wrong with using the
whole keyboard for your control scheme
it's just definitely very inaccessible
to a lot of users who don't want or
desire or have ever played that type of
game and it's definitely less accessible
to users who are more time limited like
myself to be honest rebel galaxy in this
way is a sort of breath of fresh air to
the space genre and this breath of fresh
air is largely thanks to the experience
of the team behind it it has been made
by two people almost in its entirety and
perhaps in its entirety I'm not 100%
sure on that definitely two core people
here Travis baldry and eric schaeffer if
those names ring a bell it is because
they are the creators of games like
torchlight by runic games which was a
very successful indie diablo clone air
quotes around the clone there and then
they also have experience with diablo
the very first one at blizzard north
back way before the merger of blizzard
and activision and all that went down so
they have experience with very
successful hack and slash action games
that i hesitate to call rpgs the reason
i hesitate to call them that is because
they're not really that story driven if
we're honest with the genre of hack and
slash and also the developers of rebel
GALEX you want to make sure that the
audience and their potential players
understand this is not going to be
diablo in space it is not dungeon
crawling even though the unit
is randomly generated it's not sort of
haphazard till it looted sell it it
doesn't take that path now you can take
that path if you really want to just
destroy everything but it's got more
depth than that and there are aliens you
can interact with just as one would
expect you can help them ignore them
destroy them that sort of deal pretty
standard as you perform these actions
with each of your encounters you build
faction standing and disposition with
that faction that they represent so you
can build in alliance with certain space
factions and you can build rivalries
with others and this impacts how your
interactions in space unfold as you
venture into new sectors and territories
of that space and because the game is a
randomly generated universe it sort of
lends itself naturally that this is not
a persistent universe online in any
sense of the word it is entirely
single-player the marketplace is
entirely single-player the economy is
entirely single player it is a contained
box for you to play in and if that's not
what you want then it's probably a good
idea to look into the games like elite
dangerous star citizen and the many
others coming out and if you want any
more competitive versus experience you
should look at the dread-nots there are
a lot of great space titles right now
this does not have to be the one for you
that said not many of the space titles
are a single player and the ones that
are are certainly not necessarily
developed with teams as experienced at
delivering an RPG experience as these
guys sir rebel galaxy I had about 30
minutes to play which is not a lot of
time to get a preview end but with this
game it was enough time to feel very
comfortable with the controls which
speaks volumes to its control scheme and
the fact that it is more accessible and
I was able to really get a feel of the
game and how it would progress in rebel
galaxy you play large dreadnought class
ships at the end game and you start a
little bit smaller but it is still not a
fighter pilot game you're really not
meant to be a solo operative in a jet
that does dog fighting that's that's not
what this is about it's more about
frigate like combat similar to the days
of naval combat or piracy or black flag
if you're playing Assassin's Creed it's
got that sort of feel to it in that your
ships will be manned by in some cases
hundreds and
of crew members and each of those crew
members operates dozens of cannons for
broadsides and laser weapons and flat
cannons and all these different
armaments on your ship and they can even
be tuned for AI if you don't want to
play or control them to target specific
things on enemy ships so you could have
your flat cannons target incoming
missiles you have your lasers target
enemy weapons on their ships and so
forth and really what you're going to be
doing in combat is sort of playing out
semi cinematic battles where you're
taking down dozens of fighter pilots who
are solo operatives or just larger
dreadnought class ships like yourself
and as you progress you gain funds just
like any RPG buying your ships you buy
upgrades and that sort of thing I want
to make very clear that this game is a
buy want game you pay for it one time
it's kind of sad i have to say that
these days but you pay for it once
there's no microtransaction behind the
scenes and then you're done it is not a
free-to-play game either though so keep
that in mind we're told it's probably
going to be about a twenty dollar price
point but I'm not a hundred percent sure
if that is finalized yet to this end I
think it's very noteworthy that Travis
baldry one of the two creators on rebel
galaxy said to me at our meeting that he
is not a fan of microtransactions
because he wants the developers role in
the game to be to build it solitude and
then get out of the way he said do not
stand in my way of the experience and I
have to say I agree with that I do like
that approach to things that doesn't
really mean that the gameplay is going
to be great but it is a good philosophy
in my opinion so rebel galaxy this is a
game I would play there and how many of
those if I'm honest I play them at a lot
at conventions but very few of them do I
walk away saying you know I would pay
for this and play it in my free time and
rebel galaxy is one of those I am a fan
of the direction it's taking it is a
high-fidelity beautifully rendered game
for it really such a small indie team
and I think they've got the right idea
for what they're trying to build it is
not out yet it will be out sometime this
year obviously I only had limited time
with the game and with the developers so
i can't speak to a full review i can't
tell you yes go by this no don't buy
this yet stay tuned subscribe to the
channel and will
what we think when the full review is
out but in the meantime it is definitely
a game to pay attention to and consider
buying once we've got a full review
online that is all for this video I will
see you all next time peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
