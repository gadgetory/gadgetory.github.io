whole lot of hate for switching back to
Intel from risin in his video talking
about the new Intel hardware
acceleration in Adobe Premiere and to a
very large extent it pretty much proves
the point that the blind fanboy ISM is
just completely deprived of any kind of
logic its bereft of any any logical
ability to look at data and and agree
that yes for his use case it made sense
to do what he was doing and today we're
actually validating some of that testing
not for any other reason then we've been
looking at building a new rendering rig
and at the end of the day Dmitri makes
different types of videos than us so we
might have different needs we thought
it's worth running some of the similar
similar tests with the IGP hardware
acceleration to see if it makes sense to
go with a thousand plus dollar CPU or a
$300 one with an AI GP that would
otherwise never be used so that's what
we're doing today before that this video
is brought to you by thermal Grizzly's
high-end thermal paste and liquid metal
thermal Grizzly's cryo knot is an
affordable high quality thermal compound
that doesn't face some of the aging
limitations of other pastes on the
market cryo not has a thermal
conductivity of 12.5 watts per meter
Kelvin focuses on endurance is easy to
spread and isn't electrically conductive
making it safe to use on GPU dies
thermal grizzly also makes conductor not
liquid metal which we've used to drop 20
degrees off some temperatures than our
dee-lighted tests by a tube at the link
in the description below so for these
tests we're looking at Adobe Premiere
encoding and rendering exclusively there
are obviously use cases for high core
count CPUs look at Blender we've done
those tests it's not the point today
it's not the point to try and make your
favorite 1000 plus dollar CPU until
there Andy look good the point is we're
doing this for ourselves selfishly to
figure out what we need and if you
happen to be someone who does a lot of
video editing and production maybe your
videos are similar to ours in some ways
this data should be comparable for you
so you can figure out what's the best
choice for your build if you're working
with Adobe Premiere primarily now
obviously if you're working with things
like blender you have more stuff to
consider but for Adobe Premiere they got
an update recently it's it's one of the
few updates from a doe
that doesn't instantly cause crashing
and freezes and all kinds of fun
features and in fact adds IGP
utilization on the CPU so if you have an
integrated graphics processor on an
Intel CPU ie and 8700 K then premier can
now leverage that and rendering to
accelerate the rendering just like you
can leverage CUDA and it can actually do
both at the same time it's actually very
interesting because we've been looking
at using a sixty nine hundred K for a
new system build we want to do but a
seven hundred K might actually be better
and it's easier to get in terms of it's
cheaper and it's worth less on our shelf
than high-end CPU so these are 100% real
videos we're testing with today these
are videos that we actually made in the
last week or so rendered in their
entirety and uploaded and we're using 4k
videos for the most part but we have one
1080 video and that's a builds or video
that we have erm analysis we uploaded so
there's an interesting main here and
that having the significantly reduced
pixel count with a 1080 video versus a
4k video has actually serious
implications for rendering performance
so if you're doing video editing for
your own YouTube channel or whatever and
you do 1080 maybe 1080 60 like we do
instead of 4k then the numbers are not
going to be the same as 4k numbers for
rendering they leverage different parts
of the hardware in different ways and
also we noted a couple of interesting
things where GPU usage is significantly
higher in our videos where we have
charts being drawn so actually in this
video you'll see some charts when those
are on the screen the CPU usage plummets
during rendering and the GPU usage goes
up a lot as an example with thread
Ripper and we'll show this later 1950 X
we saw CPU utilization and a dual encode
meaning two videos simultaneously
dropped from a hundred percent during a
role which is this right now this this
is a role where I'm on camera there was
a hundred percent with that and that's
with color correction and other small
effects may be some transforms opposed
the color correction and just a roll
which is a lot of pixels so one hundred
percent usage and then a chart pops up
and now CPU utilization on the 1950 X
was 43 percent but GPU usage went up
from 40
to 88% and that's on the cuda
accelerated 1080i so no IGP there so
that's the kind of thing we're talking
about where usage matters and dimitri
certainly had a point to switch to intel
for his use case i frankly don't fully
understand all the hate they got for
that specific video it's not like it was
a vacuum video it was him switching
platforms because it works better for
him and honestly the intense love of the
downvote button on anything where
someone's like i'm switching from xcp of
hawaii cpu is mind-blowing the fact that
people can't look past their their sheer
blind fanboy ISM which by itself is
mind-boggling even have that mentality
to see that yes this particular
individual is better served by another
component than the component that I
personally like I don't I don't know how
we get there but it's it's really just
perplexing to see I really truly don't
get it and honestly it's stupid if you
have that mentality it's a very bad one
you should get rid of it so let's move
on G 5,600 review is the first one this
is a review of a CPU we did recently it
is the entire review so it gives us an
idea of how long it takes to render an
actual review video that we make which
is again for our selfish purposes for
figuring out what we're going to use in
the future or entering machines so we'll
start with a rendering of our Intel G
5600 review it's a 16 minute video that
uses color correction to adaptive noise
reduction the Intel i7 8700 K isn't
impressive when looking at the older
method of software rendering and proves
to be the slowest of all the CPUs tested
the stock 8700 K takes 46 minutes or
about 12 percent longer than the r7
2,700 ex stock CPU and when overclocked
to 5 gigahertz it's still at 43 minutes
an 8 percent reduction in time required
but still slower than even a stock 2700
ex using Hardware encoding pushes work
to the IGP which is typically left
completely unused when leaning on a D
GPU for CUDA acceleration and also even
when you're not even just software
accelerated before this update it didn't
do anything
integrated graphics processors in the
ACE how hard K accelerate the rendering
to 32 to 30
three minutes a reduction of 30% in time
required to render this is also 20%
shorter in render duration than the 2700
X stock CPU resulting in a complete
shuffling of the leader board for
high-end parts specifically for purposes
of our rendering workstation this is
basically invalidating both the threader
for 1950 X and the Intel I 979 ATX II
technically speaking both are faster
than an 80 700 K but not proportionately
to their price the 1950 X is
functionally equivalent in render time
with stocks to stock differences totally
in three minutes against a 33 minute
render so about 8 to 10 ish percent sure
it's an op lift but it's not worth the
extra money of only using premier on the
system the 79ad XE is even worse in
value overclocked in to 4.6 gigahertz
which is our back supported overclock on
a 280 cooler allows us to finish the
render in twenty four point five minutes
and we wanted to pull 700 watts from the
wall and stick a 360 millimeter radiator
with loud fans on it we can push 4.9
gigahertz but just would not be worth it
and it's not really a good fit for 24/7
use at all either way stocks the
30-minute completion time isn't worth
the $2,000 plus costs not counting the
platform 87 hard K blows all of this
away and is a clear performer when it
has the IGP enabled for a 4k 60 DiDio
review basically with some charts and a
couple of other things that you can
actually see that's the cool thing about
these tests all of the rendering all of
the test cases go watch her videos and
you can see them and also we get more
views so it's it's a nice feedback loop
there definitely why we made it that way
not because it was just easier to test
that way so there's an argument to be
made for just raw performance and in a
production environment
sure I've actually argued this in the
past tune our reviews if you're a
professional and you have a lot of money
to spend on something then it might make
sense to go with something that's
fractionally faster single digit
percentages sure if it's a difference of
a thousand bucks maybe that means
nothing to you but here's the thing this
is our production environment we're
talking about so I don't really care
what anyone else is using the CPU
for keep that in mind for our production
environment we do have budgets to
consider contrary to popular belief I
don't just get any CPU I want from any
vendor all the time the 79 80 XE we have
the 1950 X we have they have to stay in
the CPU track tray for further testing
for benchmarking for content that's more
important than putting them in a machine
so if I wanted to use one I'd have to
buy it and put it in our next rendering
machine but we're talking about single
digit percentages before over clocks in
terms of advantages with those CPUs and
their 800 or $2,000 depending so you go
with an 8700 K in this instance with the
IGP that's like 300 something bucks and
that's it it's within single digit
percentages of a two thousand dollar
Intel CPU it's like premier has
single-handedly for this specific use
case of ours and validated the high-end
CPUs that we actually wanted to use by
enabling IGP rendering so it's awesome
to see it's kind of sad that it took so
long to get this and hopefully they can
stay on this and fix things like you
know the soft are not working in the
future as well let's look at this really
interesting chart next Adobe allows
users to perform simultaneous renders
about putting from the same project file
like from two separate sequences in this
use case the high-thread-count CPUs
showed their potential benefits we're at
46 minutes to render two files
simultaneously on the 79 80 X e whereas
we would have taken 60 minutes if
rendering them one by one on the 79 80 X
E and that's I mean refer to the
previous chart for those numbers it's 30
times to the 8700 K has the opposite
response it takes 76 minutes on a
software and hardware render 77 minutes
for dual software rendering and so many
two minutes for dual hardware or IGP
rendering in all three of these cases it
would be faster to render two files
sequentially rather than two files
synchronously or simultaneously on the
8700 K a single render would have taken
33 minutes two sequential renders would
have taken 66 and dual rendering takes
72 minutes on the 8700 K easy math this
tells us something critical and gives us
some insight we didn't have a moment ago
and that thing that it tells us is that
a 79 ad XE or
19:50 ice for that matter can be faster
when you're talking about rendering
multiple things simultaneously and
that's an interesting use case but not
one that applies to us so for our
purposes everything we do is sequential
we get the videos done and it's more or
less one at a time
render it keep moving because we don't
have a whole bunch of product projects
to just queue up and let them rip all at
once so there is a use case there if you
do that first of all I'd be curious to
know why like what what is your job that
you render two things at the same time
or more in the same Adobe Media encoder
window because that's interesting but
also that would be a potential use case
for a high end CPU where you do actually
get significant benefit from having the
threads but what this teaches us is that
Adobe Media encoder premier in general
when rendering they care far more about
frequency for the most part there's
obviously there's a bit of a lien on the
GPU potentially on the IEP but frequency
matters the most for our type of
rendering and having more threads
there's diminishing returns there
because you do sacrifice frequency for
it unless you're doing dual or multi
rendering at the same time you're
encoding multiple things at once then
yes it does actually help to have all
those threads because the the frequency
doesn't matter as much anymore but if
you're doing synchronous versus
sequential sequential does actually seem
to care about frequency first next one
builds a video for us we have a 1080p
file with no effects and it behaves a
lot differently from our usual 4k
correction having final outputs we used
one of our builds with videos for this
which is rendered at 1080p 60 a lower
bitrate and has no special effects in
this test we observed no measurable
performance improvement with hardware
acceleration
there's just nothing for it to
accelerate you won't see the gains of
GPU acceleration if there's nothing to
use a GPU on you'd want transforms or
similar effects to get some value out of
the IGP
for a straight 1080p file even running a
798 exe or 1950 X doesn't really change
things meaningfully anyone rendering
files similar to this one would not need
high-end hardware or even IGP
acceleration that said CUDA acceleration
still helps and is enabled on all of
these tests
speaking of CUDA acceleration we decided
to torture ourselves just to give you an
idea of how much that still matters with
CUDA acceleration disabled in our NZXT
m22 review render it took the 8700 ka
350 minutes that's five point eight
hours to render the same clip that was
finished in 34 minutes with software
rendering and CUDA using Hardware
rendering on the IGP and also CUDA by
the way we brought this down further to
21 minutes a reduction from the 34
minute prior time of 38 percent and a
reduction from the 350 minute time of a
lot of percent that's hands-down
impressive again and shows where we
should move for our next render machine
the 2700 X days closer to 30 minutes and
the 1950 X at 23 minutes with the 780 XE
at 20 minutes overclocked in the center
980 XE does get it a few minutes faster
than the 8700 Kate stock CPU with the
IGP assistance but at 2000 dollars
versus 350 it's simply not justifiable
for us remember we have to keep this CPU
the i9 for benchmarking so we'd have to
buy another one for rendering it's not
worth the cost finally for an ask GN
video one of our most popular series we
measured the 8700 K at 90 minutes
completion for both the stock and
overclocked variants when rendered
without IGP assistance enabling the IGP
brought us down to 53 and 58 minutes not
distant from the 1950 X and 79 80 X II
this type of video is intensive on the
CPU because there are very few
transforms and GPU accelerated effects
it's almost entirely straight a roll
would just specifically CPU intensive so
we're going to go over to the test bench
just for a second to get some hands-on
with what premiere does and what its
resource utilization looks like just to
give everyone a better idea of how it
behaves these days then we'll come back
here and do the wrap-up in conclusion
with how the effects are impacted as
well so here's the 8700 K now playing
back one of our clips and we can
actually set this to higher quality as
well so in certain playback right now
and if we look at task manager while
it's playing back what you'll see is
when it's playback a chart and it's
struggling a little bit here it sees all
that stuttered because I'm at full
quality right now
we're actually pushing the load
primarily to the
when it actually does load up but it's
just kind of spiking all over the place
and this is indicative of some Adobe
premier optimization issues that we're
all where there's really no there's
there's no clear single resource right
now let's take it on this processing
task so let's just drop this down to
more processable speed like half so you
have that changes things so now we're
getting is some more GPU load and this
is the Intel GPU the IGP so you see this
is actually a hundred percent load right
now the CPU is bounced between fifteen
and eighty percent depending on how much
the IGP is taking up there's some
latency between these two should not see
a perfect response between them and then
to the accelerations during some of the
rest it just depends on what kind of
image we're rendering presently in the
playback monitor so if we kind of jump
ahead maybe it's some arrow lure b-roll
which has this one's actually slowed
down so the speeds reduced on this to
smooth out the clip and the result is
the IGP is taking all the playback and
this is in real-time playback mind you
and if this stutters it gets really hard
to do editing because I mean it's
stuttering so you have to constantly
pause and start or you can drop the
quality to like an eighth and then you
end up with a really bad picture and
play backwards super grainy so right now
we can sustain a half play back the full
playback on the 8700 Kate stock as CPU
is taking a good bit of the load the GPU
on the scene is taking the rest and CUDA
acceleration is taking some of it just
depends on what's going on so that gives
you an idea of how each of these works
now we're gonna open up a test file with
some different effects that we can
toggle on and off so here we have a clip
we do some really simple color
correction applied and disabled and if
we just do that while it's playing back
there might be a bit of impact on the
components but there's almost no impact
in rendering which happens after this
this is again previewing so overall luma
tree doesn't really seem limit recolor
just doesn't seem to impact much of
anything and my playback or in rendering
is a bit more in live playback than the
rendering though and then we can also do
a clip with some warp stabilization just
for another test case and for this one
what we'll do
is take a clip that has warp stabiliser
plied and see if there's any impact
playing back versus not applied so
instantly we're getting a lot of IGP
load right now still like 14% cuda load
so not a whole lot going on with cue the
acceleration premieres never really
properly leverage that during preview it
uses it on and off during rendering but
yeah lots of IGP load not so much on the
cpu and then if we look at another
example of applying warp stabiliser
rather than enabling it we can see what
that looks like because now it's gonna
analyze and this will take a long time
so it's analyzing frame by frame this
entire clip to smooth it out and over
here we can see what it's doing to
analyze which appears to be not a whole
lot of load on any particular resource
right now bit on the CPU and a little
bit on my GP but not a whole lot really
on anything so this is going to take a
while and we're not really sure what
exactly is going on during this process
it might just kind of try to be a low
intensive background process and maybe
that's why it takes a while but either
way not a lot of immediate impact
playback though a while we work
stabilized you'll see a lot of IDP load
because that flip is warm stabilized
already so there are some basic examples
for you just a another firm reminder
here this testing could be done a lot of
different ways we're not doing it for
your benefit really it was for our own
to see what kind of components we should
upgrade to and if your use cases happen
to align with ours hopefully some of
this teaches you something along with
the charts we have otherwise it's mostly
just for our own updates for the future
and finally now back in the main set
moving on to some studies of effects we
noticed that rendering is largely
unimpaired when toggling things like
warp stabiliser luma tree color and
scales and rotates a lot of the impact
is seen in real-time playback when
scrubbing the video or when analyzing
the video with orb stabilizes but
doesn't seem to much challenge the
render times for our benchmarks orb
stabilization during rendering for
instance was 4.3 minutes with software
each time or 2.2 minutes with hardware
acceleration for each render that said
the frame analysis pre-render would be
more impacted than the render itself
limit
three colors showed the same thing 5.6
versus 5.7 minute surrender time with
hardware acceleration which is
completely within margin of error and
that's when toggling the effect on
versus off it's about 12 minutes with
software acceleration when toggled on
versus off so again no change at all
from the toggle of Lumet recolor scale
and rotate showed mostly the same on
more bound configurations specifically
GPU bound this one starts a challenge
lower and CUDA devices but we mean very
low-end here we use a 1080i for our
production machine so this is a complete
non-issue for us and for anyone
wondering there's no difference at 1080p
we won't bother with a chart for that we
tested the same things there and it's
all the same lack of difference and that
is how adobe from your behaves at least
for our use cases again a couple things
here before all the especially and the
fans out there freaked out and start
typing in mean comments here's the thing
they're perfect to use cases for the
1950 x4 the 79 80 XE for the 8700 k and
for the 2700 X these renders not really
the best use case for a lot of those
CPUs for the high-end ones especially
you'd really - for the most part sadly
be better off with an 8700 K and IGP and
that's again for our specific type of
rendering so to give you an example of
where the high on 1950 X which is great
value for the dollar we've again
repeatedly recommended it and have given
it a lot of awards the 1950 X or the
Saudi 90 XE at - 2 X the cost are great
choices for rendering multiple things at
once or if you do other stuff than
premier on that machine like blender
where you can definitely make use of all
those threads and blenders advantage
over CUDA in some instances when you
just run out of cuda memory so if you
have a cuda memory limitation with your
project files then having a threader per
cpu with all the 32 threads working at
once and more or less limitless ram 32
64 gigabytes that's a lot of power and a
perfect use case for it but for what
we're looking at the 87 hard k is a
better fit for us what we use right now
just so you know is an X 79 platform
it's several years old and we were
looking at upgrading
to x99 with a 6900 k because we had
retired at 6,900 k recently and we have
x99 boards really was looking forward to
that build sadly we're not gonna do that
builds because going with a high court
count intel cpu is sixty nine hundred k
with no IG p in it is gonna be worse
than an eighty seven hundred with with
an IG p and we can just overclock that
when tribute as well so we're gonna go
with eighty seven okay for a next build
i think is what it's looking like
currently our x79 platform is actually I
think it's a twenty four thread system
it's a Xeon CPU and we bought it
specifically for the thread count which
has been nice for blender but the
frequencies low and up at 3 gigahertz
that for premiere those threads are one
basically never utilized and to when
they are utilized the frequencies low
enough that we don't get I mean it takes
two or three times as long as the 8700
caters to render so it'll be a huge
upgrade for us to go from X 79 and a
twenty-something thread Xeon CPU which
is just not the right fit for Adobe from
ear to you know to a new one so that's
what we're looking at there again if you
have an AMD CPU don't feel bad about it
there's no reason to feel buyer's
remorse or anything else that you might
be feeling because they're still good
CPUs rise and CPUs are doing just fine
they don't have to be good at every
single thing all the time they're still
good at premiere though it's just that
this new update makes Intel's IGP and
actually advantageous thing to have and
it's not something really that I think
anyone was expecting IGP has kind of
been a stupid pointless component for
the most part but suddenly it has it use
and that's really interesting so we'll
be using an 8700 K I think for a render
machine and we'll stick with Rison
options for things like blender
rendering or something like that where
we have just a lot of tiles to do and we
don't have the frequency concern that
premiere seems to have or the IGP
advantage and one final thing as a
reminder stock the 2700 X was doing
better than the 8700 K stock in Adobe
from your without hardware acceleration
so I'll punt ill this point yeah
the 2700 X was a pretty good choice and
there's no reason for anyone to feel bad
about that now because if you're happy
with it or if you were happy with it
then nothing's changed
it's just the 87 hard K is suddenly
using something it wasn't before so
