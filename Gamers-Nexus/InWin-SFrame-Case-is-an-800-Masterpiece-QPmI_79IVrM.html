access tonight here at CES 2015 we are
at in one suite or booth rather and
anyone puts out a vision case every year
so last year there was a d frame it was
a four-hundred-dollar case pretty cool
looking but limited edition and very
expensive and it's just sort of a they
told us they set out to design what you
would want in your living room quick
disclaimer this is eight hundred dollars
it is an s frame case before we get to
that all this content brought to you by
CyberPower cyber vapor gaming PC this
case is a black and gold finish it's
it's got matt on one side and it's
actually a solid single piece of
aluminum and the aluminum has bent 15
times with a press on a table with two
people so two people actually sit there
bending all these sheets of metal which
means this is going to be very limited
limited run and it also means that it's
expensive that's where your eight
hundred dollar price tag comes from it
is only compatible with ATX and there
are no fans pre-installed so you will
want to use liquid cooling if you're
actually building with this but if
you're spending eight hundred dollars on
a case you probably want to use a liquid
cooling anyway because it's not going to
look good with fans so again solid piece
of aluminum this is black and gold
finish 8-8 hundred bucks it's made by n
when there's really all the course stats
we have for you this is a big tempered
glass covering here and that's pretty
much it so check links in the
description below for more information I
will see you all next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
