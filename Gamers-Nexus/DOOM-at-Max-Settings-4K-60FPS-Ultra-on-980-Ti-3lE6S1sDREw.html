and what you're looking at is the game
at 4k resolution with ultra settings so
it's effectively maxed out though I have
some tuned into
anti-aliasing and this was used for
benchmarking all of our GPUs we tested
everything starting at me gtx 960 &amp;amp; r9
380 x and upward that includes all the
way up to now the fury x it's been
included in our permanent bench
thanks to andy's support and we have the
gtx 980ti for the top end from nvidia so
this is our bench it's a 30 second
benchmark course it's repeated three
times for parity and it's one of the
most intensive areas in the game but not
the most intensive we don't include
combat because that is effectively
impossible to replicate perfectly and
the good news is that the environment of
this particular benchmark course is so
load intensive anyway that we really
don't see that much of a difference once
we add in some combat and a couple of
enemy AI so overall the big things here
to look at are the particle effects the
bloom and lighting there's a lot of
directional occlusion going on and you
can read about what all of these
different settings me and if you don't
know in the link in the description
below that is our GPU benchmark so you
can hit the link below that has the full
benchmark performance for all of the
cards but in terms of graphics
specifically the main items particle
effects directional occlusion there's a
lot going on with lighting and shadows
which is intensive on certain GPUs
depending on architecture and other than
that it's your general fast-paced
gameplay the geometric complexity is not
very high there's not a lot of craziness
going on with geometry that's because
almost the entire game it's it's
basically all indoors and you're
basically always in some kind of
corridor or large room like what you've
seen in our testing and those are very
simple in terms of geometry so main
geometric complexity comes from the the
objects that are not part of the main
environment so that's what I got for you
for the max graphics and benchmark
course link in the description below
again for that full benchmark to the
patreon link push trial video if you
want help set directly and keep an eye
out later today probably couple hours
from now for our video version of the
benchmark where we'll recap the
performance in video form if you prefer
not to read so thanks for watching I'll
see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
