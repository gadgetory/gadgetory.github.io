of fusion 3 design where a 3d printing
company based out of Greensboro North
Carolina and our goal is to build a
product that really enables people to
take their ideas into reality quickly
and easily so this is our first printer
we're calling it the f 306
306 is for the build volume it's one
cubic foot which is three hundred and
six millimeters on a side we think it's
one of the biggest build volumes of a
printer in its class we put a lot of
effort into the mechanical design of
this printer to really make the
reliability rock-solid to really make
the the pre quality as high as possible
and to make it as easy to use as
possible so we're really after you turn
it on you feed it the g-code file it
works the same every time the prints
look great every time and I feel like
we're pretty close to that so I walk you
through the mechanical design of this
printer so along with the big built
build volume comes the need to increase
the printing speed as much as possible
otherwise the prints take forever in
order to increase the speed while
maintaining print quality it's important
to reduce the moving mass so what we've
done is we use a drive system called
core XY which has two motors here both
of them are used to do both x and y
motion so the motors are stationary they
don't have to move but we still get two
motors he's still two degrees of freedom
along with that lower moving mass we use
a Bowden extruder so the motor is
mounted here and it feeds the filament
through a PTFE tube in here when you
scale the build volume up you also if
you stick with a smooth robb design you
have to scale the smooth rods up and to
get a good enough stiffness you're
looking at 10 or 12 millimeter rods
which really starts to increase
the weight and the cost quite a bit so
we chose to move away from smooth rods
entirely we're using a linear bearing
system that rides on the aluminum
extrusion itself the advantage of this
is it takes out a lot of parts so we
don't have to have smooth rods we don't
have smooth rod brackets we just have
some bearings and a one inch by one inch
t slot extrusion and it gets it's very
stiff the motion is very smooth that can
also run at very high speeds I've run
this machine up to speeds in excess of
one meter per second with no issues
another aspect of reducing the moving
mass is we have the bed is only moves in
Z it's quite a large bed it's thirteen
and a half by thirteen and a half inches
and that starts to weigh quite a bit so
you don't want to move that around like
a Mendel style so the bed moves in Z
it's driven by a lead screw mounted to a
motor we have some outriggers up here to
help damp any of the oscillation it
picks up the other thing we're doing
with the x and y drive system that's
pretty novel is we're using a spectra
fishing line here a couple other printer
designs have used this castle uses it
Tantalus uses it but i think we're the
first people to use it on a printer this
big and we're using that to replace the
timing belts this has a couple
advantages it takes some cost out it
also allows us to use lower line tension
while still maintaining zero backlash
the other nice thing is it allows us to
route the drive cable through the sides
of the lumen I'm here it allows us to
make this turn in here inside the t-slot
itself so the cable is nice and
protected it's not exposed to getting
caught on anything or the user hitting
it on the electronic side we're using
just a standard standard rambo board for
multi machine it's not too much exciting
there we're using Marlin for the
firmware and it's all driven by a 24
volt power supply so if you're
interested in more information you can
visit our website at fusion 3d sign calm
we are just going into our beta test now
that's going to run for about two months
and hopefully early fall we'll be ready
to start our first production run</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
