the lower-end Intel chipsets would
impact the eighth generation CPU
performance for the current line of
Intel processors and there's decent
reason for that because Intel did a few
strange things they launched the case
queue Intel CPUs 8700 K and so forth
alongside non-case Q locked CPUs like
the i5 8400 with only zseries
motherboards this is something we've
talked about in the past but basically
came down to Intel pulling in the launch
cycle pushing out the higher end stuff
as fast as possible and then you end up
with AI 5 non K parts that have to be
coupled with expensive motherboards that
frankly make no sense being coupled with
an i5 8400 so today we're looking at the
final launch of the rest of the eighth
generation motherboards before that this
video is brought to you by Thermaltake
and the view 71 enclosure the view 71 is
a full tower case that's capable of
fitting three video cards and most
configurations it's also one of the
better cooling cases in our recent case
testing bench lineup the view 71 has
hinged a tempered glass doors on either
side that make it easy to open and show
off and it comes with at least one rain
fan though you can get the RGB version
if you prefer learn more at the link in
the description below let's bring it way
back to fourth quarter of last year so
if you remember we tested the i5 8400
with two different memory speeds 2666
megahertz and 3200 megahertz
the point of that was because we knew
that these boards later 8:37 8b 360 and
B 360 over here would be limited in
their memory support they don't go to 32
so we tested that 2666 as well we
collected some data very quick recap
some of the games had a 5 to 7 percent
difference I think one of the higher
ones was 8 percent different with the
slower memory of course being behind and
for synthetics there wasn't a huge
difference at all because it really
depends on what you're doing what kind
of application workload it is so we
already tested 2666 Bridge 3200 I will
save you some time if you're wondering
how it performs in games the scaling is
the same now as it was then
doesn't matter if you use a Z series
board B Series board whatever have
thirty-two hundred megahertz on the Z
370 board versus 2666 on the Z 370 it's
the same scaling in terms of percent
gains and loss as 2666 on this or this
or this versus 3,200 on Z 370 so
hopefully if you're wondering about that
and about how gaming performance scales
we already answered it months ago it
hasn't changed i double-checked the
performance scaling is functionally
identical so we got that out of the way
next thing to look at them we did a big
content piece talking about multi-core
enhancement on motherboards some boards
have things like MCE which will
basically pre overclock the CPU so we
did that content piece talked about it
about a week ago if you missed it go
watch it but we're revisiting some of
those topics with the same testing math
it's very simple using Cinebench to
establish a baseline score and then
using Cinebench to establish a baseline
frequency on our multi-threaded and
single threaded workloads what we're
doing is comparing does the h3 70 or in
this case the B 360 motherboard actually
impact performance versus Z 370 if all
other factors are identical that's what
we're looking at right now and then
we'll get into some of the blender
performance for real-world production
workloads and things like that start
with something really simple this is
Cinebench scores the MSI B 360 mortar
motherboard had no MCE options to speak
of so performance testing was simplified
we tested with XMP and with stock
settings and that was it no other BIOS
changes necessary this chart compiles a
lot of the Cinebench results from our
previous MCE testing which you can find
already uploaded on the channel any of
these numbers confuse you go check that
video before you ask why they are what
they are
the MSI B 360 mortarboard posted a score
of 1416 with XMP on or 1407 with
complete stock settings again these are
all using the same kit of memory single
threaded performance or was 196 on both
settings and compared to other boards
that we previously tested we're about 10
to 20 points lower than multi-threaded
P performance with single-threaded
performance about the same as for why
that happens it's nothing to do with the
chipset here's where we recap some other
old cons n the difference we're seeing
here 10 to 20 points a bit more a bit
less sometimes between the B 360 and Z
370 boards it's not the chipset what it
comes down to is memory timings and sub
timings of motherboards take a lot of
liberties here the single biggest
differentiator in motherboard
performance because motherboards do
actually impact performance it does
matter outside of thins even like vrm
temperatures and fear I'm overheating
overclocking outside of all that stuff
which is pretty obvious that impacts it
the next biggest change is memory
profiling some boards have pretty bad
memory profiles out of the box
some of them support one kit of memory
better than another some might not
support a particular kind of memory at
all and you end up with just loose
timings and generally poor performance
what's happening here is MSI's got a
brand new board that at this point of
filming has not yet been released it
presently has a pre-release BIOS on it
and they have weak memory support it's
fine it's doing ok but it's 10 to 20 ish
plus or minus 5 points behind the other
center bench scores and so the reason
for that is if you dig through the
memory time it's quite obvious basically
comes down to things like TR FC or TR
efi settings like that the lower level
stuff we're increasing by a couple
hundred for our FC or something for
example will change your performance
somewhat significantly so what it comes
down to is this over time if you've ever
scrolled through a motherboard page the
support page for BIOS downloads and we
can maybe show one on screen if you ever
looked at one of those almost every note
section for every BIOS release will say
improves memory support that's what it
comes so this will eventually have all
these updates that say improve memory
support and it will equalize and score
so basically what I'm trying to get
across here is that when you see a
performance difference in something like
Cinebench which is a relatively very
simple Oh
review application for one type of
workload when you see performance
differences like we're seeing here a
couple double digits of points it's
coming down to the memory support it's
not because this be 360 chipset is
implicitly worse at doing Cinebench than
Z 317 now there are very clear
disadvantages to the lower end Intel
chipsets it's not out of the box
performance though it's things like
overclocking support which is
functionally absent on the lower end
chipsets things like the amount of
high-speed IO lanes or HS io lanes that
you get HS io lanes are something that
the motherboard vendors have control
over what they assign them to higher end
chipsets in the past from Intel have
gotten more of those for the Z series
than the H and B series for example so
that kind of influences how many
different attached IO devices you can
have SSDs for example or nvme SSDs or
whatever those are the primary
differences
so yeah the Cinebench performance
difference we saw is actually not that
large particularly considering Cinebench
is rather large margin for error and
variance in its own execution and it
comes down to you memory sub timings so
then next thing frequencies we can look
at those and just double check that it's
running at the frequency it should be
and before we get into the frequency
chart I'll also note the bus speed or
base clock was about ninety nine point
six for all tests with this board and
about ninety nine point five to a
hundred on the other boards as well as
for frequencies they're more or less the
same which is why we can point at memory
timings as the primary differentiator in
performance the B 360 mortar averages 42
94 megahertz core frequency with XMP on
which is within reason for the usual
$42.99 megahertz single thread frequency
was 44 64 to 4500 which is also within
reason and variants there's no
meaningful frequency deficit here the
differences again derived from other
settings in the board things that will
probably be improved with time
moving on to some real testing our
blender scene rendering results show how
little difference there really is this
is also going back to frequency more
than
anything else with version 2.7 9 and
using the GN monkey had test the 8400
CPU moving off the 8700 we were just
testing Li ke skew the 8400 with 32
hundred megahertz memory tested on the
ultra gaming Z 370 completed its render
and forty two point eight minutes
dropping to 26 66 megahertz memory on
the B 360 platform rendered in forty-two
point four minutes dropping the 26 66
megahertz memory on the z 370 platform
rendered in forty three point two
minutes these differences are from
change in frequency not from board
change the splash screen tests rendered
next in thirty five point five minutes
on thirty-two hundred megahertz memory
with the 8400 on a Z 370 board 36 point
2 minutes with the B 360 board at twenty
sixty six for the memory and 36.1
minutes well within margin of error with
2666 on z 370 in other words the
motherboard chipset when leveling the
fields of stock settings has no
meaningful impact on performance and to
bring it all back to the beginning if
you're curious about relative gaming
performance of 2666 versus 3200 there's
a bit there but your money is far better
spent on things like a better cpu so no
it's not always a lot of money to go
from 26 to 32 hundred megahertz but it
depends a lot on the region you're in
some of you have sent us screenshots of
memory prices in your countries and I've
seen the price difference in 3200 to
2600 in different regions
sometimes it's completely outrageous you
absolutely should not be paying a lot of
money to make that jump because we're
talking about a couple percentage points
and you're also talking about 15 plus
dollars more you might as well buy a
better other component GPU or CPU and go
with twenty six hundred megahertz memory
cuz you're gonna get more there than you
will from the memory for gain for these
CPUs though anyway the i5 8400 as we've
said from the start the sort of the
stance we've had on it remains the same
the original stance was it's not a bad
CPU but also you shouldn't buy it with Z
370 it's just not how it was meant to be
it's unfortunate Intel did not ship
these boards sooner but that's the way
it happened so now that we're in the
future with these boards again we would
recommend the i-5 8400 as still a pretty
good CPU but that it be paired with B
and H Series motherboards unless you
have a very specific reason and you
would know better than I would to buy Z
370 maybe one of those reasons is you
want to buy it now with a cheap CPU and
upgrade later not something I'd
recommend but there are completely valid
reasons to do it so that would make
sense but generally speaking we'd
recommend the non K CPUs with these
motherboards they're fine the
performance difference the impact from
performance from the chipset change is
functionally zero outside of HS i/o and
things that would actually make sense
from changing the chipset as noted
earlier so if you're worried about if
the motherboard if is e 370 is better
and air quotes then B 360 HD 70 strictly
on grounds of being a different chipset
and for no other reason the answer is no
it is not inherently better the better
is derived from things like a higher
supported memory frequency on the XIII
sounding boards this caps 2626 66 and
from things like again HS i/o and
generally just kind of higher quality
boards and the overclocking department
because these don't do that either we're
not in any meaningful way so that's what
it comes down to we'd recommend the non
K CPUs with these boards basically is
what I'm saying because there's
functionally no performance difference
what performance difference exists comes
from the limited memory tuning for
boards that just came out pretty
standard and if you run all the
Cinebench tests again in a couple months
more updates on this board they'll
probably do better and blender just
didn't care at all so once you get out
of synthetics you get into real
applications it's all kind of a wash
anyway you'll run into other bottlenecks
first most likely so that's it that's it
for this one very simple very
straightforward stuff as always
subscribe for more of this we have a
couple of cool content pieces coming up
especially on well the CPU that this
came from and otherwise I'll
PAX East this weekend at a panel a pcmr
panel I think bit wit Kyle will be there
with me along with Corsair rep and I
think an AMD rep will also be on the
panel so it'll just kind of find a thing
and we'll film it for you if you're not
gonna be there otherwise stop by go to
store it on cameras nexus net to pick up
a mod mat or one of our 2-tone hoodies
I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
