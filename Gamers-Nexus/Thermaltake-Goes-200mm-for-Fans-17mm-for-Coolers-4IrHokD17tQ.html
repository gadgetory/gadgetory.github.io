thermaltake suite now looking at a
couple of new cases and some new cooling
products that's kind of what they do so
the first thing I want to point out is
that we'll be talking about a two
hundred millimeter fan it's becoming
more of a trend it's kind of like the
industry is is regressing back to two
hundred millimeter fans that are popular
ages ago but we're gonna start with the
view 37 which is this case here I
actually have two side panels on here
does not come with two of them they are
what their own take calls panoramic
panels they've had them on previous
cases it's basically the top in the side
and one it's an acrylic panel and then
the front of the case is also an acrylic
panel before that this video is brought
to you by EVGA and the X 299 dark
motherboard for the Intel high-end
desktop CPUs the X 299 dark is one of
the only motherboards on the market with
proper vrm cooling we've tested this and
found significant performance increase
over those without active cooling on the
BRM and you can learn more about the X
tonight on dark at the link in the
description below so for this version of
the the build here it's got two hundreds
in their stock this case will come with
three 140 millimeter fans and then
either 110 dollars or 140 dollars at 110
dollars it's three 140 millimeter fans
single color blue LED at the higher
price point it's three 140 millimeter
fans RGB they are the reigning fans from
Thermaltake so you're all familiar with
those at this point and they will
probably come with the controller that
those ring fans typically come with in
terms of K specs it does not have the
crossbar here that you normally have the
structural crossbar so instead you got
the what they call again panoramic view
features include a vertical GPU it's a
bit close to the acrylic like we've said
in the past you would want to use an
open-loop block on your GPU to get full
advantage of any kind of vertical mount
but they do have one there I don't know
if it will come with a riser cable
that's TBD as is pretty much everything
on this case specs may change but and we
don't really state either so yeah
there's a small stand for vertical GPU
mount you can fit all the open-loop
stuff reservoir full-size all of that
and then they even have a vertical side
mounted radiator that's pushing air that
way
and out that side of the case is the
steel panel that has a mesh on the
opposing side so the error actually can
escape which is something we talked
about with the animatics a beret as well
for the front panel now with this
configuration 200 million fans they are
mounted on the outside of the chassis
and it's also got a thin mesh on the
sides you may find that familiar to the
age 500 feet one could reasonably assume
that you would encounter some of the
same challenges that we found with the
aged 500p in that situation the 140s I
am fairly certain you would be able to
mount on the inside if you did not have
a vertical radiator there so if you
reconfigure this build without the
vertical radiator and fans you'd
probably have the 140s on the inside in
which case some of the concern is
alleviated but you do still have
obviously a piece of acrylic in the
front of the case so this is the view 37
there's also a view 32 we'll be looking
at momentarily and then for the fans so
we have only get rid of this so the fans
the two hundreds that are in here are
kind of still in prototype mode but
we've got one here this is a ring plus
20 fan four centimeters obviously still
prototyped it's got two lighting zones
which you can kind of see on the case
behind me when the light rotates around
the rain so two lighting zones I think
it has something like sixteen LEDs in
there total or eighteen somewhere in
that range no price yet no release date
not much information on the specs but
they're looking at making them there's
been also a new engine cooler the engine
27 we looked at previously or maybe 37
here's the 27 so now there's a smaller
version of the engine 17 the number
standing for the millimeters in height
so it's 17 millimeters tall pretty damn
tiny you would put this on a very low
TDP system obviously it's not gonna cool
a whole lot of it's not going to
dissipate a ton of heat but it's also
not Mensing you put it in something like
a small form-factor box that has zero
height clearance except for maybe 20
millimeters so they're looking at doing
one of those no price on that yet either
we'll move over to the view 91 briefly
and then I get to some of the cheaper
cases so the two things to point out
here there's a view 91 which we'll get
to the view 71 we reviewed this
previously and found that it performed
actually pretty well for two fans
basically I mean it it kind of surprised
us 4gb performance with the original
so do you want the only change here is
the color of the chassis said of black
it's the titanium color as they call it
so it's kind of an off-white for the
view 91 it's just a large case with a
huge glass side panel and it's really
meant for showroom builds you wouldn't
buy this for consumer but yeah basically
put a home server or something in there
or just a fish tank of a PC with the
open loop that they have here it's gonna
be expensive it's gonna be like four
hundred five hundred dollars so not
consumer product but we'll point it out
and then we can get to the consumer
products after I quickly mentioned the
level twenty as well which we previously
saw at Computex but has been mostly
finalized at this point and we've got
some b-roll of it it's a little bit
wider than com you text otherwise it's
pretty much the same idea so you can
watch that coverage for more information
on the level twenty so for the last
couple of cases you probably haven't
seen these on other channels or won't
for a while because it's in a separate
room these are actually the more
affordable cases that I think for our
audience are probably the most
interesting they're less flashy and more
practical
none of these are final we don't have we
have prices but we don't necessarily
have fans back or things like that so
the main ones these are the Versa series
the age 26 and the age 27 it's the same
chassis the same tooling the difference
is in the front panel where this one has
a mesh for the bottom and it can fit to
120 millimeter fans in those bottom two
slots there's no fan port in the top
because it actually supports five and a
quarter Bay's I know some of you still
want those these cases do actually have
them and you sacrifice the top fans a
lot as a result but that's kind of the
trade-off with five and a quarter it can
fit 120 in the back as well no vertical
GPU nothing fancy like that it's just a
tempered glass side panel on the side
and then mesh on the bottom and these I
think are gonna be $60 from what I
understand now no final spec on the fans
this is probably the one I would be most
interested in this one you've got the
box off panel but I guess if you want
that for cheap you could get it but yeah
I definitely recommend that one over the
other the other case is the J series so
there's J 22 and a J 23 same thing same
internal chassis same tooling different
front panel the one that I prefer has a
mesh for the bottom front as well and
that can fit two fans in it same spot
I'm not sure if they're one 20s or one
40s on that one but it can fit two in
the bottom one in the back and it has a
power supply shroud with some
ventilation meshing stabbed in the top
of
for lower PCIe devices and it's also got
tempered glass that one's gonna be $55
so five dollar difference between the
two from what we understand now TBD on
everything else and that's pretty much
the Thermaltake suite there's a couple
other things as always but we'll leave
those for later you can subscribe for
