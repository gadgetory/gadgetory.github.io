with drivers held for a quote
unification reasons that doesn't sound
weird up until actual launch date the
GTX 1650 comes in variants ranging from
75 watts to 90 watts and above meaning
that some options will run without a
power connector while others will focus
more on boosted clocks power target and
require a 6 pin connector for
overclocking GTX 1650s will start at
$150 with this model cost in 170 and
running a higher power target stock more
overclocking Headroom and potentially
better challenging some of Nvidia's past
generation products we'll see how far we
can push the 1650 and today's benchmarks
including overclock testing to look at
maximum potential versus a 1660 we're
using the official unmodified GTX 1654
30 point three nine public driver from
Nvidia for this review before that this
video is brought to you by deep pools
captain 240 pro closed-loop liquid
cooler the new captain 240 pro comes
with the RGB illuminated fans and a pump
easily synchronized to each other for
color matching in your system the
captain 240 pro radiator also uses a
unique elastic pressure relief bladder
in the water tank as a leak prevention
mechanism it expands and contracts based
upon liquid temperature to counteract a
IO leak concerns the cooler is available
now and you can learn more at the link
in the description below the official
drivers came out at 9 a.m. today it is
presently 1:50 p.m. and we got the card
in at about 8 a.m. so we have this one
hour before launch
we got the drivers at launch and now
we've finished testing or some of it's
still ongoing but it's mostly done so
the problem here is that end video
withheld drivers typically we get press
drivers in advance of launch this is so
that we have time to really put together
a solid review and make sure we look at
every aspect of the card now fortunately
because we are pretty efficient here
we've still done our full 100% review
without cutting corners but it wasn't
easy and that's because of the secrecy
around the drivers and the reasoning one
might postulate for withholding drivers
is not because as Nvidia says it's to
unify them or something
but rather because probably the rh5 70
is better is what its gonna come down to
but that's not going to stop us from a
day one review so we're working with the
EVGA gtx 1650 SC ultra for this review i
will probably call it x z ultra by
accident a few times or the entire
review because they keep changing the
names on us but the 1650s c ultra is a
90 watt reference 90 watt power
consumption for the board versus
reference of 75 so EVGA has boosted the
power available to the card which means
that it will boost higher in its clocks
and have a bit more overclocking
Headroom you can go 106 percent beyond
well if six percent extra on top of the
90 watts so you have some overclocking
Headroom in there and that's why it's a
more expensive card at $170 instead of
the base price of 150 put some of the
cheaper models will have a separate
teardown video for this one because this
is a new cooler designed for EVGA and it
allows them to get the cost down at
lower which is worth looking at in depth
so make sure you check back for that
this model also includes a metal
backplate which is one of the main
marketing features because at this price
point that's rare the card runs 896 CUDA
cores or seven sm's at 128 CUDA cores
per SM which leaves us wondering when
the 1650 TI will release as this is not
the fully populated die pjs boost clock
on the card is 18 16 megahertz with
memory at 8 gigabits per second and we
can do some overclocking to get things
better than that let's get into
benchmarking will have 1080p and 1440p
tests primarily with overclocking power
thermals and frame time charts thrown in
and we managed to get all this done in
just the last couple of hours so there
are still of course things you could do
beyond the tests we've done so if you
really wanted to buy this card and use
it at higher resolutions in some games
that are lighter weight you can drop the
graphics settings a bit but we left with
our standard benchmarking settings for
now because it'll allow us to compare
versus all the other cards and remain
timely so let's let's just get right
into it
f1 2018 and the ego engine are first at
1080p the GTX 1650 XC ultra runs at 61
FPS average with room to improve
if settings were reduced toward high or
medium the RX 570 for a competitive
reference runs at 66 FPS average this is
a lead of about nine
santan will be a theme through most of
this review with one outlier the gtx
1066 gigabyte holds a strong lead over
both running at 75 FPS average
demonstrating at least 1650 is into the
successor to this 1060 but rather the
1616 on TI was an overclock gets us to
66 FPS average for the 1650 XE ultra
which ties the rx 570 stock card not a
great place to be especially considering
you can still overclock the 570 and also
it's cheaper at 1440p the 1650 runs at
46 FPS average with ultra high settings
which really isn't all that bad when
considering where we came from a few
years ago a settings reduction would
even allow an average of 60 FPS of so
desired unfortunately for the 1650 the
rx 570 still performs better here not
just an average framerate but also
measurably and perceptibly in frame time
performance this is something we've
demonstrated relating to f1 2018 in the
past as well and so isn't really a new
revelation overclocking pushes 250 FPS
average but that's still just not enough
we need more than that apex legends is
up next this is a modern DirectX 11 game
that we set to all high settings then we
use a highly controlled multi player
task force we test away from other
players but within the actual game our
previous content discovered that this
was highly representative of real
gameplay and multiplayer and as the most
accurate way we found to benchmark at
1080p and with all high settings the
1650 XC ultra plays at 64 FPS average
with Louis reasonably well timed at
49:41 fps 1% in 0.1% lows the arts 570
isn't as advantaged here as it will be
in sniper in the next test as the
workload has moved to DirectX 11 and
drops a synchronous command support
versus what sniper will allow the 5 70
70 FPS average allows it a lead of 9%
over the stock 16 50 XE ultra
overclocking the 16 50 got it close to
the stock rx 570 but the card still fell
short with a 69 FPS average or an
improvement of about some percent over
baseline
the GTX 1066 gigabyte card hasn't been
retested since our initial round with
Apex Legends but what was that 72 FPS
average at the time of last test it may
be a few percentage points faster now
but not much the results overall haven't
really changed much for the other
retested cards moving on to frame times
again being mindful that lower is better
but more can
distance is better than lower we see
that the gigabyte rx 574 gigabyte card
manages performance in a range of
roughly 11 milliseconds to 25
milliseconds with the average falling
closer to 15 to 16 milliseconds although
the data is more spurious than we see in
some other games there still aren't any
extreme swings and frame to frame
interval this is important and shows
that the card is performing smoothly
over all the 1650 as we plot it performs
well about where you would expect it
given the average FPS chart so you know
as average FPS has just derived from
frame x anyway
no major spurious swings from the mean
so that's good it's just that the 570
still manages to be highly competitive
in this test to the point where it's
well it's cheaper and often better than
framerate so that's really all he needs
to know well fought the 1050 Ti just to
get it on the chart although it needs
serious settings reductions to really
play fluidly in this game 1050 Ti
doesn't have extreme excursions from the
mean either but it certainly is slower
on average Sniper Elite 4 is next this
game uses the Astoria engine and is one
of the best built DirectX 12 titles out
we use dx12 asynchronous compute high
settings and tests primarily at 1080p
for this class video card that said we
also have some 4k tests strictly for
synthetic comparison to a wider range of
products for now let's start with the
more realistic 1080p setting at 1080p
the gtx 1650 XC ultra run Sniper Elite
at 71 FPS average with lows at 61 fps
and 53 fps 0.1% this particular game is
compute intensive and so and these are
rx 570 leverages our architectural
advantages to lead the 1650 by about 36%
the 97 FPS average the GTX 1066 gigabyte
gaming X leads of both the rx 570 and
the GTX 1650 although the latter is led
more significantly with it's 104 FPS
average
overclocking the 1652 about twenty
eighty five megahertz gets it to 77 FPS
average an improvement over baseline of
eight percent improvement in the 1650
over the 1050 Ti as meaningful posting
24% uplift but it doesn't compete well
with the rx 570 in this title actually
it's the worst in this title this title
is sort of an outlier and that's
something you need to keep in mind going
forward here's a frame time plot for
Sniper Elite 4 remember
frame times are the base magic for frame
rates and are important as they don't
average out potential issues that
average FPS and even 1% lows can obscure
the rx 574 gigabyte card runs
exceptionally well here with an average
frame time of about 10 milliseconds
frame to frame this line is nearly
perfectly flat which is what we want to
see the flatter the line the last the
variance for reference 16 and white 667
milliseconds is 60 fps we have observed
that excursions beyond 8 to 12
milliseconds frame to frame will cause
it users to notice stutter as for the
new 1650 the line is relatively smooth
it's just slower than the rx 570 finally
the GTX 1050 ti4 gigabyte card on this
line ends up at about 15 to 22
milliseconds on average with more
spurious frame time consistency along
its plot it's not bad but this card is
clearly not particularly high-end 4k is
obviously not a real-world scenario for
these cards but we're going to briefly
look at 4k sniper charge for a synthetic
comparison and seeing the card hierarchy
there are 570 again leads is time by 41%
over the 1650 XE ultra again a bit of an
outlier over clocking the XE ultra
marginally helps but not enough to
change the stack the 1650 and 570 are
both still led by the gtx 1066 gigabyte
farm cry 5 at 1080p has the gtx 1650 XE
ultra 56 FPS average which is again
behind the RX 570 62 FPS average the 570
maintains a steady lead of 10.5% while
managing to be cheaper the gtx 1064 what
it's worth still leads but we're only
pointed it out because some of the
rumors had suggested that the 1650 might
surpass the 1060 which was clearly wrong
and not something that we ever suspected
to be true hence not reporting it
originally overclocking puts these 1652
61 FPS average and improvement of about
8% 1440p doesn't play much into this
story the RX 570 again leads the 1650 at
1440p either card is particularly meant
to play this game at 1440p
so we'll move on quickly to the next
chart GTA 5 has typically posted much
better performance on nvidia than AMD
when compared relatively to other games
and that remains true here at 1080p the
gtx 1650 xt ultra ties the RX 570 for
the first time all review
the two results are roughly within
margin of error of it one another for
averages although we'd like to see
better low seventies 1650 posted the GTX
1060 still leads both handily with an
eighty three FPS average it's not even
close to what some of the rumors
projected with a 1066 gigabytes still
holding a lead of 31 percent over the
1650 overclocking allows an important
improvement to 68 FPS average which is
enough to tie the stock 780ti reference
model although obviously overclocked 780
is hold a significant lead here asking
on this chart the 570 for what it's
worth could also be overclocked here but
we're arguing over single-digit
movements at this point and the two
cards are effectively the same an
average FPS for GTA 5 at 1440p at gtx
1650 XE ultra continues its tie with the
RX 570 with an overclocked stretching up
towards 46 FPS average nearing the RX
580 game + ex stock that's not bad but
GTA 5 has been the only instance of this
thus far and overclocked 570 would
encroach similarly on the 580 as we
demonstrated years ago with the RX 400
and 500 launches shadow of the Tomb
Raider is last and is another modern
DirectX 12 title for this one the gtx
1650 XE ultra operates an average of
about 50 FPS predictably allowing it to
lead the 960 and 1050 Ti but also
allowing the rx 570 Elite of about 9.3
percent
please note again that dropped settings
further would obviously allow relative
playability and Shadow the Tomb Raider
although overclocking helps a little bit
the 50 FPS average is fine for
comparative purposes with our higher
settings but if you wanted to play the
game with a higher FPS it could be done
drop in to about medium overclocking
pushed us to 52 FPS average instability
in the OC dropped our low-end
performance for frame time consistency
unfortunately this could be improved
with more time spent on overclocking for
example if Nvidia released the drivers
to press ahead of launch that's not
gonna stop us from a launch day review
though at 1440p at the 1650s 33 FPS
average doesn't inspire much confidence
with these settings the game would need
a serious settings reduction to bring
this closer to fluidity strictly for
comparative purposes though we learned
that the RX 570 holds a lead once again
this time at 38 FPS average for about a
15 percent lead this table shows our
overclocked stepping providing a
look at the very quick process we
followed to get our overclock we were
able to sort of hold 20 100 megahertz
but it wasn't stable in all games tested
and so we had to pull back to 20 85
megahertz for the final average
frequency Peaks depend on thermals as
always and this is illustrated
immediately in the top three rows of our
table we changed nothing between those
three rows the first three and just let
temperature slowly rise on its own
eventually dropping us from nineteen
eighty megahertz to nineteen thirty five
megahertz once nearing 60 degrees
Celsius this demonstrates how boost
works after this we started actually
overclocking the card settling it for
just a one 60 megahertz offset and 400
Hertz offset for the memory we sort of
had 175 stable four core but 0.1% low as
we're dropping way too hard and so we
reverted to 160 for the core offset the
last chart is power consumption where we
have total system power consumption
measured at the wall and logged so this
is total system power consumption it's
not just for the card but the system's
heavily controlled and so we can compare
them by the deltas the SC ultra system
let's get that right there SC ultra is
drawing around 200 to 220 watts peak for
the full system whereas the RX 570
systems drawing over 300 watts like 292
a little over 300 watts so clearly the
570 is drawing more power and that's
where you start to balance out against
some of that performance we saw earlier
so then the RX 570 we made fun of AMD a
little bit for Radeon seven final e
matching 1080 TI performance after a
couple of years that was it just it was
really not the biggest acknowledgment it
was a good thing for sure and we were
happy to see it but it's not a huge
accomplishment to match your competitors
previous generation or previous previous
generation products a few years later
that's what this is doing the rx 570 the
tables have now turned to the rx 570 is
an RX 470 which is like maybe three
years old now or something like that
from the AMD mchale event so getting
pretty old and it's beating this and
it's $130 on average maybe 140 something
like that worst absolute worst case is
there like 150 bucks for a pretty good
one but
there are five 70s out there which are
four 70s four in the 130 to 140 range
and they'll beat this which is a good
card like EVGA did a really good job at
building this video card it's
unfortunate that EVGA ends up with the
GPU they did because they don't make
that part but if the coolers really
pretty reasonable at the price it's a 90
watt power target baseline instead of 75
and it's got a 6 pin connector on it so
you're losing part of the benefit of the
1650 in favor of more performance and
even with that boosted performance the
570 is still winning out and we used a
pretty cheap 570 with 4 gigabytes of
memory so the 570s the easier choice
here because worst case scenario for the
570 it's about tied in GTA 5 this card's
reasonable to overclock but even that
isn't really getting it past stock 570
performance and then of course you get
overclocked to 570 as well so the 570 is
cheaper it is typically 7 to maybe 10%
10.5% better on average with one outlier
in Sniper Elite 4 and worst cases it's
tied but it's cheaper and this is
something that came out a few years ago
like the original one 470 so really not
impressive the 1650 and that makes it
impossible to recommend so we just it's
not like it's a terrible ripoff or
anything and those have certainly
existed in the past
it's just that it's not competitive and
that's what matters in a competitive
market so we would typically push toward
a 570 at this price point $130 is
actually a really good deal we were
looking at them the other day and
remarked internally about how wow that's
actually a really good deal on a car
that used to be about $200 at launch and
was supposed to be a hundred and eighty
or so the primary or only upside of the
1650 is the lack of requirement for a
PCIe connector and the really low power
consumption at 75 watts so you could put
it in a system with no available PCIe
connectors or maybe you just need a
video out but still some reasonable
potential process something on the GPU
maybe like a home server there's value
there the 570 will require a PCIe
connector it will typically draw more
power so if those things bother you then
this really isn't bad at you have to buy
one a different model but it's not bad
it's just that that's a that's a pretty
limited scenario where you find
usefulness it's not a it's not a massive
enough difference where if you can deal
with a power connector
you shouldn't go with the 570 you should
you just buy the 570 instead so that's
it for this one thank you for watching
we did our best to get it out quickly
despite under his best efforts so
hopefully end video will push drivers to
press in advance in the in the future
they typically do it this one was just
weird so we'll leave there subscribe for
