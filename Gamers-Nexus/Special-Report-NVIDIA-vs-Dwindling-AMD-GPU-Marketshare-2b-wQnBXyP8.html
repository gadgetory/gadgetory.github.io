versus NVIDIA GPU market share including
interesting data on the most popular
cards most popular series for each brand
average selling price of video cards to
consumers and more this pulls thousands
of data points between fourth-quarter
2016 and first quarter 2019 and tells an
interesting story about the 1080 TI
likely one that we won't witness again
for a long time it also speaks to the
decline of AMD in the gaming space where
the company has struggled to make
consistently appealing offers in more
than one price category simultaneously
for the video card market this is
counter to our previous report where we
looked at the Intel vs. and the sales
data and saw an encouraging story of an
underdog beginning to claim dominance in
another market that was the CPU report
for this one the GPU report the story is
much different before that this video is
brought to you by coarser and it's void
Pro headset the void Pro headset is
available in wired or Wireless versions
with the wireless option supporting a
boosted range upwards of 30 to 40 feet
the headset has full RGB LEDs on the ear
AQAP's has 50 millimeter headphone
drivers and lasts up to 16 hours on
battery
it can also be plugged in for Wired at
use and is now lower in price than when
it first launched a noise cancelling
microphone is also included along with
an easy mute indicated by an LED and you
can learn more at the link in the
description below this report dives into
again the sales data for and vidiian for
Andy since roughly end of 2016 until now
and this is a different story from the
one we saw with our CPU sales data in
that one the chart started with Intel
and the very far apart and occasionally
coming together but Intel overall was in
the lead up until Rison at which point a
massive change occurred and what our
viewers and readers were purchasing and
Andy now looks to be the one in the
dominating position in the CPU market so
well to clarify here in the CPU market
for our audience so let's get that out
of the way first
first of all this data is affiliate data
we can look into what people who watch
us and read our content purchase and
that represents only the
people only our audience and basically
the enthusiasts audience typically also
an audience - tends to spend more money
and is a DIY system building audience
what we can't see is things like om data
laptop sales data things like that so
referencing back to the Intel versus AMD
CPU on Intel still has the lion's share
majority of the the market it owns
really most of it in things like laptop
it has a lot of it in server it's got a
lot of market in OAM and those are
places where if you look at our data it
doesn't reflect the reality of those
markets but for the enthusiasts DIY
market andy has been doing well and CPUs
that's not the same in the GPU story
line which is what we're looking at
today the difference here is that even
though we're still we still the same
ground rules you can't extrapolate this
across the entire market for the most
part Nvidia does also own basically
every other market sector as well there
are places where AMD has some deployment
but it's just it's not the same story as
Intel versus a Indian CPUs it's it's
much different so that's the reminder on
what the data represents we can't
account for OEM sales things like that
we are rounding the results to keep the
charts legible so results will be plus
or minus 0.5 percent depend on rounding
for those charts and overall the most
interesting thing to pay attention here
is going to be b10 atti
it's insane if the ten atti were a video
card company if you took the 1080i and
you introduced a third party company to
the market and said this is what they
made it would have dominated the market
just that one card and Vidya really had
an incredible run with the 1080i and
that's a big part of the storyline today
the twenty series is also accounted for
in here to the extent that it's been out
in the last couple of months and then
AMD is well well we'll go through their
numbers as well but mostly for the last
few years that we're looking at it was
our X 480 for 70 releases followed by
585 70 Vega of course was in there 56 64
things like that so let's get into it
we'll start with the GPU sales analysis
over time then look into average sign
price and the most popular series or
card by vendor our data starts out in
the fourth quarter of 2016 where we
observed a steady uptrend in AMD GPU
sales into the holiday season the AMD r
x 480 had just released around July and
August and was driving up in sales for
AMD the 470 was also popular in this
time and vidiian AMD reached parity in
February of 2017 which we did see lower
sales overall in every single February
that we've looked at so this is an
interesting side note but not
particularly relevant and this is also
around when the cryptocurrency prices
started picking up just initially Nvidia
rocketed to over 80% sales volume in
March of 2017 which is when the GTX 10
atti released
we could also postulate that the dip in
sales trend Vidya the month prior was
because there were lots of rumors about
what would be released in March and so
sales slowdown when rumors abound that
card as an aside has been more
successful in sales than any of the
other Nvidia cards we've ever tracked
and Vidya continued climbing through
July of 2017 when mining began to go
more mainstream and GBS shortages were
just starting for gamers AMD was sitting
at nearly 0% sales volume in this period
not quite but very close with Nvidia
responsible for almost all of the sales
we tracked to our audience this didn't
let up until November of 2017 when Andi
sales gained in performance during Black
Friday sales ever since then NVIDIA has
been positioned comfortably in the
eighty five to ninety eight percent
sales volume range for our audience the
company saw a dip in November of 2018
when Vega 56 and rx 580 prices started
to come down and Pascal inventory
completely dried up leaving only
expensive r-tx cards since then though
the company has recovered much of its
temporarily lost position and Vidya
pushed a lot more releases in this
period than AMD and this isn't counting
the onslaught of GTX ten series product
launches in July and August of 2016
nor the launches of Quadro cards which
also seems somewhat constant the 2016
and Vidya onslaught again of cards was
met primarily by two AMD cards in the
same period the rx 480 and the RX 470
the success and importance of Nvidia is
at gtx 1080i again
to be understated as we'll see later
because I held the company over for more
than a year while waiting for the artsy
acts launch between the 1080 TI and the
RT X launches we were met only with a
few cards like the Titan V and the 1070
TI note that this is based upon
thousands of GPU sales so although we
are limited to what our audience buys
this is still a lot of market share I'm
on the Nvidia enthusiast crowd we also
an important note do cut out things that
we can't see obviously like a lot of the
Titan sales we can't see things like
enterprise sales for either company and
we also don't track too closely the
Quadro or workstation card sales the
average selling price for a SP is an
important metric that plays into a
company's gross revenue it also shows
where each company holds the strongest
for customers
unlike the Intel versus AMD chart where
we saw increasing constantly for the
average selling price especially for
Intel this one has had a downtrend in
2019 Nvidia increased in ASP from 2017
to 2018 likely thanks to that 10 atti
sale that pulled about 55% of all 2018
sales volume for Nvidia and placed
Nvidia at $619 SP 2019 lowered this to
$543 which we found to be strongly
correlated with the drop-off in 1080i
sales due to the depletion of inventory
more on this in a moment
AMD has remained roughly in the same
range over the years moving to $255 ASP
and 2018 from 233 and 2017 then felt
falling back again to 241 the 2016
versus 2017 delta for nvidia is a result
again of the 1080 TI illustrating how
important it was for this audience let's
next look at a chart for the most
popular series by Nvidia our three-year
average shows the chart on the screen
now keeping in mind that the RT X cards
only launched more recently averaging
the past couple of years of data the
1080i maintained about 35% sales volume
overall even when accounting for the
rough 8 percent volume taken by the RT X
20 80 or 5% by the 20 80 TI and also
noting that it didn't exist in the
beginning of 2017 note also that we
can't see most Titan sales as these tend
to be directly through Nvidia
after the 1080i though r-tx 2070 is the
most popular and this is actually an
interesting data point as well this
speaks to the success of the 1080i and
helps further illustrate the initial
disappointment in the r-tx launch but
shows that the 2070 helped recover a lot
of this and this was kind of what we'd
said in our review - where although the
2080 was disappointing for equating the
1080i in a time when our TX games didn't
exist yet
the 2070 did a lot to push the better
value angle of Nvidia's argument as
opposed to the 2080 and Ti where the
value was not good and also started to
reach a wider audience but the 1080i
gave everything a lot to live up to
breaking it down into series per year is
also interesting in this chart the
usefulness of this is entirely related
to marketing mentality and what the
consumer wants to be associated with
when buying a product the 1080i occupied
55% of all 2018 sales for Nvidia that we
tracked and that includes some
additional data we didn't have
previously when we talked about this
that's a staggering volume for one card
especially with twenty series launched
in the same year but because we rolled
all of a series into each other the
twenty atti volume of one percent in
2018 and thirteen percent in 2019 skew
the perception you might have of price
hence breaking out ASP separately the
1080 TI was 700 to 800 dollars on
average the 2080 TI has generally been
above $1000 either way this allows us to
see which lines our viewers prefer to
associate with and affordability
notwithstanding the atti series has
fallen off in 2019 which is in large
part due to the unavailability of the
1080 TI and painfully expensive 20 80 TI
cards in their wake the x-axis Evan T
series has picked up steam now exceeding
20% volume for Nvidia the 60 series also
picked up some volume along with the 80
series returning to its 2017 volume we
didn't know where the 1070 TI or 1660 Ti
belong so we broke them out separately
and these most popular series has
remained the X 80 cards we left them
individualized here as I am they had a
lot fewer SKUs overall which makes it
much easier to sort
data on the chart the rx4 80 dominated
AMD's 2017 sales volume via our viewers
reaching roughly 60% that expanded in
2019 with rx 580 sales especially with
thanks to new reductions in price now
reaching upwards of 80% of all of AMD's
sales volume the rx 580 is a staple for
the company after these the rx 570 and
560 or even for 60 cards were somewhat
popular over the years but nowhere near
where the xxxx 80 series have been we
were surprised to see so much interest
in Vega 64 versus Vega 56 as well
considering that 56 can be made to
nearly match 64 performance with an
overclock and can even be BIOS modded
fairly easily that said these are
enthusiast things so this is the same as
what we saw the 1070 TI versus the X X
80 sales and illustrates that people
care more about doing less work and
having a more prestigious name for their
video card and having something that
just works out of the box that's it for
the sales data so overall what we've
learned here is that for the most part
across the thousands of data points that
we have for our audience and video is
very clearly in the lead and in a bigger
way than something like the steam
hardware survey would sometimes suggest
because that also splits out the market
into a GPS so Intel has representation
there which is not really what we're
talking about when we talk about GP
market share so yeah Nvidia is in a very
good position it remains in a good
position to the extent that in the
period when the 1080 Ti was available it
it was the most popular card and it was
roughly 700 to 800 dollars depending on
how high end of a model you bought 700
was about the floor ignoring the mining
and that's another point here the mining
boom when it lasted was actually
significant so when we were looking
through data and we didn't break this
out for charts but when real crawling
through all the data what we noticed was
in the months where Bitcoin price was
rising from it was roughly $700
something like that beginning of 2017
out of 2060 and when I was rising to the
the precipitous drop that would
eventually encounter at 20,000 or so
circa December of
17 during that rise we noticed that a
lot of the individual orders were going
from single video card to things like
eight video cards so you'd have in the
past what we or even present what we
typically see is maybe every so often
you'll see a two card or maybe someones
doing SLI or crossfire but for the most
part every single order of a video card
is an individual card and then when that
was going on almost every order was
multiple cards and the single card
orders fell off and the prices also went
up so the problem here is that you end
up with a market where gamers were
getting priced out many of you probably
remember this you have to buy low around
cards if you want one at all or used
cards which was also difficult because
mining was getting really popular at
that time and this hurt AMD we think
based on our data more than it hurt
Nvidia in terms of the gaming market
share because AMD was really getting
sales to those mining operations and
whether that was direct from AMD or
through their partners we're not sure or
even their distributors but what we do
know through backroom conversations at
trade shows with companies we can't name
that work with AMD is that a lot of
those companies during the the 2017
timeline of cryptocurrency rising a lot
of those companies were bypassing retail
and just selling straight to mining
operations and so you end up with this
situation where just like in our charts
that data's not accounted for we don't
know what the mining operations bought
they don't buy retail typically for the
really big ones and also Andy starts
losing to a greater degree than Nvidia
market share in the gaming space which
obviously affects things like how games
are optimized for different video cards
and with what type of special features
are used on those cards and video
started with more market share so it
really was in a better place when the
mining came around and priced out gaming
audiences so just just strictly in terms
of market share because if you're
looking at gaming market share the game
creators are going to optimize based on
distribution in that market not based on
video card distribution in the mining
market so anyway very interesting series
of years the mining stop probably
deserves a bit more of a deep dive but
we'll see we'll see if we if it's worth
taking the data otherwise I'm positive
there are plenty of cryptocurrency
channels out there that covered it when
it was going on so that's it for this
