Donna and I have a very tiny computer
this is a computer this is my phone the
computer is actually slightly smaller
than my phone other than width obviously
so this we have previewed already it is
zotac snoopy CO and it's a basically a
TV mounted computer so it is a fully
functional device it has windows 8.1
pre-installed on it the CPU just running
you through the specs really quickly is
a an intel bay trail atom cpu and it
operates at one point three three
gigahertz it has a point 37 volt vcore
that is really low if you're not think
of think of the Ivy Bridge series CPUs
those were about 1.3 volts if you're
overclocking a bit this is point three
seven and the TDP is appropriately low
is to watts for for the cpu I believe
and the entire device not so sure check
the link in the description below for
the full review or I will detail that
but it is to watts for the CPU that is
insanely low so intel stuff it's already
we already know it's good from a TDP
standpoint what about this computer as a
product now this is so txt $200 solution
and what they say you should use it for
if you're a buyer is things like home
office work weird documents cool stuff
like that game streaming entertainment
media streaming like videos and music
basically anything where you mount this
to your visa compatible display which is
most tvs and monitors these days it has
a special plastic mount you connect it
to the back of the display and then it
it basically talks via hdmi to that TV
or monitor and you just use it normally
like you would with any other computer
it's sort of an htpc just less powerful
and only has 17 gigabytes of user
accessible storage so what that means is
if you want to do anything with media
you're going to need to stream it from
somewhere else you're not going to fit a
lot on this 17 gigabytes is not a lot of
not a lot of room and if you want to
play games you got to stream it from
somewhere else using steams in-home
streaming which is a
priate lead times because that is
somewhat functional now or Nvidia's game
stream which has a bit more limited
gameplay game list in terms of
compatibility but it's a possibility so
you can't do some game streaming but not
the best experience in the world
especially given that most of our ISPs
give us such amazing down and operates
even internally so of course I am very
grateful that my isp is even allowing me
to upload this video to the internet
right now i am glad i'm giving them
money for that privilege but the sarcasm
aside that clearly was not sarcasm this
is a two-hundred-dollar box why why
would you get it right because you can
spend 400 ish on something that is
comparatively going to blow this out of
the water and yeah it'll be bigger no
you probably can't fit it in your pocket
but I I'm not the right user I guess
because I don't see myself wanting to
put this in my pocket and travel with it
and besides you then need to put the
power supply which is an AC drop in your
pocket and an hdmi cable and a keyboard
and mouse so you kind of loses some of
the portability once you consider those
things at that point why not just build
a more complete box or go with even
zotac Sounion 760 which I gave a pretty
good review to it's a good unit it's
about five hundred dollars to get it all
set up and going maybe a little more but
but you get a computer that can play
games on its own and host media locally
and stuff like that now this I don't
want to knock it too hard in terms of
performance the pico actually the pi3 20
it is fully called the pico does okay
the idle cpu temperature is something
like 42 celsius before calculating for
ambient that would be a little that
would be right around 21 celsius after i
subtract ambient it's that impressive
math I hope it's impressive and then if
you look at the low temperatures it's
about 52 at worst with prime95 on large
FFTs that is one hundred percent cpu
load on this tiny atom and calculating
for ambient that's going to be somewhere
just above
be like 27 or 28 Celsius so really not
that warm it's it's pretty impressive
for the tiny boxes and but that's all in
Intel's engineering side more so than
anyone else so in terms of usability
it's they works fine I did I made a
realistic use case scenario where I
effectively did a game streaming
streaming grid from another computer I
played music I played a movie and I
played I played a youtube video I did
all those things simultaneously CP was
sitting at about sixty to seventy
percent load depending on how badly the
game and movie were beating up the
processor at any given time and that the
processor does turbo because pretty
frequently so it does handle load quite
well and I didn't really notice any
stuttering with video playback I didn't
notice any stuttering too much with
typing it stutters a little bit lags
less than a fraction of a second behind
you when typing if you're doing a ton of
things at once but not too bad and if
you're a reasonable user you probably
won't hit that threshold anyway in terms
of the memory you've only got one point
seven gigabytes of user-accessible Rams
work with that is not a whole lot if you
are a tab heavy user if you love tabs
you're going to have to cut back I'm
sorry it is a weight loss program for
your web browser because at that that
capacity you're just not going to have
the room for it but again reasonable
amount of tabs a quick sort of set top
box like web browsing and you'll be fine
so all in all as a computer this
performs well I was very impressed with
the Bay Trail performance along with the
RAM on with the the flash memory the
storage the permanent non-volatile
storage was actually pretty slow I was
not too happy with that but the CPU the
RAM they did fine so as a computer I can
respect that I think this performs very
well as a product for two hundred
dollars I start having trouble
recommending it because you can spend a
bit more and get a very powerful
self-contained game
htpc maybe you don't want that well in
that case this is probably fine but
here's where I start questioning it more
for under a hundred dollars you can get
a chromebox or a chrome stick and you
can stream all of your media all of your
games all of your music from another
from a host system or a server or the
internet if you use that thing it's new
and you can stream all that and it's
just acting as a pass through to the
other to the server what is effectively
the host or the server even if it is
your own computer in your room next door
this is basically doing that if you're
trying to game on it so there's no point
buying it to game on because you can buy
something less than one hundred dollars
and just use it as a pass through media
if you're just watching movies listening
to music same thing you can buy less
than one hundred dollar chrome stick
chromebox doesn't have to be chrome it
can just be something android is the
most affordable though and use it as a
path as a pastor the only reason you
want or need this is when you want
windows 8.1 on it or windows in general
this has windows 8.1 pre-loaded and when
you want it to act as a fully functional
somewhat stable computer that you can do
multiple things simultaneously with
chrome stick you're basically just
browsing or maybe type in a word
document that's about it that is the end
of your user experience this can do a
lot more than that it can browse play
music play videos and type all at once
without really suffering at all so that
is the line you draw on the stand it is
up to you viewers to decide if this is
something you would actually want or
need I'm not the right audience I would
probably buy either a chrome stick and
use it as a pass through to my gaming PC
or even zotac zone Ian 760 which again I
gave a good review to and just use it as
an htpc it's still pretty small will not
fit in your pocket but it's still small
so that is the pico please check the
links in the description below for the
full review if you need more information
and always feel free to ask questions
please comment and subscribe definitely
subscribe helps us a lot and I will see
you all next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
