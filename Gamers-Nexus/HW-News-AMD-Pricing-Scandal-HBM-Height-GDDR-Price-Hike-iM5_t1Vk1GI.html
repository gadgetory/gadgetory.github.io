news we're going over the last week of
news in the industry there's a lot of
stuff about Vega but some Intel rumors
and sort of confirmed announcements at
this point discussion on NAND pricing
and now GD are practicing as well so GD
d our memory looks like it's about to
face the same fate as NAND for SSDs and
DRAM at this point so that'll be
interesting to see going forward before
getting to that we partnered with
LastPass for this video the password of
management solution that makes it easy
to randomly generate a new password for
each website and account without needing
to memorize them all this strengthens
account security so that you're no
longer using the same password for
multiple sites and makes it easier to
manage when one gets leaked learn more
at the link in the description below
let's start off with the Andy Vegas
stuff so this week we on our stream got
a whole lot of questions about what are
your thoughts on the Andy vega pricing
and for those who aren't aware basically
the rumor was from a get at overclockers
UK that basically the initial MSRP for
vega products 54 and 56 was only going
to last for about a day before that
price increase and there wasn't any
independent confirmation on that from
Andy we've asked other folks have asked
I'm not aware of any official statements
from the company so that makes it kind
of difficult to really figure out what
they're doing with regard to give us
posts from the overclockers co dot UK
which claims that AMD had provided
rebates to retailers ie MDF we've
learned from two different board
partners in the industry who contacted
us that this appears to be correct we're
told the gibble is right about the
prices and rebates on the Vegas 64 cards
and that it looks like the lower price
of $500 was only going to exist for
initial launch when those rebates were
available and now that they're not it
appears that pricing will increase based
on what our sources were saying we're
still waiting on comments from AMD we
reached out on the 15th and haven't yet
received response but for pricing
specifically I think what we're looking
at is a scenario where retailers and
board partners are going to benefit a
whole lot more
then Andy on Vega and that's because
ultimately a and B if they're not going
to see a penny of the money if retailers
decide to overcharge on cards by 150
bucks or 200 bucks Andy doesn't see that
money the retailer's do and the same is
true for board partners who increase
their price because they need to make
money and via Vega a 56 and 64 it turns
out how really expensive to make to the
point where 56 kind of skeptical on if
and he's actually profiting on that card
without the help of their packs their
bundle packs
HBM is very expensive we have some
numbers that I'm trying to confirm
independently but have an idea of what
it costs have an idea of what the vrm
cause something I deal with the cooler
costs I don't know I don't know if
they're making money on 56 not stand
alone and if they are it's very little
like an insignificant amount but it
seems like it's probably negative 64 is
more it's closer to breakeven or profit
but the bundles are where the money is
and so we were talking with some third
parties some companies and the initial
quantity of Vega cards was kind on the
low side the quantity allocated the
packs was pretty high so we didn't know
this about the packs
when they were first announced which was
new I ended up listing them as
independent product SKUs where you buy
the card the monitor
the motherboard the CPU all together end
of story you don't even get to pick
which component is mixed and matched
it's just either it exists in ASCII or
doesn't the way we thought it would work
is that you would buy a Vega card that
would cost $100 more and then it would
apply coupons to your card and then you
go and pick the things you want that
were supported by the pack not how it
turned out to work so either way it
looks like a high allocation went to the
packs and I mean that's pretty obvious
because the individual cards basically
sold out immediately whatever there was
there wasn't much of it and the packs
persisted hurt at least an entire day if
they're not still there at the time this
video goes up
so I interesting scenario looks like
Andy's trying to make some money back
but either way we're not sure on the
pricing concerns we're not sure if it's
going to go up and stay there or not and
we've tried to confirm it but we haven't
gotten response yet so it can't really
go too far with that story right now as
far as the different heights on GPU and
HP m so we talked to just one AIB
partner right now I haven't spoken to
enough to really make a firm statement
on this but the concern was basically
that GPU height and HBM height are
different on Vega and so you might have
concerns with applying an aftermarket
looking cooler and it sounds like the
difference that exists is less about
height and more about the adhesive used
I guess it's a silicone versus something
else I don't have the full details but
it sounds like that's more of the
difference in height that said we bought
some stuff that will help us check the
height on at least our our unit and
hopefully other reviewers who have Vega
or other users who have Vega can follow
our steps and check the height of the
HBM the GPU on your unit then we can all
compare data and we'll be doing that
separately probably just a small article
so that's the initial step we have some
other interesting news on our
overclocking efforts with Vega 56 we'll
be talking out in our hybrid mod which
we're filming shortly and we'll be up
probably the day after this goes up and
while we're on the topic of prices and
video cards some more unfavorable news I
guess digit time has it reported that
GDD our prices or specifically video
card memory prices not sure if HDMI
included in that but potentially those
prices apparently have gone up by about
thirty point eight percent for orders
placed in August so that's the cost to
the manufacturer by the supplier when
I'm from 650 per order - 850 per order
per unit I believe it's a single module
that they're talking up to that price
and HBM TDD are 5 + 5 X those are
basically the second most expensive
components on a video card after the GPU
proper and then you have things like the
cooler sort of down towards the end vrm
around where the cooler is
but prices on those looks like they're
going up 31% for these suppliers that
may affect consumer prices as well if it
does we won't see the impact of those
prices for probably another couple
months but it'll be hard to discern the
difference from that versus the
difference from mining still keep an eye
out to see if there's another price
surge in Intel news that their eighth
generation coffee Lake CPUs are to be
announced on August 21st officially and
that's for mostly purported quad core i3
parts though there will be others as
well discuss Intel will unveil the 8th
gen core processors on 8:21 via Facebook
live and that's going to be for the new
generation that follows along after
skylake and kb lake and we fabricated on
their 14 nanometer process once again
this coincides with Intel's processor
architecture optimization cadence as
they ditched the tick-tock cycle many
years ago you know it was only discussed
recently and all still transitioning to
10 nanometers that'll be cannon Lake and
coffee Lake is the filler along with sky
like X as we wait for 10 nanometers and
here's something that this was probably
discussed a week or two ago now but it's
worth mentioning the current well hour
for sure understanding at this point is
that coffee Lake will not use the 200
series boards for Intel so you're gonna
have to buy a new new motherboard which
is sort of what Intel generally does so
new motherboards will be required most
likely and then there are rumors that
the i3 S will be quad cores I think
that's more or less confirmed at this
point with discussion about six cores
also on the table and tech report has an
article about the i3 8300 and I 382 50k
alleged CPUs that are coming out the
coffee like family so you can check that
out for more information an X 399
motherboard news the tr4 platform has
seen growth over the last couple weeks
with the following vendors announcing
new boards MSI has the X 399 gaming Pro
carbon asrock has the fatality X 399
professional gaming board and the X 299
Taichi asus has the rog zenith extreme
which is what we tested on the ROG Strix
X 399 II gaming the ACS prime X 399
a and then there are a couple of other
boards in the works from other vendors
as well
ek water blocks has been in our news
segments a lot lately they're pushing a
lot of products these days and our
newest one is water blocks for arcs Vega
those will come in either vera
electrolytic copper base or
nickel-plated base for the cold plates
and they're full coverage blocks they
can be paired with a clear top or a
black top if you prefer orders I think
are live and they should be shipping
either soon or along with rx Vegas
launched note that Vega 56 isn't
available to the public yet though
also in cooling enter max has the lick
tech TR for a IO LCS closed-loop liquid
coolers it doesn't need that many of
words in the name get it it's a CLC it's
an enter max CLC it's called lick tech
they like using that naming along with
wick max perhaps consider a different
name but they are announcing these for
100% IHF coverage on thread Ripper along
with the Noctua air coolers that also
have 107 IHS coverage we have one of
these coming in so we'll be testing it
whenever it gets here and hopefully be
able to see how much of an impact that
has versus the previous version where
was it's a circular cold plate for these
smaller chips and other than that 3000
rpm pumps they will be 240 or three
sixty millimeter radiators they have an
advertised TDP of five hundred watts
potential for cooling and priced at one
hundred thirty one hundred sixty dollars
slated for late August the pump supplier
by the way for anyone interested the
enter max and left eye products for C
LCS are made by a pol tech they make
couple other products in the industry as
well including former silverstone liquid
coolers and they're one of the smaller
competitors to the likes of ASA tech and
kulit or Kuwaiti finally they're still
an ongoing NAND shortage expected until
mid 2018 there's new information on
insight over at Tom's Hardware that
details how the nan shortage very well
may live into next year which means that
consumer pricing and availability will
likely not see any respite on
probably aggressive growth and multiple
market segments like data center laptops
mobile Internet of Things devices all
that stuff Sampson and Apple both have
flagship devices launching very shortly
and both demand huge provisions of
manned and this is compounded with the
move to 64 layer 3d man that we've been
seein SSDs lately as well so as Tom's
Hardware notes business pcs are expected
to exceed a 50 percent SSD attach rate
now it's gone up quite a bit over the
last few years it's not just enthusiasts
anymore NAND technology products are
shipping the big data everywhere and
technologies and all the phones it's
it's all over the place and supplies not
great right now
so looks like it won't be any better
until next year sorry for the bad news
on man prices and gdg higher prices but
