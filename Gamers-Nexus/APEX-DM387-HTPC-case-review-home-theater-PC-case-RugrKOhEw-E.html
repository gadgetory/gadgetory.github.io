Nexus tonight and today we're looking at
an apex D m-387 black home theater PC
case that is a mouthful this is an HT PC
enclosure meant for a super tight budget
home theater PC check the description
for the full review if you want more
information on this but moving on this
case was 35 bucks when we picked it up
it is 45 now on Newegg it includes a 225
watt PSU and is sadly lacking in other
features but that's somewhat expected at
this price of course so do keep that in
keep in mind that if you have extra
money to spend any more at all you
should definitely consider spending it
because it will probably pay off to have
a case that will be more future proof
but we will go over why this case may
not work for you and maybe some options
as to how you could improve it through
some trickery
so alternative case choices will be
included at the end so if you do have
money ranging from 60 bucks to all the
way up to 200 really I'll have options
there for you first off just glancing
over the specs we see that this apex
HTPC case accommodates micro ATX and
flex ATX form factor nut motherboards
with no specific love for mini ITX
options it is large though and it is
actually very large it is 17 inches deep
13 inches high and 3.9 wide so fairly
small other than the depth the depth is
the killer here and it may not fit on
some shelves because of that but for the
same reason if you are a mini ITX user
obviously you can't use this motherboard
but you should be looking elsewhere
anyway because it is pretty large and
won't take advantage of mini ITX boards
the case has three drive bays one
external optical one external floppy and
then of course an internal 3.5 there is
no SSD bay included so you'll either
need an SSD cage to adapt your drive or
you'll have to be creative like I was
and use velcro tape and twist ties to
tether here SSD to the bottom of the
removable drive cage which can be
removed that is pivoted on screws so
that means that you can take it out and
clean
or whatever it makes installation a
little bit easier on the note of
installation I found that the case was
very easy to build with considering its
affordability it was pretty
straightforward though put the things in
the slots and then apply screwdriver
easy mode kale management is non
existent but it is also a non-issue
because the nature of minimalistic HCPCS
means that you have almost no cables
going throughout the case so I wouldn't
worry too much about that you'll also
notice that the case ships with an 80
millimeter fan
however the fan is very loud and
unbearable in my opinion for most living
room uses this is a result of the grill
the fan grill vibrates when fans reach
higher rpms so do consider going for a
lower rpm or lower CFM fan the RPM is
important though because the air force
through makes a lot of the noise so do
go for a lower fan it's just worth the
eight bucks
preferably hydrodynamic or something
like that so you have an infinitely
quieter system the overall build quality
of the case is decided the average the
case doesn't try to achieve anything
fancy in for an extreme example in the
way the switch 810 does which blew us
away in our last review but it does
serve its purpose and the the case is a
little bit lacking on some features as
mentioned it it's quality is mediocre
the plasticky front panel feels flimsy
and the buttons feel like they're
fragile but I haven't had any any huge
problems with that no cracking or
anything like that the PSU is of
questionable quality but everything
works I have put the PSU under under
very extensive stress testing 24/7
benchmarking for the last three weeks
and it has remained stable I have not
been able to provoke a failure in that
PSU but your your mileage may vary so do
keep that in mind that it is a weak PSU
of a not particularly strong spec like
the rest of the case nothing feels like
it's exceptional and nothing feels like
it's going to snap into pieces either so
it's all pretty simple it does what it's
advertised but don't expect much more
than that
and all in all everything is very
mediocre it's 40 bucks and gets what you
want it to do done a 275 watt PSU and
functional case make it a reasonable
choice for ultra budgeted htpc builds
actually one of the better choices if
you're on a super strict budget but if
you have some extra money since you are
already spending money on a fan if you
buy this case do consider some of these
other options Silverstone's su G series
especially the SG 0 8 and SG 0 5 make
perfect sense for HCPCS though they are
on the upper price range more affordably
Silverstone's ml 0 3b micro ATX case
makes for a good slim option and the XT
is a Vulcan reign supreme with its
design but it is larger and more closely
resembles a traditional rig so it's
reasonable but it might not fit fit the
htpc style that you're going for
Thermaltake makes an $80 h CPC case that
accommodates most video cards with the
reasonable ability their land box of
light is what it's called it's a little
bit shiny but probably one of the better
options out there for micro ATX boxes
they also have an armor box which tends
to be great for FAT FAT gaming systems
that have larger cards you'll find that
the apex case is one of the most
affordable of all of these if only for
the fact that it includes a 275 watt
usable PSU so it should get you started
if you're on a budget overall the case
is good it does what it's advertised to
do it holds a small system it is not
phenomenal if
if you're looking to do anything with
video cards this is not your put your
way to go if you are looking to put it
on a small shelf you should consider it
17 inch depth it will stand upright but
you know keep that all in mind if you
have room for that kind of thing do not
keep this on the floor because it will
collect dust pretty quickly with no dust
management try to keep it elevated as
much as possible on a shelf is where I
would recommend it but again you may
have fitting issues so with all of that
