shows off prototypes at basically every
show and they are so prototype II that
they often get changed in significant
ways before coming out and sometimes we
see multiple iterations of the same
prototype over multiple years of trade
shows the Lucid series of cases would be
the latest example of that with the LD 0
1 and LD 0 2 going through a bit of an
existential crisis since there Computex
unveiling when there are many ITX cases
they are now micro-atx and that's what
we're talking about today before that
this coverage is brought to you by
Thermaltake and the flow liquid cooler
the flow is a 360 millimeter radiator
with three ring RGB LED fans you can
program the fans or custom lighting
through software and then of course
benefit from the larger radiator size
and cooling performance
learn more at the link in the
description below so the LD 0 1 &amp;amp; LD 0 2
are fairly straightforward cases except
for one feature a pipe or something
we'll talk about that later the rest of
it though it's an inverted motherboard
layout and so this is building on we've
seen it with the 600 C now which came a
bit after Silverstone's
own inverted layouts they've done
rotation and inversion for things like
the Raven 0 to case that we liked a long
time we go actually so it's back its
inverted layout which means that the
video card is facing up and that you
access the main compartment from the
right side of the enclosure rather than
the left the video card facing up is
supposed to solve some GPU thermal
concerns or challenges Silverstone tells
us and it makes sense
because they are also suggesting placing
intake fans on the top which is also not
that crazy we've tested it before and a
lot of people like to say but but Steve
how do I rises yes well generally air
moves in the direction that the 2,000
rpm fan pushes it also so kind of
irrelevant that hot air rises if you're
putting intake fans on the top in this
case and it makes sense for this layout
it would definitely help keep the GPU
cool you have it closest to the coldest
source of air
ambient temperature for the room and
then the front of the case has a dust
filter it's got
options for intake fans if you wanted to
place them there as we understand it now
the case will not ship with any but it
does have the option there's a bit of an
odd five and a quarter inch sized cutout
above the dust filter in the front which
again is filtering dust without any fans
behind it in its stock state but there's
a hole with no filter in front of it so
we're not sure if that's just unfine
alized maybe they lost the cover of it
during shipping or something like that
but we'll see what happens for that but
while we're at the front of the case
let's talk about the the pipe as we're
calling it the mystery pipe there's a
normal front panel with right side
ventilation just kind of get that in
your head right side ventilation just
like normally and then on the left side
there's a squared edge I think we might
do an illustration of it it's a square
edge that kind of comes out past the
front panel mesh and or glass in this
case and it's a hole that goes from the
top to the bottom and then there's
ventilation on the left of the front
panel that goes into the pipe so I don't
I think it's modern art basically is
what it comes down to there is zero
thermal advantage doing what they're
doing here so not really I I do not know
why that exists why not just make the
front panel wider so we'll we'll try and
talk some more about that it's just a
design thing as I understand it right
now that's the most interesting feature
of the case these cases they're the LD 0
1 and LD 0 2 there will be 120 to 130
dollars the difference between them is
tempered glass basically one of them has
tempered glass on pretty much all sides
and that there's at least one blackout
panel on it and then the other one has
traditional steel so those are the main
differences for the basics the fans
again it should ship with probably zero
maybe one in the rear otherwise cooling
mount support up to two 140 s in the
front door 280 and radiator that is
radiator support in the top might be a
bit challenging because there's limited
space between the motherboard and then
there's support for up to a 140 in the
back filters include the the front
filters is filtering the bottom
and that pretty much wraps it up
silverstone had one other case as well
this was the cs3 81 and it's basically
an 8 hot swap drive bay and closure
that's kind of a lock box so just kind
of looks neat not allowed to say about
it really it can fit a couple expansion
cards it can fit a lot of hard drives
and that's kind of the start and end of
that one so that's it for Silverstone
for now we will be visiting them again
on Friday I think so we might have more
information for you from the booth
including some more information on the
pipe but thank you for watching
subscribe for more as always you go to
patreon.com/scishow he next stops out
directly I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
