G episode we just got done last night
with the live stream where Paul jumped
in so we did a live stream overclocking
of the 2080 TI fe and the 2080 TI x ii
ultra from EVGA ended up beating the
goal of the goal of Saudi 400 points in
times by extreme graphics we got 70 for
35 Paul jumped in at one point and we we
started a beef a bit of a beef between
he tubers some west side versus east
side going on so he got 7400 before I
did and then about 30 seconds later we
got 70 for 12 and everyone spams Paul's
Twitter so but Paul did end up going
going up higher on his score I don't
know if he beat 74 35 yet but I think
we're gonna keep it going so keep an eye
out on that but we haven't asked yet so
as always leave your questions in the
comment section below for next week's
episode we have some good ones this week
got an answer from Johnny guru himself
who works at coarser these days not
Johnny guru anymore and then also a
pretty good discussion on how game
explosions work before that this video
is brought to you by EVGA SRT X 20 atti
XE ultra video card we recently used
this to beat our founders edition
overclocking results with its additional
power target headroom and cooling
capabilities the XC Ultra uses a 2.7
extra thick heatsink for a quiet
operation under low loads but also
maintains higher clocks on average over
the FE model learn more at the link in
the description below quick update on
the store as always we boil shirts are
officially 100 percent gone they will
never be back we had so I stated this in
the stream but we had we ordered the
amount to obviously meet the the orders
for pre-orders and all that stuff
earlier and we end up ordering a couple
of extra just in case any got lost in
the mail during that first round of
shipping because I would feel terrible
if someone's got lost like by USPS on
the way to Australia or something and we
didn't have any to fulfill it so we were
two extras fortunately none got lost we
released the extra inventory on stream
last night and now they're gone forever
so thank you for picking them up if you
got one a lot of fun with that shirt we
really liked how the design came out and
other than I mean if you missed it you
missed it that's it so anyway thanks ty
when you picked one up you are one of
the few let's get into the questions the
first one is from Andre bolo who says I
think this was on YouTube asked why do
games usually stutter when you are close
to an explosion or some other demanding
effect
I was playing Darksiders at war mastered
and I noticed a short stutter when
throwing cars into each other in order
for them to explode or make some Souls
the closer I was to the explosion the
more likely the game was to have a
slight drop in fps isn't rendering isn't
it rendering the same thing this is a
great question and so you have asked
also separately about why the name
gamers Nexus which is like hardware
Nexus or something well we started
entirely in games and used to do a lot
of coverage on games and how games work
so I have a good answer for this one if
anyone before getting into it if anyone
has questions about game graphics
specifically please leave them below
because we have some good contacts in
the industry industry at engine makers
at Nvidia AMD we have Andrew in our own
team does 3d art so we can get good
answers to game graphics questions so
for this one not exactly sure how
Darksiders does it but there are a few
ways games do explosions just cause is a
pretty good example of impressive
explosions in this one the explosions
aren't truly dynamic but they're faked
really well anything with a true dynamic
volumetric effect would be difficult to
run especially in real time but like
most graphics it can be faked in clever
ways true volumetric effects and
explosions would have smoked Angell's
for example cleaning - a plane as you
fly through a smoke cloud like in Just
Cause 2 but that's not so easy to do in
real time you could also see real
dynamic effects by flames so you have an
expression of flame being displaced from
the planes propeller for instance this
becomes a computational fluid dynamic
problem or CFD and it's not really
feasible in real time on a grand scale
but it can be done in isolated areas one
way to fake this kind of effect though
is to divide bounding boxes into voxels
which are then used for a calculation of
the results of the explosion at is fluid
dynamics the bounding boxes use an
algorithm that is typically built per
game or per engine and that algorithm
runs on a per voxel or even intra
box'll level to determine how the
explosion behaves with regard to the
graphics output a lot of this is GPU
intensive math and runs floats on the FP
use or the CUDA cores if you prefer or
stream processors but the resulting
physics calculations tend to go into a
single thread on the CPU if the effect
begins to exceed the confines of the
bounding box that means that the fluid
is clipped so if you've ever seen smoke
for example clip into the side of a 3d
object like a car or a building and
counter-strike or something although a
lot of those are just sprites actually
you'll see it cut off and the bounding
box size could also dynamically change
or scale to resolve this problem but
that creates a huge performance hit like
the one you're talking about
so the bounding box size dynamically
scales suddenly more computations are
required and memory cost increases
greatly as we noted in our old Nvidia
vxa o coverage you could also expand the
voxels but this would result in
decreased resolution and fidelity which
is very noticeable by the player so the
ways of faking it not really perfect but
that would avoid the clipping issues
where fluid terminates abruptly and the
visual quality of the facts would be
greatly downgraded with the reduced
resolution bounding boxes are also
imperfect four diagonal effects or thin
effects like playing contrails where a
lot of additional voxel space is wasted
and system resources are burned in the
calculations a lot of things can cause
slowdowns with game explosions one of
them is exceeding the bounding box size
to improve fidelity of the fluid
dynamics but it eats more vram and burns
more cycles in calculating the floats
another reason is CPU side where
excessive in-game physics calculations
will get forced onto one thread of the
CPU potentially causing a pipeline stall
if that thread can't keep up you could
also have an issue of bouncing off of
the frame buffer limit with resource
consumption as more operations are
pushed into memory via PCIe and where
assets are pulled like real-time damaged
assets for those vehicles draw calls
things like that for an effect that is
less volumetric and more geometric you
run into an issue of excessive draw
calls a draw call happens each time the
CPU has to tell the GPU to draw another
primitive like a triangle and it's
primarily an issue in dx11
or older higher-level ap is also
changing a significant amount of models
or meshes simultaneously
result in a sudden influx of draw calls
that must be juggled by both the CPU and
the GPU which could be happening in your
instance so Nvidia tried to solve a lot
of this with game works flow by only
allocating voxels immediately affected
by explosions and using Z buffers to
change voxel allocation as the fluid
expands or contracts but the technology
never got wide adoption so we'll show
some of that footage in the answer
anyway you just won't see it in games
these days and those aren't the only
ways to deal with explosions in games of
course sometimes you'll just see really
simple sprites so battlefield 5 that
demo that's supposed to be really
impressive with all the rage racing and
everything well if you look at it
closely enough the fire that's in there
not the raytrace fire but the normal
just fire on vehicles it's a
two-dimensional sprite with a lower
frame rate than the rest of the game so
it's it's really not a perfect way to do
it but actual fire effects are really
expensive to do in terms of resources so
there are lots of ways to do explosions
that's kind of the main one that we
talked about a couple years ago on that
article and bounding boxes are a good
way to do it it's just you run into some
resource cost issues you run into issues
where the effect clips you could do
dynamic explosions but those are
extremely resource intensive and cause
the issues you're talking about and
aren't too common but hopefully that
helps out next one is from this is
another actually really great question
with an answer from John gros aka Johnny
guru he used to run the power supply
review site so the question was from
Merlin to one see who said what impact
if any does an uninterruptible power
supply have on the performance of a
power supply in a PC in terms of loss of
efficiency due to voltage ripples etc
also would you recommend a UPS for
hooking up valuable computing or gaming
equipment in general to further aid in
power surge protection and not only
against brownouts
so John's answer I'm just going to quote
it cuz I can't do better his answer was
a UPS doesn't have an impact on the PS
use performance while it is still on
main power ie not running off of battery
but obviously your efficiency is going
to be shot to hell not that the PS use
efficiency is changed but since the UPS
has to maintain a charge to its
batteries and other UPS add-on features
like LCDs that tell you the battery
level power consumption etc it's
consuming power in addition to whatever
your computer is consuming as for is a
you
PS when running on battery good for your
power supply that entirely depends on
the ups and the PSU there are a lot of
variables involved in the plethora of
UPS is out there switch over time or how
long it takes to switch to battery power
when the mains drop and whether this
period of time is greater than the
holdup time of your PSU actual output
capability UPS s are typically marketed
with VA capability but not in watts ie a
1000 VA UPS may only support up to 600
watts and the shape of the sine wave
coming from the UPS went on battery
power considering the latter depending
on how square the sine wave produced by
the UPS is it could potentially damage a
cheaper PS use bulk capacitors sometimes
to achieve a 230 volt RMS output the
wave that may exceed the voltage rating
of the capacitor now a good quality
power supply that sees this should shut
off and not all UPS is will over voltage
to obtain a proper RMS voltage it really
comes down to doing the proper research
prior to purchasing your PSU and your
UPS bottom line is however a decent
quality UPS and a decent quality PSU
aren't going to have any issues
whatsoever as for the use of an AVR it's
simply better to just have a PSU that
doesn't crap out on you turning a
brownout
it's not uncommon for a 230 volts only
PSU to shut down if the mains drop below
180 volt or 190 volt depending on the
build of the PSU but if you have a PSU
that supports a full range of input
voltage the PSU won't even blink
pun intended if the voltage drops all
the way down to 90 volts of course if
you're somewhere where the power drops
out completely for periods of greater
than 16 milliseconds you should get a
UPS as for surge protection never take
for granted that your power supply has
built-in surge protection or even if you
know it does that is enough or won't
result in a dead power supply even
though the rest of your components
should survive intact get a good power
strip he says and by good he means that
one that you know is dead when it gets
hit with a surge it should either stop
working completely or have a light that
tells you it's still protecting I prefer
the latter or one with a built-in
breaker that trips during a surge and
can be reset - these can be expensive
like my favorite trip light isobar but
are very cool so TLDR quality UPS
quality PSU quality power strips
no problems ever so that answer is from
John or Johnny guru as many of you
likely know I'm Johnny guru for the
longest time and still has been one of
the leading power spot review sites when
John worked there definitely kind of
created a market for power spot reviews
so this is for sure an expert that can
be trusted on the answer and he's these
days if you're curious he's at Corsair
but still provides great I mean you'll
notice this is the difference between
marketing PR and people who are more
engineering side not once not once did
John use the word Corsair in this entire
giant block of text so it's not even
trying to market something to you which
is pretty cool we very much appreciate
that thank you John for the very
straightforward answer and I guess if
you do want to follow up on Johnny guru
he's still got someone writing reviews
over there so next question is from raid
the road she said Steve a scene that the
8700 K or 8086 K is the bottleneck on
the new GPU is that 1080p gaming would
someone have to push for one of the
enthusiast CPUs in order to reach say
240 Hertz gaming or we at the point
where the current TV offerings just
won't allow us to break into that 240
FPS for the majority of games so the the
problem with h.t.t.h
EDT cpu is like the Intel enthusiast
CPUs is that as you increase core count
you're gonna decrease the frequency and
a lot of games still care more about
frequency than cores especially be on
something like six or eight cores or
twelve or sixteen threads so it running
a seven and eight exe would expand your
head room for 3dmark but for a lot of
games that drop in frequency will impact
you in a negative way more than the
cores will impact you in a positive way
so a lot of games run maybe eight
threads they might have game physics
thread game logic
maybe AI processing definitely a render
thread that'll get hit really hard and
as long as the render thread is one
thread entirely on its own and not split
between more which is common for a lot
of these modern game engines the
frequency will matter more because that
single thread is going to hold the
entire pipeline if it's not fast enough
to keep up with all the draw calls all
the render operations coming down the
pipe and then physics of course is also
heavily impacted in some games so the
answer is to an extent HDD can help like
the seven
100 accent maybe but in 8086 Karen so
fast it's just it's gonna depend on the
game and not many games will use 10
cores 20 threads so these instances
frequency will help more 8700 k 8086 k
you see rise in 2000 series really
caught up a lot so frequencies not
everything architecture matters too
but even then a high end rise in cpu
will make more sense in a lot of games
than like a 32 core threader per CPU the
the frequency hit will hurt you more
than the core count gain in almost every
gaming scenario that exists today so
what's the limit then yeah sure nadie 86
sometimes did bottleneck the GPU we were
testing at 1080p but the problem with
that it wasn't always F 1 2018 didn't
really bottleneck until we overclocked
and even then we're not sure a
bottleneck because we don't have
anything better than that to validate so
it doesn't always bottleneck at 1080p
with the 20/80 TI you can do stuff like
blast anti-aliasing buddy free goal is
240 FPS that's not gonna help
so I don't know 240 FPS is hard to hit
anyway I would say an 80 80 6k 7900 ax
one of those would put you closer to
that goal but it's gonna depend on the
games you can always drop settings like
if you're bound by the CPU not the GPU
you can start dropping things like
geometry so there's any setting that
changes how much geometry is on the
screen or the details of the meshes sure
it'll help the GPU to but it'll
primarily help with the CPU and dealing
with a lot of draw calls and LOD view
distance those things would impact how
much the CPU limits you as well so
anything like that game physics would
impact you those are aware the the CPU
tends to get hit harder than the GPU in
games but no I don't think if it doesn't
bottleneck at that much
it just it depends on the game like like
I said F 1 2018 didn't really bottleneck
on the TI which is kind of impressive
but so wasn't 240 FPS there's only 211
that's that's not enough for you I don't
know tell ya there's not a lot more that
you can get trogdor 8 Freebird does that
near t.j.maxx actually hurt the CPU for
example a 7700 K at 95 C 24/7 that
sounds bad to me and probably many
people's ears but is it actually bad or
does it just sound bad because typically
hot equals bad 95 C is pretty high
we'll be some thermal degradation on
parts so example of this if you're
working on well degradation to VRMs is
pretty common if they run like 125 C or
something like that you start D rating
but capacitors another really good
example caps over 105 see if the rated
for 1 over 5 C it's typically for 10,000
hours five thousand hours two thousand
hours something like that and once you
go over that 105 C point every 10
degrees you have the life of the
capacitor so those are instances for
sure or it matters but the caps even on
the Intel CPUs it's not like they're on
the die they're far enough away they're
not going to be running at 95 C it will
be significantly lower so that's not
really your concern
typically the bigger problem with CPUs
as thermal cycling not sustained load so
when when I worked at Dell we would do
thermal aging tests so the goal is to
see like how long does this lithium-ion
battery for a laptop survive under these
adverse thermal situations and we did
ruggedized PC testing stuff that would
go to like Iraq for the war so you test
laptops under extremely intensive
scenarios for heat because they're going
to the desert and dealing with sand and
so the way that a lot of that was tested
this is all pretty much public knowledge
at this point the way it was tested is
by simulating
age with heat cycling so you put that
stuff in there was a where I worked
there was a building that had a what was
it called
the name of the lab but had a shock and
vibe that also had thermal chambers and
so you put the stuff in there and cycle
heat loads so it go really hot and cool
down really hot some of them even had
chambers that could go cold to like
below ambient and that's typically used
to simulate age and the reason I bring
this up is because if that's used to
simulate age rapidly because you have to
think the product is being developed
it's coming to market let's say you're
advertising it as hate can survive five
years in these conditions you haven't
tested it for five years you don't
really know so one way to know is to
simulate it and if they're doing that to
simulate age and this is pretty well
known to you know for sure that thermal
cycling is worse for it than just a
straight 24/7 load so that's the theory
and practice it could be different but
getting back to the heart of your
question running at Intel does a bit
behaves differently than AMD at 90 C 95
C Intel as long as it's not a t.j.maxx
it's not dropping clocks will age can't
really answer that firmly we don't have
like enough of a sample size to truly
know but realistically at 90 C on Intel
yeah 90 C looks better I could say 95
that's getting kind of high for my my
taste for a lot of the processors but 90
C leaves you enough Headroom where if
you're under if your ambient temperature
goes up 5 C which is not crazy you're
still under TJ max where's 95 it goes up
5 so you're hitting TJ Max and that's
gonna be a problem but 90 C Intel is not
gonna drop clocks it doesn't look good
it's probably not good for your OCD
thermally if you like if you have that
but it's fine
AMD has an office mate optimal operating
temperature below 70 degrees Celsius
depend on if you're calculating in that
offset they do so optimal temperature
below 70 C and it behaves closer to GPUs
and boosting frequencies so for an D
rise in 2000 series processors if it's
cooler it'll boost a bit higher the
hotter it gets the lower boost so that
is a limitation and also I think they
aged a bit differently - but I don't
they haven't been out long enough for me
to really know build Zoid may know more
about this you can go paint him on his
channel actually hardcore overclocking
but my my answer to you is in theory the
damage should be worse from intensive
thermal cycling between like 90 and 50
than from straight 90 all the time 95 I
try to bring up it down a bit just
because it doesn't make me feel good but
I don't have any scientific like data to
say 95 C is more likely to kill the CPU
faster realistically for most of these
processors they are likely to become
obsolete just by nature of becoming
obsolete then die from a thermal
scenario they're pretty resilient and
they have a lot of protections to shut
them down their current protections all
that stuff next question
one of the last few tech professor said
does case internal volume have
significant impact on thermal testing
beyond case form-factor primarily in
that it takes longer to heat the extra
material and reach steady state but our
test is long enough that it doesn't
matter we've factored that in and I
guess you also have longer cooldown time
too but
and it's just it's more material it's
bigger so it'll take longer to heat all
that material up during a test next one
Andre Scott says how is progress on the
RAM timing series part one was very
informative and helps to explain primary
timings and how they reworked in
relation to each other part two is done
we are working on some animations for it
just like the first one once those are
done we'll have that uploaded and then
we've got as in Therese ed just to be
clear for new builders which way does it
air go through a graphics card heatsink
talked about this last week but correct
me if I'm wrong the air is pushed in
through it and exhaust into the case
through the sides of the card with aiv
cards rather than pulling it from the
sides it's not pulled in from the sides
it might be on like one card it's not
it's almost never pulled in through the
sides even on the blower card so there's
Nvidia blower cards on the far right of
the card if you have a PCIe slot
oriented on the left far right of the
card there's that grille and it looks
like air comes in through there but
actually it doesn't because if you take
the shroud out underneath it there's the
the blower fan and then it's got this
hook around it on the outer edge of the
card and that's to direct the air
through that flow path so it actually
doesn't come through the side of those
either even though it looks like it does
it's just it's just for looks those fins
don't even do anything they're not
contact its contacting anything so just
we looked and in a partner card with
like dual a triple axial typically yeah
it works just like a case pan the air
goes in down through the top of it and
it gets pushed out wherever it can so
it's not like there's not a flow path
necessarily there's a flow path and so
far as the fins are pointed at a certain
way it's either horizontal or vertical
that affects where it exits but the air
just follows whatever path to exit it
can which is typically out the sides and
some can come out the back yes there's
there's holes in the back for the reason
for that reason two more elitist jerk
who has the most appropriate name on the
Internet
it's just it's very fitting for I don't
know a hundred percent of Reddit for
example elitist jerk actually has a very
nice comment though because elitist jerk
says would GN consider doing D boxing
videos in place of unboxing videos for
unboxing embargo lifts that is to say
destroy the Box creatively first while
leaders jerk I like that you know you've
I guess I should say your your father
very disappointed you didn't live up to
your name elitist jerk man
what a what a missed opportunity
should've seen the comments last week
from TM so elitist jerk we had an
unboxing video wherein we unboxed the
box with an angle grinder let's just
drop the b-roll of that in there and
maybe we can do more of those if the
companies keep doing this thing so you
bring up a really good question that's
been bothering me the nvidia embargo
lifts did not for the US didn't allow
disassembly of the cards and they didn't
communicate that message to any other
regions apparently so we posted ours
anyway because other people started
posting theirs from other regions so it
is actually a problem that these
unboxing embargoes are like it's just
pure marketing everyone knows that
linus didn't do an unboxing of the RT x
cards linus was the king of unboxings
when his channel was new and in speaking
with him he's been public about this too
if it's just a straight open the box
embargo it doesn't add really any value
and he knows that it's just a marketing
play and I don't know if they're just
trying to get marking his you can't even
take it apart so I have a problem with
unboxing barrios and if they continue to
restrict the the loopholes we find in
them where we can do other stuff with
the card then maybe we will start doing
destruction embargoes instead just angle
grind through it accidentally cut the
card and have something like that then
oops guess we did a teardown by accident
last question mark Gucci said not really
an ass gen question I love the to stuff
to animal cats in the background videos
can you start moving the two cats in
different places in each video like a
mini Where's Waldo nope
