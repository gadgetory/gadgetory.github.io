2018 looking at two primary products one
is a prototype the other one is in front
of me that's the Z 370 god-like
motherboard for Intel's of course
coffee-like platform it's got some
interesting power design we'll be
talking about we've got most of the
information on this one and it's
definitely a flagship probably in the
500 ish dollar range so we'll be getting
to that after this before that this
coverage is brought to you by
Thermaltake and the flow liquid cooler
the flow is a 360 millimeter radiator
with three ring RGB LED fans you can
program the fans our custom lighting
through software and then of course
benefit from the larger radiator size
and cooling performance
learn more at the link in the
description below so for these III 70
godlike board this is a brand that has
existed in the past or MSI they're
bringing it back for coffee lake they've
got a couple of key features here
obviously this has a lot of the gamer
embellishments on it with for example
caution ultimate power and things like
that the most interesting feature on the
MSI motherboard is probably the network
switch that's built in the network
switch basically it's three Ethernet
ports on the back of the board and you
can plug a console or some other device
into the board and then out of it will
come the signal that goes back to the
router so you can actually use the board
as a switch itself or another device at
the base of it it's an 18 phase so it
has it's a doubled eight phase VRM plus
two for the memory and they're using IR
or international rectifier 3555 MOSFETs
for it with a 35 201 controller which
we've seen actually pretty frequently in
the last couple months for the that's
also IR by the way for the voltage
controller other than that memory
support is 40 133 megahertz at its max
for this board officially and that is
powered by the two phase vr m v mm v RM
other information those are 60 amp hour
stages so the 35 55 or 60 amp stages can
handle plenty of power it's spread out
over 16 of them for V Corps and the the
heatsink on this one is getting closer
to what we're looking for
it's so it is it's kind of diced in a
way that it's not just a big
block this time it does actually have
some surface area to it and then it's
got the usual covers for IO cover and
for the kind of metal top cover with all
the branding on it so it's getting there
it's looking better than previously for
power configuration this one is an 8 + 4
for EPS 12-volt there's also a 6 pin PCI
power for the PCIe slots of which there
are 4 16 length slots so those would be
by 16 and then 3 by eights by 1688
all the way down the board which is
definitely on the high end for PCIe
electrical wiring so a lot of the boards
do by fours in there as well so that's
kind of cool if you like doing a 4-way
set up for GPUs other than that most the
board's kind of covered at this point
there's kind of the expected USB 3.1
gen2 and support for all that stuff that
you've seen basically every board at
this point it has the built-in
overclocking switch it uses a lookup
table so you turn it to different
numbers it checks a lookup table it
applies that overclock your cpu and
whatever else and then you're pretty
much good to go obviously we would
recommend you manually overclock these
boards it's decently powerful but it is
an expensive board so might be something
we look at in the future with build Zoid
to analyze the BRM for its actual
high-end overclocking capabilities the I
mentioned the m2 heat shield since we've
done that in the past or these this time
are they're aluminum instead of the
previous which was a stainless steel so
aluminum significantly better thermal
conductor than stainless steel for the
gen one and they're also using slightly
thicker their old pads which is just
good for ensuring that there's flush
contact with all the components and of
course I've talked about the difference
of cooling and vs. controllers in the
past so we won't go through that again
but those are all of the main changes on
this one and for the other item the
prototype that I mentioned that is a new
edition of the Titan laptop which is the
sort of Halo product that we've seen in
the past the mechanical keyboard all
that stuff just ignoring all of those
features for a moment this is a product
where MSI is trying to introduce HDR
displays to laptops we
one we can't film it with HDR display
and two it's relevant because we don't
have an HDR camera and probably 99% of
you don't have an HR display either but
the idea is they're putting HDR displays
and laptops right now it's extremely
limited there are five of them in
existence there are two here and there
are prototypes so it's a little while
out sort of long-term view and besides
trying to go for HDR 100 Hertz displays
which would be crazy if they can pull it
off and eventually roll it out into
smaller consumer laptops that are more
affordable and not just halo products
but they're starting there because
they've limited quantity so MSI has told
us that they are ready to go they're
just waiting for their suppliers to
produce enough of the panels to use in
laptops at the laptop sizes and major
challenges for HDR displays have
included primarily thermals so you have
obviously a higher power higher quality
display sitting in your laptop which is
pretty enclosed they have to deal with
thermals so that's been the main thing
they've been dealing with and they're
trying to work towards obviously making
sure that the display can sit in there
without burning out so it'll be a little
while waiting on supply and working on
the thermal challenges but it's
something to keep an eye out for if
you're interested in that kind of thing
ultimately means HDR is coming to
consumer in a much greater way for the
next few years so that's it for Emma
