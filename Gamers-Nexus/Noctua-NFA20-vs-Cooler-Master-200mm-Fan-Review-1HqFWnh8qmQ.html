shift in the industry back when they
were big with the Coolermaster 1/2 X the
NZXT phantom 820 the Rosewell Thor and
throne cases and silver stones 180
millimeter variance in the Raven zero to
that trend mostly died and has recently
been somewhat revitalized by the
coolermaster H 500 P which contains the
master fan MF 200 our units Noctua also
shipped their new 200 millimeter fans
called the NF a 20s and so it feels as
if there's somewhat of a resurrection of
what was attempted a few years ago today
we're testing the Noctua NF a 20s versus
the Coolermaster MF 200 our fans
including some brief tests in the H 500
P before that this video is brought to
you by thermal grizzly makers of the
conductor not liquid metal that we
recently used to drop 20 degrees off of
our coffee like temperatures thermal
grizzly also makes traditional thermal
compounds we use on top of the IHS like
cryo not and hydronaut pastes learn more
at the link below for anyone who is into
PC building a couple years ago you
probably remember the two hundred
millimeter fans being basically
everything at least all the big cases
had them a lot of NZXT stuff cooler
master cases fantex cases had some the
inner max cases had some so they were
making their rounds but before we get
into the review you really have to look
at a couple of things which is why did
they come about what were the positives
and why did they go away so that we can
understand why for a couple years at
least almost no case has had 200
millimeter fans and they've suddenly
come back with the H 500 P which is
somewhat building on a legacy of the
half series and then now knocked well
with their own 200 millimeter fans so
there's a resurgence here so let's talk
about that part of the reasons they went
away were cost being one of the big ones
they're expensive to make and they're
expensive to buy as a consumer part of
the reason they're expensive is because
obviously the size but more than that in
order to keep the fan operating within
spec and make sure it doesn't have
weighting issues or off balance issues
you have to spend money on them
quality had to spend more money on the
hub the motor and the bearings because
if that motor and those bearings are
carrying these bigger blades that's more
weight that causes strain on the fan on
the bearing and on the motor so this is
something we spoke with some of the
engineers about why they moved away from
those fans and that was more or less one
of the bigger issues so you could get
them cheaper but you have the issue of
potentially blades snapping we had some
of that happen on the old NZXT fans
before they had a gen to come out or of
just the motor dying out or wobbling as
it spins for example another reason that
they went away was the the form factor
of the fans so even on these fans they
have two mounting holes two sets of
mounting positions for the fans
Coolermaster has two sets as well and
there are a couple other form factors
out there for large fans there's a kind
of weird one that Silverstone largely
exists in which is 180 with their air
penetrator fans from the Raven case and
there's a couple there's at least one
other 200 ish sized fan that has its own
set of mounting holes so this meant that
there was not a lot of standardization
between the cases which meant that
because the manufacturers didn't really
agree on how they should be mounted and
where the mounting holes should be
positioned you had issues of
incompatibility and now when we're in an
age where customizing is at the
forefront look at things like RGB LEDs
for example and all the tempered-glass
incompatibility doesn't necessarily fly
so that was a big problem too and then
another one is just cases moving away
from a cooling focus and moving away
from big mesh panels and trying to get
back to closed off paneling sleek is
kind of a big buzzword to throw around
to things like that so then it's just
moved away the pros of these fans
they're larger so they can move a lot
more air because they're cut through a
bigger hole obviously in the case and
this means that you can run them at
lower rpms they're quieter has a lot
quieter in some cases but they move a
lot of air and that air is also over a
wide spread of just over the whole case
so if you have a side panel that's got a
200
it that's very nearly the size of your
motherboard it's great for cooling the
GPU it's gonna get some cooling on the
VRMs as well if you have an a IO or a
CLC and will help out pretty much
everything in the case so that's a big
positive so that's most of the upshot in
the original deployments these were
against metal mesh paneling so we're
gonna be using some of that today in our
testing to go over what we're looking at
the Noctua NF 820 this one cost $30
right now the master fan isn't yet
available separately but probably will
be at some point it's what's in the H
500 P now and based on other master fan
RGB prices stand-alone we would assume
that would also be 30 to 40 dollars so
they should be pretty direct comparison
the master fan also is crazy on the RGB
this fan has no LEDs at all it's just I
mean putting LEDs on this would be kind
of pointless anyway look at it so
they're very different and how they look
which means they kind of focus on
different markets you don't buy this
because you want it to look good you buy
it because you want it to look like
naktu I guess and there's something to
be said for that as well because there
are plenty of people who like to have
that nock to a look because I guess to
some extent knocked was done very well
to market themselves as a sort of an
engineering focused brand and they've
now associated this color with that so
if you like that look then obviously
you're not going to get that with
Coolermaster as for how we tested we
have a we actually have a wind tunnel
now we're not using it for these fans
because they're too big for it but we
will be using it soon so keep an eye out
for a big fan roundup that we're doing
with wind tunnel testing but what we're
doing instead is similar to what we did
for the Noctua china-made versus taiwan
made fans we have an anemometer that
allows us to take measurements in linear
feet per minute and we're positioning
that on the outside of a case side panel
so we're using a thrown side panel with
mesh on the side it has native 200
millimeter fan support it supports the
mounting holes for all the fans that we
have presently and we're only testing
two today so we mount the fans of
that push the air through the panel and
then take a reading of that airspeed on
the other side and that gives us our LPM
or if you prefer fpm reading which is
linear feet per minute we are also
testing for noise we're testing LP m at
every rpm range in steps of 10 percent
so 30 to 100 or 40 to 100 we lose
resolution after that and we're testing
the noise up many of the same intervals
but we have a noise floor of 26 DBA so
below that you get no reading basically
you read the room noise at that point
and then finally we have a noise
normalized chart for the LP M as well so
let's get through it we're gonna start
with the linear feet per minute flow
will look at normalized noise the noise
after that starting with the LP m chart
now we're looking at a range of 40
percent to 100 percent for which we'll
have matching rpm numbers in the article
link in the description below the Noctua
fan pushed air at 423 linear feet per
minute at 100 percent RPM a lead over
the cooler master fan a 378 L p.m. keep
in mind that these gains don't
necessarily translate directly and
especially not linearly to performance
uplift in a real system air flow is
complex so it's not a linear scale to
convert LP m gains to temperature gains
for example at the low end of the RPM
range from 40 to 60 percent Coolermaster
retain the lead but those speeds are low
enough that you're really not moving
much air anyway and not doing a whole
lot of cooling at 40 percent we're at
145 to 160 LP m with the breeze weak
enough that there won't be much
appreciated component performance with
either of these two fans the two tie at
70 percent matching at 275 LP m and to
really get an idea of how this compares
we can do it noise normalized test next
these noises represent various RPMs we
can show those in a moment at roughly
34.5 DB a plus or minus 0.5 the NOx with
an pushes for 24 L p.m. where a cooler
master does at 334 LP m at 33 DBA we're
running at 386 L p.m. on Noctua and 3:02
on cooler master 31 DBA has us at 316
versus 275 L p.m. for Noctua and cooler
master respectively as for where those
noise that
were chosen hears the noise chart
overall and the rough 34.5 DBA range
comes as a middle point between the 100%
RPM knocked to a fan and ninety percent
RPM Coolermaster fan which run at
roughly thirty four point nine and
thirty four point four DBA respectively
our testing scale is down to about
twenty six point nine DBA and this is
where we no longer have test resolution
the noise floor of the room is about
twenty six decibels and we disable all
system fans so it is not possible for us
to test below this noise floor and we
also lose accuracy as we approach twenty
six the knock to a fan remains generally
ahead but has a wider acoustic
performance lead at the low-end if you
recall Coolermaster had a bit of an L
p.m. lead at the same low end for its
test so these would match with those
noise findings and just quickly here's
an RPM chart that shows the RPM to PWM
response or rpm two percent response in
terms of the one hundred percent versus
forty percent scaling on each fan if you
want to see how fast those go then ask
for temperatures blender GPU testing
often had our difference within margin
of error and test resolution with a
maximum change of about one degree
Celsius the blenders CPU test shows
about the same testing three marked fire
strike we saw the Noctua fans were
generally about one to two degrees
advantaged for GPU temperatures so not
that exciting so for the H 500 P that we
tested and controlled testing with a lot
of different tests between them we're
not seeing a huge difference certainly
not one that if you wanted extra
performance you should go by the fans
for and I should mention as stated a
moment ago this was for the H 500 Pima
schmod so we actually made it easier for
the case to breathe and it still got to
be some static pressure performance for
the fans some optimisation for static
pressure because it's fighting that
front mesh but basically we're not
seeing a huge change with this
particular setup it's possible that with
different setups you would see more of
an uplift with Knoxville vs.
Coolermaster the bigger difference is
looking at the noise to rpm or the noise
to LPM change because at 100% we're
seeing
kind of roughly the same performance
favoring Noctua one to two degrees max
but not to a can run at the can maintain
the same LPM flow as the Coolermaster
unit with a slightly lower fan speed and
also a lower noise level so really what
this comes down to is less raw
performance at max RPMs and more of
performance and consistency of
performance as you decrease the RPM to
better accommodate noise neat they're
pretty quiet already at 100% but if you
wanted them quieter you can step down
knock to a further while retaining more
performance theoretically depending on
the case of course and and then you
would be able to get a better noise
normalized result than with coolermaster
for example they're not gonna be that
far apart though in performance it
really is it comes down to knocked was a
little bit quieter cooler master has RGB
LEDs and comes with the aged 500 P so
those are two things to consider as for
the cooler master fans in general we
notice that our fans wobble a bit and a
lot of you noticed this in the review as
well we never mentioned it in that H 500
P review but the particularly the one
fan we were testing which was 50% of our
sample size from coolermaster wobbles
kind of like a bike wheel that's out of
true so you'll see it just sort of I
don't know it just it moves around about
the axis as if it's off weighted or just
not fully centered or something like
that
and that's what actually creates some of
the noise difference because that
wobbling which exists on both samples
does create some noise and that's
largely where the difference comes in
actually but yeah that's that's really
it pretty simple test in terms of
performance
you probably don't really need to pick
based on performance it's just what do
you like the looks of and the master fan
you can't technically buy right now
anyway a time of filming so that's not
really an option unless you're just
looking to buy the case and then trying
to figure out if you should replace the
fans stay tuned though we'll have a full
fan roundup 120 and 140 millimeters
here's what I'd like to you to do if you
have a particular fan that you really
want to see tested in 120 or 140 sizes
leave a comment below and we're gonna go
through them and pick a few probably
between 5 and 10 of the most popular
suggestions and then test them on the
new wind tunnel that we're working on
