AJ's crowning engineering achievement
for this generation as always the KP
cards aren't necessarily meant for
people who well they aren't meant for
people who just want a card and don't
have any personal or enthusiast interest
in overclocking or playing around with
it and in addition to this review
tomorrow's video will have us gaming
with liquid nitrogen on this card so
we're extreme overclocking but actually
doing gaming benchmarks through our
standard suite you'll want to check back
for that especially if you're one of the
people who says liquid nitrogen
overclocking this point list you can't
play games with it because we're proving
you wrong this is a card for people who
really want to get low level with
hardware and into the weeds and today
we're testing it as it was meant to be
tested our review looks at the kingpin
card for quality under liquid nitrogen
but also looks at normal use cases like
straight out of the box performance
thermals and power performance and
overclocked gaming performance with the
stock water loops but again also Alan to
this card allows users to completely
remove the power limit from Nvidia
architecture the bane of our existence
and we're looking to see if it's worth
it and for whom it might be worth it
before that this video is brought to you
by thermal grizzly and their high-end
thermal compounds thermal grizzly makes
cryo not paste for high thermal
performance and conductivity without
being electrically conductive so you
don't have to worry about shorting
components cryo knot is particularly
good for replacing stock GPU pastes as
cryo knot is a non curing compound learn
more at the link in the description
below we've done a lot of coverage of
this card it's currently coated in
Vaseline for overclocking stop it
so the the card we previously looked at
we did a teardown of it you can check
that separately but we'll talk a bit
about here we did the builds Ord
coverage of its PCB and vrm quality and
they're very high it's a well-built card
but it's extremely expensive and that
means that most people will probably
look at it and scoff at the price and
that's fine because it's it's really not
meant for average use it's not meant for
someone who would buy a 20 80 TI fe or
XC ultra or something like that this is
meant for overclockers for enthusiasts
and although it can be overclocked
without alan - of course it excels with
alan -
or exotic cooling but the lack of power
limits the added tools for voltage
control do give you some additional
power with just the stock cooler which
is a 240 millimeter CLC at $1,900 this
is one of the most expensive video cards
on the market you have the Titan r-tx
above it and then we're not counting
things like quadros so tight r-tx is
about 2500 this however is capable of
outperforming the Titan r-tx even
without L&amp;amp;T in gaming workloads now it's
still a lot of money so yeah it's
cheaper but you're talking $1,900 and
the improvements versus a stock XE ultra
or something might not really be worth
it to you but that's because it's not
meant to be used that way so the way
this card is really properly used is by
playing around with it and what you can
do with this one that you can't do with
a lot of the other cards is things like
add the xoc bios you can completely
eliminate the Nvidia power limit and
even if you're not doing an exotic
cooling you can still take the CLC which
is a 240 millimeter a Sutekh CLC and we
can show that and be roll a bit and that
comes with a cold plate on it that's a
bit modified so it's got a protruded
cold plate we'll talk about that more
later but it's a flatter service it
works better with GPUs that are exposed
die rather than an IHS which has a
slight curvature to it so that's
beneficial for cooling and that it's got
this larger vrm fan Adhan as well so if
you care about stock performance you can
overclock it pretty damn high and we'll
go through those numbers with the stock
cooler on it you can also run the noise
levels fairly low with an overclock
that's pretty high and that's because of
the 240 CLC large fan on the vrm and
then there are icx sensors if you want
to look at things like the thermals of
memory of the VRM frankly it's not that
important to look at those because
they'll be under control so it's not
like you can really do anything with the
information but it's cool to look at and
they do use NTC thermistors for those
which we've previously validated to be
accurate to the real world so it's not
like it's some BS marketing those are
actually the temperatures
it's just that what you can do with that
information under stock use it's pretty
limited it's just cool to know hence
being an enthusiast card you're paying
for
features that are just interesting not
necessarily practical and that's fine
there are practical features too though
and the power limits one of them but
being able to effectively get an extreme
overclocking card out of the box that
having to do any hard mods yourself is
the real value add of an EXO seat card
whether that's Galax or whether that's
something like the KP card and this is
something that often gets overlooked and
just when users are commenting on these
types of products so go back over the
basics in the XOC live streams we did we
got up to 25 80 megahertz that's really
high the stock frequency of something
like an XE ultra is under 2,000 mega
Hertz and that's a higher-end 20 80 TI
as well when you overclock most 28 ET is
on the market they tend to stop at
around maybe 20 50 megahertz plus or
minus about 50 megahertz
20 50 is about where we see the the mean
and excursions from that mean are rare
and often negative not positive so this
card that's with an overclocked by the
way this card runs at about 20 40
megahertz out of the box now does that
impact your performance a lot not
necessarily we'll talk with that in the
numbers today but it gives you a higher
starting point for overclocking at which
point you can sort of springboard to
2526 megahertz and potentially beyond
these GPS are also Bend we have footage
of an MSI bidding tool that was at one
of MSI factories EVGA uses something
similar it's not the exactly the same
thing to our understanding but EVGA uses
a similar tool to take the individual
GPUs and we've seen trays and trays of
those put it into a socketable tester
and then validate the performance if
it's a good chip it goes into a KP card
if it's not as good of a chip it might
go into something like a black condition
card where you're not really guaranteed
a high clock or maybe an actually ultra
if it's kind of good but not XOC good so
these are Bend and pre-selected and KP
kingpin who's one of the leading
overclockers is heavily involved in the
process of setting those parameters and
and working through the cards in fact a
lot of these were pre tested by kingpin
especially the early ones or at least
the ones that went out to some of the
media so let's get into the numbers
we'll talk about how the overclocking
works go through our OC stepping chart
get through the gaming by
Marx for fun thermals and power and talk
conclusions here's how the kingpin card
works the card has three bio switches by
default the switches include a regular
OC and Ln to be BIOS but even the LNT UV
bios isn't really ready for Alan Zoo for
that you'll want the XO CV BIOS which is
made available on X devs dot-com X Deb's
is run by ten one of the two evil
geniuses behind the kingpin card and has
an incredible guide about how the card
works even if you don't want to buy the
card but you're just interested in
learning about hardware this is an
excellent starting point to learn some
more about how GPUs work the guide is
honestly one of the most in-depth we've
seen on the Internet the XO CV bio says
password protected the password is again
I promise not to RMA this card
indicating exactly why it's not on the
card by default as for the V BIOS
differences the regular V bios runs a
hybrid fan speed range of 0 to 48%
running quieter with vrm fan speed at 22
53% you just don't need more with that v
bios and there's a table on tin site
that has this information the fan stops
under idle load whereas OC and ellen to
be buy us options never stop the fan and
run higher speeds power limit is still
360 watts on all of them and the power
target is 144 percent max on all of them
there's no thermal protection on the
Ellen 2 switch but the others have it
the XOC b bios gets rid of the power
target it's just 100 percent all the
time all of that said you'll still run
into n V V DD o CP or the GPU core
voltage over current protection which
can be forced off with EB J's classified
tool the classified tool is what we used
during our XOC stream to tune the
voltages for the card and it makes
available NV v DD which is effectively v
core FB VD D which is memory voltage and
PEX voltage these can be tuned
even without the XO cv bios and NV v DD
OCP can be disabled with this tool we
have to turn it off when tuning the
voltage to the core as we hit the
maximum current quickly but the card can
still handle more you'll want to keep V
Corps under 1.3 volts when not using
exotic cooling here's our OC stepping
chart the chart is split into peak
frequency the average frequency with a
given set of
settings temperature during the run
which will fall between crashes and vvd
D power target and more note that the
power target is removed with the exo cv
bios as there is no power limit in this
mode with the regular v bios we found
that we were last stable in row 12 at
about 21 at 45 megahertz average
frequency this is damn good for a
starting point but we knew that we could
improve it with more work ultimately the
regular v bios and talent to be bios
don't actually change a whole lot for
non xoc overclocking and even well even
with it doesn't matter it just doesn't
change a lot but we switched anyway to
run higher fan speeds and remove some of
the protections with the allen 2v bios
our final stable result was 21 60
megahertz average frequency we're about
22 20 megahertz peak frequency we tended
to bounce between 21 60 and 2205
depending on the workload at any given
second the power as measured by gbz read
377 watts but we know this to be
somewhat inaccurate so you can mostly
ignore that column well instead refer
you to our power tests later in the
video
we found that NV VDD was actually
limiting us more than it was helping so
we set it back to auto and ran 10 80
millivolts the reason for this is
because the voltage begins to pull away
power from the core after all wattage is
equal to volts times current and
increasing the voltage to the core will
reduce how many watts we have available
to actually boost the clock it actually
goes negative so you get diminishing
returns and the negative returns if you
push the voltage too high we also had
some black screen issues which we
eventually traced back to NV VDD with
OCP on so the next step was to use the
EXO TV BIOS and then disable OCP
although you could do this without the
extra cv bios if you wanted for this
testing all with the stock cooler
we found the max table configuration to
be 2200 5 megahertz core and 14 60
megahertz offset on the memory we
couldn't get the next step stable and so
settled here with a 1.2 NV VDD raising
to 1.25 didn't seem to help
nor did 1.3 and so our next step was
liquid nitrogen will show some live
stream clips for this section working
with experienced overclocker dosed upon
z AKA bearded hardware on youtube we
were able to get the card up to a
respectable 25 80 megahertz core and
offset of 1500
100 megahertz memory we found that the
card was difficult to keep stable at
minus 130 degrees Celsius and below like
below as in below minus 130 not towards
zero but that targeting instead minus
120 to minus 124 degrees did the best
for our card we all see as minus 1 15
earlier and were able to get pretty high
with that but needed the extra 10
degrees to push further note also that
this results was after streaming for
about 4 hours so you'd do much better if
you didn't chicken clock it like we did
for entertainment purposes and pushed it
hard out of the gate either way we ended
up at about 1.4 NV VDD and 1.5 for FB
VDD with pecs at one point one one three
and we ended up increasing our scores
from a baseline by 23% with the
overclock to 25 80 megahertz so they're
still scaling here at least sometimes by
extreme this test is among the most
important for the kingpin 20/80 ti as it
establishes what the cards resting
frequency is when under a heavy workload
for most 20 80 TI cards we see variable
frequency with a range of about plus or
minus 100 megahertz from baseline as a
result of either inadequate cooling or a
heavily power limited be BIOS well plot
the 2080 TI f e frequency first to
establish the trend the fe card falls
from a peak frequency of about 19 20
megahertz at the start ending closer to
17 70 megahertz went under load the
reason behind this is twofold
although the GPU isn't hitting it's hard
throttle at 87 degrees Celsius it is
encountering boost tears all the way up
to its resting temperature roughly every
5 degrees Celsius plus or minus a bit
will result in a higher boost frequency
and so the same card running at 50
degrees would operate at a higher
frequency despite potential power
limitations the second part of the
equation is the power limit where Nvidia
Zephie card is becoming bound by how
much power it is allowed to pull by the
v bios limitation that nvidia set
plotting the kingpin card and now we see
a perfectly flat line which is what you
want to see the card starts at about 20
80 megahertz but as it heats up to its
resting temperature it settles at 20 40
megahertz baseline 20 40 megahertz
versus the 17 70 megahertz of the FE
card is a considerable improvement and
is responsible for many of the gains
you'll see in today's charts we saw an
improvement by sticking our F
ecard underwater not shown here but then
it became power limited while using as
much thermal boosting Headroom as it
could
plotting temperatures next the KP card
heats up to about 50 degrees Celsius and
stays there whereas the FE card runs
closer to 75 degrees before eventually
dropping clocks to rest at 73 degrees
Celsius this next chart looks at the
kingpin fan response versus temperature
curve having a low temperature in itself
isn't really all that impressive as any
3000 rpm set of fans can achieve that
but doing so with reasonable rpms is the
hard part with a 240 millimeter CLC that
gets much easier the GP temperature is
plotted on the Left axis where we see
the card sitting in the range of 50
degrees Celsius the GPU fan spins up
from about 600 rpm resting speed to
1,100 rpm went under load for this
version of the V bios and the regular
fee bios on the card the fans can spin
over 2,000 rpm at max speed so for auto
settings to maintain 50 degrees Celsius
at 1,100 rpm is pretty damn good
the vrm fan stays at around 1,000 rpm
and hardly moves with regard to its
speed as the V R M is over built already
to the point of not really needing much
cooling under these conditions as for
why it cools so well a lot of it has to
do with the GPU cold blade on the CL c
we previously talked about this in an
old EVGA hybrid cooler teardown we did
but to recap EVGA is using an ASA tech
CLC for the new 20 atti kingpin card
with a modified cold plate the cold
plate has a protrusion on the bottom to
contact the GPU using a flatter surface
than can be found in CPU CLC's for a CPU
cooler which is what almost all of the
CLC's are built for the cold plate is
very slightly curved by ASA Tech's
supplier to match the curvature of the
IHS of a CPU for GPU is because the die
is directly exposed without an IHS it's
better to make the die to a flat surface
which would be the protrusion in the
cold plate that helps contact to the GPU
and improves thermals as a result for
power consumption testing we're looking
at total system power at the wall as
logs through an ashes of the singularity
fork a highly intensive workload
although this is total system power
we've controlled all of the exposed
voltages in the system and use an
identical bench each time which allows
us to look at the Delta systems a system
to get relative accuracy of GPU power
the 2880 I can pin system left to its
stock configuration and regular V bios
ends up pulling about 455 to 470 Watts
from the wall during these test drugs
the V bios has a power limit of about
360 watch when stock and even that still
limits the KP card more than the vrm
ever will
XO c bios is needed to really push it
hard because the ln 2 and the OC bios
both have a three sixty watt limit
during our live stream when nearing the
25 80 megahertz peak with 1.3 to 1.4 NV
v DD core voltage with memory at 1600
megahertz offset we measured a peak
power consumption of just the video card
not the system at 670 it's a 700 Watts
we'll look at this more when we do our
next content piece on the KP card but
obviously that's a lot of power draw
that's more than we're seeing here for
the entire system when it's left to
stock conditions component temperatures
are also stay within reason
unsurprisingly when operating stock or
with a non XOC overclock we observed
stock thermal performance under a
torture workload at about 50 to 60
degrees for the memory depending on
which module was measured and 37 to 55
degrees for the power components in our
original IC x coverage of the SC 2 and f
TW 3 1080i cards we validated that evey
J's NTC thermistors are accurate and
read similar values as our own
externally installed probes considering
the power components could take up to
and over 125 degrees Celsius these
readings are all about as good as they
can get under a stock cooler like this
one an f1 2018 the king pin 20 a DTI
stock card runs at 113 FPS average which
actually puts it ahead of the stock
Titan RT X and roughly tied with our
water-cooled 2080 TI fe overclocked at
113 FPS average the 28 e TI KP leads the
XE ultra on for 30 point 3 9 by an
impressive 7.3 percent and that's with
both stock with the KP card overclocked
under just the OC bios the card managed
to lead the charts at 122 FPS average
that puts it ahead of an overclocked
Titan r-tx by 2.7 percent and ahead of
the XE ultra overclocked 118 FPS average
by three point three percent
considering we're still talking about a
20 80 TI here not some new GPU that's
good scaling and shows the benefit
of a higher end card although the value
is obviously a tremendously different
story and one that we'll talk about more
in the conclusion Sniper Elite for at 4k
and high settings is next using
asynchronous compute in DirectX 12 and
this workload the stock kingpin 20 atti
again outperforms the Titan RDX once
again by about seven point four percent
so far we're seeing consistent spacing
here the twenty atti kingpin stock cards
120 FPS average also outperforms the
stock 20 atti XC ultra by 10.5%
overclocked in the XC ultra puts it up
to 126 FPS average although it wasn't
able to sustain as high of an overclock
in Sniper 4 as in the other games
the kingpin overclocked pushes it to 131
FPS average but it's 0.1% lows have
fallen as a result of an unstable memory
overclock we could further fine-tune
this although in this instance Sniper
Elite 4 is more abusive than other games
and we would lose about 1 FPS to 2 FPS
average off the top as a result still
overall it's pushing further than other
cards we've tested here let's look at
the frame times to illustrate the
instability in our memory overclock just
to be clear this is on us not on the
card itself as we pushed it to an
unstable level with this V bios and this
power target available but it's
important to show the reason this is
important is because it illustrates why
frame time testing is necessary see how
the gaming experience is to the user if
we had only looked at averages the
experience would look much better with
131 FPS average number and the frame
time dips that caused stutter would be
obscured or hidden as they were plotting
the kingpin stock card we see overall
highly consistent frames of frame
intervals with frame times averaging in
the eight point five to nine millisecond
range this is among the best stock
performance we've tested for a single
GPU and the high consistency shows that
the card isn't pushed to unreasonable
limits out of the box plotting the
overclocked task for the K P card we
begin encountering excursions from the
mean frame time upwards of 8 to 10
milliseconds which becomes visible to
the player as small stutters or hitches
these happen almost in predictable
intervals and it appears to be because
the memory clock was unstable in Sniper
for these spikes are what create the
worst 0.1% value at despite the average
FPS finally applauding the 28 et ixc
Ultra OSI we got an example of a more
stable overclock that still encounters
occasional hiccups for this one we also
had to drop the memory OSI as it was
able to hold higher in other games there
are no major spikes on this one but it's
the result of spending more time
fine-tuning for gameplay the KP card
ends up with better averages but worse
0.1% low and this could be made equal or
better than the XE ultra by spending
more time fine-tuning the clocks that
said our focus for that was more on XOC
with this card so we didn't spend too
much time stock tuning shadow of the
Tomb Raider at 4k places the kingpin xx
atti stock card as outperforming the
Titan RT X by about three point two
percent considering the Titan RT x cost
$2,500
that's not bad although we must fairly
state that the Titan RT X is really
intended for other workloads with its
memory capacity regardless a 28 ETI
outperforming to Titan RT acts under
stock conditions is a good starting
point
the 28 ET IX z ultra operates at 71 FPS
average with the 28 e TI fe stock card
at 68 FPS average once we overclock the
K P card to its maximum at stable offset
with the stock OC v bios the card ends
up at 82 FPS average surpassing the
Titan RT x overclocked 78 FPS average by
4.2 percent and out matching the 28 ET
IX e old Trent and EFI overclocked
results by 3.3 percent and so on the XO
cv BIOS and over volting it would give
you a bit more room but you have to be
careful of cooling requirements our 0.1%
lows dip here as a result of an
imperfect overclock the memory is
bordering on stable and throwing
occasional errors which results in the
dip further fine-tuning can eliminate
this issue once again although the
average frame rate is about as good as
it'll get without the XO cv bios so we
tested other games than those but you
get the idea you can stop there
culprits an improvement on average over
the 28 ET i overclocked cards it's
actually better on average than a titan
r-tx full stock some games this might
not be true it depends how much they
care about the additional cores versus
the additional frequency and frequency
does play a big role so as you can see
with things like 1660 verse 16 60 TI
overclocked enriched 2070 or 2060
overclocking where you start bumpy
making 2060 towards 2070 with just
higher frequency it matters a lot so is
it worth it well
frankly and honestly for a lot of people
the answer is no and EVGA is also pretty
comfortable with with stating this
because this is not a card that I mean
probably a lot of people do this but
it's really not the sort of thing you're
supposed to just buy put in the system
and never work with again it's there's
there's too much effort that goes into
the PCB vrm quality is too good the
overclocking guides are extremely good
the ones written by ten from ex devs
from EVGA really but it's too good that
stuff to not take advantage of it so if
you are planning to plug the card in and
then maybe you think you'll just slide
the power target to 144 and never do
anything else we Don assay skip this
card save the money and buy something
else but if you have an interest even a
beginner interest in overclocking it's
something you should consider this is
something that you would want to
purchase for actually you know working
with getting hands on with and the
classified tool is good to tune the
voltages if you've never done that
before read the ex devs guide and be
careful because you can start killing
things there's a reason the XO CV BIOS
is password protected with a password
that is I promise not to RMA my card but
yeah this this is clearly not something
for the dailies as Vince likes to call
them although you could certainly buy it
for that point you would be overspending
and it's honestly not worth it if that's
who you are
but overclocking this as an enthusiast
who's worked with a lot of these video
cards it was genuinely more fun than the
average 20 80 TI and that's because with
the average 20 80 TI or any other 20
series card it gets once you've done
like 20 of them which is probably about
what we're up to
you start to realize they're all about
the same they all stop at the same place
it's about 20 50 maybe 20 115 megahertz
if you're kind of on the higher end and
it's the same steps to do it takes 15
minutes once you're experienced with it
and then that's it that's that's what
the card can do you're done unless you
can get a custom v bios and the KP card
gives you more room so with the liquid
cooler with
the XOC bios we pushed up towards about
2200 megahertz oh then we start becoming
power limited you can increase the
voltage at that point but then you'll
probably hit OCP but you can use the
classified tool and turn that off you
should run a level 0 LLC if you want to
run on the high end but you can
obviously decrease that a bit if you
want lower LLC for you know it was
concerned about stability but you can
turn off OCP you're still gonna hit a
power limit so then the next step is
install the XO CB bios read the guide be
careful not to go too crazy on the
temperature of the voltage because you
can damage things easily and it would be
your fault at that point but you can
install the XO cv bios and not even
under xoc conditions you can still push
it further so this is something that
gives you some room to play without
allen - it's it's it gets it's a really
high-end beginner approach if you wanted
to do that but once you feel confident
and comfortable with overclocking the
card you can start pushing exotic
cooling dry ice reality or something
like that anyway the card is a lot of
fun to work with for overclocking it's
more exciting or interesting than the
other xx ATT eyes with the CLC on it and
that's because you genuinely can get
more out of it and it also allows you
some more dials to play with which as an
enthusiast is exciting because we're
used to Nvidia stuff being completely
locked down a lot of that's on NVIDIA
EVGA with these cards and some of the
other competitors with similar cards
like galaxy Hall of Fame they can start
working around some of those limitations
in a way that you really can't with a
mainstream card so that's that's the the
right audience for this it's someone who
is gets a lot of fun and entertainment
out of playing around with these things
and you maybe feel like Torian has been
a bit of a letdown thus far this breaks
those rules because it doesn't it
doesn't have to follow them so that's
your ticket out but it's an expensive
ticket we would say the price is fair
for the hardware you get and it's fair
for the performance you can get if
you're into competitive benchmarking
overclocking or if you're into
enthusiasts just kind of tweaking around
with the hardware obviously fair and
worth it will depend
on you and what you're doing the price
is fair insofar as the hardware it's
worth it if you're doing all the things
I just described and it's not worth it
if you're just gonna plug a card in and
then put a solid panel on the case and
never look at it again so that's our
Kayden pin twenty atti review this is a
really difficult thing to review because
it's really complex if you want to learn
more watch our PCB and vrm analysis by
builds why he goes into incredible depth
on the card we also have a tear down on
the channel separately that will give
you over an hour of content on this and
then if you really want some more after
that
we've got an ex OC overclocking recap
from our livestream that talks about the
steps we went through to get to about
2600 megahertz and if you want still
more than that we've got a four Herald
livestream archive so have fun but that
that should give you a pretty start to
finish look at the card and we're happy
that this was the first product we've
done a review on that had XOC data in it
so cane pin thanks for setting it over
and Joe thanks for not destroying it
because I know you really really wanted
to so that's it for this one links below
