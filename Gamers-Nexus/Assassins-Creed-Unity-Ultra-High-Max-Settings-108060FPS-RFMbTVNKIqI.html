Nexus net and I just wanted to quickly
show you our benchmark scores for
Assassin's Creed unity you can find the
full GPU benchmark in the channel click
on the channel name below and you will
find our full Assassin's Creed review
and GPU benchmark if either of those
interests you what you are looking at
right now is our benchmark course this
is the course that I took when testing
all the GPUs so I ran the circuit three
times for parity with each GPU in each
graphics setting took quite a long time
and this is a pretty good representation
of how the game will actually impact
performance as you play it because we're
running through crowds looking at crowds
we look at some smokestacks on some of
the roofs which is good for particle
effects and testing that we've okay lots
of shading lots of light and dynamic
lighting soft body physics things like
that so there's a lot here and it can
all be done with a pretty simple very
easily repeated test which is the most
important part it needs to be easily
replicated so no combat because that's
too dynamic too hard to replicate and we
just kind of run through the city look
around go to one of the eagle spots and
then jump down off of the roof and
that's about it and we get all kinds of
effects and graphics technologies in
there in that process you can do this
test yourself just follow the course
that I have laid out here and then you
can test your GPU let us know what the
frame rate is if you do that this test
was performed using ultra high settings
so this is what the game looks like on
maximum settings including the Nvidia
specific TX AAA which is a different
type of anti-aliasing that uses a
temporal filter temporal meaning time
based so it actually analyzes previous
frames and current samples in the
current frame and then it uses that
information to reduce things like
blurring and choppiness as you move the
camera in real time it's not shown very
well with live screenshots it's shown
much better with movement which is what
you see here so this is the game on
maximum settings including P CSS or
percentage close to soft shadows and
TxAA and everything else on ultra high
and let me know if you test your your
cards post the frame rate results in our
article or below and I will see you all
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
