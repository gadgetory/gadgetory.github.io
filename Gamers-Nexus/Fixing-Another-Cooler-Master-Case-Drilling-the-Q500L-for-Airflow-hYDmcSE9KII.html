lot about it having too much steel and
not enough hole in the front and the
problem here is that for airflow as we
saw in testing even when just blasting
it with air filling more slots with fans
it still wasn't good it was just
objectively never a well cooled case no
matter what we did and so we actually
did some math on this so the whole
radius is about 0.25 centimeters we
calculated the area from that counter
the number of holes and what we came out
with is the front is about eighty four
point seven percent or so eighty four
point six nine percent steel and then
the remainder is air flow and that's why
a lot of this did poorly in testing
especially when you start doing things
like adding filters on top of it so now
you have mesh covering the only holes
there are in the case so what we're
gonna do is drill a bunch of holes and
try to fix it before that this video is
brought to you by coarser and it's void
Pro headset the void Pro headset is
available in wired or Wireless versions
with the wireless option supporting a
boosted range upwards of thirty to forty
feet the headset has full RGB LEDs on
the ear cops has fifty millimeter
headphone drivers and lasts up to
sixteen hours on battery
it can also be plugged in for Wired at
use and is now lower in price than when
it first launched a noise cancelling
microphone is also included along with
an easy mute indicated by an LED and you
can learn more at the link in the
description below there's a hidden
benefit with the way Coolermaster did
these holes so each one of them can be
used as a mounting point you can see the
outline here for the power supply
contributing to the ugliness of the
front of the case is meant to be covered
up by that mesh filter but you can also
insert the four screws for the power
supply mount up here you can move it
down here and insert them there you can
put fans in whichever one slot you might
have open and having the holes all over
the place
means that there is some granularity and
adjusting what ends up where or how you
mount radiators things like that but
we're gonna get rid of all of that
advantage today and drill each one of
these to be wider originally the idea
was to take a dremel or something
just cut a giant gaping hole in the
front of the case and stick this over
top of it
and you would probably have something
that cools pretty well but because
that's clearly not a feasible solution
for coolermaster we're gonna try
something just widening the holes this
will make it structurally weak but we
care more about airflow so the end of
this video we'll talk about the thermal
result for this experiment and a quick
shout-out to Zeta on the GN discord for
recommending these step bits so that we
can do this a bit more easily so
currently we are at about seven thirty
seconds of I guess an inch and we'll
probably move up to maybe like a quarter
inch for the hole or maybe even a bit
higher I haven't used one of these bits
before so we're gonna learn how it works
today
wow that's quick so this worked really
fast that was the one fourth marker we
could make it wider I don't know how
much bigger is that so so I guess the
question is if we drill the neighboring
ones do they start colliding with each
other yeah that's looking pretty good
so these holes are five point two seven
millimeters apart and these are four
point four millimeters apart I think we
could do a little bit better than that
okay so that's a 15% reduction and the
amount of steel between two holes and
because we're dealing with area on a
panel that'll add up really fast so I
guess we need to do this for all them we
could probably go a little bigger I'm
gonna try one kick bigger on this
actually where is the bracket I don't
get it okay cool there's gonna be a lot
of metal in there that we'll have to
clean out later that is now a 5/16
that's definitely about the biggest
we're gonna be able to go see if it's
too big
oh that's 5/16 that's a pretty cool
drill bit I'll link this in the
description below if you want to pick up
the same kit that I'm using now we are
2.8 1 millimeters apart it's right about
47% reduction in the amount of steel
between two holes now some of these
that's gonna be too close and I think
they'll bridge but we'll we'll do our
best
ok cool so the biggest problem we're
gonna face is cleaning all of this out
so that we don't get a bunch of metal
shards all over the components and short
things but we'll just we'll just use an
air compressor or something blow it all
out when we're done but I guess now the
process will be fairly straightforward
drill a bunch of holes in the front of
the case drain the metal onto the mod
mat which you can pick up on store dock
here is excess net and then clean it out
make sure we don't get anything on
components and test it so I'm gonna
drill a whole bunch more of these like
five hundred of them because I think
that's how many holes they are our mod
came out well ugly but the whole point
is that we're focusing on proving a
concept we're making a point not making
something pretty although we originally
were going to take a dremel to the front
we decided to use a step bit instead to
widen all the holes to ten point three
two millimeters from five point six
millimeters resulting in about an eighty
four percent increase in the hole
coverage which is more than we had
planned in the initial part of this
video that you just saw the panel is not
detachable and loses structural
integrity as pieces are removed but
again the goal was to determine if
bigger holes would be sufficient for
improving thermals going back on our
original plans make one giant gaping
hole since we already knew how that end
results would look this gives us
something unique to look at so that we
can see if Coolermaster had just simply
widened everything if it would have
worked out better for them to improve
this further we'd also want to drill
larger holes in the
top before the cpu fan as this is where
the CPU drafts a lot of its air when
left in the stock negative pressure set
up with the power supply blocking some
of the front intake the same can be said
for the holes in the bottom near the
video card although at this point you'd
basically have a steel frame left with
the cheese grater on top of it finally
note that the power supply placements
can be switched between the front top
and the front bottom and that this will
inhibit all air flow thus nullifying
that mod and that particular reason if
we move it to the top then the mod
doesn't really do anything in the top
where the CPU air path is and so forth
and before getting to the results just
one final note that we did a lot of test
configurations for our original
benchmark and review of this case and so
if you're not familiar with that content
you should check out their review so you
understand what each test is looking at
here's the CPU torture workload result
list growing ever longer for just one
case now definitely losing us some money
because of the time investment but we're
gonna prove a point here the moderate
results with an extra two fans lands us
at fifty two point two degrees Celsius
over ambient for CPU temperature which
is a massive 10 degree reduction from
the original results of sixty two point
five degrees over ambience that's just
from drilling the holes to nearly twice
the size so we didn't need to completely
remove the front panel to see this
change which is impossible anyway
because you can't remove the front panel
in this case that said we did need to
basically destroy it so this is proof of
concept and academic exercise territory
not a mod we would ever recommend you
could do something similar to this maybe
perhaps with more care but doing it like
we did would result in a very flimsy
warped front panel stock results look
like they get us minimal improvement but
it's much more significant of a change
than these numbers let on for this we
moved from seventy four point four
degrees to seventy two point five
degrees over ambient but keep in mind
that our original test had us throttling
hard seventy four point four degrees
over ambient means regularly hitting 100
degrees in actual temperature we were
throttling in each test which makes it
difficult to actually present a straight
thermal number seen as it's no longer
100% controlled this frequency overtime
chart demonstrates the issue the average
CPU frequency in the original task was
just 40 35 M
but the modded version of the case
averaged 43 42 megahertz and this isn't
because it's some weird variable
frequency it's locked
it's supposed to be 4400 megahertz for
this test bench always so we not only
reduced throttling and a significant
performance affecting noticeable way to
the user we also reduced thermals at the
same time to see both of these results
in conjunction is significant as
throttling will inherently lower the
thermals of the first results and then
increasing the frequency will increase
the thermal requirements of the cooling
this is a major improvement from our mod
even though the fans aren't present in
the front of the case for this test back
to the main chart the no filter test saw
an improvement in frequency as well and
finally exited throttle in territory
reduced down to seven point six degrees
over ambience and the getting very very
close to the 44 hundred megahertz target
we should note that comparatively to the
other cases that you can see in our
chart in the original review these are
still abysmal results but at least
they're no longer the worst you've ever
seen as you add fans like the fan added
pointed out the CPU the case gets
competitive but it's basically
impossible to get both the GPU and the
CPU competitive simultaneously and
finally adding a single fan the most
reasonable chains receive you thermals
creates a straight front to back airflow
pattern through the tower cooler when
dropping the power supply into the
bottom front of the case this drop
temperature to fifty point five degrees
over ambient and is another massive
reduction that's one about 13 degrees
from the original 64 point two degree
result that we saw in this configuration
originally Coolermaster might as well
have put a flat steel sheet in front of
the fans for this case and finally we
did observe a lack of improvement from
adding a fan positioned in the bottom of
the case as well but that's because it's
pointed straight at the GPU which
basically compartmentalized at the top
of the case because this video card is
about the largest you can possibly fit
in this case with the power supply used
it moves some of the GPUs hot air up and
into the CPU chamber and you're also
dealing with radiative heat off the
backside as in the original review then
it's best to just go with a different
case we we improved it but not really in
a usable sense it's it's very ugly you
can cover it up with the filter so
that's nice if you actually wanted to
use this case
if you actually want to do a mod you
could obviously do a much better job
than this you should probably maybe sand
it down first use a stepped bit that's
not quite as aggressive make sure you
use a fixed size every time and don't
vary it and then find a way to keep the
front panel flat and not warping so it
could be done but it'd be easier to just
buy a different case this one is like we
said in the review because it's a micro
ATX case that's been adapted for ATX and
so clearly some corners are cut here for
thermals and it's it's really difficult
to overcome all of them all the time we
still have issues with the GP thermals
with this mod because it's
compartmentalized because the video card
unless you get a small one barely fits
with the power supply in there as well
and you can start drilling holes into
the bottom of the case you can stand the
case on its side like we did in some of
our tests originally like that and then
you start to get some good performance
or at least well acceptable performance
but it just becomes a question of how
much are you willing to do to make it
work and for a case like this if you're
starting to buy smaller components just
to make it thermally acceptable then
what are you doing you might as well
just build the smaller system all
together at that point in buy a
different case so anyway that's it for
the mod it was a fun exercise in
improving things and of course there are
more elegant ways to do it but the
concept has been proven so if you end up
buying one of these and would like to go
a similar route go for it just do a
better job visually than we did although
we're pretty happy with the thermal
results here so that's it for this one
