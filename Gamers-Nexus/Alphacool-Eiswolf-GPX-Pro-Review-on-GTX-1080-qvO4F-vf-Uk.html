landed in our shop after one of our
viewers generously offered to loan us
the unit straight from the German
manufacturer alpha cool the ice wolf GP
X 1080 deploys a quick-release solution
for integration into a semi custom
liquid cooling loop and differentiates
itself from pre-built
hybrid products like the EVGA hybrid by
providing full coverage of the PCB not a
full coverage water block but full
coverage aia saw uses aluminum fins and
a base plate that contacts the vram and
the vrm directly using a built-in pump
to circulate liquid through whatever
radiator is attached before getting to
our review of the ice wolf this content
is brought to you by AMD freesync
devices like the affordable LG 29 um 67p
2560 by 1080 ultra wide which is
currently $300 check the link below for
more information on that and this is the
$130 ice wolf liquid cooler from alpha
cool the unit here is one we're looking
at the rest of this is part of their Ice
Bear line and you'll need something like
this to hook into because these quick
releases are that basically screws that
tension in you need a radiator on there
obviously to use it so it's this isn't
something you can buy for 130 bucks and
use out a box you do have to buy another
part but that's what we're looking at
today we've mounted it to our test
subject the 1080 founders edition which
is undergone quite a bit of abuse in the
last six months of its life but it's
back and it's going through some more
tear downs and build ups with the Alpha
coil unit so we're mounting the block to
the GPU which contains a pump pre filled
with liquid and large heatsink for the
full PCB and back side of the PCB out of
the pump block protrudes two tubes and
in and an out valve and those tubes
terminate with locking valves these can
be connected to compatible products
again like the ice bear which is 280
millimeter cooler that we bought for
around hundred and forty five dollars
and that also cools the CPU by the way
EK WB's quick release valves will not
work with the ice wolf and the same is
true for a couple other competitors but
we do have the e KW v x LC predator and
will be soon pitting it against the ice
wolf check back this week for that
review alva cools tubes use an 11
millimeter outer
outer and our rubberized encased in
coils to help prevent bends that would
kink flow and G quarter inch threads
allow for relatively universal fitment
to other liquid cooling products you
could even avoid using the locking and
quick releases if desired though the
value kind of plummets at that point
since you may as well go for an open
loop setup the base plate provides full
coverage of the PCB but again it is not
a full coverage water block the liquid
lives only in the pump and this means
that future GPU upgrades won't require
repurchasing the pump part of the
solution you'd only have to pay for a
new aluminum plate and cooling block and
back plate and things like that and then
reattach the pump to the new card so in
theory it's a bit cheaper that way but
that's assuming that the mounting holes
are the same spacing for future video
cards the entire unit is comprised of a
base plate a back plate and integrated
pump which is this part right here that
has the tubes coming out of it and then
thermal pads that you have to cut the
size a bit annoyingly we'll talk about
that more later and all this means that
you can actually run this isolated from
a CPU cooler if you wanted to which
again the ice bear is a CPU cooler
that's got its own disconnect valve up
here you can unscrew it and connect it
to whatever you want or you can connect
it into a loop if you run it alone it
makes for kind of weird value because
the block is basically just feeding
straight into a radiator and the whole
cool part of this the entire reason
you'd buy something like this is because
it hooks into a CPU cooler and makes for
a poor man's open-loop cooling solution
or lazy man's effing loop cooling
solution basically you don't have to
deal with the whole separate reservoir
separate pump all the stuff that you do
with open-loop cooling but again it's
not quite as effective as an open-loop
setup so we'll look at all the thermal
performance today the main things to
look at we've already talked about
installation in the previous video but
we'll be talking about that again today
because the previous video is a blind
installation so now I've got some
thoughts on it compiled based on our
experiences with that installing the
IU's 12 isn't particularly challenging
but it can be pretty annoying at times
the Theroux had for instance need to be
cut to size by the user and about half
the pads are pre-cut like the vram but
the rest is up to you to do a
thoughtfully supplied template by alpha
cool does make this easier to their
credit but it just seems like a silly
place for the cooling
company to save money when they spent so
much on the massive aluminum heatsink
regardless not the biggest deal in the
world the quick-release system however
is a little more obnoxious its finicky
the threads will sort of lock but if you
apply extra pressure for reinsurance
because obviously you don't want leakage
they'll slip and need to be retighten
this is part of the spring tensioning
system that they have it is a weak point
in the spring tensioning system and this
is a casualty of weak plastics in the
valve among other things
Alvah cool could improve this by adding
some feedback to the user for fully
secured and sealed connections similar
to ek water blocks which have a clear
pop upon mocking note though that you
should also expect a few drops of liquid
to leak out during connection this is
normal
we'd recommend putting down paper towels
as safety and then running a leak test
prior to fall operation speaking of
leaks during the connection to our I
spare 280 unit also from alpha coal that
we purchased we had an issue where the
cheap plastic locking mechanism and it's
spring popped out of the valve resultant
of the aforementioned slipping threads
when you tighten them just to be sure
fortunately we hold the tubes up when
installing these types of things so no
fluid was really lost at least none to
the board where it would matter just be
careful when you're connecting
everything get into the testing our full
testing methodology as always is defined
in the article in the description below
you can click that link for the full
review some extra tests and the
methodology the main things to talk
about here we've connected more than
just the normal software to read the
gpio temperature attached to this video
card are two thermocouple probes these
were used for our EVGA vrm testing and
they basically one goes to the MOSFETs
it goes the third MOSFET up from the
bottom and the other one goes to the
back side of the PCB where there's a bit
of a hot spot starting with a baseline
thermal analysis this simple test runs
fairmark for just 25 minutes and it's
all automated with scripting we've
written in-house so it provides an
understanding of performance prior to
endurance testing for baseline GPU
temperatures we're seeing the alpha cool
GP X Pro idling at 5.4 Celsius delta T
prior to any real testing this compares
to about two salsas delta T on the G on
a hybrid that we built which is just a
founders Edition card with an EVGA CLC
attached to it and that's something
ages ago before the EVGA hybrids were
available if you're wondering how that
makes sense
regarding the lower idle temperature on
the EVGA solution that we built here's
why there are two things that cause the
increased GPU diode temperature on the
ice Wolff cooled GTX 10 a DfE it's the
same video card the same clocks but this
one as you saw with idle runs a couple
degrees warmer the first reason is
because this base plate is sinking for
the vram and the vrm and any other hot
components on the front side of the PCB
and even sinking the backside of the PCB
so it's pulling more heat in to that
central area where the pump is
responsible for obviously sending it out
through the tube system to get
dissipated once it hits the radiator so
that increases the GPU diode temperature
because you're just pulling all this
other heat in from the card to one
central area now also well and because
the liquid is then working harder and
running hotter now also same idea liquid
running hotter because we've got it
attached to this this is the CPU cooler
it's attached to the CPU even though the
CPU is not really doing anything it's
still generating Heat even when it's
idle it generates at least some level of
load and so that warms up the liquid as
well and that's why you get those
differences in results when it's idling
when it's under load it's a bit of a
different story though
as for low temperatures we're looking at
the GPX Pro at about fifteen point five
Celsius on the GN high rate at about
fifteen point three Celsius no real
difference here but we do see that the
alpha cool unit is more efficient at
keeping the GPU temperatures under
control when it's under load because
we're also cooling everything else on
the card let's move on to endurance
testing this first chart shows the GPU
MOSFET number three and PCB backside
temperatures for the devices the probes
remained in the same place for each test
but I'll talk about some potential flaws
here in a moment we're seeing load
temperatures are about the same when
tested over a one-hour firm mark vrm
burnin and the fats are significantly
different in temperature though the
Alpha cooled GP x pro is keeping its
mosfet number three around six celsius
cooler than the GN hybrid solution which
relies entirely on a base plate and vrm
blower fan for vrm cooling and because
the blower fan ties the GPU temperature
the GPU temperature is low because it
liquid cooler it doesn't run that fast
as for the PCB backside temperature is
my primary theory for the increase seen
in the GP x pro PCB backside is that the
massive backplate and thermal pads which
connect the front side just through the
top of the card are helping to better
spread heat across the entire unit this
can cause a thermocouple to look like
it's experiencing a higher temperature
than is perhaps realistic and that's
also because it's indirectly touching
the back plate so it's sort of the
center of the transfer on the backside
of the card
endurance tests with GPU over clocks
manually applied position the GPX pro
and GN hybrid about 0.3 Celsius apart in
GPU temperature with a GPX Pro again
advantaged in MOSFET temperatures the
probe on the PCB is reporting higher
temperatures but that's because we've
got a thermocouple sandwiched between
the thermal pad of the backplate all the
heat is transferring through that area
as explained given that this
thermocouple is positioned on a hot spot
the 42c backplate temperature or back
side of the PCB temperature I should say
isn't that s'what it's attached to is
still way more than acceptable it's
perfectly fine it's not like we're
hitting 130 Celsius on this PCB and just
as a reminder vrm temperatures can go
higher than what you might be used to
seeing with something like a GPU diode
it's not the same we're 100 Celsius is
really really bad on a vrm not such a
big deal a lot of them have a t.j.maxx
of 150 C so a bit of a different
temperature scale therefore what's
acceptable one final test to go over
before sending you to the article for
the rest these are in more of a vacuum
we're looking at only the GPX Pro for
this set of tests this benchmark is with
the CPU being loaded with prime95 LF of
T is maxing out load at 100 percent
while the GPU is being tortured with
fairmark also at 100 percent load and
fir mark is pretty stressful on the V
RMS and power design too this results in
high temperatures in both the CPU and
the GPU across the entire board and
since we're using a shared loop that's
an important thing to look at the
results position the CPU at about 52 C
delta T under load or about 70 to 73
when accounting for our ambient and this
is with the GPU at around 19 Celsius
delta T or roughly 4 Celsius higher than
when the CPU was under minimal load in
the previous test sepia cooling isn't
great to be honest but it is cooling two
hot devices at 100% load which is pretty
uncommon even in gaming especially in
gaming
regardless we'll talk about that more in
our future ice bear review for low rpm
testing if you're curious about the
noise and performance trade-off we've
got that as well
it's in the article in description below
and we've also got the noise testing in
that article as for the impact of
cooling on clock rate stability and
maximum clocks we'll break this down in
two different ways the first is a
straight chart the next is an overtime
line graph in this table we're looking
at the average clock and maximum clock
of both solutions when playing GTA 5 and
dirt rally alpha cool manages to sustain
a higher average clock even with the
stock configuration that's had no
overclock applied with GTA 5 we're
seeing a difference of about 14
megahertz between the GN hybrid an alpha
cool 1080 Fe at stock clocks the Alpha
cool variant at 1866 megahertz to the GN
hybrid variant at 1852 megahertz the
maximum clock is about the same for this
setup dirt rally also posts an identical
maximum at clock rate between the non
overclocked cards which makes sense but
we're seeing a boosted average clock
rate with the alpha cool GP x pro and
that gain is about 45 to 50 megahertz
though recurrent results are similar
though we're seeing the higher maximum
clocks on the Alpha cool card the result
is a 15 megahertz higher average clock
rate with dirt rally with a GP x pro at
20 86 megahertz to the GN hybrid 20 70
megahertz it's actually somewhat
substantial since we're already pushing
the limits of what Pascal can do GTA 5
gives us a 26 mega Hertz increase in
maximum clock rate with sustained
averages about 40 to 45 mega Hertz
higher than the GN hybrid card just for
another way to visualize that data
here's that line graph with an over time
plot of frequency on the charts between
the hybrid DIY solution we built and the
Alpha cool DIY solution we built the
question is whether or not this makes
any real difference in gaming in the
real world so our temperatures are
pretty good and actually we've got a
slightly higher clock rate with the Alva
cool solution over the other solution
the GN hybrid built with an EVGA cooler
and a vrm blower fan but does it matter
that's where FPS testing comes in for
dirt rally at 4k Ultra we're seeing
stock clocked GT X 1080 hybrid
performance at around 90 1.7 FPS average
82 ish on 1% low and 76
ish on the point one percent lows
looking next to the alpha cool version
also at stock clocks before overclocking
is effectively identical there's no
noteworthy change when looking at
overclocks it's clear that the Alpha
cool card has a very slight lead about
three to four FPS average and that's a
result of a slightly higher overclock
capable because of the solution even
though these differences are significant
insofar as the larger gaps in 1% 0.1%
lows with these two cards the
performance is basically the same it's
not detectable to the user at least any
reasonable user who actually is living
in reality FPS is high enough on each
device that performance looks about the
same
still this shows that there's at least
some benefit from the increased clock
rate stability of the alpha cool card is
just irrelevant
moving on to GTA 5 at 1440p with very
high settings and ultra settings we're
seeing pretty minimal performance scale
in between the devices they're
effectively identical performance on the
card with stock clocks as equal and
there's no significant difference
between the GN hybrid and the alpha cool
overclocked GTX 1080s
there is no perceptible performance
difference between them at all
so is this worth it well the end result
is pretty similar when we look at FPS to
other liquid cooling solutions versus a
stock 1080 like the EFI card stock with
its original cooler you can see about a
5% FPS increase just from that higher
sustained clock because thermals are no
longer concerned because the EFI cooler
will run into thermal limitations at
some point it can handle more heat but
GPU boost basically tells the the GTX
1080 is saying I really want to stay at
or below 81 Celsius so we're going to
modify the clocks make sure that happens
these eliminate that problem so you do
gain about 5% FPS there we've talked
about that in the past in previous
reviews of the 1080 and of our build of
the 1080 hybrid originally but does it
matter when you move from one a
liquid-cooled solution to another well
not so much the FPS difference is
basically none it's almost no FPS
difference a couple frames sometimes but
even when the lows are higher on this
thing it's still not a big deal so the
question then becomes one of value
particularly why buying one of these
would make sense there are three
possible answers to that first it's a
fun project and being an enthusiast is
part way about building things that
aren't necessarily needed but
cool to do in that regard the Alpha cool
ice wolf is a fun teardown and build up
project for a Saturday and the
psychological or uniqueness benefit of
that may be great enough to justify the
purchase it's just kind of fun to do the
second answer is that because we're
getting a semi custom loop out of this
we're also getting the benefit of a
multi pump system that has some
redundancy in the case of failure so
we're consolidating to a single radiator
in the loop this increases the cooling
efficiency sort of per square area used
in the case but it also provides a peace
of mind in the event of one failing pump
that you'd obviously want to replace it
pretty immediately the final possible
answer is related to noise the noise
argument here is that you could run
lower fan RPMs through something like a
280 millimeter radiator if connected to
the CPU block and completely eliminate
the GPU fan merge the CPU and GPU
cooling into one or two fans as it were
and then you end up with lower rpms
across those fans because it's all
liquid so it performs pretty efficiently
as is this makes for lower system noise
levels overall while retaining cooling
that is still better than an air-cooled
card and that's really the big one and
the one we've talked about before in
terms of advantages if none of those
three things are interesting to you it's
probably not worth the purchase the
quality of materials is high enough the
modularity is interesting the efficiency
is good but if you don't care about
those three factors the fun project
factor the noise factor or you think you
get better noise from an alternative
solution and you just don't care about
the other benefits of this then don't
buy it
it doesn't make sense for those use
cases the next thing these quick release
valves are awful they're probably the
worst ones I've seen these from ek far
and away better and we'll be talking
about these shortly these are simple
button press pull it out and when you
reconnect it there's a really definitive
click so you know it's connected with
these when you're screwing them back
together the threads if you go just one
tick too far will loosen and you'll have
to retighten it there's also the risk
where we had the whole kind of casing
explode and I had to reassemble it while
holding the tube up in the air so one
week so thanks again to Eric for loaning
us this unit to work on we'll be sending
it back to him with some extras maybe a
shirt or something so if you have
something that you think we don't have
access to like one of these
let us know might look at it and work
something out but otherwise as always
pay traveling at the post roll video how
is that directly subscribe for more
we've got some interesting content
coming up this week including a look at
our new solution for robocopy and our
files on the GN servers and moving them
to our Nass and then from the dash to
the web it's really cool setup I'm
excited to talk about it so subscribe
