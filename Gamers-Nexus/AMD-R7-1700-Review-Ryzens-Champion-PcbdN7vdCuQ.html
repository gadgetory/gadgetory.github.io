one-third of the Internet we're back
today to review the AMD it rise in r7
1,700 CPU we delayed it by a few days so
that we could really take in the
positivity of some comments stemming
from our first 1800 X review now that
we're back in this 1700 review were
primarily looking at the price to
performance of the 330 ish dollar and
the r7 1700 and comparing that in
positioning with the company's marketing
materials and with the competition of
course which would be the 7700 K at a
similar price though we have plenty of
other CDs in the stack before getting to
that this coverage is brought to you by
Thermaltake makers of the new compact
silent 12 cooler that's priced at $25
and includes a m-- for mounting supports
the contact silent 12 offers budget
performance with low at noise and a low
price link in the description below if
you want to learn more about this cooler
their eyes on r7 1700 cpu is an 8 cores
16 thread unit with the same CCX layout
as the 1800 X and 1700 X it's really the
same in most regards the cache the
architecture of course is the same so
you're mostly looking at the same thing
other than the frequency and the TDP TDP
is lower by about 30 watts looking at 65
versus 95 on the to higher skewed chip
and then the price $330 versus about 400
for the 1700 X and about 500 for the
1800 X for the unfamiliar you can read
or watch our original reviews for a
straight-shooter recap of the
architecture the r7 1700 ships with a
stock frequency of 3 gigahertz and
boosts to 3.7 under the right conditions
mostly limited thread scenarios the CPU
we received it did not include the race
cooler though we just purchased our own
1700 and are awaiting its arrival so
that we can independently test the
cooling solution on the topic of cooling
the 1700 requires a much less powerful
solution than the 1800 X largely thanks
lower voltage and frequency on the 1700
TDP again is 65 watch the 1700 to 1800 X
and 700 X both at 95 watts but with
higher native frequencies memory support
is the same on paper just with the
caveat that we had greater memory clock
in limitations on these 1770 1800 X even
with the same platform we were only able
to hit 26 66 megahertz out of box even
using these
and kit and motherboard as in the 1800
extra view this indicates that there's
some sort of memory controller
limitation on the r7 1700 with our model
though we've spoken with other reviewers
and board partners and found out that it
seems to just vary depending on which
CPU you have and by that I mean
individual CPU to not skew an hour later
overclocking tests we were able to jump
back up to 29 33 megahertz without issue
further validating that this is likely a
stability and bandwidth issue at the
lower CPU frequencies we're still
testing on the ACS crosshair motherboard
still with the latest stable EFI release
and that's version of five seven zero
four at time of shooting we've begun
testing on gigabyte boards as well and
have largely seen no difference in
performance that will publish those
numbers in a separate content piece so
that we can have some comparisons
between boards and platforms again so
far between the two not looking like a
huge difference if you're looking to
learn more about the 1800 X and our
thoughts on it links in the description
below and we also have a link to this
review the written version in the
description below that will include the
testing methodology for this if you're
curious about what components were used
for each of these CPS on the bench its
detailed there we also have some thermal
test notes their power blender Premiere
gaming all that stuff is detailed in the
article starting first with temperature
over time we see temperatures
drastically reduced versus the r7 1800 x
with both CPUs using our kraken x 62 at
max fan and pump RPM the r7 1700
sustains a completely flat clock rate
under load other than one hitch and the
1800 x by comparison had some
fluctuation although small during the
torture testing this is largely due to
heat and seen as b-17 100 it constantly
sits below 50 C with this cooler
generally closer to 45 it's easy to see
why clock fluctuations aren't happening
on the r7 1700 skew CPU far easier to
keep this thing thermally controlled and
again you can learn more about those
thermal tests in the article looking now
at total system power draw and voltage
stats we observed the r7 1700 operating
at 133 Watts peak draw for the complete
system when under stock settings and
with a blender workload that's compared
to 185 watts
total system power draw of the r7 18
that that said note again that our 1800
exit did run 29 33 megahertz memory at
all times during testing whereas the
current 1700 CP that we have was limited
to 20 666 unless overclock the 1700 push
is a core averaged core clock around
3200 mega Hertz when left to auto in
blender with a V core of 1.0 six eight
volts Cinebench single-threaded we see
power draw at 80 watts total system
versus the compare the total system
powers of 92 us on the 1800 X with CPU
speed bouncing between thirty two
hundred and thirty seven fifty megahertz
this is because again boost and XF are
on the AMD CPUs only kick in when
running limited thread workloads it does
not enable for workloads at leveraging
all threads like blender voltage is
around one point two eight six to 1.30
eight V core for this particular test
but pov-ray rounding us out at 37 50
megahertz clock rate for a single
threaded run with voltage stable at one
point two eight six this is lower than
the 1800 X contributing to lower
temperatures overall we run our power
tests in balance mode for a few reasons
but the performance test that would be
production blender premier and gaming
are run in performance mode as explained
in our first article there is a
limitation of performance because of
some core parking issues when running
and balanced and so we run performance
for the gaming and workload tests and
for power draw volt it seems like that
we just decided to do balance because
really running performance in those
looks a bit extreme in some cases so
we're kind of hoping that you can pick
through the numbers and figure out how
you're going to use the CPU generally we
would hope that you could use balance
mode for the most part because does
consume a lot less power let's your
clock rate drop lower when idle but
there needs to be some more updates
before that's the best option just
because it does limit gaming by about 4%
an hour testing moving on to production
our blender benchmark uses an in-house
render scene that renders at 400 samples
per pixel with a 4k resolution and 16 by
16 tile sizes for CPU benchmarking
this scene is used across all CTS we
test and represents a real-world use
case for a release candidate seen as
created by GM's animator as shown here
the r7 1700 stock SMT enabled completes
the scene in about 33 minutes this is
between the 77
100 K overclocked and the r7 1800 X or
69 hundred KS stock CPUs that's about
where we'd expect these 1702 Falls given
the 1800 X's performance but what's
interesting is the overclocking aspect
assuming you're willing to put in the
five minutes to overclock and run a
little higher temperature the 1700 is
able to complete the scene in the same
time as the overclocked 1800 X as both
at land at around 3.9 to 4.0 gigahertz
in our production test we were able to
sustain a 4.0 gigahertz clock in gaming
for the 1700 but production workloads
that stress stability enough and forced
us to drop to 3.9 which is where the
1800 X overclocked again if you're
willing to overclock and aren't
concerned about IT approval the 1700
beats of the stock 1800 X and
effectively ties the overclocked variant
note that our OC on the 1700 bumps
memories of 29:33 since we can only
support 2666 stable without on EOC this
more or less invalidates the existence
of the 1800 X if you are okay with
overclock in and of strictly considering
its for CPU accelerated Bunder tasks
though a GP will still get you further
faster in most these cases particularly
the blender benchmark we use just like
we said in the 1800 X review and the
deserves praise for its production
positioning versus Intel fame or double
cost alternative also just like we said
in the 1800 X review we'd recommend the
1800 X over the 6900 k4c be targeted or
software accelerated production and
again that's nearly a direct quote from
the last content piece but now we would
recommend the 1700 over the 1800 X it's
an even better value for CPU accelerated
production if you do any but does need
an overclock to kick it into gear
the overclock is trivial and the cooling
requirement isn't all that high
otherwise for the most part blender and
premier are happening on the GPU though
other workloads like compiles should you
work with them would benefit from CPU
acceleration that said most of our
audience is going to be the gaming type
and if they do any production at all
it's probably YouTube content creation
or streaming so we're keeping those
audiences primarily in mind when working
on this content our Adobe premier
benchmark is conducted by rendering our
EVGA icx review representing a
real-world workload filled with color
Corrections warp stabiliser transforms
things like that and this benchmark the
sixty nine hundred K leads one over
box with the 18-hundred accent leading
these 5900 case talk marginally again
both stock now as stated at last time
the marginal lead is made less marginal
when considering that we have cost
positioning that said if we look at the
our 717 one hundred we're performing
ahead of these heavy 700k by about
thirty minutes which is a considerable
gain when looking at the near price
equivalents slightly favoring a and b
this is finally starting to look like
the Rison processor that should have
champion to launch
despite initial shipment and branding of
the 1800 x overclock at least 1700 again
outperforms the 1800 x or equals the
overclocked 1800 x with equal memory
speeds given the $170 price reduction
from the 1800 x we see no reason for our
audience or mixed workload users to buy
the 1800 x the 1700 is far and away a
better deal now again premier is cuda
accelerated so you generally want to do
those workloads on a GPU that said the
price positioning is much stronger
versus adjacent intel competition and
finally starts to build a case for Rison
in our reviews users who do cpu
accelerated workloads should of course
check benchmarks for their relevant
software as we don't test all of it but
could generally postulate that the 1700
would outperform an i7 7700 k stock in
software accelerated tasks again check
reviews for the actual software you use
it doesn't all behave the same way with
regard to multi-threading and frequency
we've got a few other synthetic
workloads in the article like Cinebench
fire strike and pine spy you can check
that link below if you want those let's
move on to games this is where the 1800
X fell short in our last review it
ultimately performed on par with the i5
CPUs some from older generations than
others depending on the game and was
priced about two times what an i5 is so
for pure game performance it's a bad Buy
and we say the same about the 69 hundred
K by the way given me seventeen
hundred's it's significantly lower price
the stack up should be a lot more
interesting now of course it's not going
to outperform the 1800 X when both our
stock but the price is still $170 lower
so the competition should be more
comparable before getting to that this
is a slide from Andy's own marketing
materials for
our X 480 and Polaris launched as the
slide suggests 95% of PC gamers use
1080p or below so for that reason and
for methodological reasons like actually
finding these CP limitations in gaming
we are primarily using 1080p for
benchmarking now we do have a few 1440p
tests just like we had for the 1800 x
but you'll see that that basically makes
all of the CP is the same including the
1700 and the 1800 x so based on this
slide most of the market is still on
1080p or below as stated by AMD as
always for full methodology the links in
the description below we're starting
with battlefield 1 and battlefield 1 the
and the r7 1700 SMT on operates at
around 129 FPS average or 85 1% lows
with 68 fps 0.1% Lois this is sandwiched
between the i5 4690k stock and I 535 70
K stock all three of which have more or
less identical loads at with regard to
user perception now again that's not
great price to performance release 1700
but it is a whole lot easier to justify
as a product than the 1800 X for gaming
if we're looking at pure gaming
workloads we'll get to that more in the
conclusion though overclocking the r7
1700 to 4.0 gigahertz which was stable
with games but not production on our
model and with an increased memory
speeds of 29 33 the CPU is now
outperforming the stock 1800 X or
performing equally to the 1800 X
overclock the 1800 X overclocked 3.9
gigahertz was able to sustain a more
stable clock rate with a 1700 fluctuated
more frequently and so places higher and
it's low values at 109 and 94 verses 89
and 75 on the 1700 the higher sustained
clock rate is primarily a benefit of the
additional power throughput higher
voltage and higher baseline of the 1800
X if you okay it with the higher frame
times on the low-end
higher frame times being a bad thing the
1700 overclock is clearly significantly
better in value because although I our
frames arms are not desirable
it's not a huge difference in this
instant the average at frame rate is
imperceptibly different as well
furthering the argument for the 1700
overclocked over the 1800 X stock or
overclock that makes the 1700 a whole
lot better than the 1800 X in terms of
price to performance for gaming but it's
still on par with Intel i5 CP is
last generation comparing against the
i-5 60 600k the 1700 stock performs
measurably worse across all three
metrics but the perception isn't
different as we said last time
so despite lower values overall you
probably won't detect them as a user one
potential argument here is that the 1700
includes of stock coolers so if you're
ok with using that it has some value
that we haven't tested it yet we're
waiting on our retail model to come in
and in theory the motherboards should
also be cheaper once they aim for market
saturates we wouldn't recommend using
any motherboard for overclocking because
some of these VRMs are not that great
but keep an eye out on our channel and
the website for recommendations on which
boards are ok for that so between the
boards and the stock cooler that brings
the price closer to an i-5 but we're not
quite there we're close but the
significant gain is in production and we
absolutely would not recommend an i5 CPU
for production rendering because the
thread limitations are just too great
the 1702 helps fill that mixed workload
gap where the 1,800 exa fell short for
gamers at its price last time let's move
on to total war hammer
as a reminder total war Warhammer has
some issues with measurement of 0.1% low
values a game is more variable and its
output to begin with but it's also a lot
more sensitive to Glocks ability on CPUs
and given the CPU bottleneck that's why
it's a great TV benchmark it just so
happens that over clocks will really
show their limits here if you're on the
border of instability and the game is
also just generally less reliable in its
low-end frame latency that stated the
results placed the r7 1700 stock at
about the AI 370 to 50k performance
range sandwiched between the i5 2500 k
overclocked to 4.5 or if you prefer
stock the i3 6300 and the i3 is 22 K
again stock its measurably slower than
the 800 X given the lower base and boost
frequencies and generally not that
competitive in terms of price to
performance for a pure gaming build of
course it's also got that production
benefits that's much easier to justify
for streaming and content creators at
its price point and we still don't
recommend the 70 to 50 K at its price
just like we didn't when we reviewed it
but the point stands at least 1700 isn't
all that impressive in terms of raw FPS
throughput the 1700 does have it better
1% low values which are a bit more mad
be consistent in this game then its
neighboring Intel CPUs so that is an
upshot the overclock that variance is a
lot more interesting particularly
because again this is a trivial
overclock for our CPU your mileage may
vary but ours hits 4.0 easily for gaming
workloads the performance is now at 136
average with high sustained one present
values the TD plants itself just under
an overclocked 72 stood K ahead 5.0
gigahertz and out matches the 1800 X
stock CPU so we're around the 70 to 50 K
overclock and an 800 X which is a
reasonable improvement for the increase
the extra 100 megahertz on the clock
also helps overcome the overclocked 1800
X since ours was limited to 3.9
gigahertz this again pushes the 1800 X
further out of recommendations for
gaming builds with the 1700 d SERP II
and any potential it had for most of our
audience we'll go ahead and highlight as
some key off performance before moving
on for does significantly improve
overall throughput with this particular
game we're not focusing in on it as much
as the initial review watch starts to is
heavily multi-threaded but does push
more GPU load then in total war
Warhammer without an overclock the stock
r7 1700 performs ahead of the i5 6600 K
in average frame rate matching the 1800
x stock and it's measurably but
imperceptibly worse frame Layton sees
this performance puts the $330 r7 1700
under the $240 i5 7600 K when both are
stock momentarily ignoring other cost
factors in the builds we don't yet know
how good that stock cooler is
overclocking pushes the 1700 past the
i-5 7600 K and close to the 7700 K with
hyper-threading off hyper threading on
we see a big performance advantage for
Intel's architecture and $340 7700 K
which is now performing at 113 FBS
average to Andes 86 FPS average
overclocked or 80 FPS average without
the overclock regarding the 1800 X were
able to effectively match that CPU and
overclock in the 1700 and we outperform
z stock 1800 X as expected for a few
more games including Metro last light
and GTA 5 there in the article below as
you'd probably guess but we have two
benchmarks from 1440p before moving on
just like we included 1440p benchmarks
in our previous contents will include
them again
keep in mind that pushing it more pixels
inherently creates more load on the GPU
and with these higher settings we're
looking at a GPU bottleneck that makes
all CPUs look more or less equal
including Andy's own a product stack
these charts are limited as we just
added them specifically for the 1800 X
and for actual CD performance
limitations you'll want to look at those
1080p benchmarks as those gives the best
idea for Raw perform from scaling within
gaming as GPS advanced regardless let's
look at a few 1440p numbers following
and these arguments of representing CPUs
at higher resolutions and thus
introducing GPU bottlenecks we see that
the 1800 X is effectively irrelevant as
a gaming option when GP limited since
the 1800 X and 1700 produced results
which are perceptibly equivalent again
this was a MV suggestion so following
the path of imposing external
bottlenecks e 1700 is equal to an 1800 X
in gaming when bumping against the choke
point and with the 7700 K outperformed
both by about 10 FPS average and in low
values the 6900 K as it has been remains
bad value for anyone who only games now
with battlefields one at 1440p we see
again that the stock 1700 and stock 1800
X are equal in performance thanks to the
imposition of that GP limitation with
both slightly tailing the Intel CPUs the
and the r7 1700 is priced in a way that
makes it a lot better at the cost than
the 1800 X in the case of the r7 1700 we
see mixed workload use cases at shine at
the $330 price point where the CPU
definitely outperforms the 7700 K in
premier and blender rendering tasks when
the CPU accelerated if you're pushing
renders the CPU and doing some gaming
it's not a bad buy it just depends on
how much production you do versus how
much gaming or how much you care about
hitting high refresh rates and games in
which case you'd clearly be better off
with the 7700 k if 144 Hertz at 1080p is
what you care about this positioning
further reinforces our stance on the
1800 X you are far better off buying an
r7 1700 for about $330 or if you can
find it without a cooler even better it
might be a bit cheaper and applying a
five-minute overclock with a half-decent
cooler than buying the 1800 X you will
net a better product in turn
of price of performance and really
perform about the same in gaming and in
production as long as you are okay with
overclocking which isn't difficult with
these and sustaining that overclock for
whatever lifespan of the system you are
planning to use just means you need a
halfway-decent cooler and you need a few
minutes looking at guides to make sure
you're applying correct voltages if the
correct voltage manual tuning is
required which you should generally do
because auto often goes a bit overboard
so there's really no reason to buy an
1800 X if you are okay with that
scenario now we normally assume that
most folks aren't overclocking that's
generally my assumption is we see a lot
of people who pick something like a 7700
K because it's the best not necessarily
overclocking it so that may be the case
here as well but with a 1700 it is
actually worth doing it's not hard
it doesn't change really a whole lot
versus Intel if you're used to Intel
overclocking same concept the only point
of hesitation and saying this is the
future bending of these CPUs we're not
sure if the early 1700 models will OC
hire or not or if they're modified 1800
X parts that retain the same Headroom
our sample overclocked to 3.9 or 4.0
depending on a workload and that's what
puts it on par with the 1800 X where
outperforms it depending on how IV 18 or
Dex clock that also allows us to clock
the memory higher which is not great in
the stock settings so another point in
favor of overclocking if yours is
limited and we know some other folks
like Paul from Paul's hardware and bit
wit were able to achieve similar
overclock on their review sample r7 1700
CPUs we're still waiting it for our 1700
to come in the purchased one from Amazon
and that one of course will try to
overclock see if it does the same and
it's still from the first round of
production so obviously keep that in
mind we'll also be able to look at the
stock cooler at that point and see how
good the cooler is if it's actually
worth using or if you should purchase a
standalone one anyway in the past with
the Wraith cooler was genuinely a good
effort by AMD we gave it a great review
so if it's the same thing here it might
be just fine of course the aftermarket
ones do tend to be a bit better in terms
of price performance but if you're
trying to save 30 bucks now they have
not been that in the past we'll see how
this one is because the rise in series
is a
is new so wait for that so again we
strongly advise against the 1,800 x as a
cpu for a gaming machine being gamers
Nexus that is what we focus on if you're
doing zero production you're not doing
any content creation or anything like
that then you're really still better off
in terms of price to performance for
gaming with an i5 or an i7 CPU
particularly at high refresh rates with
1080p that said for people who are
combining content creation like we do
with a gaming or maybe considering
streaming the r7 1700 is actually a
viable chip and far more so than the
1800 X given the price and the
overclocking potential to equalize it to
and then in terms of 1440p performance
the two chips are the same assuming you
have something like a GTX 1080 and
you're bottlenecked it looks the same
now of course they're not actually the
same because we have a GPU bottleneck so
when the higher end cards come out that
may change but that's what it looks like
now and that's also why we favor
attended yuuki benchmarking we still
have to look at these 1700 X but from
early results it looks like the r7 1700
is the hero of AMD's lineup this looks a
whole lot better price to performance
for our audience even other audiences
considering overclock potential if you
can overclock not all use cases allow it
it's far better than the 800 X in that
regard so it's easier to argue this CPU
just know that you're still going to be
limited in terms of total frame rate
throughput in games versus compared Lee
price Intel CPUs so if you're okay with
that trade-off it's really not bad we
can actually stand behind the r7 1,700
under the correct usage conditions and
those are going to be mixed workload
conditions where you do some production
that is CPU accelerated maybe streaming
in addition to gaming if you're just
gaming is still going to be a cheaper
CPU or an equivalently price i7 as your
better bet in terms of raw frame
throughput but in those mix workloads
the 1700 it really does thrash the i5
and even does a pretty good job beating
the i7 though isn't as they're threshing
in production workloads that are secu
accelerated so that's all we have to say
for this one thank you for watching
