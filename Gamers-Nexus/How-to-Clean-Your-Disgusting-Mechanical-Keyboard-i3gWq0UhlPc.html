we've got the keyboard and its natural
habitat
I've been chasing the keyboard all night

going to pull its keys out we're going
to clean the keyboard once we clean the
keyboard form its natural habitat we can
put some metal key caps on it will be
gaming in no time
tools for the job you're gonna need a
key cap puller to kill the keyboard
you're going to need some duster I like
to call it keyboard killer harmless to a
human deadly to a keyboard once you got
the tools you're going to approach the
keyboard slowly because it's got vile
repulsive remnants under a previous
human contact once you catch the
keyboard they clean it you got to be a
bit careful
perhaps wear a hazmat suit if it's been
in the wild too long get your duster get
your key cap bowler pull the key caps
you'll feel a bit repulsed if you like
it's a vile smell once you got the key
caps pulled you flip the keyboard over
you want to redistribute its little dead
flakes of skin its contaminants its
pieces I hear it's Chrome's its general
disgustingness into the wild so that it
can populate the plants serve as a bit
of soil got some high nutrient soil in
here for free from the keyboard don't
need to buy it from the store you just
sprinkle some of this magic stuff
straight into your lawn it'll go grass
like Miracle Whip Miracle Grow Miracle
