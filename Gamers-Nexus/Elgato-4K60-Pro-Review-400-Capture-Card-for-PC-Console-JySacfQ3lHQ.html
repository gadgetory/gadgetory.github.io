60 capture card and it's $400 there
aren't a lot of reviews of this one it's
relatively new it came out in November
MSRP is about $400 and there aren't many
competing products either the main thing
with a capture card like this is that
it's more or less plug-and-play you
could record things locally on the same
system using something like shadow play
or relive the only downside with those
is you occasionally have issues with for
example frame time variants 0.1% low as
one resent lows dropping off a little
bit and if you're a more serious
competitive gamer you might want an
external capture system that said the
other main use case would be with
consoles and it's a bit peculiar there
because at 4k 60 you really only have
two consoles that can even do that
the Xbox one X and whatever the new ps4
is called Pro and with those there are
very few games that actually do 60fps so
it's more like 4k 30 so we're gonna
review this today and as you can see
you've got thermocouples hooked up to it
just for a bit of an extra thermal test
out of pure curiosity before that this
video is brought to you by the new cable
mod pro series cable mods new pro cables
come with pre-installed closed combs for
clean builds accompanied by a revamped
color style and vibrance the cables are
now using thicker wires and they've also
added right-angled internal USB 3
extension and right angled SATA data
cables by the pro series cable kits at
the link below or customized at your
cable set with the configurator also
linked below we've been using this
capture card to record our xbox footage
for benchmarking one of the reasons we
got into the decision to review it was
because one of the very few reviews of
this specific card on Amazon by a user
said something like I thought this
internal PCIe by 4 device would work
with my laptop so clearly we need to
talk about that this is an internal card
first of all in terms of the looks it
looks like it's got a giant heatsink on
the front and on the back it doesn't
we'll get there and talk about that in
terms of the capabilities it does for
k60 the saw
sir by default allows you to do up to
140 megabits per second using virtualdub
OBS or some other software you can go
higher than 140 megabits per second and
do so more or less without introducing
any significant lag there is a point at
which you would find that the stutter or
lag or drop frames but you can still go
higher than 140 the company says that
the card works best with GT x10 series
and Andy Vega cards we tested it all the
way down to 960 it's fine technically
speaking this word it gets more
interesting this card has no on device
encoder so it actually doesn't do any
encoding work and it helps it does some
of the processing but ultimately it's
pushing that work off to either your CV
or your GPU you can select which so if
it's going to CB or GPU on the GPU with
Nvidia you'd be relying on n V encoders
a gtx 1080 or t I would have to envy
encoders everything below them would
have one on V encoder we found that a
1060 or 960 could still process 140
megabits per second without issue you
might be able to go a bit higher than
that with two env encoders but because
you're on an external capture machine
anyway it's not consuming nearly as much
resources as on the same machine and E
has its own encoder as well but you
could do either CB or GPU and then at
that point you're really just piping the
video out of the console or the PC into
another one and this has two HDMI ports
on the back so no DisplayPort
unfortunately but if you think about the
target market probably consoles that
makes sense again there's a bit of an
oddity in that not many games actually
do 60fps but this is capable for the
ones that can and a quick addendum on
that clearly talking about consoles
they're not about pcs so it doesn't seem
like this things are flying off the
shelves
which speaks more to the current demand
for 4k 60fps streaming than anything if
you're not bottlenecked by the game
basically your bottlenecks by your
upload speed so not that many people are
doing it right now demand seems quite a
bit lower than a 1080 card but it still
worked really well overall the existing
alternatives are much more expensive
this is 400 bucks
well has a mage valve Pro capture HDMI
4k Plus which has the worst name on the
planet and that's 800 to 900 dollars
major well does have a heatsink and fan
the 4k 60 Pro does not more on that
later doesn't matter a whole lot for
this particular product but this card
the elgato one has functional drivers in
software for Windows 10 and we had
issues with those drivers working
properly even on Windows 10 so on
versions of Windows 10 from before the
fall creators update we would run into a
catastrophic issue that required
removing the card on installing the
drivers inserting the card reinstalling
the drivers and then it would work again
but updating to 1709 resolved all of
those problems for the Windows version
the solver is not much different from
virtualdub or OBS it actually does a lot
less than either of those two things it
makes it easier for new users but we'd
recommend other sauce or if you want
more control you can toggle between CPU
or GPU and coding you'll need their
software for that there's a bitrate
slider and that's about it
so using virtual dub or OBS it's
possible to capture higher bit rates io
on the back is limited to HDMI and put
an output and there's not any meaningful
amount of latency
visibly noticeable during the capture
process with this card so that's not
really a concern either let's talk about
thermals though this was more curiosity
just for fun in theory if you have this
in a system what you're probably doing
is you're if it's not the test bench
you're sitting it in a system below a
GPU and these days probably above power
supply shroud so it's really going to be
limited for its airflow options and it's
got a GPU above it if it's not doing a
lot of work it'll help cool down the
backside of this if it's doing a lot of
work it'll heat it up so we're gonna go
through some of the numbers for assembly
it's four screws very easy to take apart
we have thermocouples on here you can
see them sticking out of the card
there's a venting slat here it looks
like there's a fan in there there's not
it looks like there's a heatsink in
there there's not it does not make
contact to the PCB whatsoever on the
front side it's actually just a hollow
shell
not on the backside there are no thermal
pads there's no direct contact except
for maybe in one instance to the back
plate so all the heat for the most part
is transferred via radiation not via
conduction which is far less efficient
and it's not really meant to be heat
sink in that regard this is this does
one of two things it looks cool or it
keeps console players I guess in the
eyes of El Gato from touching things
they shouldn't if they don't know what
they're doing I don't know but I think
it's more of a looks cool thing so
getting to the thermals the back plate
would also be great for sinking heat
away from hot areas on the PCB
except again no thrown pads or points of
contact at all with metal shell in
general there are some small vent holes
cut on the front it's otherwise sealed
and in the case of testing for k60 we've
noticed that it gets pretty warm without
active airflow on it even on an open air
test bench and this was to the point
that I get unpleasantly hot to the touch
so we decided to stick thermocouples on
it but we also test with the 140
millimeter md exeed radiator fan to blow
air out over the test bench during
testing which helped a lot but we've
seen multiple pictures of builds where
4k 60s or HD 60 Pro cards are jammed in
next 2 GB back plates with no room for
ventilation or just a PSU shroud for
thermal testing we first took
thermographic images of the card when
its heat sink was fully disassembled
which was really meant to give a spot
measurements so fill things here
thermographic imaging is misused a lot
in tech media people use it to get an
actual measurement of something but
that's not really what you're supposed
to be doing when you're taking an image
of a graphics card the way we use it is
strip all the parts off get rid of
anything that's going to cause
emissivity or reflectivity issues with a
thermal camera take a picture of a
blackbody component like an SMD and then
use that to determine where we should
put thermocouples for properly accurate
measurements so we determined that there
were two places that got pretty hot and
they were opposing each other there on
either side so one component is right
here on the back another one is on the
same spot on the front and those
components are the large silicon lattice
semiconductor part and also the dual
part dual port
hdmi receiver so that's where we put the
thermocouples and although the cover
looks like a heatsink again it's not so
let's look at the numbers the first
thermal test with the covers on is stock
configuration the test was started with
the system off so there were a few
seconds of near ambient temperatures at
the beginning it was a little warm from
earlier use after that there were
relatively slow increases in temperature
as the system was turned on the Xbox was
off at this point all Salter was closed
and the card wasn't doing any real work
but it did still pull some power while
idling of course once the Xbox was
turned on and the card began passing
through an HDMI signal temperatures rose
abruptly we had the capture utility open
which doesn't seem to matter but we were
not recording and the card was just
passing signal from the card to our
monitor during this part of the test we
waited for the temperatures to reach
steady state which happened at around 86
degrees Celsius on the front 79 on the
back and then we began to record some
gameplay whilst recording started using
the elgato for K capture utility GPU
accelerated the temperature initially
went down and began to fluctuate more
that's because our GT x 1080 FTW had
been idling up until that point the fans
are not spinning but the envy encoder
load caused them to activate and begin
moving air across the test bench we
could control for this of course but
it's a good example of the kind of
behavior that might be seen in real use
case temperatures continued to climb and
then levelled out around 90 degrees
Celsius on the front and 84 on the back
with this experiment going we
experimented with switching to OBS at
higher settings during this part of the
test but there wasn't a noticeable
effect we then placed a 140 millimeter
fan on top of the test bench which is
what we do when we actually need to
capture your footage
temperatures instantly dropped as
expected and leveled out around 75
degrees Celsius on the front 69 degrees
Celsius on the back when using the fan
we stopped logging here but the guard
retained heat in the metal plates for
quite a long time after being turned off
here's the test data when the cover is
off the card idled at around 35 degrees
Celsius with the cover off and no HDMI
signal going through it 35 C is fine
it's above ambient a bit but it's not
going to overheat just by idling of
course once the Xbox was turned on and
the card began passing a signal through
temperatures rapidly rose without the
benefit of the metal casing
soak up heat it was also less insulated
though so we reach steady state around
69 degrees Celsius on the front 66 on
the back even once recording started
this is superior to the 84 degree and 90
degree temperatures of the test with the
cover on which is more to look cool than
to be cool again adding a fan to the
test bench lowered the cards
temperatures drastically the test
finished up around 47 degrees Celsius on
the back and 49 in the front the
duration of this whole test was much
shorter than the first one note the time
scale as the lack of metal to soak up
and retain that heat did make the
changes much more rapid we lose that
soaking ability we never saw any
performance loss with this though so
although the temperatures are getting to
levels of being more or less
unacceptable for these silicon
components even though we're there we
didn't drop more frames there's no
performance degradation now there
probably you might run into is this was
on an open-air bench if you have this in
a poorly ventilated case under a GPU and
above a PSU shroud your thermals will be
worse and I don't know what kind of
protections are on these cards I don't
know if they have over temperature
protection but regardless if they do or
not doesn't really matter the point is
you've got stuff getting really hot and
over time you could have things like
capacitor bulging that would damage or
destroy the usability of the card so
thermals are certainly we would like to
see al gato improve the thermals on this
and they could do it by not building a
literal heat trap on the card that'd be
a good start maybe you know connect the
big piece of metal that's over it to a
component on the card so it's actually
sinking heat and exposing it to the
outside where you've got airflow that'd
be a good start we'd like to see that
it's not something that ruins the
usability of the product it works fine
if you're in a case with poor airflow
please make sure you put fans in there
so that they can actually breathe and
that will solve most your problems as
far as the product itself it worked
pretty well for a four case of capture
we didn't really have problems with the
product the saucer is pretty bad it's
it's really it's got some bugs we've had
a lot of crashes it does not play well
with older versions of
Windows 10 even you want FCU or later
and it also is very limited in its
options we found OBS or even virtual dub
which is basically a 20 plus year old
project maintained by college students
for free we found both of those to work
better so if you're looking at buying it
consider those but they'll got our
stuffs ok it's frustrating sometimes
that does 140 megabits you can do more
on the other software the other oddity
of course again 4k 60 doesn't apply to a
lot of console games works fine for PC
we tried it it handles actual 4k 60 just
fine and the playback is no problem
we've been playing clips probably
through this whole video and it all
looks good so the only the only real
bottleneck in terms of performance and
frame jobs are the games especially for
the consoles $400 is a pretty good price
but there's no point in buying the card
unless you're actually going to use it
for 4k 60 if your internet doesn't
support it and you're live streaming
then don't bother unless you're gonna
upgrade your upload speed soon if you're
capturing local and then uploading later
it's worthwhile if you can actually play
the games at 4k 60 on the host system
and other than that the 1080p version of
all the million capture cards that are
out there for 1080p 60 are cheaper
better alternatives if you're not
legitimately transmitting 4k somewhere
to the Internet at some point so that's
kind of how we look at this there's a
$200 Blackmagic intensity Pro 4k we
can't vouch for its quality we haven't
tested it but we did see it we used to
use a vision card that's an SC 2 HT 4 I
believe is the model we use that for VR
capture it's like 2,000 plus dollars so
the disparities large and it can't even
do 4k 60 like this can but it does a lot
of other things so different tools are
different jobs and then of course there
are there are plenty of more expensive
options as well but this seems to work
pretty well for it works well for
something that's in between $200 in 2000
the $400 4k 60 is fine it's just make
sure you actually will use it
because if you're not going to because
your Internet's bad or something and
you're streaming then there are cheaper
options that do the job fine with
1080p60 so that's it for this one thanks
for watching someone dressed in data on
third all thermals there's not really
anything you can do about it other than
put a fan in the case and make sure it
points generally towards the capture
card you're not gonna lose performance
probably unless it gets really bad but
you might have a component degradation
over time which will not manifest itself
as decay and performance this is this is
something that it's a common
misconception people think that video
cards from overuse will decay in
performance for example same thing with
this that's not really true it's just an
instantaneous failure so you go from
working like it's always worked to not
working and works fine until it doesn't
in other words so with the the kind of
temperatures are dealing with on this if
it's it'd be used in a low airflow case
over time you could have cat bulging or
popping and that's it so just make sure
there's a fan on there but otherwise
it's fine so yeah thanks for watching
get a stored on camera's nexus dotnet to
pick up a shirt like this one or one of
our mod mats which are on backward but
shipping within the next couple of weeks
now and we sold out instantly last time
so get an early if you want one
otherwise go to patreon.com/scishow and
razaaq's ourselves that directly and get
behind-the-scenes video access thanks
for watching I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
