nexus dotnet and you are watching
episode 4 of our weekly green light
spotlight video a recurring series that
tells you what games you should watch
out for on steams greenlight service as
the service matures we see even more
games getting promoted so please
nominate games you think we should
support below in the comments with that
said kicking us off in slot number seven
this week we have day one garry's
incident and indiana jones esque 3d
action adventure that's littered with
all manner of traps agility challenges
which look crazy fun by the way enemies
and hidden treasures running on Epix
famed Unreal Engine 3 this FPS survival
game forces you to seek out shelter food
and navigate challenges in an open and
destructible world the devs plan to
release the game in episodic form
targeting five dollars per quote-unquote
episode so go check that out if you're
interested in giving off a completely
different vibe in slot number six we
have a rational investigator which is
headed up by the same writer behind
penumbra FTL and Driver San Francisco
irrational is a game of private
investigation and text-based argument
that in classic noir style encourages
deductive logic for crime solving and
story progression as you traverse the
map NPCs will challenge your character
with arguments and puzzles and offer
clues that must be uncovered to solve
crimes and mysteries in the town the
game is based off of a rational Redux
which had over half a million plays on
the web if I remember correctly forge
take slot number five this class-based
multiplayer brawler heads up our mid
range of green light games this week and
it is almost fury like an example if
anyone remembers that game forge
promises a zero grind game that utilizes
the MMO PvP mechanics but without the
mindless droning required to get to
those upper levels the game's difficulty
comes in your own ability to command its
classes much like an FPS and it even
replicates an FPS arena except in a
fantasy environment if you're looking
for a challenging PvP experience without
the time sync of an MMO you may want to
give forge a shot as it does feature
some classic RPG elements as well in
verbis virtus is our next game we were
looking at today and it is consequently
very hard to say quickly ever since the
explosion of voice activated
shout and Skyrim we've seen a rise in
voice recognition technology in games at
least in mod form in verbis virtus has
added its voice to the fray saying
things for example like the beam of
light will activate a beam of light from
your hand or mind over matter will move
objects at least in its current state
and the dev say they will be adding a
unique language I'm not sure how that
will impact gameplay but they do plan on
making it a bit easier for localization
this will all cast spells at the targets
on your reticle so using your voice to
command an arsenal spells as you travel
through dungeons littered with traps and
enemies is the goal of in verbis virtus
if that sounds interesting to you go
check it out on their steam greenlight
page grapple is the next game and this
game along with the next to actually
look incredibly fun to me this one is a
ball based tactile physics action
platformer say that five times fast if
you were to grind spider-man into a pope
and at jello to what remained you'd end
up with the shiny slimy goo ball found
in grapple swing from surface to surface
stick to walls and launch too far away
platforms in an attempt to complete
courses in the fastest time possible the
game's mechanics focus on overall feel
of the game aiming to achieve
satisfaction of controls and fluid
execution over all else our second place
in game however is a little bit
different the last Phoenix it is a dog
fighting game with vivid okami asked
graphics you control a Phoenix in a
ruined landscape and in order to restore
color to the world you must destroy
carrion birds and aerial combat color
returns to the world as you fling crows
to their death and incinerate carry on
flyers and as the atmosphere of the game
grows and worked on color plants will
regrow in real time and replenish the
land in this open island environment the
fighting game play is based primarily
around diving rolling evading boosting
grappling and fiery explosions hopefully
supplying us with enough options to have
some seriously fun gameplay but the next
game is definitely seriously fountain
fracked osc take slot number one and it
is well deserved I must say this a game
was suggested in our comment several
times it is a first-person adventure
game where you interact with in-game
synthesizers create music and solve
puzzles based on the sounds that you
create in the game the game walks you
through all of this and teaches you how
to use its proprietary set of music
creation tools which the developers take
great pride in and they even expressed
an interest in teaching the player how
to make their own music within the
bounds of the game by the end of their
play through experience I'm going to let
the audio of fracked OSU play for a
second since the game is almost entirely
audio-based so here's a listen to that
and with that everything in this game
will center around sound and with such
unique player interaction and a focus on
actually teaching the player something
there's no reason not to consider
fracked OSC for steam greenlight so
that's it for this week's green light
spotlight please like comment and
subscribe as always you'll find links to
the games in the comments below or sorry
in the description below leave a comment
with your suggestions for next time and
i'll see you guys next time peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
