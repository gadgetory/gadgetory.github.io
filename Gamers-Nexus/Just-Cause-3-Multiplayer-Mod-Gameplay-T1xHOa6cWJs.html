multiplayer support on his December
first launch the game's predecessor has
a multiplayer mod that's become so
popular it's even made its way on the
Steam library pages to accompany the
core Just Cause 2 game that mod was in
development for nearly 2 years but is
publicly endorsed and playable allowing
global multiplayer chaos
explosions races and all manner of
vehicles and semi competitive play on
the steam page alone the multiplayer mod
for Just Cause 2 already has 10,000 user
reviews and it's only been listed there
for one third of the mods lifespan as of
today the Just Cause multiplayer project
or JC MP launched a functional
multiplayer demo Just Cause 3 that's
what you're looking at right now the
team has only been working on the mod
for a few weeks and may have been able
to salvage some code from jc2mp mod
hopefully accelerating the process as of
now the demo shows car racing between
several players player operated jets
executing bombing runs on player cars
and the general chaos and grandeur the
series is known for back in November
2014
Just Cause developers Avalanche Studios
said that they might officially add in
support for multiplayer but that
obviously never happened there's still a
chance for official support as the game
matures and it'll be interesting to see
whether Avalanche openly endorses the
multiplayer mod or if it sees the
endeavor as a threat to official
multiplayer the mod isn't yet available
for download and is still in early
development phases but is showing clear
promise and has a proven track record of
delivery to learn more about the Just
