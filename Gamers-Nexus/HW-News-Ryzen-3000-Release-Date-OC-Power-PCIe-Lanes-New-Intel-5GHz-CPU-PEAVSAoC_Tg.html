already have some pretty highlighting
items from AMD Intel and NVIDIA and it's
gonna be all three major silicon players
in the space
AMD news is the most interesting it's
what we have the most depth on right now
and that includes some launch timing and
expectations of what AMD is showing and
when there is a keynote this week
actually it'll be with him like 12 hours
of this video going live but it's
probably not gonna have quite as much as
you're expecting if you've seen some of
the rumors however there is still
additional information on AMD and its
rise in 3000 series next 570 including
power consumption things like that that
we can share in this video we'll also be
talking to NVIDIA GeForce super and then
the Intel 9900 KS before that this video
is brought to you by drop and their HD 6
xx headphones the 6 xx headphones offer
high quality audio output with wide
device compatibility mouth drops 6 XX
also includes a 6 foot cable with 3.5
millimeter plug alongside a quarter inch
adapter for those who might want to plug
into an app the 6 X X focuses its energy
into balancing the sound leaning toward
warmer and bass your audio they're also
easy to disassemble and replace
individual parts making these headphones
trivial to maintain for long-term use
learn more at the link below so AMD up
first anthe has its keynote immediately
basically for this event this is
exclusive to us we received this
information through multiple of our
contacts and confirmed it a month them
so the keynote is supposed to have the X
570 unveil and if you're expecting a lot
of detail on specification for the rise
and 3000 series CPUs if you're if you're
looking for frequencies and overclocking
and power and really just about anything
with detail prices you're probably not
gonna get most of that we will be
covering the keynote so hopefully some
of this proves to be wrong and there is
actually SPECT information that we can
cover and it will go up same day if so
but our understanding now is that it's
mostly you next 570 launch no specs what
we do know beyond that and this may be
more interesting for you is that June
10th is the intended it rise in 3000
series desktop CPU
announcement at e3 and that only could
be lineup of the CPU is the different
skews down the stack the price is the
frequency is the cash and all of the
other specs to do with the CPU so you
might get one or two of those at the
Computex keynote but everything else
will be at e3 on June 10th July 1st is
when the rise on 3000 series pre-orders
will open and then the x5 70 pre-orders
will open there's also maybe going to be
an embargo list but it won't be
performance review and then July 7th
will be the performance review embargo
and the launch of the Rison 3000 series
CPUs along with X 570 a 16 chord so we
have some information on this as well
there is as we've said in the past
couple of weeks now there is a 16 core
that's confirmed but we have some new
information on overclocking and what we
have learned is that the 16 core CPUs
that presents are allegedly pushing
towards 300 Watts under air which in
this case means Waters water cooling but
era being ambient temperature not exotic
cooling so that's about what we know
presently for the upper bound of the
power for 16 core we'll have to wait for
more information on that and get more
detail X 5 so many chips that we have
some more hard facts on so the X 5 Sony
chips that will be 11 watts versus the
previous X 475 point two eight watts
this is a considerable increase in the
heat output of the chipset which is a
result of PCIe Gen 4 from 3 and then
some of the board's you'll see some
changes to PCB materials or just
improvements in more focus on signal
integrity because of PCIe gen 4 it's
apparently not so easy to just throw
into any board and because of the
increase in TDP or increase of chipset
power you're gonna see a lot of boards
with fans which you've probably already
seen the last couple of days the Lane
assortment we also know now so 16 total
CPU lanes coming off the CPU to the GPU
and four lanes coming from the CPU to m
dot 2 devices so that'll go to a
specific I'm not two slot on the board
you'll have to check them other word
manuals to see which one that is also
for memory support we have learned again
through trusted sources that it's 3200
Hertz 2 slot
it'll be a bit lower for forest lot
we'll talk about that and so when we're
motherboard videos coming up this week
really say again July 7th Intel news
this is really pretty straightforward
Intel has an I $9.99 hundred KS CPU
coming up that asked us for special
edition if you remember the 8086 K it's
that so the 8086 K was a it was an 8700
k the same thing except it was
functionally pre overclocked it's
basically ships at a higher clock so
they don't call it overclocking abut
chips at a higher clock and the 9900 KF
same thing it will ship at 5 gigahertz
all core so it's a higher clock to 9900
K the same die just a higher frequency
out of the box special edition comes
some time probably this year but we
don't firmly no one yet or in the very
least week we can't say Intel should be
announcing details on this later in the
week for a firm release date but that is
what the CPU will be pricing TBD at
present at time of filming and it's also
has shown some of the performance of its
ice Lake CPUs mostly for notebooks and
the demo shown was Andy Picasso versus
Intel's new 10 nanometer ice Lake CPUs
with IG peas and in those demos Intel
had both devices set to 25 they were 25
watt devices and it at power parity
Intel was matching or leading Picasso in
their benchmarks now big flag here that
as always these are our benchmarks
conducted by the company so until we can
verify them you probably shouldn't take
that too far because we need to see how
well it validates in reality and depends
on the workloads things like that but
from what Intel has shown so far it does
look like the most promising GPU
advancement by Intel in its graphics
accelerator line that we've seen in a
while so 10 nanometer and ice Lake are
getting to be a bit more serious of
accommodation for intel's IGP lineup
whereas in the past we've just called
them the Intel graphics decelerators
they weren't good at all but things have
changed so ice Lake will be among the
first to start pushing and the
financially from Intel side of things on
graphics and finally Intel demonstrated
variable rate shading testing you've
heard about this in our coverage of RT X
when an video was talking more about
variable rate shading
but there's a new 3d mark feature
benchmark that demonstrates variable
rate shading performance and it doesn't
presently work on all devices and won't
it depends on if they support it but
Intel did show performance uplift there
the question again is how the image
quality is in the Intel demo is it looks
like the reduction in quality should be
negligible but we'll have to wait until
we get the monitor actually like right
in front of our faces to look at it more
closely so that's the news the 9900 KS
is really the interesting item for us we
don't cover much mobile but intel has
put a lot of performance numbers out
there on ice Lake if you're interested
in mobile stuff you can go look up other
coverage and video super there's not
much we can say about this and video
teased super g4 super recent a couple
days ago there's a 16 second teaser on
it and what we do know is that it sounds
like this could be a higher clock to
memory part so it'd be the same GPUs
2016 2017 2018 probably with higher
frequency memory bumped up and we also
gathered some information that it sounds
like there's an RT X 20 series refresh
in the works when that will come out
we're not clear it's not at this show
it's not a Computex more likely maybe a
week or two after Computex for
additional information not a launch but
just additional information on this
stuff or at least one fan sign RT X
which is something that anybody's been
working on as well and will be shown at
e3 very likely and then finally there's
news item brought to our attention that
apparently Nvidia has filed for
trademarks before 30 80 40 80 and 50 80
there's some speculation online about
and videos trying to block AMD from
using these names although this is
perhaps more fitting for the storyline
people like to build between AMD and
NVIDIA in reality NVIDIA has ten eighty
and twenty eighty already and had nine
eighty before that and sort of had an
800 series but mostly seven and so I
guess the theme here is that Nvidia is
incrementing and 3,000 4,000 5,000 we're
eventually going to happen if they keep
skipping the hundreds in between for
example ten and twenty other than 16
because 16 is bigger than then 10 but
not quite 20 and so that's why that's
why they used that name I guess that was
the explanation either way 3080 big
surprise is a name that Intel or Nvidia
rather wants to use as for
whether it's to block a MV whatever
we'll see maybe but it just it's kind of
kind of reading into it quite a lot
right now so that's it for this one
subscribe to catch the show coverage

this was exclusive to us so you might
not have seen it yet unless you checked

access net to support us directly and
definitely check back shortly for all of
