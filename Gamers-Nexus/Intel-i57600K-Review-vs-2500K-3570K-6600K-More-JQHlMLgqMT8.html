look at the more likely purchase for the
majority of gamers the Intel i5 7200 K
quad core variant we previously reviewed
the i7 77 100k and found the CPU to be
largely uninspiring with regard to out
of box performance gains in gaming
though did remark that its render gains
that were more meaningful now we're
looking at the 7600 K to see how the
processor moves Intel i5 series forward
before getting to that this content is
brought to you by our patreon backers
you can go to patreon.com/crashcourse
with to help out directly we just
reached one of our goals and are
producing some more interview content
pieces to check that out to help further
running through the specs first the
Intel i5 7600 expect for an i5 CPU it's
four cores four threads no hyper
threading and is using 14 nanometer
process but it is Intel 14 nanometer +
process which increases the thin height
and widens the gate pitch and as we
discuss in the 77 100k review that
improvement is really just what gets
them a couple hundred megahertz extra
out of the clock so really the main
gains for Kaiba lake over skylake just
covered again is going to be in the
frequency department other than some
really specific things like 4k Netflix
playback like other case cue CPUs the
7600 K is fully overclockable and pairs
best with the z series motherboards
we've already detailed the new 200
series chipsets in our 7700 k review
again click the link with description
below for more information on the
chipsets as for the 7600 k specs we have
a base clock of 3.8 gigahertz and a
turbo clock of 4.2 the cache is reduced
to megabytes and total cash from the i7
dropping the 6 megabytes from 8 and
otherwise it's largely the same specs
and compatibilities the biggest change
as always is the have thread count and
reduced frequency from the ice own
family for details on the kb lake
architecture check the links in
description below because that's got all
of the benchmarks in terms of the actual
systems we use the benches defined in
the methodology section it changes
obviously from one CP to the next
because you've got to account for
different memory compatibility ddr4 over
3 and then
architecture itself is defined on the
7700 K review won't be going over that
again today but we can go through the
thermals blender benchmark some
synthetics and then game benchmarks
temperatures with our i-5 7600 K were a
bit better than what we saw was a 7700 K
depending on a voltage Auto V core
things like that I was all discussed in
the motherboard reviews by the way but
for now what we're seeing is a 74 C
package temperature went onto the same
way the 77 Rek was under with a VX
workload core 0 through 3 were in the
range of 67 to 74 Celsius and then the
power draw was rated at 97 to about 101
watch or thereabout the core we keep at
one point two eight eight it was
manually tuned for these numbers and
then ambient was somewhere around 25
which is important to note as well and
just for what it's worth the liquid
temperature was 33 Celsius for the crack
and X 62 that we use which was a bit
warmer than we saw with the 7700 K and
that's just because the ambient was a
bit increased during these tests since
the value of our normal Delta numbers
using our in-house designed blender
benchmark guys built by Jen's Andrew
Coleman we're recording a total render
time on the CPU of approximately 68
minutes with the stock configuration or
62.5 with the 4.7 gigahertz overclocked
version as this benchmark demonstrates
having the additional threads helps and
render workloads as a tool can render
two times as many tiles simultaneously
the 7600 K takes just under 30 minutes
longer to render the scene than the
stock 7700 K and is expectedly slower
than all i7 cps on the bench
other than the ADEs 2600 k compared to
last generations i5 6600 k the 7600 KC's
an improvement of approximately 5 to 6
minutes or about 7%
moving on to synthetics prior to game
benchmarks Cinebench testing places the
i5 7600 k between the i5 6600 k and the
i7 4790k and that's what 716 cv marks
for cv performance and 184 marks for
single credit performance comparatively
our overclocked boosts that up to 788
for total TV performance still below the
4790k and 204 for single credit
performance or just below the 7700 K
5.1 gigahertz the i5 6600 K from last
generation operated at 664 CD mark sorre
172 single-threaded for 3d mark fire
strike and time spies tests again the
link the description below has those if
you want more synthetics but now we can
move on to game FPS benchmarks for these
we have a mix of CPU bound games and
mixed workload games watchdogs to is one
to really pay attention to here because
the threads really matter in that game
as we just explained in one of our
optimizations guides and then total war
of course is interesting as well because
it is a CPU bound title we recently
posted a watchdogs to CPU optimization
guide for graphics settings as the game
has proven to be one of the few titles
that takes advantage of additional
threads from higher-end CPUs the line
dividing i7 + i5 CPUs here is clear with
i7 CPS dating back to Devil's Canyon
overtaking and outranking even the i-5
7600 K even with its overclocked 4.7
gigahertz configuration we're still
seeing it beaten by i7 for the most part
we're also seeing an average FPS of
about 93 for the OC 7600 K with the
lowest tightly times as shown with other
CPUs the non overclocked version rests
at 84 FPS average and the Intel i7 7700
K stock operates at 113 average so we've
got a gap of about 20 FPS because the
two stock KB Lake CPUs looking at the
previous generation the i5 6600 K
operates at around 39 FPS average so
we're gaining approximately 5 to 6 FPS
generationally that's a gain of about 7%
which in this game anyway is sadly
pretty good for this generation of Intel
CPUs for Battlefield 1 we're seeing the
Intel 7600 KS stock lands at around 140
1sps average roughly equal to the 6700 k
i7 from last generation to be fair it's
also roughly equal to the 7700 K from
this generation which also capture on
141 FPS average compared to the i5 6600
K there's not a ton of improvement we're
moving from at 137 average to 145 or a
gain of about two and a half percent so
not that exciting we only start seeing
meaningful gaps once down to the 35 70 K
but even that's not very relevant almost
dying for 144 Hertz gameplay total war
has always been a CPU intensive title
all of them really and that continues to
shown with total war Warhammer as noted
previously the frame times have larger
range in total war than were used to
so the 0.1% values aren't quite as
valuable as normally just because it is
a bit more variable in its performance
overall we're seeing large-scale ability
over the generations of i5 CPUs in this
benchmark with the 7600 K it stock
landed at 165 FPS average and the 6600
KS Stockland in about 10 FPS below that
the i5 4690k from Devil's Canyon
operates around 143 FPS era so we're at
about a 10 10 10 FPS scaling to each one
was the 35 70 K at 99 FPS average the
scaling here shows that there would be a
major benefit of upgrade for this
particular title if moving up from Ivy
Bridge or Pryor but not so much
excitement beyond that the overclocked
7600 K by the way it shows that
frequency matters with Total War and
plants us at around 177 FPS average
ashes a singularity CPU focus benchmark
provides a look at dx12 performance of
the title that's well optimized for the
new API the 7600 KS stock performs just
ahead of the 6600 K and just below the
4790k i7 CPU that's about the same as
we've seen in terms of placement with
the other games it was far and moving to
the overclocked variants of the 7600 K
we're posting an FPS that is still below
the 4790k but it is getting a bit close
at the next step up as for overclocking
the 7700 K that we worked with both of
them actually were a lot more exciting
than the 7600 K we were able to hit five
to five point one gigahertz on the i7
variants of KB Lake depending on which
one we were working with and that would
really wasn't that hard we use the
liquid cooler forward of course because
it was kind of required at that point
but even using the same looking cooler
for this one same methodology same
motherboard even which was the Z 270
game pro carbon we're still only hitting
only hitting 4.7 gigahertz on the i-5
7600 K with one point 4 volts I was
kinda able to get some stability with
4.8 gigahertz but that was really
pushing the voltage that I was
comfortable with and beyond that you
start running to some pretty serious
temperature issues and there was just
stability issues all around so 4.7 was
the number we got with our particular
sample of the
7300 kay and ours was a retail sample I
bought it so if that's worth noting I
guess it's out there it was not provided
so it definitely wasn't hand-picked or
anything like that
the 7600 K overall has about the same
conclusion as the 7700 K which is if you
own sky lake or Devil's Canyon or has
well there's really no reason to upgrade
for the most part especially for gaming
redoing things like animations like the
blender rendering there might be a
reason to upgrade but gaming not really
it's kind of a hard sell even with the
CPU intensive titles like the total war
watchdogs 5 to i7 would get you a lot
more than I 5 to new i5 other than that
if you're on something as old as the Ivy
Bridge or older than that it's probably
worth considering an upgrade but again
at this point I would say just wait
around a bit we'll see how Zen performs
normally we don't recommend waiting but
because then is so close and it's been
on the radar for years at this point
might as well and see how it goes at
that point it's worth looking at what
the decision would be for an update but
for now no real reason if you're on
skylake as well double canyon maybe ivy
pitch as we've come to expect with the
intel generational step so thank you for
