with the insurmountable market failure
that was fury a revitalized approach to
MMO PvP without the grind of levels and
punishing time requirements it was a
fantastic idea but so poorly executed
that I'd bet most of you don't even
remember the game let alone its
compatibility issues with yes Windows
Vista the world of online battle arenas
has exploded since that time and we've
recently seen strategy oriented MOBAs
take the games industry with ruthless
advancement creating a bandwagon that's
sprung innumerable MOBA like games which
then distill into the speak of just
online competitive gaming where you can
control one character that is what MOBA
has become to mean and a lot of these
marketing materials so that's a bit of a
stretch but not every action brawler has
to be a MOBA like dota or league and
today we're talking about an indie
newcomer named overpower which yes does
use that mobile like branding this game
has us cautiously intrigued for its pvp
arena roots and overpower is inspired by
counter-strike and unreal tournament the
foundation for its medieval fantasy
match based gameplay although not a
fully accurate description if we had to
slap a John Ruan this game it'd probably
be third-person shooter gameplay
mechanics have familial ties to the cs
and UT series and pacing from what we've
seen feels familiar for counter-strike
veterans combat heavily relies upon the
generation of a complex and dynamic
metagame spawned from the existence of
70 abilities for classic RPG classes and
a strong dedication to skill based
combat there is a persistent leveling
and character progression mechanic that
to some extent mirrors what you might
find over in a traditional fantasy RPG
or MMO PvP arena but the game is meant
to be more of a fantasy styled medieval
team fortress 2 meets counters
fusion so far we think it's gameplay
trailers are promising and achieving
that amalgam for players who like the
style of MMO PvP combat but don't want
to fight back to the top of the server
just to get there this style of game
offers a solid drop in drop out play
style similar to shooters and reminds us
of chivalry or if anyone remembers the
mod predating that age of chivalry the
classes are selected at spawn currently
limited to warriors ranges mages and
assassins each class more or less does
what the name would indicate warriors
get physical with enraged melee weapons
Rangers that use snares fire ice and
vampiric arrows to kite enemies across
the battlefield mages that use damage
shields stasis effects Andy vocation
spells with area damage for field
control and manipulation and assassins
sneak in and out of combat using their
class-based ability to duck out when the
battle gets too hot for their damage
over time poisons and their immediate
stuns each class is outfitted with four
core abilities and two special abilities
called gems which are earned and chosen
between matches abilities can be mixed
and matched with weapons and armor as
characters progress though class
abilities remain immutable anchors for
lively staples of engagement as for the
game modes you can expect the usual
assortment of deathmatch Team Deathmatch
and equivalents for domination and
capture the flag which has been changed
into something called quote critter
capture this last game mode is more or
less based capturing of cuter versions
of flags but stealing critters from the
opposing team will grants berries buffs
to the thieving team overpower isn't
done yet and is currently running a
kickstarter campaign for twenty two
thousand dollars which a ton of money in
the light of other campaigns out there
there's not much in the way of gameplay
footage just yet but from what we've
seen so far it's absolutely worth a look
for the right player but as always with
Kickstarter games and we emphasize this
very strongly we strongly urge our
viewers to thoroughly research games
before pre purchase and that's the same
for triple-a titles as it is
for indie kick-started games it's a good
game to keep on the radar for sure
though check out the channel for
additional games and hardware coverage
and as always hit those links in the
description if you'd like to support us
directly thanks for watching I'll see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
