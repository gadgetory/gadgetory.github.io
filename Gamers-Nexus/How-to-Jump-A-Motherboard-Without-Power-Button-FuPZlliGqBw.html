astana and today we're doing a very
useful utility video for when you're
testing your components pre-build so
this is when you're trying to make sure
they work before you put them in the
case and all we're doing here is showing
how to jump the motherboard without
using a power switch from the case
normal you've got two pins that go into
a power switch goes to a case hit the
button and it turns on what we're doing
here is we're eliminating that so you
can turn the system on without the
switch and we're doing that with a
screwdriver so first of all this is our
official test bench for high end GPU
testing we've gotten x99 classified
board that has a special power button on
it so we don't actually need to do that
in this instance but for those of you
with lower end boards that don't have
that this will be useful we've got some
kingston ram and a cpu from ibuypower so
that's the that's the bench to do this
all you do is take the screwdriver and
you jump the positive and negative pins
on the board and as you can see the fans
have started up systems going and we're
went to buy us now so that's all there
is to this jump start trick if you need
any more assistance with testing and
troubleshooting please leave a comment
and we'll help you out something's wrong
over here probably unhappy with the GPU
configuration but that's all for this
video check the patreon link in the post
role if you like this kind of content
and I will see you all next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
