review of LTX Linus tech Expo that was
there by car will be relatively content
free by the nature of it but LTX a lot
of fun I wanted to talk about it and
this will promote our side channel the
GN steep side channel where you get more
of this stuff with you on it I'm gonna
be uploading a couple of dontel rocks
over there some of them talk
yeah LTX is a lot of fun well most of
gone events have ever done actually and
a lot of that is just you know what's
that because it was so Jenny
there were a couple companies rapping I
just gotta have that make it work but I
like that were able to focus sort of on
fans and and other media to there's a
great opportunity to talk to Jay and
barnacle II isn't everyone done some
just blew technical trails pretty easy
something that I can talk through and
write China mine let's see oh my god
there's a bear
got here
you guys see the bear yeah I was about
two feet away from it so hopefully I
didn't piss them off very cool so
independent media can gather is really
valuable for a lot of reasons one is
that we can all kind of talk about some
of BS we have to deal with for
manufacturers
maybe an artist heard examples even on
the in stuff I can be able to talk while
doing this one
so yeah that allows us to keep all the
manufacturers honest when we can talk to
each other I figure out what's going on
I do sometimes do some stuff that's
really not cool bad for the consumer
limiting media access stuff like that
I think Linus has an event on his hands
that has some hidden value for everybody
which is that we can all get together
and just talk about what's going on the
industry
you guys good
Devil's club and axe so one of the other
advantages of that event it's the
highest concentration of viewers you
know who the heck I out of all the
events we go to which actually it's
valuable for another reason that it's
not an ego boost it's because I can see
who our audience is I get to talk to you
guys really great meeting all of you out
there a lot of cool conversation some of
you had great ideas and how we can
improve like our charts and visual
presentations some of you had asked UN
questions so the value of that again is
that I know who's watching us I can put
some faces to the view numbers and that
allows me and the other creators to I
would imagine a good opportunity to make
sure our content works for the audience
and make sure we can keep doing what
people like
that means a lot more when it comes from
so on face to face when they say which
of your content they like the most
because we get tons of thousands of
YouTube comments it's kind of hard to
give them all the same weight after a
while I don't know the people who come
see us in person really know what we do
so it's good to listen to them and
improve our content further so I
appreciate that thank you you guys good
oh you guys okay okay
you good but uh yeah else you expose a
lot of fun actually it's great meeting a
lot of you out there doing amazing
supportive fanbase and very encouraged
keep doing what we're doing I think
there's a greater potential of LTX then
beam just ban me it up Linus has an
interesting opportunity get a lot of us
tech media take youtubers together so we
can support each other
and I think that has tremendous value
when considering how manufacturers have
so much pull in terms of sampling so
where he came together eliminate some of
that concern stop getting cut off
samples yeah and if some people were
like oh my god damn reason access please
don't turn it to wine as tact hips but
here's the thing we can work together
even though we have very different
content types without one of us coming
the other so just remember that yeah
they're possibly friendly country
friends with competitors technical
competitors is ultimately we don't
compete with each other in the industry
as a whole kinda needs people who are
looking out for consumers to stick
together
you know there's a lot of like they do
appeal to a different audience but they
still play a role and you know we don't
always agree with how the other one does
content or maybe better phrasing is I
wouldn't do content his way he wouldn't
do it my way but we can still absolutely
add value in different ways I'll do the
rider I don't know what that is over
there
good don't worry
so she wasn't expecting it stuff sorry
man you good yeah okay have a good ride
going back for sure great hangout with
Jay hey that's probably the the main
value-add here instead of a convention
where we just talk to companies and show
their all the time we can talk to
youtubers
Ajanta so we got a transition at the
heart of darkness and closed out the
video there but uh yeah LT is a really
good opportunity for me to engage
viewers and with other Creators some of
the manufacturers are there but not too
many sections so fast
but it's got some promise venue is good
to check the GN Steve beside channel for
of this some of the videos solve them
it's just straight right that's great
launch pad so yeah
GNC for more of this otherwise you know
where you are now protect subscribe
before page on comms I favor Texas House
head directly
I'll put some of these up to the
behind-the-scenes backers store
Nigeria's next inside that
although I should make jerseys at this
point and uh yeah thanks for watching
see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
