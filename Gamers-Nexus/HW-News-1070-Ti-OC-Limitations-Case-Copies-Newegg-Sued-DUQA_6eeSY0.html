things like all the various 1070 TI's
that have been pictured Newegg getting
sued
Wolfenstein - and it's Vegas support
kind of an interesting story of although
a brief one and we've also got a new a
couple of products on the market to talk
about cases chairs Seagate financial
results things like that and the big one
though is the 1070 TI overclocking story
before we get into that this content is
brought to you by the Thermaltake flow
RGB closed-loop liquid cooler which is a
360 millimeter
radiator +3 120 fans that are RGB
illuminated if then we'll take it ring
fans at that this is a 4.5 done a
stacked pump which is one of the faster
pumps you can learn more at the link in
the description below so this point
several the 1070 TI cards have been
pictured or allegedly pictured anyway
and it really shouldn't be a surprise to
anyone that they all looked the same as
the 10 seventies in the 10 80s it's the
same card more or less just with some
changes to the GPU so the coolers are
gonna be the same the product stack for
the most part will kind of be the same
but it's getting shuffled around in a
few ways one of them is the naming so
you'll probably notice as the cards
start getting their official names
either officially or unofficially posted
online you'll probably notice that
anything that carries any type of pre
overclocked moniker anything that would
be synonymous with a pre overclocked or
could lead a consumer to believe that a
card is pre overclocked those names will
almost certainly be stripped from the
titles of the 1070 ti cards as opposed
to for example if you sold a 1070 card
that was named 1070 gaming OC it's our
understanding that the 1070 T is in that
same instance would just be named 1070
TI gaming no OC and that is an Nvidia
mandate we'll call it from what we
understand now now there's always time
for these things to change but that's
kind of what it sounds like is going on
as for why the monikers and the names
are changing like that it's obviously to
reflect the overclocking
Changez so from what we know today it
sounds like the 1070 TI is not going to
be permitted to be pre overclocked by
any of the AIB partners we're not clear
on a fee consumers will be able to
overclock the card the story has been
around for a little bit now you've
probably heard it we haven't really
spoken to it yet because we're just
waiting on more information to come from
direct sources in the industry and we
finally got it and basically what we do
know is that the out-of-the-box clocks
not to be confused with out-of-the-box
thermals out-of-the-box clocks should be
more or less set to whatever Nvidia says
they're set to and then everything else
is up to users and it sounds like
overclocked and we user standpoint will
either require workaround software or
potentially something like registry mods
or the BIOS mods things like that we
don't have any reason to believe that
the BIOS or power-play tables or
workaround software would not work so
it's possible or fairly possible that
you'll be able to overclock as a
consumer it might not be as simple as
going to a normal application like
afterburner or precision and doing it
but we'll see we're gonna look into it
there should be some leeway there it's
just it's gonna be a question of how
difficult is it to do hopefully it's not
something like with Vega where the V
bios gets locked down as well I don't
suspect that should happen but we'll
find out soon enough
as for the story though they've been
plenty of 1070 TI is pictured EVGA s had
plenty of they're shown I think on video
cards with a Z and I think ACS has had
some of theirs shown and maybe a couple
of others but they they all look the
same because they are the coolers are
the same is just going to come down to
the GPU which is basically going to be
10 80s that failed validation or bend
down 1080 is to fill a certain market
segment we'll have more thoughts on that
when the time comes but as for now these
are all more or less either direct
sources or rumors in the industry but I
think it's pretty safe to say at this
point that based on everything that has
been posted in the past week the 1070 TI
is going to exist it's just a question
of what capacity will the overclocking
exist in as well next story though new
egg
getting sued so Digital Trends reported
on this a few days ago the report stated
that for South Korean banks have grouped
up to file a lawsuit against new AG the
u.s. california-based retailer although
they are owned by a Chinese parent
organization now the Hansa new century
information technology company limited
but still us-based so they've been sued
by a group of banks in South Korea who
alleged that the retailer worked with a
South Korean hardware manufacturer to
conspire about fraudulent orders for PC
hardware the bank's accused new egg and
ASI of collaborating with Monte Wall a
company that's listed 3 billion dollars
in funding from South Korean banks and
one which the bank's alleged
artificially inflated its prices for
orders to new Aegon asi by intentionally
selling overpriced hardware to the
companies the CEO of Monte Wall was
sentenced previously to a now reduced
15-year prison term in 2013 for
defaulting on billions of dollars in
loans and the banks are now chasing down
new egg and ASI for allegedly enabling
this and working with the company on its
fundraising the lawsuit states quote no
such business would have bought the
products at such an inflated price
unless it intended to create the
illusion of extensive profitable high
value commerce between it and its
supplier for the purpose of defrauding
lenders into supporting the transactions
and this was basically saying or
suggesting that new egg and si were
getting kickbacks for enabling Monte
Walz pricing or sales of hardware as
they solicited loans from banks so we'll
see how that one goes out this kind of
thing pops up a lot and either it goes
nowhere
or they settle and we'll see if we hear
about it again but next news item both
unsigned - so what one sign - the new
Colossus received official recommended
and required specifications today along
with an interesting statement that
pointed towards better Vega
implementation in the game which is
using the Vulcan API so Bethesda notes
that it's Vulcan integration will
reportedly quote utilize the power of
Andy's Vega graphics chips in ways that
were not possible before and we're
planning to benchmark this when it comes
out within a couple days from posting of
this video they goes done fairly well
with doom as have all the AMD video
cards the most part so it makes sense to
see similar performance hierarchies with
this game as it's also using Vulcan it's
just a question of how its implemented
the bigger question is what is meant by
Vega specifically being highlighted as
being leveraged in ways we haven't seen
before so we'll look into that one the
time comments but that is the teaser
that we have for now as with aspects
Bethesda recommends an i7 4770k the CPU
and a gtx 1066 gigabyte or RX 474
gigabyte pretty big disparity there for
the GPU and that disparity should I mean
not that you can drive a lot from specs
and recommendations but should more or
less point towards the difference that
we'll see from Vulcan but we'll see as
four minimums
it's an i7 3770 or FX 8350 with the gtx
770 or r9 290 for the GPUs next news
item is a good opportunity to talk about
clone cases and OMS in the case industry
as many of you know a lot of the
industry is based on suppliers and OEMs
and rebranding and the manufacturers
that we all know buy products that exist
theoretically improve them to some
extent and stick the brand on it apply a
warranty apply some support maybe some
software and then you have your product
with all the extra bells and whistles
and markup that's kind
our works well the case side of things
you basically you have companies like
Jones bow that create a product sell it
to companies like Roseville and the one
that made the an ADIZ crystal those are
the companies that buy from people like
Jones bow take an existing case in its
entirety brand it and sell it with a
different fan count so that's one side
of it another side of it is reusing
existing tooling it's not uncommon for
example for a company like Coursera to
invest hundreds of thousands of dollars
upwards of half a million in some cases
to develop tooling for a complex
expensive flagship what you would call a
halo product case and then pull some of
that R&amp;amp;D and tooling down into the
product stack later on and try to recoup
ROI on that investment that's not
abnormal for a business to do and as
long as it's done in a way that
differentiates the product stack without
making original purchasers feel like
they should have just waited then all is
fair and well because you end up with a
more diverse product arrangement and
with complex cool things that were
expensive to make that wouldn't
otherwise be brought to market at
affordable prices so that makes sense
what the sort of third side of it is is
you have tooling that is used by
manufacturers for avian exclusivity
window and eventually gets released and
everyone starts using it so we see this
with in the past as has done this where
they om cases for people like cyber
power or aiwei power and then later
maybe six months down the line it gets
released to consumers char Coons new
case is the am-5 silent case which am-5
a really great name they're just trying
to piggyback off of Rison but am-5
silent case so this one uses noise
damping material and a colorized front
panel here's why this case is pointless
if you've seen the antic p8 which we
reviewed you will notice that its
interior is identical to the shark
and five silent K's not only is the
interior identical the exterior is
functionally identical the ventilation
and hole placements in the same spot all
that's changed this is the front panel
coloration so that ventilation is all
going to be the same depending what fans
they use the cooling performance should
be roughly equivalent and you look a
little bit further you've got the
Silverstone R l05 from several years ago
at CES and that one is also the same
it's the same tool and I think that's
one of the older instances we could find
of this tool in existing and later came
down to the p8 the char Coon tg5 also
uses this with a different front panel
but it's got the same interior chassis
and we can show all that so that's the
same as the a m5 and finally this is all
also the same as the arrow cool project
7 c12 the fare to arrow cool there's at
least has a different front panel it
will have significantly different
thermal results that has during fans as
different LEDs that's an example of a
company taking a tooling that exists and
building upon it to make it unique so
that they can actually offer something
new but all these other ones it's the
same case basically but either way
they've got a new case on the market
next up Seagate technologies reported
financial results for the quarter ending
September 29th 2017 for its first
quarter of 2018 Seagate reported 2.6
billion in revenue with gross margin at
28% and net income at 181 million
diluted earnings per share land at 62
cents for reference last year's
financial results for quarter 1 2017
reported a 167 million net income and a
55 cent diluted earnings per share the
company's year-over-year revenue
continues to decline in the face of
flash popularity rising though there's
obviously still place for hard drives
it's just becoming more limited
Seagate's
first quarter 2018 cash flow was around
237 million from operations with 350
million return to shareholders and
dividends and share repurchases NZXT in
addition to the forthcoming H series
cases
is rolling out a new grid fan controller
and the grid plus version 3 as the name
implies is the company's third iteration
of the digital fan controller the new
controller offers the ability to manage
six different fans and can automatically
detect the difference between three pin
and four pin and fans furthermore the
grid plus version 3 can monitor noise
levels and adapt fan speed to
performance or silence or a mixture of
both it also offers a 0 DB mode for
silent operation and the controller
meshes with mzx ease cam monitoring
software in the new h-series cases NZXT
also has its own gaming chair that's the
same as every other gaming chair on the
market so that's pretty boring but
they're working with verdaguer for this
one it's the SL 2000 its rebranded in
purple and black and says NZXT on it and
so this is something that's kind of
bothered me for last two years going to
all the trade shows more and more people
just like four years ago everyone
started doing the mobile products those
all died fortunately and a little bit
after that everyone started doing
keyboards and mice some kept doing it
because the margins are absurd compared
to what they normally make and some stop
and over the last two years everyone
started making chairs so verdaguer came
into the market along with dxracer and a
couple of other more dedicated chair
companies and then you look at the
chairs that are offered by Thermaltake
corsair NZXT HyperX and there's at least
one more major manufacturer that does
this too but definitely thorn will take
NZXT corsair HyperX and a couple of the
others we've seen that shows you look at
their chairs they're all using the same
supplier for like the armrests are the
same they've got the same four-point
pivot the base is the same the wheels
are the same except for the instance of
Corsair who use rollerblade wheels for
theirs and you end up with very many
differences which kind of goes back to
the case are you
then we're like if you're gonna use a
supplier that's the same as your
competitor at least do something new and
cool other than change the color so NZXT
is working with verdaguer to rebrand a
chair just like everyone else has worked
with whomever Verde gear supplier is or
verdaguer directly to silently rebrand
chairs and sell them as their own
at least times exe owns that it's a
verdict your chair that will give them
that but yeah they're all the same just
get the one that's the cheapest if you
really want one of those to begin with
that's no stick with the grid version
three in the eight series cases NZXT
next one cherry cherry is targeting the
DIY market now and they're going after
the hardcore keyboard or typist
enthusiast Cherry's got a new offering
that allows buyers to purchase their
switches loosely either in developer
kits or individually and the switch is
being offered our MX red blue black
brown green clear silent black silent
red and the speed switches which are
those gray ones that Corsair has used
there's a small caveat here cherry only
offers the switches without mounting
pins through such retailers and will
exclusively sell the switches with a
direct mount for the PCB but either way
pretty cool if you're into that kind of
thing into the idea of building your own
keyboard and relatedly Corsair is now
offering its own keyboard key cap kits
and those are compatible with a wide
range of the Corsair keyboards using
Cherry brand switches the new key caps
are PBT double shots
double shot meaning there are actually
two molds PBT is widely considered more
durable than ABS and a double shot
process is intended to help resist
fading and legibility over time which is
a common complaint with the etched key
caps
Corsair is offering the key caps in both
black and white with a two-year warranty
and they should cost fifty dollars for a
key cap kit that's all for this week's
