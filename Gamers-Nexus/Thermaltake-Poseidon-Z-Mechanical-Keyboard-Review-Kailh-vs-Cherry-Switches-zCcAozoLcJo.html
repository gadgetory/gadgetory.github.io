Nexus tonight and today we're talking
about yet another mechanical keyboard
there are quite a lot of them these days
today we're looking at thermal takes
Poseidon's II blue switch mechanical
keyboard you will notice I did not say
cherry blue that's probably a first for
our mechanical keyboard reviews this is
in fact a kale switch keyboard and we'll
talk about that more in a moment so this
was first demoed at CES we saw it there
we have some footage I will be showing
actually of a pax competition that
happened a few weeks ago where users
were typing on the keyboard four words
per minute one guy did like 150 no big
deal except it sounded like a stampede
of clickety clacks so such is the nature
of mechanical keyboards this is the blue
switch keyboard there's also a brown
switch Poseidon's II as for the
specifications what you need to know is
that it is a full 10 key keyboard that
means it does include a numpad it
doesn't include a wrist rest which I'll
it kind of annoys me but it's not a big
deal because you can go pick one up at a
department store if you really need one
so no wrist rest
it has function keys from F 1 through F
7 that control media operations like
through windows media player play stop
pause stuff like that volume control f11
and f12 control brightness I believe
there are let's see one two three four I
think there are four levels of
brightness plus off it might be it's
like four ish and then we've also got a
button in the very top right that will
toggle your Windows key if you
accidentally hit that while gaming
beyond that everything is pretty
standard it is a mechanical keyboard we
have some stabilizers on the spacebar
and other large keys but other than that
everything is using a kale switch so
here's the thing with switches under
your key is what's called the switch a
lot of you already know this the switch
is what determines that the tactility
of the key presses determines if it's
linear it determines the actuation depth
how far you need to pass it before
registers it determines how much weight
is required to press it down and hit
that registration point and other things
of that nature that ultimately determine
how loud and how responsive a mechanical
keyboard is
so cherry is the ubiquitous option right
now cherry is German based and they
manufacture all their switches in
Germany but there's also kale and kale
is in China they make what are
effectively replica cherry switches as
you can see in this photo by rip stir
from the mechanical keyboard subreddit
they are pretty damn close to what
cherry makes the primary differences
between the switches are in the cross
points cherry uses gold-plated cross
points which theoretically might have
better durability and potentially better
conductivity for transferring the actual
key press to the system as for if that
will ever be noticed in your use I am
not really in a position to say because
I haven't tested these things for years
on end so that's really something you
won't find out until it's got heavy wear
and tear on it the other major
difference is the cherry switches use
slightly thicker molding but really
everything else is about the same it has
the same center-based the same central
return spring that has the same plus
sign even on the actual switch it's got
the same colors so blue and kale is
effectively blue in cherry they're a
little bit different in the spec but
ultimately they can be thought of as
equivalents the same for brown and red
and everything else so that's the deal
with the switches you can read the full
article in the link below if you want to
learn more about the switches and see
some more images of the differences as
for the Poseidon Z well once we get past
the switches it's got a five year
warranty which does bolster my
confidence in recommending it given the
different switch type I normally don't
feel too confident recommending
something made in China that's a replica
of something made in the West that's
been around for a while but it's a
pretty close replica the reason they can
get away with this is because the patent
has expired so it's all completely clean
and a five-year warranty does give you
that bit of confidence that hey if this
thing falters miserably hopefully
Thermaltake will honor the warranty and
replace it so so that's kind of what
we've got going for us here on the
confident side on the specs side there's
a normal six to eight n key rollover
when testing the rollover I was
ever able to press keys that did not
register so I don't think that will be a
concern for you there's no special USB
or 3.5 millimeter sockets on the board
it's pretty straightforward it's just a
keyboard no special features no volume
roller none of that stuff just a
keyboard and the reason they're doing
that is because they want to come in at
the 60 to $80 price point which they do
pretty well I've seen it at 60 to 80
everywhere and there's really not a lot
of competition in that price range for a
keyboard with this relatively high
quality build and moderate quality
switches in my testing so the blue
switches are very clack e if you if you
like I don't know if you can hear that
but if you like the clack enos and and
you want to feel like you're in a press
room from the 50s then you'll like the
blue switches if you want something more
damped and something that's more favored
by for example Starcraft 2 pros you
should look into the brown switches
they're going to be very close to
cherries Brown switches
beyond that the look and feel are pretty
important here so in terms of the feel
when I was using it it's using the
normal sort of sloped cylindrical caps
so pretty standard key caps everything
feels fine the keys aren't spaced
weirdly they're the keys aren't sized
weirdly so you don't have to relearn the
keyboard the tactility is good it's
pretty tactile there's a lot of kick
when you push it down it kicks back kind
of hard so that's really nice if you're
doing a lot of typing if you are a
typist in any measure of the word or a
journalist or something like that you
might enjoy the speed with which the
keys rebound because that that rebound
sort of helps you jump from one key to
the next as for whether that increases
words per minute I have no idea but it
feels pretty good so who cares and in
terms of gaming if you know it's you
push WASD and it works so there's really
not for APM type stuff I guess you might
benefit from the tactility if you are
good enough to notice but as for how
good you need to be to notice that I am
not qualified to answer because I was
only in Dimond and Starcraft so my
thoughts on the keyboard it's I'm okay
with it
I
I think if I were spending sixty to
eighty dollars I would buy this pretty
actually pretty definitively I would buy
this because there's not a lot of good
competition in this price range the
closest keyboard that I liked that was
nearby was Corsairs kay 65 compact
keyboard it has no 10 key hence compact
and I can't use that cuz I need 10 key
if you can get away without it or you
don't even want it then perhaps consider
the k60 5 versus the poseidon sea for
the same price if you increase your
budget a bit to 90 bucks you can start
looking at Coolermaster storm quickfire
TK which is an MX brown switch so if you
really want cherry you don't feel
comfortable with kale then you know you
got to spend more money that's that's
the deal when you're going with the
known brand competition is a good thing
though so I'm okay with kale entering
the market Corsair has a case 70 which I
recommend pretty regularly in the 113
dollar price range links in the article
if you want links for these keyboards
and then Das Keyboard is one of the
higher or highest quality mechanical
keyboard manufacturers they've been at
it for a while they have their Das
Keyboard Pro at 130 bucks and ducky has
their shine three in the same price
range so you can see that the scale here
is pretty large or it's a pretty wide
spectrum of pricing if we pull it back
to reality 60 to 80 bucks I'd buy the
Poseidon Zi going to 90 bucks heavily
consider the Quickfire and then once
you're above 90 you've got the whole
world open to you in terms of options so
I don't really have any serious
complaints here I really wish it had a
wrist rest I know you can go to a
department store and buy a cheap wrist
rest but it just doesn't work for me I
have concerns with my wrists where I
actually need to get a good keyboard for
that so if you have similar concerns
than perhaps you should evaluate what
your needs are in that regard for most
people I don't think it's relevant it
doesn't have any frills it is completely
no-frills so you're paying for a
keyboard you get a keyboard the
tactility is good I like the feel and
there's a warranty that will hopefully
back it up if something goes wrong given
that these are kale switches which for a
lot of us are untested so those are my
thoughts link in the description below

all this stuff and let me know what you
think I will see you all next time pee</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
