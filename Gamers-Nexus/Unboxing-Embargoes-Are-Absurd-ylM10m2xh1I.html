this is a fluke current clamp so there
you go
thanks for watching I'll see you all
next time unboxing embargoes are a
complete they're a form of
generating more marketing hype and
hanging onto the news cycle as long as
possible it's not even a user experience
to see a media unboxing because as a
user you don't get this stuff when you
buy behind the product and open the box
it's not even a user experience anymore
it's just blatant pandering and trying
to draw hype and keep it as long as
possible
I need to move these before getting to
that this content is brought to you by
the Thermaltake flow RGB closed-loop
liquid cooler which is a 360 millimeter
radiator plus 3 120 fans that are RGB
illuminated if then we'll take it ringg
fans at that this is a 4.5 done a stack
pump which is one of the faster pumps
you can learn more at the link in the
description below at some point this
year it went from a normal news embargo
plus performance embargo cycle to
something a little crazy sometimes it
was news embargo unboxing embargo
performance no actually there was
another one there was unboxing embargo
news embargo something in between like a
guide and then performance embargo what
used to be the case more traditionally
and if you ask some of the writers as an
on video in the industry they'll tell
you the same generally speaking it was
you get the news you can publish the
news but you don't talk about having the
product and can't even say you do and
then you do the performance review later
but now there's all this hype to fill
the gap and generally it's being filled
under the term unboxing embargoes which
aren't necessarily news and it's kind of
ambiguous where you draw the line as to
what constitutes an unboxing so it's
getting kind of just it's too much hype
it's not consumer friendly it's a waste
of your time and more so than even my
time because on your end if we take a 5
to 10 minute unboxing video which we
have not yet made and
we do please kill me but if we take that
and multiply it by fifty to a hundred
thousand views that's a lot of minutes
that will never be returned the people
who once had them so again it's not even
really a consumer experience anymore
because what's happening is with the
advent of unboxing embargoes which stem
from a new era of visual based media
that's more hype focused than
information and data focused what we end
up with is these extravagant media boxes
and gifts and unboxing experiences and
sometimes it goes to the consumer look
at the dre beats for example you end up
paying enormous amounts of money for the
literal box that they come in and
sometimes it doesn't go to the consumer
it just goes to media and makes it look
like this thing is way fancier than it
ever will be so from the aspect of hey
this thing's actually useful I would say
no except for one perhaps one instance
where maybe you're looking at an
unboxing because you're not quite sure
if the thing includes the adapter that
you want or the cable that you want and
hey no one actually talked about it in
the reviews so let's watch an unboxing
that makes sense doing an unboxing
embargo specifically to generate hype
not a fan of it and this isn't calling
out any one company in particular
because there's been a couple of them
that have done it this year
and I'm not sure who started it I would
like it to end but this year it's
basically been more and more pushing the
limit by both the companies and by the
media and we do this to I'll tell you in
a minute to figure out how much can you
on the company side it's how much can
they market the product and stretch out
that launch timeframe as long as
possible to keep hype and interest and
from the media perspective it's how do
we push the limits of what's allowed
under this phrase unboxing embargo which
has been left intentionally vague by the
company to try and do something actually
unique and different get views so
everyone is playing into it but in
different ways for example with the
point of where do you draw the line
where does it stop when we're told
unboxing embargo what we do is take the
product and disassemble it never open it
from the box but hey this is part of my
unboxing process so
it falls under in an unboxing Barga does
it not and then you see other channels
there in PC builds and things like that
and this isn't a beef against them
because I totally agree with their
perspective and what they're doing again
we took it apart
they built a PC where's the line both
are unboxings and neither have
performance numbers I guess ours is more
of a well it's just taking it apart but
it doesn't have a performance metric
attached to it so you don't really get
yelled at for it and this is a lot
different from where it used to be where
you had the news coverage no one knew we
have the product you could probably
guess but you don't show it and then
later you do the performance embargo and
in between that time you have enough
time to test and focus on testing and
benchmarking and reviewing and really
build your content piece to be something
worthwhile now that time is filled with
instead of silence it's filled with
marketing hype and noise and a lot of
that is generated by media and a lot of
it's generated by the company because
everyone's fighting for views to survive
in a pretty fierce industry and if you
start looking at things like logical
fallacies you could pull the slippery
slope one and draw a parallel to the
games industry I used to basically only
cover games before moving over to the
hardware side and on the game side there
was a trend that's now more popular
where you would get these special
embargoes depending on who you were are
you an influencer on YouTube or are you
a reviewer and if you were an influencer
then you would get a special embargo for
some games where you could post Let's
Plays that were non critical to show the
game before launch if you were a
reviewer well then screw you post your
review and it launches like everyone
else so that's kind of where you want to
avoid getting that direction because
ultimately with an unboxing you really
can't be that critical because to be
critical really properly anyway to be
critical requires data you can't just be
an asshole and call it a day so ideally
you have some data to back it up and
just doing an unboxing isn't going to
give you that data and oftentimes we
don't have enough time or even the
drivers to benchmark products to put out
data in
discrete forms so really what you're
looking at is a video where the user or
the creator is not going to be critical
very likely won't be anything that is
critical will probably be pretty
softened and then you open the box you
get the hype you got to see the stuff
that's inside the fancy media kit that
you'll never own and everyone moves on
watch this the next one and the product
launches and everyone's all hyped about
it whether performance well or not is
irrelevant at that point except for the
fact where the hype is the worst thing
in the industry and if it performs
poorly then it comes back at us which is
really crazy because it's media who are
following this unboxing trend so to
generate all the hype if a product that
performs poorly consumers of course feel
misled because they're like wait a
minute but this thing looked awesome
based on of course nothing except for
unboxing videos and not data so it's
this really vicious circle and you point
fingers a few different ways but really
just like no more unboxing embargoes
please so ideally the way it's done I
think is the way it used to be done when
this was more of a a written driven
industry where you had written articles
and Ian Contras over at on and tech had
a great article that was just called
thread Ripper 1950 X we can show you
photos now and he goes through showing
the photos kind of even pushes the
limits a bit with that one and that's a
written cite by showing the thermal
paste circle which we also showed in
video form so even they're just pushing
it a little bit and then at the bottom
he's got a personal note that's actually
really well written about the state of
the industry and the same thing about
how unboxing embargoes are based on a
new form of media which is video that we
obviously play a part in and it's on
that form of media being primarily hype
and driven by marketing and visuals and
not charts and data and all the stuff
that we put out on the channel which
obviously you get less interest for that
so that's that's part of the problem
part of the problem is the demographic
changing part of the problem is the
means of media consumption changing and
those are all things that are pretty
difficult to control and you really
can't so there's no point trying to
control those
but trying to put out good content that
doesn't play into just simply opening a
box showing the product and moving on I
think is part of the solution to the
problem and the problem being an
insurmountable wall of hype for various
products all the way down to cases now
when computer cases have the amount of
hype behind them that some of them do
like the age 500p it's kind of getting
to me like a little bit much it's not
something you don't really saw and it's
fantastic for the companies this is
completely brilliant for the companies
involved with unbox and embargoes they
get free coverage for the most part they
get they don't have to pay for the
advertising and they're getting
advertising and it's the sneakiest
advertising in that it seems sincere and
it's not actually disclosed as an ad
because the creator of course doesn't
see it as an ad and probably didn't
charge for an ad so it's actually just
just to conceal Dada but the creator is
not even making any money for it other
than maybe YouTube Adsense which is not
enough to even eat ramen noodles off of
so that's what you're dealing with with
unboxings so to back it up a little bit
I think I first started thinking about
this with the 1080i was one of the first
ones that used the explicit words
unboxing embargo and then after that
thread ripper played into it quite a lot
actually Rison did as well with thread
Ripert started getting a little crazy
and we voiced that to Andy we voiced it
to multiple other companies that have
done on box and embargoes where
basically you start getting into product
unboxing news embargo installation guide
embargo review embargo a week and a half
later and really why does the
installation guide why does the the news
embargo why does the unboxing why did
those have to be separate things just
all in one or just the news and that's
it and then do the rest later but it
controls the media narrative quite a bit
because everyone's vying for traffic and
it's it's pretty hard to break away from
that you need view is to keep going and
in this industry that's as saturated as
it is it means that it's harder and
harder to get those views from people
who are now your competitor
so from that perspective obviously
you're gonna do as much as you can to
show the new product and talk about it
because that's what's getting interest
in views and drives revenue and growth
and all those things and now from our
perspective I don't think it's not
really the point to talk about our
perspective of this but again if we
don't do unboxings will do a teardown
which we do anyway whether or not
there's an unboxing embargo we always do
tear downs but the reason I'll post them
with an unboxing embargo lift is because
it's unique content it tells you a bit
more we can actually start drawing
conclusions about the product look at
the BRM for instance before even getting
to the performance so you actually start
getting some good information there and
it is pushing the boundaries a little
bit as to what's allowed so as long as
it's not charts and numbers I guess it
seems like it's okay to do again you get
PC builds by other youtubers which is
perfectly fine they're doing the same
thing we are
provide different content to get views
and the reason that these borders are
pushed PC builds PCB analysis that we do
tear downs and various other things you
can do with the product and an unboxing
the reason all that happens is because
what the hell do you do with a literal
unboxing you basically open it up and
you show it and maybe you can do an
overview and say like it's got a dial
and it has ten different settings and
you can zero it out that's kind of
getting useful but still without any
kind of actual user information how the
product behaves it's ultimately not that
useful unless someone has already
purchased it in which case it is after
the unboxing embargo left and after the
performance embargo has lifted so really
they might as well just defer to the
performance review which is gonna have
numbers and information on how to use
the product in that specific scenario so
I think that's it I don't know that I
have a lot else to say I'd like to I'd
like to think that this will have some
kind of ripple but it probably won't
either way I got to rant about it so
yeah thanks for watching
we do not do unboxings as you all know
and it's not gonna happen anytime soon
and if a company tells me you can't do a
teardown either then I'll say okay well
we're just not gonna post anything and
hold us wait for the review date to lift
because unboxings are stupid that's my
opinion of it so now you're watching you
