episode where we try and answer your
questions this episode I'm saying this
more and more and it's because more of
you are watching and getting engaged but
we did have a lot of really good
questions and once again not going to
get to all of them so if I missed yours
please post question below in the
comment section and we'll get to it for
next episode hopefully but before we get
into the content this time it is brought
to you by this case this is the antec
cube case we saw it at PAX we haven't
seen it since then but it's finally
starting to ship so at least three
viewers so we've got one in now I'll be
testing it soon and doing thermals and
things like that the thermals are really
interesting to me for this case because
it has a up the the video card faces up
so it's sort of an inverted ATX layout
and that means that the video cards up
here against this acrylic window so you
can see the face plate through the top
of the case but of course that poses an
interesting thermal challenge and we
talked about that with the iWeb power
revolt to wear that case kind of worked
it out because it was an enforced liquid
cooler for the unit that at least we had
and that works pretty well in this type
of environment I'm curious to see if a
blower fan verse is the sort of axial
fan axial first radial fans will
actually make a difference in
performance so this is a good test case
for that because with the normal push
fan set up with like a twin froze or acx
cooler you might actually be kind of
restricted for air but with a blower fan
it might work out okay because it's an
IT Xbox so that's the sponsor I am very
very curious to actually test it and see
how it performs thermally but visually
there it is so you can see it so that is
the case but let's get to the questions
first question is from beam polaris who
says i'm looking at a monitor that has a
game mode looking at the manual it says
this quote turns off the frame buffer to
reduce input lag I didn't even know that
monitors had frame buffers and can't
find any information online about
monitor frame buffers and what the
disadvantages of disabling it are can
you help me em eh can you help me yeah
so this is an area I don't know a whole
huge amount about but I did some
research so I think I
at least distill the basics and then
perhaps this is something we can
research in the future but from what I
understand from what I've researched
based on this question what's going on
with gamemode really depends on the
monitor you have I know asus has one
because we have a shoes displays and I
checked and I know Samsung has their own
game mode and they both do it a little
bit differently so your mileage may vary
the basic idea with all of these
monitors for the most part when they
have a game mode is that is basically
your monitor does some not it's sort of
like post-processing where it's
calculating color calculating noise or
gain to clean up the image it's
basically working on color accuracy
image processing things like this so the
monitor does have to actually perform
some calculations when it receives a
frame from the video card and get it
prepared for the user and some of that
is why when you look at one monitor to
the next or even just switch between
modes you know monitors have modes not
just color and brightness or i should
say brightness and contrast but they've
color as well and that takes processing
so what's going on here with game mode
from the two asus and samsung displays
that i researched and looked at is
they're turning a lot of that off so if
you go to game mode it will turn off
things like the it already do you get
reduced color accuracy you might get
reduced or completely disabled noise
reduction so that could produce a
slightly grainy ur image where noise is
generally what's referred used to refer
to as sort of like dots and specs or
imperfections in your your frame and
image output and you'll see that in
camera for example if you turn up I so I
so you'll get a grain your image as you
increase and that's kind of noise so
noisy reductions turned off or disabled
or minimize with the game mode and this
reduces the input latency issues you get
a faster pipeline if you're super hyper
competitive than or if you have a
display that's just doing too much
processing or
slow processing you can help reduce some
of that latency by using game mode but
you sacrifice some of the color accuracy
and some of the noise reduction and
other functions that may be going on
with an image processing on the display
so that reduces your input lag take the
good with the bad I guess depends on how
serious you are about that or how bad
your monitor is out of the box now as
for other brands like as I said they
seem to all sort of have a slightly
different definition of what their game
mode does so this doesn't speak for
everyone but I think that gives you a
basic idea of what they all kind of
intend to do with the with the
technology with the modes in the display
hopefully I answer that question though
next question is from ulam's 5 she says
hi Steve why doesn't AMD you have
something similar to nvidia GPU boost
yet it seems like an intuitive feature
to implement and n videos already on gen
3 is it actually hardware enabled
feature so gen 3 or not it's it's a
proprietary technology so I don't know
that generation really matters it's it
is their third iteration of GP be his
friend video and he does have a boost
technology though it's just not talk
about quite as much because i think it's
not fully understood polaris was kind of
where a lot of this was introduced and i
did talk about how AM DS boost function
works in our original launch day our X
480 review and that's got a whole the
whole page one is architecture on
Polaris you should read that if you
really want to understand more about
polaris and boost is discussed in there
but one of the things that Andy does
especially with Polaris and with the wat
man you to utility you can see different
states so if you've played around with
wat manner you saw our overclocking
guide you'll see that there are seven I
think seven different bars I've thought
my head and so you've got seven bars and
they kind of very clock rate and and
voltage based on the DPM state so that's
what that's called as DPM States dynamic
power management basically so you've got
these seven states
and the lowest state just like sleep
states on Windows you have things like
s0s0 IX with Intel or corrective idol
type of thing s1 s3 s4 s3 and s4 the
most common s3 asleep as force hibernate
this is basic window stuff that I'm
talking about right now but similar to
that idea you have these different power
states that are defined in Andy's
hardware as DPM states and lower state a
lower number is a less less active or
less clock intensive state so if we are
on the desktop and you haven't forced
through wat man a clock rate which is
constantly high and you're running just
kind of stock settings and you're on the
desktop doing nothing the DPM state will
be at its lowest we'll probably the
first state and that is going to be the
lowest clock rate and therefore the
lowest voltage you don't need that much
voltage to sustain a low clock rate of a
couple hundred megahertz so this is part
of the power saving approach that amd's
taken with Polaris if you're not going
to use twelve hundred megahertz of clock
then why push it is the idea and it's
really it's not a new concept but the
way Polaris has implemented it is new in
terms of these specifically at the wap
an utility which is brand-new this year
so that's what AMD does and there's some
interesting points as I spoke out with
Raja Kaduri the RTG Radeon technologies
group chief architect in one of our two
videos and one of those is as game
developers begin to sort of better
program their devices to work with these
low-level API is one thing you could do
in theory anyway is aside from like the
regular C reservation things like that
if you're a game developer you could say
hey i know this event is coming in the
game the example roger used was an
explosion so let's say we know an
explosion is coming because the game
knows before the video card does the
engine figures all of that out and we
know that this explosion will trigger
some intense amount of load on the GPU
you start saturating physics processing
you're saturating all these other types
of
also same with any kind of explosion
think just cause 3 or something so if we
know that's coming as a game developer
we can go in there and work with amd's
hardware in this specific use case and
basically and it works with NVIDIA as
well but we're talking about AMD right
now and basically say okay so up until
this point we don't need to be fully
engaged in the clock so we can run a DPM
state 6 or something like that up until
this point maybe maybe 1260 megahertz
1240 megahertz is enough and so we
operated that sort of lower sustained
clock rate for the majority of the time
you don't get quite as high a frame rate
but it leaves Headroom for when you need
it and so what that does is you run at
an acceptable frame rate in a DPM six or
five and then you hit that explosion the
game tells the GPU hey this big events
coming up time to get ready GPU can
boost up to the seventh state that BTW
p.m. 7 or whatever it needs get a couple
extra mega hertz or more out of the
clock and help compensate for that
heavier load so you can keep your frame
rate throughout the processing
whatever's going on in the scene so
that's an these solution DPM does work
without direct developer involvement
that is just the best example that's
that's the example of where it would
work the best is when you have an engine
and a game working with the hardware to
say this is how we need to work together
to keep the clock throttles not really
the right word but dialed back if not
necessary and then amp it up when it's
necessary rather than run at full bore
the whole time and not have any room
when you need it to sustain the the
fluid frame rate that a player would
expect so that's theirs you can read
more about DPM states in our article I
think I may have talked about it in the
overclocking article as well but
definitely the RX 480 review with
Polaris I talked about that at least a
little bit with wat man maybe on page
six but the only on page one so
hopefully that answers the basics they
do have boost as the short answer it's
just not the same implementation as
Nvidia's version of boost next question
is from
hey so now Nintendo is going to take
this video down by the question hey
Steve I saw a pretty cool mod here on
this overclocker net forum post and it
gives a link the modder here bought an
aluminum heatsink and after applying a
thermal pad the heatsink and attaching
it to the back plate of his nvidia titan
he read a difference of about twenty see
after applying the heatsink for less
than thirty dollars my question to you
could you validate this testing and see
if cooling benefits are unique to him
alone or if someone like me could reap
the same cooling benefits I would
appreciate any information greatly if
you could do this I'm not gonna promise
that we're gonna go slap a and aluminum
block onto a video card right now but I
can tell you just from experience how it
works so what you've got here two things
to note 1 yeah putting a block of
aluminum on the back of a card with
thermal pads if you don't already have
something there will probably improve
the temperature at least a little bit if
not a lot you're definitely gonna be
pulling temperature off of the PCB more
efficiently and hopefully you've got
some form of dissipation in the form of
intake from the case to blow that heat
off of the aluminum fins that you've
slapped onto the back of the video card
so that's that's the hope so yes in
theory will reduce temperature now one
thing I didn't read the whole thread
that was linked but I did look briefly
through it and the user is using a I
believe it was either an IR camera or a
thermal imaging device either way IR
cameras you've there a couple flaws and
one of them emissivity of whatever
you're pointing to that like aluminum
being pretty shiny and the second point
is because of the way a large heat sink
on a large area that puts or let's
rephrase a large heat sink on a small
area of high heat like a large aluminum
heatsink on the back of a card where
your area of high heat would be the
backside of the chokes probably maybe
the backside of the MOSFETs that's your
area of high heat that's now being
pulled up
being sunk by the heatsink and that's
going to spread out your heat so will
definitely improve temperature at least
a little bit but it might look a whole
lot better in thermal imaging that it is
in reality that's why we're sort of
retesting and doing extra testing on the
EVGA cards that are under question right
now for prm's and that's I just finished
putting thermal probes on the thing the
idea is we're going to be moving the
thermal probes because then we can
direct read temperatures of individual
components rather than sort of an
aggregate temperature using a thermal
imaging device looking at the back of a
bit of a back plate or looking at the
back of a thermal pad where you have
some level of insulation because you can
actually see the device that's creating
the heat anymore you can only see the
device on top of it so that does create
that sort of obfuscates the performance
so at the point of saying all of this is
that yes the performance will almost
certainly improve but reading with just
that one device is going to make it look
probably better than it is in reality
that's not to say that it's wrong to do
so especially if you're an enthusiast
and you're just you're not in it for
making content or something it's just to
say that don't expect necessarily if you
took a thermocouple to it that you would
see the same gains so I believe the
gains here 20c is what what the question
says 20 see improvement but uh it's it's
a bad project for thirty bucks though
we've done stuff like that with arctic
cooling and they make some good kits if
you want to do any conversions on your
cards they do have back plates that are
aluminum back plates that you stick to
the back of a car things like that so
that's kind of a fun mod to do if you
ever bored on a Saturday day within as
far as if it improves your performance
you'll get a bigger gain for putting
liquid on the GPU but it's not bad to
cool down the VRMs or the PCB anyway
next question Jason Smith says hey Steve
when you start your zen and benchmarks
will you include the 2600 k for
comparison I believe it is the most
venerated i7 if not the most popular and
/
the most logical place for a quote
common user to start considering an
upgrade to be worth the investment
regardless of workload I agree with you
that the Sandy Bridge series is really
popular so I spoke to Patrick stone who
has worked with me for a number of years
now on the site on and off and he does
personally have a 2500 k so I am
planning to add the 2500 k to the bench
that'll be our sandy bridge I don't have
a 2600 k and i don't know that i have
direct access to one anymore but i'll
look I do want to include it but
minimally I do have a 3570k we're going
to have the whole i-5 sweet covered
almost for sure I have access to 2500 ki
have a 3570k personally in one of our
case benches that is soon being retired
and I know we've got the i7 920 or 930
whatever that in a Hail mcp us i'll
include that hopefully as well if time
permits but definitely the most recent
sort of Sandy Bridge onward for i5 or i7
s I've got the 4000 series stuff I will
try to get a sandy bridge 2600 k I can't
promise anything but we'll see the maybe
buying a used one might be worth it i
don't know it depends how much they cost
about wanted to buy an old system from
someone but yeah it's it's a good item
test and i will be doing as much as i
can on the ham the sandy bridge onward
next question don de Silva says steve is
it fair to say that older core
architectures like sandy bridge Ivy
Bridge and the hay lam speaking of have
run their useful course I've seen
several videos elsewhere that suggests
these CPUs i7 920 2500 ke DC are still
capable of gaming at 1080p in a variety
of triple-a titles as someone
considering an upgrade to a 47 IDK so i
can read as my ddr3 ram is it better to
hold out until the next generation of
cds or act now that is the ever-burning
question from everyone should i wait or
should i buy now generally when things
are multiple months out I do kind of
lean towards by now because you can
always wait there's when when Zen
and kb lake launched immediately we're
going to start talking about the next
product so you can always wait but of
course when something's like one month
away it does kind of make sense to wait
and see what happens now the question
here is unique because you're talking
about reusing ddr3 and these newer
platforms have all moved to four so that
is a very valid thing to want and
actually when I bought parts for a new
system build three plays mine which I
never ended up building but their
inboxes still but when I did buy parts
my plan was I'm going to take a 4770k
that's been retired and stick it into a
z97 motherboard and use ddr3 and the
reason I decided that was because I knew
one I had a 4770k but also that with
memory I've got a lot of ddr3 like many
of you I'm sure that I can still use
still perfectly fine memory and
sometimes in higher capacities and
always you get for with DVR for
dependent costs and also because the
gains from something like a 4000 series
I 7 and the current gen and impending
Jen I sevens are not massive a 47 90k to
a 6700 k pretty small jump and I think
we benchmarked at ages ago at this point
but it's a couple percentage points
depending on what you're testing games
for sure though now we're going to
cabling I can't say for sure I'll be
able to say eventually but I don't have
them yet so we will be testing 4790 case
against the 7000 series kb lake cpus by
sevens but i can't definitively say what
the performance gap would be it'll be
certainly larger than a 47 IDK to a 6700
but the 47 90 k is still damn good and
if you can lower your costs by buying
one of those four in the 200s dollar
range rather than the 300s and you can
reuse ddr3 RAM that's a good amount of
money or taking off the cost and if you
put that into a video card you're going
to be bigger gains there then from joint
a kb league so one hundred and fifty
dollar price different
videocards that could be a gtx 1070 or
something like that from something like
a 1060 or a 480 and that is significant
enough I would absolutely recommend that
route if you're trying to save money now
then we don't know what it's going to
cost or how it's going to perform so I
can't really comment on that but if
you're if you're personally looking at
should I get a 40 790 k or k be like I
do the 47 90 k if you're trying to buy
sooner because you'll have a system kind
of today and save some money but I'm
sure they're plenty of opinions off hat
you can discuss below hopefully in a
civilized manner last question exiled
storm says does the cat use the same
shampoo as you snowflake has her own uh
just sort of saliva based shampoo I'm
not really sure that I want to use that
myself or maybe I do that's Chris hey
