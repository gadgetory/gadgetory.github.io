thermal paste so we are doing thermal
compound application methods on thread
Ripper using the 1950's specifically the
video will show you using a piece of
plexiglass how the throne page spreads
when we depress it on to the IHS and
then we're going to look at how it
spreads once a cold plate is applied to
it through actual mounting force as
normally and finally the end of the
video we're going to look through the
results which one's perform better if
there's any appreciable difference at
all and this was partly inspired by an
older video of dear bowers so we're
borrowing his methodology with one of
these which it's not perfect you're not
using the same force to mount this thing
as you would a cooler but that's why
we're expanding on it by also mounting a
cooler and we'll show you before and
after before getting to those that this
coverage is brought to you by e BGA and
they're 1080p is C 2 which we've
recommended fairly highly for its build
quality and the icx sensors which are
kind of fun to play with you can check
our full FC 2 review for the 1080i if
you're curious to learn more or you can
click the link in the description below
to find the product page for the 1080i
SC 2 and because AMD gave some outlets
permission to go ahead and post thermal
results already we figured it'd be ok if
we went ahead and posted some of ours
for some of that matters quite a lot for
you as a DIY builder which is thermal
paste application so we're looking
through that thread Ripper is
interesting because of its dye layout
and this is something we showed in our
initial video where we show the location
of the dyes and how distant they are
from the center so it's not like what
you'd normally expect with a traditional
heat spreader and dye where it's right
in the center of the thing ok so here's
what we're going to go with I have 6
methods here that I've drawn on the
paper and the first one number one is
actually what AMD is recommending for
their application so they're showing 5
kind of small to medium sized dots in
the corners so you hit the dies here and
remember only two dyes are active so you
might have these two or these two the
other two are silicon substrate
interposers that are just spacers the
next is a modified version of what we've
been using which is just basically Road
lines across the dyes and then what
actually doing as this right now but
that may change after these results so
we're doing like a dotted road basically
this is your traditional dot and X and
then just ham spreading it by hand
across the whole thing and just as a
reminder here is the chip that we for
the IHS that we drew on with dry erase
marker as a reminders and some people
thumb that's highly offensive uh-huh
so the IHS be drawn shows you the dye
location you've got two of these active
and to inactive we don't know which ones
and that's what we want to cover so our
objective is to cover this if we
flashback to the footage of the default
A's attack thermal paste we already know
how that applies and it only really
covers I maybe like half of the dye area
the cold plate covers the whole thing it
barely covers these outer edges but the
thermal paste did not so we're going to
look into that with this video let's go
ahead and start this off as you can see
with this drawn on one we have the
Plexiglas one or whatever it is
polycarbonate whatever matching up
pretty much dead on so we use this to
push down and let's actually just start
with method number four which is the
traditional dot in the middle method and
I'm just going to go ahead and put a
check mark here so we're doing the
Plexiglas one first so here is what
we're looking at and this first one I'm
going to do a big dot right there on the
Z which is dead ten of everything this
is a pretty traditional way to apply it
their own pace so it's reasonable to
expect people would continue doing this
if they don't know what's underneath the
IHS we're going to go a bit bigger than
normally and normally you might stop
somewhere around there if you're working
with a smaller intel chip or something
we're going to just do a glorified
version of that I mean that's still
pretty good amount of thermal paste
let's do a little bit more okay so a
giant died right in the middle or a blob
rather not die and size this drawing on
yeah okay so here we go just kind of
line it up
and
not getting much here and as you forced
more pressure of course it will spread a
bit more which will see that once we
start applying the cold plate with the
socket correctly with the screws but
that's what we're getting right now it's
just can't spread out much more than
that
so I think that's pretty much where we
stand
so that's what the blob gets you now if
we look at the dyes not covering a whole
lot here we got about half of each of
them that's going to be suboptimal
transfer you might be fine
you know if the cold plates still
touching these outer areas you're still
pulling heat off of them but this isn't
about being fine it's about what's the
most efficient that's what we're looking
at you today may be the case that it's
totally irrelevant we'll find out in the
results section now to clean this off
next one we're going to do is the let's
go with the AMD recommended method so
they're doing a dot right around here in
the middle and let's also assume that
they're putting the others in the middle
of the dye location so this is going to
be between the e and the N that's also
pretty good size
those are all pretty I think we may have
done a bit more here than the Andy
doesn't there their media recommended
version but I think we might need more
try not to apply too much torsional
force here so something like that it's
what we end up with which if you did a
bit bigger dots you'd actually you would
cover all the dyes so that might not be
a bad method bigger dots than we did but
overall not bad we'll test it and see
how it does let's move on next one let's
do the line method not the one we've
been using but one pretty close to it do
a line from the a to the N T to the R
and this is not what are we doing that
in the middle of these or what kind of
the bottom of the a kind of the middle
of the T okay and these are are going to
stick out from under the cold plate sort
of they'll they'll definitely bleed out
from under the cold blade of a nice deck
cooler okay here we go
the real test is going to once we get
the cooler down here
all right so by hand that's pretty good
that's about where it's about as far as
we're going to get so that one looks
good the best looking so far we've
covered all the dyes we're not doing
full i HS contact if you're mounting a
smaller cooler to it anyway it doesn't
matter but that's what that's what we're
looking at with this one which actually
this makes it kind of look like the next
method is not going to matter okay next
one I'm out of paste I think on the
first team it's all the same pace though
so next one let's do the same thing just
with the dots in the middle which really
almost feels pointless but
pretty much the same spreads out a
little farther on the sides but the two
lines for the road does just as well as
the dots in the middle two more methods
to do with this one let's do an X all
right X how's it go see I should have
figured that out sooner make city makes
it easier for the camera to see what's
going on when I push more force onto it
right okay it's not great it could work
if you use more compound than I did but
as you can see over here you don't have
full coverage pretty good everywhere
else honestly so basically the lesson is
just make sure you're at the right
height it's the starting point so you
could bypass that by just doing a dot in
the middle of the R and a dot in the
middle of the end to make sure you cover
everything but not bad overall okay so a
bit much on the throne face yeah kind of
unavoidable I guess I'm up here to
probably do one of the football things
but yes that's a quick look at it we're
going to do something more proper now
with an actual CLC apply that to it wait
okay that hands okay apply an actual TLC
to it with real proper mounting pressure
that's more even across the even across
the die area and across the IHS then
we'll get into testing see how it goes
with last compound to use for that one
spreading method but so far what we've
learned is the X method looks okay so
active looking okay right here and then
let's do a note good
this one was okay this one not so good
and this one is like excessive these are
my notes for later compared to number
two
so that's what we're going to test let's
do the cold plate stuff and then move on
to testing so you finished applying all
the thermal paste we did a couple
different variants so there's one
variation of the blob with method where
basically did a small and a large
and then a slightly larger large blob
because those are yielding interesting
results so we did those instead of the
full-coverage then I'll paste spread
basically remove that one from the
equation and honestly I think that one
will make more sense with something like
the nock to a full coverage plates
anyway because right now if you manually
apply their own plates to cover the
entire IHS with one of these days attack
coolers you're not going to use a lot of
the compound that's on there anyway so
it just kind of sits there and not sure
whether it helps or hurts but we had
other things to test so act to that one
but had plenty of other cool ones to
work with and we've got photos comparing
the different application methods after
the cooler was removed to here's how it
ended up looking in the photos these
images show the application after the
cooler was torqued down fully run
through our burnin testing and then
removed this has a huge your mileage may
vary element to it so don't take any of
these as hard fact it will always be
this way take them as this is how it
would be if you applied it the way we
did it will obviously change with these
application because you're just going to
either use slightly less or slightly
more thermal paste each time you apply
thermal compound including variation on
where that paste is actually placed on
my HS the plexiglass test was a nice
idea but once we actually applied real
mounting force to the thermal paste
application it was clear just how much
more spread you get from that retention
kit it pushes down a whole lot harder
than you'd be able to do by hand so once
in a real-world application the
Plexiglas method doesn't really remain
all that representative of what we're
doing but it's a nice idea for on-camera
demonstration of how the compound
spreads outward and that's about it it's
good for seeing the process of spreading
but not good for seeing the final full
spread which is what these photos show
only a few applications show notably
different spread patterns between each
of the application methods and we can
get into testing those next some basic
on testing we use the same mounting
force each time the retention kit is
pretty easy to work with
torque drivers and things like that also
make it easier so same mounting force
same
cooller same thermal compound for all
the tests from the same batch not that
that's too relevant at that level it's
not going to be visible and with our
resolution anyway max speeds on the
crack next sixty two and then the
voltages we fixed the stock test to 1.2
volts so it's a little bit on the high
side compared to out of box stock
voltages but it's stable and it doesn't
change at one point - it just kind of
sits there which is what you want
because voltage changes the power
increases or decreases and you have
variant we fixed it to one point three
six two five for the overclock with a
forty multiplier and then for logging
had current log in via clamp at the EPS
twelve volt voltage monitoring and of
the CPU that is and then ambient all of
which were aligned ii ii and
spreadsheets and then we could check for
consistency errors or things like that
in there as I understand it threaded fur
has 36 sensors in it so these things
they well they have a lot more sensors
than that but they have 36 relevant
sensors to us and those are placed all
over the dies and inside the IHS I did
ask about this at the am the event if
they could give some examples of where
they're placed within the IHS and didn't
really get any concrete examples just
more of a well there's a lot of them so
they're pretty much everywhere and
that's fair so the sensors in here are
averaged depending on how you what
software you use and how it works with
it and if it even recognizes a stripper
with hardware info 64 which is
definitely the best one right now it
creates a TDI readout and TDI is a
collection of all those sensors averaged
so I wish we could see them regularly
because then you could if you knew where
they were you can tell how the coverage
is in contact is for each specific dye
but but this is good enough so that's
what we're using we are also using
prime95 28.5 29.2 had some issues we
like to do 29.2 with 8k sizes for the
fft but it just it there's some issue
right now with either thread ripper or
prime we're not really sure what so we
just use 28.5 because it works
and the clocks didn't change that well
at all really there's power cycling and
prime so we account for that in the data
and the spreadsheets and an average it
all out as necessary and get rid of any
of the data that looks bad
so we enroll into it now pretty
straightforward though assuming your
ultimate goal is just to cover the whole
IHS it seems that application method
doesn't too much matter as long as a
sufficient amount of compound is located
centrally our small blob tests for
calling it uses a sparing amount of
combat and the least out of all of these
will show that on the screen now if you
want to see how much it was and that
managed to perform similarly to the ACE
attack pre application and the double
line pattern which performed a bit worse
than expected honestly the double line
seemed like to do it better our our X
pattern gave us the most overall
coverage once we corrected the lines to
better intersect the dies and ended up
covering the entire cold plate of the X
62 this gave us a measurable and
repeatable difference of about two to
three Salty's improvement depending on
which numbers you're comparing this is
pretty damn close to our error margins
so it skates by just barely so more
we're really close to being equal here
it's not enough to be a revelation the
only real reason the X pattern is
performing well is because we've covered
more of the cold plate though there's a
limitation to the efficacy of a spread
as you start bumping into the seal
boundaries toward the screws in the
plate outward in the outer edges of the
coolers there's a seal and you're really
not contacting anywhere there's micro
fins or even liquid anymore and the very
least we're preventing air pocket hot
spots from forming in those screw holes
which do sit right over parts of the
dies so that's always a good thing
following and these application method
recommended we ended up closer to 44 C
not that distant from the other tests
and also within error margins for some
of its neighbors or most of them even it
could be better
AMD's recommended application method
actually is just fine as a method but it
leaves a whole lot of room for the user
to play and that's not a silly a good
thing there's no reason that the five
dots method recommended wouldn't work
just as well as the others it's just a
matter of how much pace you apply with
larger dots assuming it's not excessive
we should more or less match the
performance of all the other application
methods nearby we followed a indies
guide as best we could but there's room
for bigger dots as always and ultimately
were just
here in a video anyways they're hard to
get depth there but figured odds would
make it just fine the most interesting
test was the heavy blob method we did
two applications of this one with the
first using a significant amount of
compound dead-center of the z in the
word risin the second test used about
maybe 25 or 30% less compound and still
managed to a 39.6 Celsius delta T over
ambient average performance figure the
larger version of this blob operated at
around 35 Celsius delta T over ambient a
significant performance uplift over some
of our other test patterns like the v
dot pattern with the smaller dots and
even the A's attack pattern which is the
silkscreen applied one again we think
that this is just a matter of relying on
the coolers own mounting pressure to
spread the compound out evenly across
the IHS rather than trying to manually
spread the coverage the downside is that
you're sort of guessing out how much you
need to cover everything because it's
all being applied under the hood when
you're tightening things down that's the
only real disadvantage to the blob
method it's easier to gauge coverage
with an X for example or the parallel
line and these recommended v dot method
is also good for this but we just have
to use enough to make sure there's full
spread outward with any of them and
we'll be fine what's not shown here is
tired tests without thermal paste which
resulted in clock throttling as you
might expect a very unhappy thread read
for cpu but we were just curious as for
overclocking results while we didn't
have a good enough cooling solution to
find a difference the CPU is pushing 21
to 26 amps down the EPF 12 volt cables
at this point around 262 326 watts with
that overclock and so was running hotter
than our Kraken X 62 could reasonably
handle it at stock state it could handle
it it wasn't throttling at all actually
but its bottleneck so to speak enough by
being the weaker link than the thermal
paste so we're not going to get a
picture of how much they'll face impacts
things without a better cooler
we need a heavier duty cooler to get the
thermal down to a point where that their
own phase difference is visible if
you're wondering why this chart doesn't
have every single method we used in the
other one it's because it was pretty
apparent what was happening by this
instance and testing no point in trying
more methods when our cooler is clearly
the limiter there's no perfect method
the only real conclusion here
that covering the whole plate or at
least most of the plate is going to help
out a bit but as far as which method to
do it it comes down to how confident are
you in the coverage of each application
if you feel better about the X because
that's what you use and you feel like
you can gauge that its coverage and make
sure it'll cover the relevant dyes then
go with it but if you feel better about
the blob just use a whole lot of thermal
paste dead center it'll spread out and
be pretty good it's just a matter again
of how much compound you use there's no
reason the X method or the dual lines
method or AMD's recommended five dots
method wouldn't be just as good as any
of the other ones it's just you have to
use a lot of compound so personally
speaking my experience generally is with
that blob method I know how much to use
to spread it across the whole IHS with
all the older CPUs so you just up scaly
here and that worked out if I had used
more compound with any of the other ones
you'd probably see pretty similar for
Florence but it just comes down to what
you're used to so relying on the cooler
to spread things out is it seems pretty
good it's a lot of force you just put a
big amount right in the middle and it
will squish all the excess outward and
cover the whole thing including the rest
of the cold plate that isn't covered by
the stock pay it's on the easytek
coolers so we're looking at next is
where it really gets interesting with
the full coverage cold plates we don't
have any of those yet but if you have
something like the Noctua cooler with
the full coverage plate or the EK water
blocks one coming out soon those
instances might be one where it makes
sense to manually spread the compound
over the hawaii HS because you actually
have a plate that can contact the
reported IHS whereas one we're using
right now only contacts the center so if
you cover the whole thing you just end
up with a lot of compound on the corners
that never touches any cold plate never
touches any copper at all but that's
what we're looking at so overall not a
huge difference in performance for a lot
of these it just comes all that the
conclusion here is not blob is better
know what it is it's more they're all
taste is better within reason so if you
can cover the whole thing then it looks
like that'll be best for performance
so one thing I'm not a hundred percent
sure about but I'm kind of I suppose we
could hypothesize about is that the
holes the countersunk holes in the cold
place being that they are deeper into
the plate than the actual cold plate
could be producing hot spots of air when
the things heating up because they do
actually sit right over the dies so that
might be why we're seeing performance
uplift in the scenarios where there's
full spread over those holes as well but
that's it for this time as always
