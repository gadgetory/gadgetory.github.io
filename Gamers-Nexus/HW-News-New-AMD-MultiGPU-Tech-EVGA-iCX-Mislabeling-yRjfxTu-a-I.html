hardware news recap this week we're
talking about EVGA is icx to reddit
thread that was going on XT SMC
employees being charged with a breach of
trust after IP theft and also some news
on 14 nanometer and Intel's present
shortage of 40 nanometer oh and one more
thing
GTX 2060 theories are looking to gain
some momentum here before that this
video is brought to you by Thermal
Grizzlies high-end thermal paste and
liquid metal thermal Grizzlies cryo knot
is an affordable high quality thermal
compound that doesn't face some of the
aging limitations of other pastes on the
market cryo knot has a thermal
conductivity of 12.5 watts per meter
Kelvin focuses on endurance is easy to
spread and isn't electrically conductive
making it safe to use on GPU dies
thermal grizzly also makes conductor not
liquid metal which we've used to drop 20
degrees off some temperatures than our
dee-lighted tests by a tube at the link
in the description below quick note as
always on the GN merge stuff first the
mod mats the next round of them are
shipping to us this week shipping to us
so then we'll ship them out to you so if
you want to place an order make sure you
get one this round go to store documents
nexus dotnet you can backorder the mod
mat we've shipped a lot of them so far
but this next round is coming in this
week so we'll be sending that out as
soon as it's in otherwise we have other
store merch like always and we'll be
restocking these beer glasses pretty
soon so for the first news item we have
EVGA icx to discussion this blew up on
reddit in the past week this news item
has to do with EVGA finding themselves
in a bit of a kerfuffle lately this is
from a reddit thread that was sent to us
by several of you actually so here's
what's going on this is my best recap of
it it's a long story there are a lot of
emails involved a long reddit thread as
well but the gist of it is that when
EVGA posted their r-tx series pre-orders
live the initial pre-ordering page for
the cards that went up which are not
full icx to technology cards but do have
icx cool and that pre-order page said
incorrectly that those cards had the
thermal sensors and had power monitoring
and the user placed the user who made
this reddit thread anyway placed a
pre-order for the card found out
actually doesn't
these sensors and email than EVGA
obviously to complain about this and
figure out a solution so that's the the
top level now kelvins need to be defined
here first of all EVGA and their icx
branding it gets a bit confusing so EVGA
has had a table on the front page of
their site since these pre-orders went
up and it's been clarified since but
originally that table said the chart
said I see x2 for the top end cards that
would be the ones that they now call I
see x2 technology I see X 2 and the
other card said dual fans and what those
two things mean originally I see X 2
meant it has these sensors it has power
monitoring sensors it has all the
cooling solution and duel fans meant
that it has just the icx cooler but none
of the sensors and none of the power
monitoring now they've clarified it so
now it says I see X 2 technology which
means sensors and power monitoring and I
see X 2 cooling which means just the
cooler so it's a bit confusing to be
fair to all the customers out there EVD
a to be fair to them has tried to
clarify this but just to make sure
everyone's really clear on this
when EVGA uses the phrase icx technology
they're talking about the nine
thermistors the NTC thermistors that are
on the PCB that measure the thermal
performance of the items near those
thermistors and when they say you icx
cooling it still has the fans it still
has the pin fins it has the thermal pads
on the backplate it has the asynchronous
fans it has the hydrodynamic bearing and
the fans so the cooler is entirely the
same it just doesn't have the sensors
which means that those cards when they
went up for pre-order are pretty close
to icx as it was presented which is with
the thermal sensors except without the
sensors in the original publication so
that was the confusion that went on and
EVGA has corrected the page now they've
removed all references of the thermal
sensors and they removed references of
the power monitoring on those specific
cards they also offered the customer
either a full refund for the product
since they had pre-ordered something
they thought was out but wasn't yet and
as an alternative to that step up so it
was a paid step up
the customer would pay the difference
they would be first in line to get the
new card with IC X and the IC x2
technology cards that is the ones with
the thermal sensors ship about seven to
twelve days later because they come out
later because they're built later so
that was the compromise offered the
customer did have a response to that and
here's what they said EVGA offered EVGA
said we can offer you a cancellation or
refund for your XC card and reserve an
IC x2 card of your choice to purchase
when they are available for sale we
would not waive the difference in the
price between the items and the
pre-order on an IC x2 card at current
expectation you would likely be waiting
7 to 14 business days longer for an IC
x2 card then if you kept the pre-order
this is the best estimation I can give
you at the time
either way you would be first in line
for the model of your choice q in mind
however that the dates may change the
dates would apply to everyone waiting
for these cards not just you if so I
will update you accordingly and a
customer replied and said well they
posted on Reddit at this point and said
so yes make the customer compromise
because of your mistakes while EVGA
literally takes your responsibility
obviously waiting even longer for a card
for my new build while shelling out more
cash do to them misrepresenting their
products didn't fly with me and I've
canceled my pre-order so I can see it
from both sides at this point it was a
misrepresentation EVGA was incorrect and
saying that the card had thermal sensors
when it did not they've corrected that
probably a bad move but at least they've
corrected it and now it's just a
question of is EVGA going to email the
customers who did place pre-orders does
that seem necessary we asked about it
EVGA still figuring this out internally
and and you may get an email with some
clarification on what is an IC x2 card
which even in that email back to the
customer was pretty confusing because
they said an upgrade to an IC x2 card
even though the existing XC cards have
icx coolers so I know it doesn't seem a
hundred percent clear of EVGA even knows
what's icx and isn't but they have
charts on the page now so if you were
confused it should be pretty clear and
if you pre-ordered they might send you a
clarification email will see on the
customer end I have to say I think it's
the EVGA solution of full refund and
cancel or pay the difference and get it
first is reasonable because if you walk
into a store and a product is labeled
with Ron price or something you bring it
register and they catch a throne price
they don't have to legally sell that to
you at that price as is commonly thought
so I can see it from both sides
EB J definitely under on initially but I
don't think they need to give out a free
upgrade just because of that I think the
offer was was reasonable but we'll see
we'll see what EVGA does if any of you
get one of those emails forwarded along
we can talk about it next week
moving on to the next item there's an XT
SMC employee who has charged with a
breach of trust regarding IP theft and
this now former GS MC employee simply
referred to as Chow has been indicted on
breach of trust for stealing
confidential documents pertaining to TSM
C's 16 nanometer and 10 nanometer
process technologies as reported by
digit times comm cha was allegedly
planning to begin working at Shanghai
Holly micro electronics HL MC where he
planned to take the trade secrets with
him and this is actually a case that we
talked about previously regarding when
we're going over all the micron stuff
the micron law suits all the memory
corporate espionage and IP theft trade
secret theft in the memory world so this
is a continuation of that story so IP
theft and infringement accusations have
been common in the last couple of months
especially and China is continuing to
try and bring their own domestic memory
production online coinciding with a lot
of these common allegations micron is
currently locked in a legal battle with
UMC and both sides are citing theft of
intellectual property and trade secrets
against the other one and also IP
infringement so it's a battle that's
still going on we reported on it pretty
heavily in the past but the biggest news
item here is that the XT SMC employee
has been indicted on breach of trust at
this point so if you were wondering how
that went that's how it went
next on GTX 2060 theories gaining some
momentum so this is something that we've
talked about a few times now where we
thought the RT X branding might go away
at the lower end because RT X it stands
out just because different and video
clearly chose a completely different
brand identity for this product and
moving the RT X does imply pretty
heavily that the cards will be capable
of not only just rate racing but all the
other stuff that comes with the RT X SDK
not necessarily the RT x video cards
a lot of different things call our TX
right now GTX though we have publicly
speculated and it is speculation might
make a return for things like the 2015
the 2060 where the cards just won't have
enough processing power to deliver
real-time rate racing in addition to
traditional high-fidelity graphics or
high quality graphics and higher
geometric complexity as you would expect
with any decent video cards so for that
reason our TX might get dropped and now
that theory is starting to gain some
ground so it's not just speculation
anymore
all of this stated there was a recent
Nvidia interview with financial website
seeking alpha and this led to new
discussion over the theory so Nvidia
executive vice president Colette cress
said the following it's a it's a big
block attacks but you'll listen closely
you'll hear Oh everyone's been talking
lately the quote was and then just a
couple of weeks ago now we've announced
the overall cards or overall gaming the
cards will come out we'll start with
ray-tracing cards specifically we will
start with the ray-tracing cards we have
the 2080 TI the 2080 and the 2070 coming
to market this is a major leap in terms
of something that people probably
weren't expecting for another 10 years
to 15 years the games will look
different there'll be a moment that you
may pause at whether or not this is a
film or whether or not this is a game
we're extremely excited to bring this
overall technology first to the market
and as widespread as we are so these
cards will be available shortly within
the quarter but we're very excited about
the excitement both in the ecosystem
with developers as well as what this
brings to the overall gamers so yeah I
mean there's the quote itself
notwithstanding the main thing here is
the phrase starting with the RT X cards
the the rest of the quote was I mean
there was it was a discussion with a
financial website and you can tell
because there wasn't a lot of Technology
discussion there but the big thing again
the quote was we all start with the
ray-tracing cards and it could be making
a mountain out of a molehill but I guess
the discussion online lately has been
that the phrasing the ray-tracing cards
implies that the lower end cards might
not be
trés enabled which is kind of what we've
been saying and other people have been
saying all on so it might just be
feeding that otherwise and I will see
the crux of it though is just that one
quote and it didn't come from someone
pretty high up at Nvidia so we'll see
what happens but our current guess and
it is a guess is that the the future car
is 2050 2060 cards like that are most
likely going to be things like refresh
Pascal so you might have a 1070 that
becomes a 2060 or something like that
not entirely uncommon but something that
we think might happen specifically for
the RT x-series and the twenty series of
cards next up JP ours John petty
research published a new report on video
card sales for quarter 2 of 2018 quarter
two typically sees a decrease in sales
by about 10 percent when averaged over
the last 10 years of sales but for 2018
quarter 2 posted a decrease of 18
percent for Adam board and all video
card sales jpr calls this out to be
quote very low when compared to the
desktop PC market which decreased 3.4
percent quarter-to-quarter
the AIB sales decline is also skewed by
high quarter one sales due to
cryptocurrency demand which jpr thinks
impacted the sales numbers for quarter
two and your every year jpr reports a
drop in board partnership mints by five
point seven percent EVGA RTX 20 line up
was shown at PAX West about a week ago
now the rest of the RT X cards we showed
previously at Gamescom with the RT X
announcement but they had a couple of
high res images that they sent over to
us after a couple of them were lifted
from a live stream we figured we'd reach
out and get the actually high quality
versions for publication so EVGA has and
will show them on screen has a blower
design coming up with the acrylic
faceplate seen on the other RT X designs
that seems to be their unifying ID for
this generation of cards there's another
design that's revamped for the FTW 3
series that we previously filmed that
games come and then there's the hydro
copper at CW 3 image that was sent to us
anyway not the actual card yet and this
is an open-loop waterblock card with an
acrylic faceplate fitting the rest of
the ID and is a continuation of the
existing hydro copper line from EVGA
there's also the hydro copper XC for a
lower profile shorter PCB solution and
then
the hybrid series of cards for
closed-loop liquid cooler solutions
which would include the larger form
factor hybrid FTW three with a taller
PCB and the shorter hybrid XC the final
solution is the XC and XC 2 series which
we previously detailed at Gamescom and
should have some footage of that already
another report here on intel potential
14 nanometer chips shortages so this is
there was a tweet that one of you sent
to us recently where it was we'll put it
on the screen but just talking about how
Intel's kind of got one side taken out
by 10 nanometer delays and then the
other where they've been pushing 14
nanometer is now kind of facing
shortages so the reports and source is
mostly shown by digit times again
indicate a shortage taking form for
Intel's 40 nanometer CPU specifically as
we approach the second half of 2018 we
briefly mentioned this back in July when
it's how openly admitted in statements
to investors and others that there are
potential supply issues coming up with
increased demand for 14 nanometer as
it's aged especially and this is what
was discussed in an earnings call back
then but Intel vowed to work with their
customers to mitigate the constant
supply shifts and the supply constraints
that are affecting them currently so the
supply crisis seems to be taking shape
now and could set the stage for price
hikes and non availability for the
holiday season which is fast approaching
Intel Supply whoa stem from an
unexpected demand increase as well as
unanticipated 14 nanometer production
being pushed on to the fabs a byproduct
of the long delayed 10 nanometer node
much of Intel's fabs were expected to be
in full production of 10 nanometer by
now so having to retool them for
unplanned 40 nanometer silicon
production is time intensive to say the
least
further exacerbating the problem is
Intel's new Amber and whiskey Lake
processors which are expected to power a
slew of new low-power notebooks and
tablets like a sirs new laptops shown at
Aoife 2018 whether or not Intel can keep
retailers in stock with CPUs will be one
of a couple variables that underpin the
PC component market in the last half of
the year with the other being the US
China tariff discussion we should have a
complete separate video on that sometime
soon if not already when this goes up so
check the
for that one I might come out after this
and they announced their new Athlon 200
GE CPU with Vega graphics coming to
market September 8 so it's already out
and it's 55 bucks
Andy is aiming to get the Athlon 200 GE
to be a pentium counterpart or a killer
if they have it their way and that's
attacking the low-end market where Intel
has done well with its Pentium G 45 60
and more recently the G 5600 2 CP is
that with am these competition the r5
and i-5 market where Andy is doing
exceptionally well in taw has managed to
hang on to the low end with a penny on
products but that is now being
challenged by the 200 GE and by the a320
chipset which uses a lock to multiplier
for this so for the part itself it is a
Zen based Athlon product it's a 2 core 4
thread part with integrated Radeon Vega
graphics the Vega graphics have 3 ECU's
while the chip itself offers a 3.2
gigahertz clock rate with no boost so
that's just flat 3.2 the 200 GE will
also support the ABX instruction set
which is an acute benefit over the
Pentium and Celeron competition there's
a new rumor about an Nvidia tu 106 chips
so we've been trying to label these
specifically as rumors when we have them
and limit them to maybe one per episode
lately but this one is interesting
there's a version update that was put
out for hardware info 64 which is
actually some of the leading software
monitoring solutions we've one of the
best we've used lately so hardware info
64 listed support for an Nvidia tu 106
and it's update notes and we know the
our TX 28 is based on tu-104
and the our TX 20 atti is based on
presumably a tu 102 chip really would
make sense and video goes down a
numerical value as the size of the die
increases so tu 100 if it exists would
be the biggest version although the
volta card kind of already does that so
we could infer from this update note
from hardware info that the tu 106 die
is a smaller more mid-range targeted
chip destined for either a 20 60 or
maybe a 20 70 because we haven't
actually opened any of those yet and
those are already announced and slated
to come out soon so as always take this
with a grain of salt these types of
leaks have definitely been at inaccurate
in the recent past even but coming from
hardware info there's maybe something
there either way all we know is that
there's probably going to be a tu 106
which is really not a surprise to anyone
other than the fact of the timing of it
I guess and that may be quarter 4 if t
106 actually happens next time AMD rolls
out multi-gpu interconnects for vega 20
this is pretty interesting there are new
AMD GPU Linux patches that reveal and
the we'll have an answer to Nvidia's
envy link currently known by AMD anyways
xgm I so Veronica scoured the revelation
and a few lines of code and recent Linux
drivers and outside of that details are
scarce xgm is built on AMD's infinity
fabric and will serve as a high
bandwidth interconnect for multiple GPUs
additionally there is speculation that
xgm eyes bandwidth could exceed 100
gigabytes per second and AMD is 7
nanometre Vega GPUs are still on track
to be delivered by the end of the year
dubbed Vega
20 but they'll come in the form of
Radeon Pro and Radeon instinct these are
aimed at machine learning deep learning
and otherwise data centric applications
well it makes sense for Andy to
implement high bandwidth
interconnectivity for professional grade
cards it doesn't mean that it'll come
down market to the AMD navi GPUs or
really any of the gaming grade cards
we're not sure where it'll go yet but it
does look like something that will be
happening for the professional side and
there's something and vidi has been
talking a lot about MCM lately as well
so that'll be really interesting market
as it develops for multi chip modules
seems to be the approach that AMD took
with Rison and it's worked out great so
it helps to reduce overall die size
which helps with managing cost of
high-end products as well and finally
hardware sales for the week the Corsair
Vengeance RGB series of ddr4 3000 Hertz
memory was on sale for 150 bucks and
that was for a 16 gigabyte kit which
isn't a terrible deal as our news writer
Eric called it then finally there was an
Intel 8700 9 K for $280 and will link
those below if you're interested in them
