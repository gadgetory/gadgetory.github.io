and this is the EVGA XC model so it's
it's small in one dimension and it's
pretty fat in the other we're gonna be
taking this one apart we also got the
gigabyte model in this morning so this
needs to go through standard testing
still but we might look at it after but
there is a reference board design as
usual for the 1600 series the reference
TDP as well as 10 watts less than what
you VGA is running it's 120 watts versus
130 so this is basically one hundred and
eight hundred nine percent offset power
offset out of the box so we're gonna
take it apart look at the cooler quality
the attachment of the cooler to all the
components and then the components
themselves before that this video is
brought to you by iFixit and their I'm a
genius campaign which ribs Apple's
Genius Bar and sets out to defend the
consumers right to repair their own
products as write to repair laws have
entered the spotlight iFixit wants you
to share a short video with them about a
time you repaired a product instead of
buying a new one with the hashtag I'm a
genius you can submit your stories at
the link below and enter for a chance to
win a $100 gift card for iFixit store we
already shared our repair story on the G
on Twitter click the links below for
more information so here's the EVGA 1660
T I keep blanking on the name XC and
it's a single fan it's a phat card
though it is about three slots it's like
two point eight or something so it's a
three slot card and I mean I guess
that's really all there is to it we know
it's 130 watts we know it runs out of
hundred thirty watts like all the time
and there's no overclocking power off
sup yon that because it's already baked
in so what we're gonna do is take it
apart and we're using the iFixit Pro
Tech tool kit that was probably the ad
for this video as well and this I'll
start here this sticker EVGA stickers
don't say anything about the warranty
and that's because and I've confirmed
this if you take the screws out through
the sticker they actually don't void the
warranty which is pretty nice it is a
tamper seal to figure out if they need
to check the Throne paste or anything
like that on our RMA
so anyway we've got four screws and then
we can reveal the die for the first time
once we get in here
because we haven't seen the 1660 di di
we haven't seen the 1660 ti die yet that
was harder to say that should have been
so this should be pretty easy yep
alright well there's not much content
here today
yeah the cooler comes out with four
screws actually pretty interesting and I
will note we're working on the G on
medium mod matte which can grab on
stored on camera Sachs has done that if
you like this work surface that I'm on
we do have them there you can get them
on reserve because we sold through the
first round already but here's the card
so to have family a different style cut
out for EVGA in the baseplate that's
kind of new for them let's just go ahead
and instantly reveal that die that's
what I'm most interested in it this
paste is feels like should natsu or
something paste pretty standard stuff
you can see they definitely covered
their bases though like that's that
looks like actually maybe not
I wasn't say that looks like it's done
by a silkscreen cuz Easton tech uses so
experience for their paste but I
actually can't tell okay there's the die
pretty small even compared to a 20 20 60
tu 1/16 - 400 a 1 so the 1060 was a GP
106
I think - 481 as well so follows the
same naming scheme except it's 116 and
it's terrine so I think that's 268
millimeters squared like I said we have
an official chart with information we
can maybe put that on the screen or
something if we need to but that's the
die very basic stuff for the rest we
have a base plate it's an aluminum base
plate we have three heat pipes that look
like they are ten millimeter heat pipes
and they are the flat style heat pipes
which are nice because you can get more
service area contacting the fins it's
actually pretty standard practice these
days but just in case you're not aware
flat heat pipe allows them to get direct
more direct contact to the fence tack
rather than a round heat by where you
need to go through more solder and the
rest has just soldered I to connect to
everything so that's most the cooling
solution on the bottom there's a copper
cold plate
that's an interesting shape just to fit
the mount in the holes but that's
because this card is so small that
they've got some of the memory right
here and we'll reveal this in a second
approaching or encroaching on the GPU
territory hence having the cutout over
here I would be interested to see if
they have I mean it's not really
necessary but it would have been
interesting to see if the copper here
extended to cover those vram modules as
well but it's honestly just completely
unnecessary so the vram will be cooled
well enough by the aluminum plate in the
fan and then the rest we have some
thermal pads actually let's just take
this base plate off and look at the rest
so there's a just nothing screw combo on
each side of these for the i/o the
expansion plate we can track those on
our now a dual sided civil GPU
silhouette mod mat and these hold in the
base plate okay then two screws here
that look like they do nothing right
there except actually they do hold this
inner plate in which goes on top of some
of the video outs and then that connects
to the base plate as well via screws so
we're just gonna unscrew it from the
outputs right here get these last two
screws there we go that connected to the
lower plate so here's our card we have
memory modules so we've got one two
three four five six of those at the six
gigabytes I like the indents they're
interesting
just holes in the baseplate curious
about those but yeah so so indentations
there from baseplate but let's see what
kind of memory it is I previously called
this tool a spudger but I've been
informed that it is in fact a Jimmy it's
a it's an easy mistake anyone could make
it this is actually a Jimmy not a
spudger my apologies to Jimmy's family
so memory it looks like it is micron
that's micron okay micron memory 12
gigabits per second over clocks to about
14 in our testing at least that's
covering the shunt resistor so you've
got a shunt resistor right there that
would be that thing 5 milli ohm and you
could short the shunt resistors one of
them if you wanted to boost the power
target I suppose there's another on the
back I guess we can check which one
corresponds to the pins versus the PCIe
slot but before doing that check
there's the inductors so we have a
two-phase memory vrm and then a
four-phase for the GPU VRM the MOSFETs
are on semi NCP 3 0 to 1 5 5 power
components on the back we have another
on semi 4 5 4 9 1 and we have and onto
my NCP 8 1 2 7 6 on the top ok so now
this is not too particularly relevant
for most use cases of this card but
we're gonna check the shunt resistors
and see which one corresponds to a PCIe
cable so if for some reason you wanted
to lift the power targets on this card I
guess you could probably get it pretty
close to have like overclocked but you
get like 10 7 TTI performance for sure I
think well maybe that but you'd get it
you got a pretty close to stock 10 so
TTI pros I think without a power target
but let's just check which ones go to go
to what
so for this test it's pretty easy we're
just gonna check a a 12-volt pin on PCIe
verse is the shunt resistor lag
resistance or checking for continuity
and these are this is a we've got on the
mat here so let's do a few things you
can see on the mat so again our new
medium mod mat we have some shunt
resistor examples here these small
things number 12
and if you check the leg of number 12
versus the yellow the 12 volt line on
the power connector you can then figure
out which one corresponds to that versus
to the PCIe slot in the bottom so what's
gonna be on the bottom and then what
we're looking for on the DMM there we're
looking for a zero not a well but zero
zero point two is pretty close to zero
so that that's continuous so that shunt
resistor corresponds to that PCIe header
if you did want to short the shunts for
some reason so that's really it on the
card it's it's very simple it's a small
card there's not a whole lot going on
the die is there so if you haven't seen
that before you can see it now it does
not have the retention bracket around
the outside of the the substrate as we
see on some cards but the twenty eighty
and down I think dropped that retention
like metal housing that's on it normally
and that's fine it's not that big
and then the cooler just has three ten
millimeter heat pipes they go right
through the only spot that matters which
is where the die is this is pretty
direct contacts they're big copper cold
plate some fins you have some L shaped
fins over here like the 45-degree angle
all shapes that's right there mostly for
air flow purposes air passage sometimes
this can be used for increasing surface
area - they're all pads if there's a
thermal pad under it you get a bit more
surface area while still allowing air
flow to go through so that's a typical
reason to use those and then the
straight 90 is for the rest and I think
that really
covers the card it's it's very simple
and I don't know that this even has I
don't think this even has LEDs I don't
know I don't look at the cards when
we're patching them we don't really care
about Ellie's but I don't think it has
them so that's the EVGA SiC 1660 TI XE
and we have a review on the channel
already for performance you can check
that subscribe to the channel for more
of course we're gonna try and work with
this one as well as we find time for all
these cards so this is probably on our
list for thermal testing and stuff like
that so that's 1660 ti let us know what
you think
performance-wise or the build and I
don't know what else to say really
memorizing the name has has consumed all
of my mental capabilities so we'll end
it there subscribe for more is always go
to store documents access net to pick up
one of the media mod mats on backorder
now because they were too popular and
you bought them all thank you but
they're on backorder so you can get a
reserve and patreon.com slash game is
excess otherwise i'll see you all next
