his minion Alex who personally declares
that he is only great ish on Twitter
recently posted a 3dmark score that
surpassed our own so we're gonna fix
that
featuring the hashtag rip LTT waterblock
a Titan V and a 79 ad XE that we've
pushed significantly further than our
last overclocking attempt this video is
brought to you by the gamers Nexus
anti-static mod mat our mod mat uses a
high-quality anti-static surface with a
rubberized finish we also have a custom
paint job on it which includes reference
points and cheat sheets for PCIe eps 12
volt and other power cables along with
quick reference throne taste application
guides a screw sorter for your video
card tear downs and it includes a common
ground point and a grounding strap to
help protect the products you are
working on from electrostatic discharge
order your mat now at the link in the
description below so breaking down the
basics really quickly first of all we're
gonna have a live stream on this right
now we're doing is we're building up the
Titan V and a custom loop to prepare it
for this test and secondary that what we
doing is a live stream showing the
overclocking process as we try to
overtake lioness tek-tips score on the
3d mark charts will also submit it to
Hardware bot because we know how to do
that
unlike some people so it should be
pretty fun it's just kind of a media
rivalry thing and I really I line us and
crew I strongly encourage you to just
try and counter me try and come at me
after this because uh we'll see if you
can see you may have all the money in
the world I guess that's really all you
need but we'll try anyway so okay what
we've got is an ek water blocks block
for the Titan V it's as far as I'm aware
the first of its kind officially we did
a hybrid modest Lea this will be much
better because it is full coverage it
will contact all the BRM components and
everything
HBM GPU vrm all the stuff will be good
to go and then
gonna stick a 360 on it and we're
considering the option of chilling the
radiator in ice water or dry ice or
something like that but we might not
even need to because frankly Linus's
score doesn't impress me that much so
we'll save that for perhaps the
retaliation in the future as far as the
scoring for anyone who saw were followed
up on our previous live stream with a
Titan V and the 79 80 XC we placed about
top 10 now that was largely because you
could buy your way to the top these days
but we did also do some actually pretty
good overclocking on Titan V what we
didn't do is have all four channels on
the X 299 motherboard we only use two
sticks of memory this time we've got
four and we've done some work with build
Zoid tuning everything so I think we'll
all be pretty impressed to the results
but we'll save all that for the live
stream today let's start out with
putting this block on the Titan V I've
already pre stripped down gotten rid of
the old air cooler that was on there and
then I think we just need to cut the
loop to size and get it on the bench and
we'll be good to go the CPU will not be
part of this loop we're gonna isolate
them so that the the the thermal
capacity of each loop is sort of fully
contained within itself one 360 for each
and that should take care of everything
very nicely Pascal and Volta in this
case both are extremely sensitive to
temperature every five degree reduction
or there abouts will get you notable
gains in frequency and when we're
talking about fighting over single to
double digit points and fire striking
times by that'll matter so that's the
plan we're gonna mostly be competed in
times by extreme let's get on with the
build process okay so we need to start
with thermal pads I have a lot of
thermal pads and although unnecessary
we're gonna use some of the really good
stuff as soon as I find it we're gonna
put quite a bit of money worth of
probably the Fuji poly pads on here and
we need one millimeter and those will go
on the vrm components
how big is this all right so we've got
some ultra extreme one millimeter pads
that we're gonna put on there and then
I'm going to use some cry or not we
we've done a lot of thermal compound
testing lately and although often within
margin of error cryo not tends to come
out on top or close to it so we're gonna
use cryo not on the middle and then fuji
poly for the pads and we might not have
enough here for all of it but we'll see
how far we can get just scrape off some
of the old ones first nice brand new if
they're all pad ok so there's are some
really expensive thermal pads I just put
on there and they are suspect they're
the right size and everything now we're
gonna do a bunch of thermal paste we
should be good
yeah that's not great coverage should be
mostly good on pads somebody's do
thermal paste and for this part you can
manually spread it on this GPU and I've
done it but first of all cryo not
spreads out a lot it's non conductive
and when I say spreads out a lot I mean
it's very liquidy the fact that it's non
conductive means we don't have to worry
about SMDs
on the sides of the substrate outside of
the inner poser area so we're going to
do is just an X pattern within some
spot-check dots where they are really
needed hpm is on the corners as always
and the GP itself of course the larger
die in the middle people in the comments
are going to say things about either
being too much too little thermal paste
they are complaining about things that
don't actually matter don't listen to
them they're incorrect
so with GPUs there is zero tolerance if
you miss a corner of the GPU with paste
depend on what's in that corner you you
could end up killing it from heat they
seriously have no tolerance for over
temperature for spot temperatures
so this has worked very well for ours
and we're just gonna do more of it okay
so next step we're gonna start
installing the block and this will just
sock it down very easily it's gonna be a
much better cooling solution than our
previous one although our previous one
was very good the custom-made hybrid
that we did the back plate here I think
technically is optional
it's gonna mount on just like that and
we do it looks pretty nice actually that
brushed look we do need to get some
throwing pads on there and we also need
a couple of mounting screws in there to
secure us to start with and then we can
do the rest so six screws will be
omitted to add the mount of the back
plate all right cool so we have all the
men that we need we need to put six more
screws in those are not going to go in
until this plate is on so this is the
next step and I need to put on the some
thermal pads before this as well okay so
we took a pause to go publish some
content on CTS labs which you should
definitely watch or read but we're back
now so the next step is to drop one of
these thermal pads we're just going to
use the included ones for this because
it's not really that important we're
gonna drop this right here between the
two screw points and the other one will
go somewhere in this area we'll find out
in a second though once I can line it up
so first of all so let's look it's a
little bit of transfer to the backplate
I'm actually going to add a thermal pad
that they don't specify and stick one on
the back of the GPU now this won't do a
lot for us but any amount of additional
transfer when we're overclocking and
kind of pushing it and we should use a
square one but I'll just put a couple of
these any kind of high-end overclocking
like this every fraction of a degree is
going to help
so in this instance we can conduct stuff
from into the back plate and then just
hit it with a fan and dissipate that
that energy all right
that's looking pretty good okay all
right last couple screws it should be
six here and this will secure the
backplate we're gonna have a minimal
amount of dissipation this is really
primarily if it looks as we've
demonstrated in the past however again
any small amount of help we can get will
take at this point for this endeavor so
then we get to flip it over see how it
looks
add all the fittings to everything and
from there we'll just have to fill the
loop get the pump situated which we have
a pretty nice pump to go with our 360 so
the GP will be completely isolated in
its own loop and probably won't be using
the bars that come with this they're
very good fans for noise normalized
performance however we want absolute
performance they're probably gonna you
soon on maglevs or which is the supplier
for the corsair maglev fans or something
to that effect
maybe corsair maglevs although we have
those on our cpu already so might go
with soon on for the others what's that
supposed to come off okay why you do
this okay
don't worry the thing to prevent finger
prints cause them alright
forgot that i wrote that down there so
there's the rip LTT titan v looking
pretty damn good let's take a closer
look at this so you have an okay shot
micro fins or of the text is really what
I'm asking so this is really just my way
of taking more time to get this in the
shot you can see the micro fins over the
GPU so this central block right there
covers the GPU die the hpm is really low
heat flux HP m2 is low heat flux it's
not as much of a concern at all for
cooling but cooling it will certainly
help the GPU does respond much more
significantly though to the reductions
so we'll have liquid you come in through
one
side go out the other it's gonna go
through these microf in channels and
whisk away or wick away rather the heat
through the fins and then it'll just be
dissipated once it gets into the
radiator and the fans blow through the
the Illume the copper fins in the case
of this particular cooling unit so
that's the primary set up we have really
damn good thermal pads on there they are
in fact making contact and just looking
down the card right now double check
that so they are making contact on both
sides it would appear yes
great so we've got really good contact
the pads give excellent top-class
they're all pasted on there with cryo
knot and now we just need to prepare the
loop which is something we'll do off
camera because that'll have to run a
leak test for 24 hours yeah that screws
not in there but uh that's okay
we're having a leak test for about 24
hours before turning the card on the
system on and the next step is basically
what we're gonna do is set up pump this
is gonna go on the bench so this will be
done just before the stream when we do
get around the streaming you've got your
in and outlets on it and we'll just
connect some fittings on there which ek
was kind enough to when I told them I
wanted to take Linus down support in any
way they could find possible so they
sent us some pretty nice fittings for
that we'll install those and not like
that though install those and then we
also have some coolant they sent which
uses their cryo fuel branded it's just
it's it's just basically a mixture of
distilled water and some other maybe
propylene glycol or whatever they I
don't know their exact composition
chemical composition but we've got some
of that it is blue colored so thank you
ek for looking out for the GaN colors
and reppin you know maybe if Linus
starts begging as well something he
certainly is more skilled at you could
use orange for him that would just be my
recommendation and and he probably will
come and beg for some help at some point
because he'll need it so that's the
that's a pump we've got the radiator
- 360 as stated we'll use some really
nice fans on it and buy really nice I
mean 3000 rpm and then see where it goes
from there it's gonna be super loud very
cool and efficient our limitation is
actually going to be ambient temperature
so perhaps if it if it snows again set
up outside otherwise there's always the
option of running the cart off of a
riser
for a negligible invisible performance
hit and then running the the radiator in
a tank now unfortunately out how to take
the cart apart wrap it in shop towel for
condensation control oh you know what we
should let's see hmm
I just remembered something we haven't
messed with the Titan in a little while
I have a secret weapon that we're going
to add the last content piece we did on
this thing was shorting shunts and it
got us about three percent more
performance and there was a-there worse
it did pretty well overall so I think
what I'm gonna do
off-camera is potentially dismantle this
and it's not that hard to put back
together it'll take 10 minutes and then
throw some liquid metal on there shots
short them out and we'll get another
couple percent out of the thing or I
could save it because I don't think I'll
need that much health so that's it for
this one thank you for watching check
back soon for the live stream I do not
have a date yet but we will definitely
be announcing it via Twitter and we're
trying to give everyone a heads up it's
going to depend on production timelines
and things like that I think we're
trying to sync up with Linus's video
they're posting some kind of OC video
with the Titan V where they they took a
time to spy extreme top 10 spot so
they've been posting that soon be sure
to watch it because we're gonna respond
to that with a live stream and try and
beat their score by try I mean beat
their score and then we'll see if they
respond to that for a bit of fun between
media outlets so that's the that's a
plan to catch the up
dates again twitter.com slash gamers
Nexus if you're a patreon backer on
patreon.com slash gamers Nexus you can
join our discord where I will announce
it to all of you directly and personally
and otherwise we'll try and mention it
in other videos but it'll be a lot of
fun make sure you don't miss it do a lot
of overclocking I've got some help from
build Zoid in the prep work so that's
for this one thank you for watching go
to store that gamers Nexus dotnet to
pick up a mod mat like the one I was
operating on today our next round comes
in end of month and it will ship and a
month very early April we completely
sold out last time so get an early if
you want one thanks for watching I'll
see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
