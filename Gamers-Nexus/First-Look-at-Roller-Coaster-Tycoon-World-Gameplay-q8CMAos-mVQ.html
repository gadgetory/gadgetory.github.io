dotnet and we are here for our final
tour of day 2 of pax checking out
rollercoaster tycoon world and i'm
joined by matt LeBlanc ax from Atari yes
the executive or one of the executive
producers on the game so for a quick
overview those who are unfamiliar with
roller coaster tycoon or who haven't
seen it in a while can you give us a
rundown of what the game is sure so
roller coaster tycoon world is a
next-generation simulation theme park
building game right so you're you're
going to be in this game you're going to
build this amazing theme park with tons
of different rides and rollercoasters
and then we throw this really cool
simulation layer on top of that where
you're worried about things like the
ride finances and the stats of your
peeps and you're worried about the
guests happiness and stuff like that so
it's really sort of a full package of
running a realistic cool fun theme park
and today we just looked at the sandbox
mode which is more freeform so in terms
of rides support what are the plans for
different types of rides how many of
those rides sure so the game has over 30
flat rides those are just this sort of
the typical pre-built rides those fall
into three categories of junior rides
thrill rides and family rides like as
you would expect in a real theme park
and then we've also got over 10
different we've have 10 different kinds
of coasters built off of 4-track types
so when we did our research for the game
we realize that a lot of different
coasters really have only certain types
of tracks and that's how you get you
know the different coasters in this game
we have steel wooden hanging and launch
coasters so that's that's a little bit
of what you'll see when you're playing
roller coaster tycoon you were talking
about doing research for the game did
research involve going to theme parks of
course you can't build a roller coaster
game without actually visiting couple of
theme parks yourself our design team has
been out to them a bunch our art team
gets inspired by real rides out there
you're not going to find any of them in
this game but you're going to get the
feeling that what you've seen this game
could actually exist in real life we
think that's a really fun and exciting
take on it and it gives players that
feeling that what
they're doing really matters and that
it's it's realistic and it's fun and
it's roller coaster one of the bigger
items we were talking about was modding
support so this is not something i
remember being supported in roller
coaster tycoon one what's what's the
deal with world support of modding yeah
so we saw what was happening with our
community over the last you know 10
years or more we really wanted to make
sure that we built a game that lasts for
just a number of years right and we want
to be able to support those content
creators out there that I've already
existed even though we've never actually
had officially official modding support
in the game now we're fully embracing it
we have Steam Workshop natively
integrated into the game as you saw we
think we've made it really accessible to
everyone as well as powerful more
powerful than ever before right we've
made sure that we support the unity
editor the free editor that's how we're
going to allow players to import models
into the game and anyone with any 3d
graphics program is supported by unity
will be able to create stuff for the
game so we're really excited to see what
what players are going to make very cool
so that's all through Steam Workshop and
one of the the cooler things we saw in
the demo was that you can basically just
go straight into unity like you're
saying sure edit existing models so if
you're unfamiliar with any kind of
modeling or graphics experience you can
kind of play around with the existing
item so scenery you mentioned that was
one of the other things we were talking
about with scenery and in the older
games you place western-style stuff or
other different types of aesthetics
basically and it didn't really impact a
whole lot in terms of the function of
the game but it sounds like it does for
world what's what's the deal yes it's a
great point so we've wanted to make sure
that the simulation in this game has
become smarter right because it's not
just about building stuff it's about how
the game responds to what you're doing
so we notice a lot of players loved
making themed areas of their parks right
that's of course a huge huge part of
this franchise and if you ever visit a
real theme park you'll notice they build
out family areas they build out western
areas or sci-fi sections you're going to
have peeps that like Adventure rides
or western rides and they're going to be
attracted to rides because they notice
that it's themed in a certain way and
over time your game will adapt to that
and you'll start to attract more of
those kinds of people so it starts to
feel like this realistic ebb and flow of
people inside your theme park for the
the closing things here we need some
kind of release target as they're a
tentative release or price point or
anything like that yet sure so we have
announced that it's going to be a cue
for 2015 release I do not believe we've
announced the price point at this point
but you should stay tuned in actually in
the very near term will be talking about
pre-orders and things like that so you
can check it out for more news on
rollercoaster tycoon calm sounds good so
of course full coverage in the link in
the description below as always and
we're looking forward to looking at the
campaign mode at some point hopefully
yeah because we just did the freeform
stuff today so that is rollercoaster
tycoon world day 2 of pax got more
coverage tomorrow and I will see you all
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
