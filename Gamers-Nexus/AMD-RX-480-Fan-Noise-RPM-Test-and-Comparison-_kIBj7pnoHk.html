noise test today so in our review which
is already live of the RX 480
there is a coverage of the noise output
of this blower fan compared against
other fans we've got the decibel
readings there but it doesn't always
really help to just look at decimal
numbers so I wanted to do this separate
video will install this thing and the
plan is to demonstrate just how loud
100% is when you have the fan at 100%
speed which you should basically never
have it there and and how generally
reasonable the auto and fifty percent
settings are which are more or less the
same before getting to that this
coverage is brought to you by Origin PC
and their new origin at Kronos small
form-factor PC which is customizable
upgradeable and now shipping with the RX
484 high-end that home theater and via
our gaming so there's the RX 4 80
installed in the bench a single 6 pin
power and now we're going to use the AMD
driver software called wot man to manage
the fan speed settings ok so we've got
the card installed and we're at the
beautiful resolution of whatever this is
1024 or something like that but
installing the drivers here keep in mind
that you want to get rid of the trash
software gaming evolved and once we've
got these installed we can go ahead and
manage the fan speed settings in wot man
alright ok is it working yes ok so
here's what we've got for the test the
plan here is I've got a decibel meter we
already used this from a tripod mounted
position it did not move it was pointed
out the card you can read about the test
methodology how far it was sensitivity
things like that in our test methodology
for the review of the RX 480 so that was
covered and then we've also got control
of the fan through software and I'm
gonna be putting that through against a
1070 so you can compare the two and
we'll have the decibel charts on screen
at some point for you if you want to see
that just
pure decibels but let's go and do the
subjective look at how it sounds and we
have to navigate this awful interface to
get there there's about five clicks too
many to get to fan speed control so once
you arrive on this screen it will begin
login and showing sort of some of the
performance metrics this is our state
step in for some of the other stuff but
what we want is just the fan for today
so this can't be done through
afterburner as of yet because this is
before the card was officially shipped
so there's no support yet and here's the
fan so we've got our rpm here if we
switch this to manual control you'll see
these bars appear and the maximum speed
of this fan is 5200 rpm so that means
our our 50% speed will be 2600 rpm so
let's go for the most extreme thing here
and just tell it to run at 5200 rpm I
haven't applied this yet once this
starts here's another thing to keep in
mind so we have a sound recorder we use
that for capturing all the audio for our
videos and that recorder we're attaching
a stereo XY microphone to you were
mounting it to a tripod and pointing
that mic at this card at the fan
it'll be positioned 20 inches away as
our decibel meter was also positioned
that distance during our decibel noise
level collection and putting the mic
there will give you an idea of what this
sounds like we'll cut to that noise
separately though so here's here's what
we're gonna apply this setting and there
goes so it's much louder as you can hear
the decibel levels for this first of all
this is a blower fan that means all the
air is pulled in it gets pushed out the
back you feel it coming out here and
there's actually cut out in the back of
the cart as well where I believe it
holds some air in
but the decibel level is at 100% speed
it's 65 point 6
decibels and that compares against the
r9 290x reference which was 69 point
Ford as well so this you can hear I'm
raising my voice to talk over this this
is what 60 pit five points accessible
sounds like and then we'll just cut
right here and show you without me
talking what it sounds like compared
against 50% and idle
so another note I've got this liquid
cooler set to silent the only noise it's
really making it's coming from the pump
can't even hear right now over this fan
these are the 120 millimeter case fans
you'll notice they are all unplugged and
not doing anything and that is because
we're not doing thermal tests for doing
noise test so don't want the extra noise
so all the noise come from the power
supply and the CPU cooler pumped for the
most part and now the video card which
is overwhelming all of it decibel levels
when you're reading decibel charts it's
logarithmic so you can't do calculations
just a normal subtraction to get a delta
it's a logarithmic formula which we show
on the site if you're curious about that
now if you want to see how hard this
thing is pushing air I suppose there's a
few different tests you can do you can
kind of do one of these so that's a
pretty good and let's bring it back here
you can see it's flat or whatever you
want to call it vertical let's do that
that's a good amount of air coming out
of there of course there's also the
classic photo shoot so here's our
there's our options that is 100% speed
so let's turn this down to 50% speed for
2600 I don't think I have to change both
these values so we're gonna do it anyway
2600 apply okay all right so now at 50%
we are hitting 40 2.8 decibels when we
get this chart out I will show it on the
screen as well so forty two point eight
decibels at 50 percent versus 65 0.6
decibels at a hundred percent and down
at the auto setting which is going to be
more closely resembling what you get in
real world performance the auto setting
is collected after five minutes of
real-world gaming and it's pretty
abusive gaming so then we end up with
this thirty nine point four decibel
metric and that is against idle of
thirty seven point three so there's
really no no noticeable increase in in
decibel levels for the video card
between idle and auto when you're gaming
now one thing here all of these numbers
if you notice the top of the charts has
system noise levels that's because this
isn't just a noise level of only the fan
it's a noise level of the entire system
we don't have a good way to measure just
the thin so you have to factor in here
the the noise of power supply and other
components which is very low these are
pretty quiet components for a reason but
it's not zero so that doesn't mean
there's some additive logarithmic
additive noise from these other
components and one other item to note is
when looking at noise levels you also
have to subtract out the room noise if
it's known we measure the room noise
before every test its subtracted using
that formula and then we end up with
these values so these are already Delta
values versus the environment which is
about 25 decibels when there's nothing
on whatsoever including a/c or HVAC so
that's the fan at 50% and at a hundred
percent let's bring it down here I think
the lowest value is probably 1200 it
will it should should force me to not go
below there okay so 10:40 I've never
seen it actually that low if we put it
on auto apply I think it'll go up to 12
okay so 1042 2200 so this is noticeably
quieter to me I don't know really how it
picks up on on the mic we're using right
now but we will cut in some audio
standalone of this just so you can hear
it
so that's the idle noise levels the next
thing I'm going to do is put this in
this is the reference or founders
Edition 1070 we've already published all
of our noise charts for this in the 1070
review and in the our X 480 review which
again linked in the description down
below so we'll look at this again this
time it will be a subjective test which
there's objective measurements there's
decibel measurements as you've already
seen but the subjective part will help
you actually compare what those decibel
numbers mean in the real world since
it's kind of hard to understand
otherwise I know why they changed their
font
how does that meeting go alright create
a new version of precision like I can't
even close it
what
bring the camera over here EVGA please
make the ex work okay all right Thank
You Jacob okay all we're doing is
changing the fan speed same thing here
let's jump straight to a hundred percent
speed on the GTX 970 founders edition
card here we go
takes a little longer to ramp into it
but not quite as loud
as the Andes car antique art at 100% fan
speed and objectively we have the
numbers for you here this is again
tested with the proper noise setup not
how we have it right now for
demonstration purposes so at 100% speed
the founders edition card on this chart
is going to be the dark blue line that's
labeled GT X 1080 and 1070 that type
57.2 decibels for 100% speed versus 60
5.6 for Andes now Andes runs faster it's
at 5200 rpm and this fan is running at
so and these fan runs at 5200 rpm and
this one runs at about 4000 more or less
so it is slower obviously that's why
it's a bit quieter they both are not
great at cooling as you've seen on our
reviews of both these devices as always
a Ivy Partners do a much better job with
cooling in general as a kind of general
sweeping rule but that's what we got for
100% speed let's compare that to 50 and
see the noise difference here it's a
considerably quieter of course
50 again is about what you'd be hearing
in most gaming scenarios charge do not
really ramp up to 100% speed in the real
world and that's for a lot of reasons
but you can configure it to 100% speed
if you needed it for something like
mining or whatever so 50 percent speed
we're at 40 1.9 decibels and these 42.8
basically the same and then the auto
setting we've got as well logged as 47
friend Vidya and 39.4 on the other card
so that pretty much wraps up the noise
comparison they are more or less the
same at reasonable settings it's only
when you push to a hundred percent that
this thing becomes unbearably loud but
the use cases where a fan is that a
hundred percent are very limited because
they are normally they use a custom fan
profile that will generally prohibit
ever reaching that speed you'll start
seeing system shutdowns and things like
that from thermals if it doesn't get
there if it really needs to but for
gaming you're never gonna be in that
scenario so that's our quick subjective
fan noise comparison thing checks review
for the RX 480 and if you're interested
