2019 and we're gonna start with the
really high-end stuff I promise there's
more affordable things we talked about
in this video and more practical things
too but just because it's interesting
we're starting at the high end with the
velocity WS block for the x5 99 chipset
motherboard and this is the Asus Dominus
we talked about it earlier in the week
there's also a completely insane vrm on
this motherboard which we also talked up
previously and a company in that EK is
doing a vrm block before that this video
is brought to you by the deep cool
captain 240 pro AO cooler the captain
240 pro uses a bladder within the water
tank to expand and contract based on
liquid temperature as a leak prevention
mechanism this works by birthing air at
higher temperatures making for a unique
closed-loop liquid cooler design the
captain 240 pro also expands upon the
existing captain series by extending
tube length for more flexible
positioning and updating the LEDs
learn more at the link in the
description below there's actually no
name for the block right now this is
still pretty early staging for it but
these boards and the CPS are supposed to
ship in the next well we'll see they
should ship soon because they're here
but they'll be shipping soon so the
blocks come a bit after that the block
here is the velocity WS and there's
actually a slightly change there's a jet
plate for it now as opposed to the
previous 36:47 socket blocks so this
socket is not new we actually talked
about this we have some b-roll of the of
the flow of the jet plate but we talked
about this socket at Computex I think
when we were doing the initial 28 core
Intel coverage where we sort of surmised
that yes this will be a 36 47 repurposes
Eon which it is and so that's what we
see here I'm it's it's fortunately a
reused socket from Intel so some of the
parts can be in terms of the ilm space
and they're going to be the same it's a
narrow ilm and then changes are really
the jet plate and and like the cold
plates a bit different as you can see in
some of our b-roll so really high-end
don't have pricing the block the cpu
block will be over $200 I don't know
what the vrm block will cost and I don't
know exactly when they're coming out but
if you're one of the I don't know 1% of
people or fewer
in the 3175 act I guess there are water
cooling options may be more interesting
to you is I'm hoping to get some of
these to use for our overclocking so
that we can continue to kill J and make
sure he's buried in the ground so that's
really why I care about these but moving
on to something a bit more practical is
the Valkyrie series a IO and this is
something we talked about at Computex as
well but it was more prototype at the
time and Computex was about June last
year so it is not an ASA tech design it
should sort of bypass the ASA Tech
patent concerns we talked about this
with deep pools as well where it's it's
a bit of a challenge because the ASA
tech has successfully sued companies in
the u.s. they forced companies out of
the US for having a funky a pump in the
block that's ultimate with the patented
revolves around because the design of a
pump itself is not inherently new but
this should sidestep that so the
velocity or the the Valkyrie excuse me
Izzy kaise approach to trying to
aggressively attack the market of CLC to
close liquid cooler some of you call
them a iOS ek hasn't typically really
offered these they've had the Phoenix
line things like that in the past but
this is a proper AI o or CLC and the
only thing here that's you might see out
of place is there is a fill port so kind
of useful there but otherwise there's no
real gimmicks here it's just it's an
aluminum radiator pretty standard it's a
copper cold plate and then the pump is
visible through that acrylic housing on
the top so that you can see the impeller
there and don't know exactly the details
on who's making it i it's not Dyna Tron
or ippolit act to my knowledge but I
don't know if he's making the through
the OEM is so this should be priced
probably competitively with Corsair from
what I understand but it's not final yet
but if you've been waiting for
EK to make a CLC then it looks like
they're finally doing it this is a the
follow-up from Computex previously and
it's got RGB in it I guess if that's
your thing
moving on so this is something you saw
in our Leon Lee coverage and one mr.
dare Bauer informed us that perhaps if
there's enough demand for this district
play that EK makes the UK would bring it
to a water market well
this exact one might not be going there
but ek does have plans to bring the
district late similar to this to some of
the top cases on the market so you
should have an option in the future to
buy a district plate this is really it's
will have shots it from the inside where
you can see it's mostly helpful for sort
of detangling your tubes you can send
them all to one plate and you don't have
this big mess of tubes going for one
component then I have to just all it
goes to the plate and said plus it looks
nice so yeah it's they're not cheap to
make so they won't be cheap to buy but
if you've been wanting something for
somewhat function somewhat looks on the
open-loop side of things then hopefully
soon the top cases on the market should
have compatible plates like this from ek
but we'll follow up on that as far as we
know the PCO the O 11 should get one the
new O 11 coming out that XL should maybe
get one and then the some of the in one
cases will be getting one but we don't
know the rest let's move on to the next
thing so for this one revival of the
supremacy series ek has been moving
towards their quantum series and phasing
down the the supremacy series blocks but
there's a supremacy classic hopefully
coming out well that's right here it
should be coming out soon looking at
about a 20% lower price I think it's
already available at priced online in
some places on the UK website so it's
about 20 percent lower in price for some
of them like the CPU block it's about 70
or 80 dollars instead of 100 for the
quantum so price down it's the supremacy
line nothing's really changed so if you
like the supremacy line you don't need
the Flair of the quantum line that's
kind of what ek is targeting just
keeping the cost down and otherwise no
major changes to this one so I just
wanted to point that out for people who
have liked the original ek Box the
classic approach that's what they're
working on and one more thing I want to
show off it's just cool it's a case it's
somewhat modded but we're just going to
show it off because it's one of the best
built machines we've seen at the show so
far so this last one this is just a case
mod and this is done by JR 23 he's a
mater works for ek these days it's an in
wind case but it's been pretty heavily
modified so you have this insert here
along the inner lining and gives you the
the nice reflective look which is
accented by a light box on the top of
the case so it
just it looks pretty cool I'll walk
through this some of the specs for you
massive radiator in the front on the
left and on the right so we have shots
of that but huge rated here huge radio
on the other side there's a distro plate
on the back of the mother but the mother
words mounted to it and then you have
the new link here between the 20 series
r-tx cards which should be coming up
soon if not already from ek if you've
been looking for one of those to bridge
to cards they are working on them which
we could have used recently for our
Titan r/t X's that we did to once again
kill and bury J spent a big goal of mine
the past couple of months
so yeah that's it's just a cool mod it
looks good we want to show it off not
something you're gonna be buying
probably but I wanted to point out one
of the better build systems at CES 2019
that will cover us for an hour for the
ek suite has always subscribed for more
you can go to patreon.com/scishow and
exit stops out directly or stored on
cameras nexus dotnet and of course let
us all know what you thought of ek
showings and we'll try and get some of
them into review in the future I'll see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
