Nexus thought night and today we were
looking at orcs must die tues newest
expansion pack family ties this booster
adds no new traps but it does introduce
some new levels and a few cool weapon
options that can be applied toward your
or killing arsenal first let's go over
some of the new items in the traditional
robot entertainment humor they've added
a new stone staff which is a powerful
stick resembling object that has the
ability to quote-unquote stone orcs
despite the teams play on words the
staff does not in fact send Oryx
scrambling in search of three dozen
Mountain Dew no instead it turns them
into stone so it's a bit literal in its
meaning thus this immobilizes them and
makes them seemingly more susceptible to
certain attacks I'm not entirely sure if
that's true but it did seem like they
were more susceptible to explosions for
example and the primary attack of the of
the staff does not take mana and is
ranged and it is an area of effect
attack but it is very low power and
suboptimal for most situations that I
find myself in so do keep that in mind
the reign of teleportation is the second
item it is a universally applicable item
we found in our testing although space
the my co-op player and I did not use
the rain for its actual teleportation
capabilities all that often we did find
it very appealing for its explosive
capabilities because exploding Oryx is
always a good thing in classic telefe
ragan fashion a quick dimensional jaunt
will explode all those who stand in the
area and a freezing upgrade will ensure
that the evenly newly added ball and
chain orc enemy will stand frozen in
place thus making her definitely more
susceptible to attacks finally on the
items front the last new item of the
family ties pack is the jar of ghosts
this jar is fairly straightforward if
you get hit by an orc its passive
ability will temporarily make the orc
fear stricken causing it to retreat I
found this to be incredibly useful when
I got stunned by larger enemies who
would then run away for just long enough
to let me bunny hop away
as manly a fashion as I possibly could
the active ability will place down a set
of skulls these instill fear in the orcs
and we'll send them cowering running all
the way back through the traps that they
just made it past this was one of the
most useful items I found for my loadout
in the new set but that's mainly because
I tend to enjoy using traps with slower
reset times and this Nets more time for
those traps the the new pack also added
two new organ outfits though I will not
talk about them too much they are
available for both characters i think
they cost 35 schools might be 40 or 30
and they have a pretty cool blue
appearance moving on up next we have the
new enemies that were added by the
booster pack the the aforementioned ball
and chain enemy is to quote robot
entertainment's website and enormous
female orc wielding a powerful mace
that's bigger than you are it is a
high-powered slugger who seems to shrug
off conversion effects from what I've
noticed and causes an immense damage
with a single swain that leads to my
sorceress character and to top that off
the other new enemy Hobgoblin healers
keeps their health and keep her health
excuse me maxed when she starts taking
damage so take out those healers very
early otherwise you're just going to be
wasting your time shooting it because
she'll heal immediately now of course
what you are all here for is probably
the new levels these are for me the most
desired addition for the new expansion
packs luckily we actually found some
very fun levels this time around the eye
foundation levels to be a bit more bland
than I would have liked but the family
ties pack did have more variety and had
some incredibly fun choke points for
traffic experimentation the first of the
levels called rush hour which seems to
be using the same naming scheme as the
previous pack had the best choke point
and made for very fun and explosive
gameplay so I definitely recommend that
level after rush hour we did have
another level called breakneck triad
which is the second level of new pack it
is also available in endless mode for
those who love to play with the new trap
combinations endlessly we found this map
to enable intense gameplay that was
incredibly challenging
it was very tiring because it sends
endless waves of the high-powered ball
and chain org and I don't even know how
we survive to be honest I think we got
maybe three schools on that level and
that was our best run so far it has
three angles of attack and no central
funnel through which the enemies can
feed so it's definitely a challenge and
if you like hard maps this is easily one
of the hardest I've played yet and the
final new map is called triple threat
which is primarily based around around a
central hold point in a convenient
hallway this means you can easily
exploit it by placing your death box
throughout a contained space but it
makes for very fun play and it has some
cool stuff you can do with ceilings and
steam traps if that's your kind of thin
there was also a stairs of doom map
which I will briefly mention it is a new
endless mode map though it's fairly
simple it's really just two sets of
stairs going up a hallway with some acid
in between there's really not much more
to it than that now is it worth buying
as the big question here and you can
read my full thoughts on the expansion
in the short article overview which is
linked in the description below so click
on more info for that and but to sum
things up pretty quickly I'd say it is
probably worth it the thing is you're
paying five bucks which is a pretty good
amount of money really for for the
content you're getting for a few new
levels and some new weapons it's about
an hour of new content in story mode and
then however much time you can manage to
extract from endless mode if you don't
find endless mode any fun it'd be hard
to justify the five bucks I'd say the
new weapons can be incredibly useful
albeit they are certainly not required
to enjoy the game you can get away with
most of of what you already have they
tend to do the same thing except these
are a bit more embellished it is
ultimately your decision of course if
you like endless mode and are the type
of player who can't get enough item
combinations give it a go if you could
care less about three new items and an
hour of story mode and really don't care
for endless mode well it might be best
to pass until the next sale and with
that that is all for now guys so I will
see you all next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
