director / retro games oh you're kind of
famous country yeah yeah how are you
you're not famous are you famous dogs
ever I've been working with this guy for
12 13 years now I think writing did the
previous game in the series before and
we worked on ma the secret world
together that's right and now we're
doing this now we're doing Jibril
chapters which is a sequel to dream full
and also part of the longest journey
tsagaan longest journey was a game that
came out in two thousand in the US and
the sequel dreamfall came out in 2006 to
it's been a while since the last game so
we're picking up the story now eight
years later and development time but a
year later in storytime and so gentle
chapters is a narrative game it's a game
of choice and consequence to gain all
about the story it's a game set in two
worlds torque and Arcadia a world of
science in a world of magic and you get
to play different characters you know
having intertwining stories in these two
worlds and it's a story that's deep and
complex you don't have to have played
the previous games to get it we're gonna
have sort of a recap at the beginning of
the game and reintroduce the characters
but it helps if you played you'll get
more a little bit more out of it if you
believe long journey and dreamful but
it's been a while since we made the
previous game so the challenge for us is
being to sort of meet all those
expectations eight years of the reset
pent-up frustration we have to do the
very best we can all make sure that it's
a great experience for everyone yep yeah
so when we made dreamfall in 2006 we
fully expected to be able to continue
and finish the story within a couple
years it was designed to their to port
to port stories yes exactly it was
always the intention to make
yemen and for it to come out relatively
timely in a relatively timely manner
yeah first one then we went off and the
whole developer team went off to do the
secret world an MMO and that team grew
and time passed in six years later we we
did release secret world but you know at
a point we really really felt it was
time to do 24 chapters but our challenge
is that funcom who we used to work for
hey there focuses on online games and we
wanted to do you know Jane four chapters
obviously as a single player game so we
set up a new studio red thread games we
got the license from fan come to
continue telling games in the longest
journey in universe and we went off and
from absolutely nothing we created a
Kickstarter campaign to get the the
Molitor back to the game we're lucky
enough to get some some grants as well
from the Norwegian government socialism
yes you got that in there yeah I did get
that in there and you know a lot of
personal investment from the founders of
the company to in time and money and
then you know our dedication so it's
been it was definitely a challenge in
touch and go at the beginning but you
know the day we launched our kickstarter
we're sitting there like we have no idea
how this is going to go but within 10
minutes of the campaign launching we
were you know just going like this and
we went out to lunch came back from
lunch we're at a hundred thousand
dollars and they were like this is
probably going to grow away yeah so it's
in entoban so we had actually had to
make the game as well they're like oh
crap yeah we have to make the game
though that was a great feeling that was
a wonderful feeling and since then it's
it's it's it's actually been pretty
smooth sailing we've been lucky enough
to have some really solid tools with
unity that we're using everybody's using
unity never experienced people never
experienced a previous titles exactly
knows exactly what we're doing we are
making so we've been really lucky we
haven't really hit any big snags along
the way we are doing some brand new
stuff with the the online functionality
tire to the choices you make and
and and also in having a story that has
so many branching possibilities that's
definitely been a challenge we also had
some ideas for you know fancy mechanics
in the beginning that we said no we're
gonna pair those down because the game
is about a narrative and storytelling
and what we left with this is a game
that is all about the story but it's all
the you know it's all the better for it
it's it's a game that we feel is really
gonna be the best game in the saga so
far we land I mean that's that's one big
portal challenge to us that we're all
horrible perfectionists we want we want
to make this look just a little bit more
beautiful just that you know
everything's just a little bit better
and that's obviously a challenge but
that's that's a challenge we face every
time with yeah and it's great fun doing
it yeah yes I mean we're we're
definitely focused on gene for chapters
right now once that's out the door we do
have one more story to tell and longest
your name universe and that is the
longest journey home which you know
we'll pick up where the longest journey
ended and to see some of what happened
in the because there's a ten-year gap
between the longest journey and rainfall
so there's a yes there's something to be
told there's we don't want to reveal too
much but in that game where we're
planning on going back to 2d or
something not quite 2d but we have some
ideas that we're not going to talk about
quite yet but it's a bit torn it is to
me a lot again yeah and it's definitely
something we want to do we want to do it
but of course it's never a sure thing we
want to focus on doing four chapters now
but yeah it's it's on the list of things
we do really like you to do to do this
on our bucket list um the longest
journey was a home game I think for most
people it took close to 30 hours to play
and dreamfall on the other hand was
reasonably short you could definitely
play through that game in 10 hours I
know some people spend longer but there
wasn't that much stuff to do aside from
the main storyline so a lot of people
felt maybe that was too short I mean
personally I'm a final games at
Hollister I think 10 hours is its pretty
long
because you're telling a story that's
basically seasonal Game of Thrones and
that is a story tells the story so with
Jim four chapters we're aiming at
something that's closer to dream fold
and locust journey and I also think our
players are getting older they don't
have as much time and younger people
have more choice in terms of games as
well they might not want to play one
game like just a story for for more than
four more than 10 12 hours and that sort
of our targets in terms of DLC we don't
have any you know weird the plan for
gentle chapters now is to finish the Zoe
story there's nothing like right now
that's our main focus whatever we do
beyond that it's for the future no again
that we can talk too much about that
because no we don't know we don't know
when we we just want to focus on telling
you a story i'm finishing that story
that's that's all we care about like and
anything else we'll take it as time
comes you know but anybody who you know
his ass back to us or got in the game or
is backing us on paypal right now they
will get zoe story and there'll be a
good story and it's going to be 10 12
hours long and that's what we're doing
that's a museum don't be boring no I
think I think maybe dream for broke a
few of the design rules of longest
journey am j fell had a little less
magic had a lot less stuff to look at in
the world a few conversations shorter
conversations so i think we've gone back
and said we want more magic and magic
not just in magic fireballs but magic in
terms of a world that feels slightly
magical and that also feels more or
deeper and more inhabited than has more
more history more history as you really
see the the scratches on the Soviet we
have so much material that we've that
we've written and done over the years so
this this universe is extremely full and
complex I want to show that off as much
as we can we want to you know get people
as into it as we are yeah but I think
one of the strongest design rules is
that story trumps everything so every
decision we making gameplay on
challenges in the game it's always
dictated by with the characters do this
does this make sense in the story is
this going to lead to a good place and
we never make sacrifices to the story
because the game-playing which is the
opposite way of other people are doing
but we're sayings are like yes we want
good games obviously but we're making
the choices for the story and that's
what these games are about I mean some
some games are about gameplay challenges
and you know the the the the ability to
learn and get better at something but
but that's not what these games are
about their about the story and the
characters and you know whatever we do
is to serve the story and the characters
yeah universe so if people want to learn
more about dreamfall chapters or help us
make the game by pledging to the
production they can go to gym four
chapters calm and we're still accepting
pledges via paypal
and every every dollar helps make the
game better so yeah we encourage people
to take a look at the game and if they
like what they're seeing them help us
out cool all this cool stuff to be had
if you reverse and there's a game at the
end of a game at the end</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
