bring you some threader for two news so
in this one everyone else will be
posting specs and prices we've got those
too but we also have some extra
information not too much about the
architecture side and while more of the
topology of how threader for two is
arranged under the IHS we'll be talking
about that a bit today showing a
topological diagram of threader for two
basically a block diagram talk about the
specs and prices and then we'll get back
to moving into our new office before
that this video is brought to you by
NZXT is new h 500 case which we recently
found to have an impressively effective
cooling setup that is entirely negative
pressure when stock the h 500 is the
successor of the s 340 and s 340 a lead
offering that high build quality that's
all steel and glass and kale management
features that are also top class for the
$70 compact mid tower case age 500 is a
part of NZXT Zanu H series lineup which
also features options from mini ITX
micro ATX and full ATX builds learn more
at the link of the description below so
the quick basics here just like with
rise in 2000 series we're not
technically working with AMD on this
launch they did not provide any
documentation although at the last hour
they did offer we ended up getting all
of our information elsewhere so not not
technically working with them on this
one but out of respect to everyone else
we'll keep the information we do have
mostly limited to what's lifting out
embargo although keep in mind I don't
100% know what's under embargo and what
isn't because I wasn't part of the
meeting so anyway we've got some news
for you and might have some testing
later on just depends on how things work
out with the move so first thing here
the configuration Andy's got a few
processors we'll go over those in a
minute
the 2990 WX probably the most
interesting it's the flagship halo
product it's pretty high it's their
highest end processor 32 cores 64
threads we'll talk about that more
momentarily and this one uses the cores
enabled in all dies so that's the most
interesting part of this is with I'm
looking for my original thread Ripper a
diagram but our original thread record
algorithm showed how just two of the
dies out of four actually have active
cores and that was true for the entire
1900 series so with this one the 2990
you X is moving to four active dyes and
it has cores across all four of them
will talk about the topology - that's
it's kind of interesting because two of
the dyes are basically i/o controllers
and the other two are connected via
infinity fabric basically just an
interconnect so that's the 2990 WX and
this one more or less confirmed there
Bauer's findings where he got into a bit
of a battle with AMD earlier this year
about whether a thread Ripper had just
deactivated dyes that could potentially
be usable via epoch so more or less
confirms those findings 2958 W act or
2950 X rather than the 2920 X are these
successors to the existing 1920 to 1950
X in terms of the core and thread count
and these will be using dyes 0 and 1
leaving the other two unutilized just
like the original threader for one
launch no changes there I think we're
pretty sure it's even going to be the
same dyes which would be nice because
that means that anyone who had special
flow plates for liquid cooling won't
have to change the configuration ZK
included and improvements over threader
for one include more of the same stuff
we saw for the rise in 2000 he pees on
these n+ architecture not to be confused
with Zen - and rise in 2000 not to be
confused with Zen do as well so more of
the same stuff this includes cache
latency drops they've dropped cache
latency about 15% on l3 cache 9% on l2
cache and 8% on l1 cache and DRAM
latency was also reduced by about 2%
with an increase in official JEDEC
supported speeds - 29 33 megahertz from
26 66 megahertz previously again that's
official JEDEC support not to be
confused with maximum memory support so
you can clock higher but that's the
official Jetix support which means that
overall memory compatibility would be
improved over 30 for one just like with
rise in 2000 series where you had
motherboards like x4 70 primarily
improving their bios and memory timings
and auto timings you'll see more of that
and thread over 2 as well so here's an
image we made that shows AMD is threaded
for two SOC topology it's not much
different than the 1950 X at its core
this is the 29 50 X using two memory
channels to connect dyes to memory 32
PCIe
each and IO operating about 50 gigabits
per second with a 1600 megahertz memory
clock assumes cores 0 through 15 are on
dyes 0 in the diagram with cores 16 to
31 on dye one in theory AMD is enabling
the same two dyes in every single
processor individually so hotspots
shouldn't change in TR 2 between TR 2
CPUs this is good news again for cooling
manufacturers as for the memory channels
like with Red River one these can be
pulled into a single um a or uma domain
rather than two at Numa domains this is
user configurable and depends on whether
you want latency for gaming or pools for
production local mode or Numa is useful
for reducing memory latency like in
games while uma or um a is ideal for
even spread of memory hits across the
channels basically distributing the
transactions this image shows the 2990 W
X block diagram it's not too different
but gets a bit more complex when given
the extra two dyes dyes 0 and to hold
the direct buses to PCIe and DDR with
dyes at 3 &amp;amp; 1 simply sitting between
infinity fabric lines to the main i/o
controller dyes thread referred to will
be on 12 nanometer LP or leading
performance this is largely what enables
clock speed increases that were seen in
rise in 2000 and has been carried over
to thread over 2 and also has a note the
tr4 socket will remain compatible CB
expects and pricing and stuff that
you'll probably have seen by now these
are there are a few of them this time
more than the last time this so 29:20 is
a 12 core 24 thread part that replaces
the 1920 x directly in core account 3.5
to 4 point 3 gigahertz with XFR to 3.5
bays 650 bucks for that one so this most
immediately replaces the 9 to 20 X which
for reference is presently $520 about
130 bucks more has the same core and
thread count but it has some frequency
changes latency changes to cache and
better JEDEC memory support this runs
the 1920 exercises runs up to 4.2
gigahertz and the 29:20 x will ship in
October 29 50 X this is 1600 or 32
threads we should have a table somewhere
on the screen eventually and this one
runs 3.5 gigahertz base to 4.40 Hertz
EXIF are 900 bucks and replaces the 1950
acts of the same core accounts $100
cheaper than the Knights and 50x at
launch price but currently the 1950 acts
is around 780 dollars today so it's
significantly cheaper it's just you lose
a lot of the gains and some of those
gains include the frequency or the 1950
X capped at 4.0 gigahertz and you could
boost it a bit more manually via XO far
or via manual overclocking but that's
about where it's at this one ships
sooner it ships in August the 2970 WX 24
Core 48 thread processor 3.0 gigahertz
base to 4.2 gigahertz boost $1300 and
this is a new CPU line for AMD ships in
October and finally 2990 WX is the halo
products this one is 32 cores 64 threads
3.0 gigahertz based 4.8 gigahertz boost
$1,800 ships August 8 I believe and 64
PCIe lanes on this one still quad
channel runs 4 by 213 millimeter squared
dies 250 watt TDP on this one so
speaking of TDP and these formula for
calculating TDP is a bit different than
Intel and NVIDIA doesn't mean any one of
them is necessarily wrong it's just that
they all do it a different way so this
one for AMD they calculate it for the
2950 X which is listed as 180 watts EDP
they calculate it as follows TDP and
watts equals T case degrees Celsius
minus T ambient degrees Celsius divided
by the heat sink fan thermal resistance
so just to be clear T case is the case
temperature as reported in some software
monitoring tools as opposed to T
Junction which is the one that we
normally care about more T case is going
to be your basically your IHS
temperature the t ambient measurements
is the ambient temperature and then the
heat sink fan thermal resistance is
shown as degrees celsius per watt so AMD
calculates its 180 watt TDP by taking a
56-degree assume the optimal processor
to mid temperature for the IHS and
subtracting a 32 degree pretty high
ambient temperature if we're honest and
then calculates a versus a 0.133 thermal
resistance which they have deemed to be
more or less optimal so that's how they
calculated we'll talk more about this
later as for T CTL same as last time
it's a 27 degree offset just like
starter for 1 and then performance
metrics here
so despite AMD making a huge fuss about
media testing games at 1080p last year
for some reason I guess they did they
forgotten what it was like to work with
media at that point can't blame them too
much AMD is now testing hence head ATP
themselves so and these performance lab
and notes do note that their gaming test
suite was done at 1080p go figure that's
how you show a difference and regardless
AMD showed on average about a 6% decline
versus Intel when comparing for
similarly priced parts this is actually
pretty damn good for Andy we obviously
we have to independently validate it if
we ever do other people well if we don't
but let's just take them at their word
for right now it was over a pretty big
suite of games they looked ok we looked
at their game suite and honestly it
doesn't seem like they're trying to pull
one over on anyone which is cool because
it's not often that a company will show
any downsides even if they're minor and
even if they're outside of the use case
so processor is clearly meant to be used
for production and they went forward
with a game and test anyway showed a 6%
decline and we're ok we actually I'm
pretty happy to see that they they did
that that takes takes some courage to do
that 6 percent though not bad at all if
we take them at their word because
you're considering going up against
Intel and gaming they've had a lead and
he's gaining there and then Andy has
theoretically should have a lead with
right over 2 and a lot of production
tasks like handbrake blender Cinebench
if that matters to you cinema 4d stuff
that actually uses the thread count so
they've got potentially big advantages
in production departments were the
targeting with not a huge loss in gaming
and then of course that is taking all
the documentation at its word but we did
look it over and it seems actually
pretty fair overall we looked through
all the endnotes all the testing Suites
and all that stuff and it looked not bad
so wait for independent analysis but
honestly pretty good-looking overall so
far so other performance figures AMD is
using an H 100 i CLC closed loop cooler
it's actually not one of the but it's
it's pretty good but to put out if they
were at max fan speed or not is kind of
the question we have to assume they
likely are
because that's just I mean that's how we
would do the testing that make sense and
and it is a high tea TV part so either
way though h100 ICL sees a 240
millimeter closed loop liquid cooler not
one of the best on the market the fact
that they're able to use that on a
twenty nine fifty x and a twenty nine
ninety WX before stock testing shows
that despite higher TDP thermals might
actually be pretty under control so it
is going to be a hot process all of
these will be hot processors relatively
speaking to the rest of the market but
an h1 her IC LC is promising it's just a
question whether it's Mac's fan speed or
not because then you're talking like 50
plus decibels which most people don't
want to tolerate on a part so
fortunately you can solve that with
mostly a 280 C LC and lower fan speeds
so anyway it looks good overall it's
just wait around for independent
analysis hold pre-order stuff like that
thermals should be more or less under
controlled if you're controlling for
voltages and then motherboard support to
be determined the x3 99 creation is
probably the best one we've seen so far
and the ACS looks like they're sticking
with their existing boards which they're
going to be shipping optional vrm
cooling brackets for those because the
VRMs will get really hot if you actually
overclocked thread her Purdue as opposed
to running it stock where it should be
mostly okay so that's it for the
threader Pitou news not clear on what's
embargoed and what's not Andy did reach
out last minute they didn't send any
documentation over we got it separately
and we will be looking at potentially
sourcing parts as well whether we buy
them or have them shipped via third
parties not sure yet still move into the
office but so no promises on if we're
covering this particular product on a
bench but will probably be testing some
of the threader for two parts it's just
we're not sure which ones and some of
them come out in October remind you so
maybe look more for those anyway that's
it for this one subscribe for more as
always the move is still going on with
posting more moving videos the David
Cantor interviewer we talked about ten
nanometers coming up probably pushing
that out to Wednesday most likely and
then go to store documents next to snot
net to pick up one of our mod mats we
still have a few in stock they're
shipping really fast so thank you for
the support if you buy it today like as
and when this video goes live you'll
definitely get one ship and then our
posters video card posters for video
card Anatomy are still in the store as
well patreon.com slash gamers next
directly therefore bonus
behind-the-scenes videos I'll see you
all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
