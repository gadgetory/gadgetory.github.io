and we're here at EVGA suite at CES 2016
looking at some quick disconnect video
cards before we get to that all of our
CES coverage is brought to you by I by
powers revolt to small form factor
gaming PC this currently set up in a
quad sli configuration with all nine ATT
is the only current ski of shipping or
will be shipping anyway with the QDC
setup and QDC just means quick
disconnect it is in the asa tech supply
to cooling solution so the radiator is
actually separate and it can connect to
the GPU and the cpu so if you want to do
kind of a semi quasi open loop that's
what this is doing it's a lot easier in
that you don't have to drain it and
configure it to the same way in open
loop style but the setup here has one
pump coming out of the GPU that connects
to the radiator and then one that can
connect to the next GPU in the sequence
or the cpu block in this instance the
cpu block uses also a Sutekh mounting
hardware but it is an EVGA designed with
the LED logo and that is RGB
controllable and that is what's up here
connecting to the x99 platform and that
is a one size fits all blocked so this
can be used on x 99 z 170 and any other
relevant systems evj will be selling the
radiator which is up here it's a three
sixty millimeter radiator and that's
being sold separately the GPU sold
separately cpu block sold separately and
this is all coming soon it's not out
just yet the case here is also knew from
EVGA it doesn't have a name just yet
it's not done designed just yet but this
is something we'll talk about more in
the article and that will be in the link
in the description below so the yet
unnamed case also has a fan control down
here you can actually control it
physically with hardware switches for
the percent speed of the fan and that's
displayed in red for exhaust and green
for intake and again all this coming
soon as far as the radiator size for
these QTC systems you need a larger
radiator because it is multi component
so when you have four GPUs and a CPU set
up with the radiator you need more
liquid and obviously it's going to be
harder to cool
the temperature is going to run hotter
just in general the liquid temperature
will be increased by nature of having
more components so that is the current
iteration anyway of the EVGA liquid
products coming soon they're called the
hydro QRC coolers and QR g for the GPU
so that's quick release GPU and quick
release CPU the next EBG a card that's
on display of the suite here today at
CES 2016 is the vr edition geforce gtx
980 TI shown here and that has an hdmi
connector in the front of the card and
that connects to an optical drive bay
slot that basically is for your HD vibe
or oculus rift headsets the whole
purpose of this is just a shorten the
length of the cabling so you have to run
the cable to the back of the card
instead it just goes to the front
internally in the case and that is the
VR edition 980 TI and as always check
the article on the link in the
description below for more information
hit that patreon link in the post roll
video if you want to help us out and
i'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
