nexus donna and today we are comparing
texture resolution on titanfall i used
identical settings for all four of these
images you're about to see and it's just
the far left is the lowest texture
setting the next one is medium the next
one is very high and the last one is
insane which is max so this kind of
compares those I tried to do a video
comparison with macros to make sure
everything was completely identical
unfortunately the mass movement does not
get passed through to directx it's too
low level in the stack so I did my best
here but you will see that we have
screenshots lined up as well so you can
kind of you have more time to compare
the point of showing this is to really
illustrate a point that in titanfall the
textures are not all that different at
the higher resolutions so on insane you
can see here right now we're looking at
where we're looking at event on one of
the pilot training levels and there's
really almost no difference between the
far right three the difference is in low
on the very very far left so first of
all if you're having any sort of issues
hitting 60 FPS regularly on a 750 or
better video card then you can probably
drop your texture resolution to very
high and you won't know any better truth
be told so even here with the boxes you
can see there's very little difference
with this big metal plate again very
little difference the left to you can
kind of start to see a little bit of
flatness but that's about it so we're
getting to some of the more interesting
stuff there's a tank in this room that I
wanted to show off we're going to look
at some more vents first apparently I
like events a lot go figure haha so the
tank I have some stills of this that are
about to come up you'll see once again
that the difference is in the left two
images medium and low and that very
high-end insane have almost zero
noticeable difference and yeah so here
we go and what what this really tells us
is the game's differences are going to
be in the small details like this sign
so if you have lower
resolution settings your texture
resolution i should say you'll notice
the differences in these small things in
the fab objects that really don't add a
lot to gameplay they just kind of their
environmental things here we're looking
at the texture primarily of your arms of
your character model the model detail
remains high but this shows us that
really it just stay above low and you'll
be pretty happy with how the game looks
and finally we're going to look at some
of the graphics quality in game this is
just a graphics comparison in game of
various graphics settings it's not quite
as scientific as the others in terms of
showcasing the same exact thing over and
over but I do try to show a few things
repeatedly like getting into a Titan and
dropping a Titan so first we're looking
at low everything's on low here
including texture resolution this is
most noticeable in the the guns textures
and in the environment textures on the
wall to our right and then we're going
to look at after I'm done ejecting from
my explodey titan here it has a special
perk call the explodey it tends to blow
up after this we will be looking at
medium low which is going to be medium
textures with low settings and first
we're rodeoing a Titan again look at the
actual up-close texture of the back of
the Titan you can see that low
resolution in play here so it is quite
noticeable now we're dropping a Titan
again and getting into it the the smoke
coming up is a little bit I mean it's
it's really all going to be the same
except for the textures so you can't
look at shadows and smoke too much here
it's the only thing I changed was
increasing the texture to medium
resolution from low so you need to be
looking at the gun at the environment
textures particularly the walls because
those are pretty noticeable and that's
about it and this is what the game would
look like on the 5800 k if you played
with our settings when I benchmarked it
the other day again link below for the
benchmark so so that's medium and low
next we're going to look at insane
settings and insane is for this one I
max out everything so we've got 8 X msaa
which is a little bit crazy but whatever
we have I think 16 X anisotropic
filtering and then max everything else
and insane
solution textures so that's this it's
running on a 270x and recording by the
way so that's that's pretty impressive
for a good frame rate to perhaps record
and play here's our tight and drop in
this one you can notice that the smoke
and the particle effects and all that
stuff and even the lighting from the Sun
in the background way more noticeable
this time in terms of quality than the
last two times and once again looking at
the the gun resolution fear you won't
notice quite as much of a difference
between the previous one with medium
resolution and the current one because
as we already show the texture
resolution really doesn't change the
quality all that much once you get past
low so hopefully that illustrates my
point you should be able to play pretty
well on almost any texture resolution
setting other than low and not know any
better honestly so check out a link in
the description below for our titanfall
benchmark that's what you're looking at
right now so this showed video card
performance in titanfall there's also an
article link below for all the stills in
this video so if you want to see the
stills lined up next to each other hit
that link and that's all for this time
so please like comment and subscribe and
we will see you all next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
