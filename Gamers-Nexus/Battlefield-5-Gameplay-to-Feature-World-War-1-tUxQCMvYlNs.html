listings has reconfirmed battlefield
five a game we already knew to be
inevitable from both earnings calls and
ea's history of turning out sequels into
infinity this isn't the interesting bit
of the leak however the german-language
job listing effectively confirmed that
the battlefield franchises setting will
be world war one this news comes from
the german description of the job which
explained that the game in question was
out deutsch quote mesh peeler tactic
shooter in einstein belt Krieg and by
the way I new high school German would
eventually be worth to Ohio and in
English that translates to multiplayer
tactical shooter in world war one if the
unintentional leak is true which it
certainly would appear to be at this
point this would be a first for the
Battlefield franchise there haven't been
that many video games take on the First
World War actually at all and World War
one was fought mostly in trenches so
soldiers in the first war spent a lot of
their time waiting for the commands a
charge against enemies in the other
trench or when they weren't charging
into enemy fire and dying on mass
soldiers had to deal with heavy
artillery bombardment gas tax dreary
conditions overall have kind of made it
a hard sell for FPS games which don't
really lend themselves well to
stationary conflicts unless I guess
you're a camper battlefield it did
previously visit vietnam though with its
critically acclaimed at 1942 series and
that was before going hard into the
modern and even futuristic eras this
direction certainly seems like a risk
for EA to take with one of their
flagship franchises but after the
critical and fiscal disappointment of
hardline certainly another risk a new
risk with maybe a bit more emphasis on
making a good game could be a good move
for EA according to the same source
battlefield five is expected to release
at the end of October later this year
and those interested in looking at
another modern take on the First World
War can check out the online FPS affair
done by m2h and Blackmill games if
you're really not sure about world war
one I suppose you could always read off
Quiet on the Western Front certainly not
at all depressing I promise you remember
