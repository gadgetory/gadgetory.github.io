access tonight we're here at Computex
2016 this is our final day we're
certainly done we've done plenty of
coverage now but now we're looking at
another case is the rose well Cullinan
so this is a new case that's coming in
q3 of this year the main thing here is
it's got tempered glass which seems to
be a bit of a trend this year so Rose
well sticking right there with the rest
of the industry in what or the only and
when all during the tempered glass stay
now which is a good look
it's got tempered glass to side the
front and the right side and then in
terms of core specs this is basically a
mid tower case it supports the standard
motherboard form factors on the back
there are three 2.5 inch SSD slides the
bottom front two 3.5 inch HDD drive
cages and then the fan count is not yet
finalized but it can fit three one 20s
in the front I believe three one 20s on
the top one one twenty in the rear and
it looks like they might be including a
total upwards of five fans stock but
that is not finalized yet the price will
be $150 for MSRP and again that's in
quarter three of this year terms of
other standard features there's the
magnetic dust filters that we've seen
crop up on a lot of these cases this
year including some of the ones we've
reviewed from Roseville a couple of
months ago there's a fan speed
controller in the front for low medium
and high fan speeds that connects to a
fan hub in the back the fan hub is
powered by molex so it's not a PWM to
motherboard hub but is a 4-pin molex hub
so that's what you got for the fan hub
and it looks like something like four or
five fan connectors so that should take
care of the whole case that pretty much
wraps up the Cullinan so that's entering
sort in the middle of the mid-range to
high-end case market and then there's
two other quick small features I want to
show you on the other cases that are
just cool mechanical things so I'll move
over there and look at that next so the
two small mechanical things this is just
kind of neat this case is the Raptor 22
it's not determined if this will make it
to market yet it's a prototype but the
cool thing here is that so it's just a
drive bay cover basically pretty
standard drive bay cover except instead
of a hinged door it's got this push
mechanism and then it just rolls and
that is on some teeth you can see
there's teeth and gears in there so
that's all that is just plastic gearing
system and then this case is the high
Mars and this one you can pull off of
course the
front sort of mesh filter type thing and
that reveals this little mechanism which
is just for a drive Kate it's for hard
drives it's kind of like almost a server
setup but more in the consumer style
case so that goes there these are hot
swappable and they connect down into the
PCB with the SATA connector in the
bottom of it kind of like you might see
in some laptops where they're
pre-installed hot swap bays but on a
system case of course this doesn't work
with 2.5 jes yet but it is compatible
with 3.5 inch and then there's four pin
molex on the bottom for power and that
is the high Mars so I just want to show
if the mechanicals they're kind of neat
but otherwise the Cullinan is the maiden
case look out from row as well and as
always check out all of our copy text
coverage for more case lamps we'll have
a best of case around up coming very
shortly if it's not already online thank
you for watching I'll see you all next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
