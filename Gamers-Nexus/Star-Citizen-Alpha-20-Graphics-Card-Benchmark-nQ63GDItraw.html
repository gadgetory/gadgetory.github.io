tonight and this is our star citizen
alpha 2 point 0 GPU benchmark where we
look at the public test universe or PTU
and do some tests for a few different
game modes including the new Ark Corp
and Crusader maps we just tested art
Corp for now we also look at the murray
cup racing free flights and the hangar
module for performance and we'll look at
all those in terms of Delta scaling and
an absolute FPS metrics as we roll
through the content here so previously
we've looked at the original arena
commander dogfighting module we've
looked at the hangar module and now
we're back as the game has developed
quite a bit more since our last look at
the game we've expanded our test
methodology to be much more
comprehensive as well and try and really
look at all different parts of the game
because there is a very wide range of
one gameplay type and 2 FPS performance
depending on which game mode you select
so we look at a lot of those it's
unrealistic to look at all of them on
all of our cards right now that's just
it's not going to happen because it's a
lot of reasons that I'll explain in a
moment but we got some Delta scaling
stuff and some GPU verse GPU testing in
the standard racing part of the
simulator alpha 2 point 0 for those who
do not follow as closely is the first
major really launch for star citizen in
terms of looking at what the grander
open world will feel like as the game
approaches it's more complete stages so
part of this includes the ark Corp and
Crusader maps which are two maps within
the PT you and those allow for some
basic multiplayer interaction including
seen other players on the map chatting
with them and collision that's that's
about it in terms of the on foot
gameplay right now and wandering around
there's some pretty cool stuff I had one
of our testers Mike gaglione he he works
on the benchmarking with us he was
wandering around and collecting some
b-roll of the art Corp city or station I
guess you could call it and it's pretty
neat some of the stuff that you see is
there's a lot of potential for immersion
there and it's definitely an intensive
game which makes it fun to benchmark and
that's what we're doing here
today so let's dive into this first of
all big disclaimer this game is not done
this is alpha two point oh you did not
miss the one point o launch of star
citizen proper this is how the second
original game it's still an alpha and
because of that that means there is
effectively a guarantee that
everything's changing this is not just
some pre-release week before launch test
it this is if you're watching this video
in the future when the game has come out
just ignore it move on to our more
recent benchmark because I can guarantee
these numbers will change but the major
things here are drivers the GPU
manufacturers obviously haven't made
drivers to support star citizen yet
because it's not a complete game so
there's no manufacturer side driver
support to a large scale and then on the
star citizen side there's very little
optimization at this time including some
limited LOD scaling and that is visible
in the pop in effect in game so pop and
just briefly very briefly explain it is
when you see objects and the distance
begin to pop into the view like they
just materialized almost and in star
citizen that's really it's not great
right now and that is for I would
imagine performance reasons because you
see a lot of stuff like fences and sign
posts and things like that popping in
maybe 30 40 meters away where in most
games it can be a bit farther than that
so that is definitely a concern in terms
of the benchmarking with performance you
will see numbers chains as the
developers change the pop and distance
change the LOD scaling create more
assets finally it's art assets so all of
that disclaimer stuff out of the way if
you are trying to play alpha 2 point 0
this is what you will be looking at for
your performance metrics first of all we
tested a few things here we tested the
Murray Cup race for the actual card vs
card performance we tested the PTU for
delta scaling on a 980 TI and then we
also tested free flight for delta
scaling on an ayiti I when I say delta
scaling this is a new chart that we
introduced with the overwatch benchmarks
and delta scaling is basically a
percentage difference look at the frame
rate increase or decrease between
settings and between
so for star citizen we say we're not
going to test all the cards on the PTO
and the race in free flight that's it's
far too much work we it's just not
feasible to test all four different
existing game modes right now on 10 12
configurations that's a lot of testing
to do for a game that's not done yet so
we do the big test on the race and then
the delta scale takes a 980 TI as a sort
of cross section and says what is the
percentage performance gain or loss in
game mode X versus game mode why those
would be things like free flight and
Hayner and then we also look at what is
the percentage gain versus loss at very
high high medium and low settings those
are the four presets available right now
there is no fine tuning available
without going into i NIS or something
like that and we're not going to talk
about ionize at all here because it
exits the scope of the article which is
the benchmark the game as it exists
right now so in free flight spaces
largely empty and if you're exploring
that empty space you are FPS will be
higher than what we're showing here
because we aim to create a worst-case
scenario in these benchmarks that's for
a few reasons I've discussed many times
before not the least of which is
reproducibility it's very important to
be able to reproduce these tests and
their results with great consistency and
eliminating things like variants
introduced by just being way too high of
an FPS because empty space or
eliminating variants from other players
I EPT you testing on all cards is it's
very important for us to do that so we
do the free flight test by flying
towards some objects in space including
sort of a space station capsule type
thing and an asteroid and then for the
racing tests we wait until exiting the
sort of hangar area because that is that
tanks your FPS hardcore when here in
that area so we exit that we do a 30
second run of the race take one corner
and then for the PTO testing I had Mike
figure out a course to test for that
that presents sort of a mid-range FPS
we're on the higher end cards we've seen
50s to 60s in terms of frame rate and in
some parts the PTU you'll see up to 70
even 100
p.s some parts you'll see as low as a
dip of maybe sixty percent so it one
depends on what card you have and two
depends on where you're testing all of
our test courses are shown in this video
and an hour separate video on the
channel that's two minutes long if you
want to see those and replicate our
results so let's dive into this first of
all we're going to talk about the Delta
performance tests if you want to see the
full methodology the other components in
our bench rig hit the link in the
description below for a lot more depth
and you can find that there we're
starting with the Delta performance
charts then moving into the charts that
compare multiple GPUs against one
another these first charts are used to
assist in extrapolating the theoretical
FPS throughput in each area of the game
the first chart shows performance
scaling in the PT or persistent universe
module and that's looking specifically
at the arc Corp map on a 980 TI at 1080p
and the bars represent percentages a few
quick notes here the PT right now is
tough to get into in terms of the
instance will fill up there will be
network drops there's players which can
impact FPS load time is a massive issue
so that is why we excluded it from our
all GPU testing and instead was
something that is tried true and creates
reproducible and easily validated
results which would be the race course
later on so that stated we've
established very high as our baseline
for FPS assuming that this is sort of
the target setting and that's why you
see that at one hundred percent each
reduction in settings would be high
medium low shows an improvement in
performance and this offsets the
percentage positively showing a scaling
of around twenty percent going from very
high to high effectively zero scaling in
the PTU specifically between high and
medium and about a forty three percent
performance win from very high to low
which translates to roughly a 20-percent
gap in medium and low now this is on
tonight ati so on some cards lower end
cards in particular you will see
slightly different numbers here going
from the higher settings the lower
settings because of the just the level
of load that they're put under but this
is a basic representation of what you
can expect and helps with extrapolating
results from the main test
in testing our core proved to have the
least noticeable difference between high
and medium and falls within a margin of
error the art Corp benchmarking doesn't
scale the same way as other game modes
do right now in the PTU and in the game
in general I don't know how much of that
is the team the star citizen teams
graphics optimization or settings
changes or network optimization with
reduction of elements or things like
that for passing on the network I'm not
sure what's going on there but medium
and high and our testing look to be
effectively identical on multiple cards
actually we did validate that result and
the rest shows a swing between 100-200
forty-three percent performance gain at
low moving to free flights the maximum
performance gap is thirty-one percent
between a very high and low with high
seen a six percent gain over very high
and medium seen almost a sixteen percent
gain over very high or ten percent over
high there's one more chart to look at
before we move the GPU verse GPU tests
so we're still on the 980 I stand alone
for now this one shows a game mode
preset scaling at 1080p and high
settings again high not very high
specifically as it pertains to our
benchmark courses the asteroid Hayner
which is what's in our press account
right now was the least intensive area
of the game running at 90 FPS average
and with relatively consistent low
performance metrics free flight and just
somewhat on the complexity of the
cockpit obviously so in our all of our
tests it is key to note that we flew an
M 50 interceptor I think that's an
origin ship and our free flight testing
involved a linear course in which we
approached a couple of satellite objects
in space and they're a bit of a
worst-case scenario for the testing so
if you fly around an empty space
understandably it's much less intensive
and you're going to see a higher FPS
than we saw in free flight testing when
flying at more geometrically complex
objects the race course provides a more
intensive look at ship gameplay by
planting us in a city and offering
significantly more object density and
geometric complexity than in free flight
so is a lot more polygons
being drawn there's a lot more draw
calls there's a lot more stuff hence the
density of objects and that makes for a
slightly more intensive test it's not
until we get to the Ark Corp testing
that FPS falls heavily presenting a
swing of forty-two percent between the
ark Corp map and the hangar with low
performance metrics proving a lot looser
than previously and that's a big
performance gap depending on which part
of the game you're in and is a major
contributor to y star citizen is so
difficult to benchmark so that sort of
shows what you can expect in terms of
the performance scaling between each
device let's look at card vs card for
the 1080p 1440 and 4k resolutions on all
presets except for low in this case at
1080p very high we were only able to
exceed 60 FPS on the 980 I reference
card one percent and 0.1% low frame
rates are extremely consistent and
tightly timed with the average something
that we want to see for improved
fluidity of gameplay the GTX 980 4
gigabyte card runs 10 frames slower in
the race map than the 980 I planting it
around 17.2 percent slower than that
card and play becomes noticeably
choppier as we approach the 40 and lower
FPS range occupied by the r9 290x and
slightly exceeded by the r9 390 X and
these new 380 x can't cut it at tennety
and very high it's just it's not really
that playable right now without doing
any additional tweaking drop into high
settings still at 1080p sees mixed FPS
increases with most cards landing again
between three and seven percent the 390
X now approaches 50 FPS and the 290x
still shows its poor one percent and
0.1% low performance the performance
across the board slots the same card
hierarchy as the previous chart so they
are all listed basically the same order
but we introduced the GTX 950 to this
chart falling short of any playable
ranch at 26 FPS average medium is
significantly more forgiving than very
high but we again see fairly linear
performance across the board dropping to
medium allows the 290x and 380 x to
enter general playability
worst case scenarios but the 380 x does
struggle a bit the gtx 960 also isn't
particularly well suited for play right
now but can get by until a time at which
optimization improves or cars are
upgraded just don't expect precision now
again these are sort of worst-case
scenarios for testing except for the Han
or bit right before our test begins
where you'll see even worse performance
than this but generally in free flight
or in Hannah it is going to be much more
playable than what we're seeing here on
average the 970 sits above the 390 X in
all of these charts and that's something
we've seen increasingly commonly as
we've tested the newest games out
including Assassin's Creed and some
other games that we've tested in the
game benchmark section on the website or
on the channel so the nine sanity just
slightly outranks tonight the 390 X
right now and that's consistent across
all the charts 1440p is understandably
abusive on the system introducing it 1.6
million more pixels than 1080p nothing
is perfectly fluid at 1440 and high and
it's really not much better at medium
with 14 44 k is effectively out of
question right now with the 980 TI
falling to a laughable 23 FPS at 4k and
medium so really don't expect to play 4k
right now with even though 980 TI so
that is our benchmark for star citizen
alpha 2 point 0 including some of the
public test universe testing that we did
on our corp and other maps if you want
more detail on these tests you want to
see what our cpu eyes and all that
information then hit the link the
description below for full information
and a more in-depth article look at this
obviously right now we're not going to
really recommend GPUs to purchase
because the games not done so I'm not
going to do the usual what's the best
GPU at different price ranges thing that
I do for these videos but as it stands
right now generally the game is playable
in the 40 ish FPS range as long as
you're okay with a little bit of chopped
in the worst case areas of each map
because it's not like it's a competitive
game right now it's not csgo it's
there's not intense dog fighting with
actual high consequence as their
theoretically will be when the game
launches so right now you can get away
with that lower FPS more so than perhaps
you normally would be
able to and it's it's playable on some
of the lower end cards as long as you're
willing to live through some choppiness
and deal with a bit of issues on art
corp and the other more intensive maps
but again not recommended a GPU this
time and that will look at the game as
it continues to iterate going forward so
