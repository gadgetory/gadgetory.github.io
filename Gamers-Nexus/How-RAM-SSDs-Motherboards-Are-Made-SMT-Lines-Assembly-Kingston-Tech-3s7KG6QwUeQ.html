Kingston technology and you're here and
we're going to show you our SMT process
how we manufacture memory for Kingston
so the first step of the process
basically we're going to take the bare
boards the bare PCB so we're going to
run them through and we're going to
apply solder to each one of the solder
points onto the PCBs this process is the
same for a USB Drive or whether it be a
memory or DRAM application same basic
process similar to what you would do
with motherboards as well so the first
machine basically has a large metal
stencil and if you want I can show you
real quickly this is what a stencil
typically looks like there's a bunch of
holes that are laser cut into them based
on whatever that particular board
requirements are and we put this into
the first machine the first machine will
then apply the solder through the
stencil onto each of the boards and the
second step of the process is it's then
verified using a solder paste inspection
process where we actually will use a
laser read the solder that's positioned
on the boards and verify and make sure
that the proper amount of solder is on
there not too much not too little just
enough to have the highest quality next
step of the process is we will place all
the small components caps resistors
eeproms
onto the motherboards so or memory
boards and in this case this machine is
very fast with a Gatling gun who picks
up the caps and resistors off the
backside and places them directly onto
the PCBs so all smoke components are
placed by the first machine the the next
step of the process after putting the
small components onto the modules is we
you place the DRAM or the large devices
and this machine in this machine are
used for placing all the DRAM zhan to
the DRAM modules and we have to inline
basically to improve the overall
efficiency two of them twice as fast
essentially the next similar process is
taking the modules and putting the hood
oven and raising the temperature high
enough so the solder melts and the parts
sticked onto the boards so this
particular system here has seven
temperature chambers starts at around
150 degrees C and depending on the board
maybe around 255 degrees C and at some
point the solder
reaches the temperature where because
molten and the devices that attach next
step we cut them off and send to the
testing department okay so I just talked
about the oven how you set it up the
temperature heats up the parts they are
attached next steps of the process is
another optical inspection this machine
here is used to read the location of all
the chips onto the boards to make sure
that they're in the proper alignment
before we take them out to the testing
Department so it's one of our inspection
criteria to make sure every single
device is tested and then verified
before we send it out the next step of
the process is actually a labeling
machine where every single module gets
labeled while it's still attached to the
large panel so we have all the proper
information when it was manufactured
where it was manufactured which
components were used so when the parts
go out to our customers we can verify
exactly when and where it was
manufactured the last step of the SMT
process is basically a giant dremel tool
essentially so decided here is a high
rpm device basically cuts all the edges
off of the modules or USB drives
whatever it might be and basically this
material gets cut off and all it's left
are the modules that go into our testing
department so that's the basic SMT
process so once the modules or USB
drives are manufactured ready to be
tested we take them across the room over
to this section of the do area and we
begin the process of testing every
single device 100% electrically and so
in the case of USB drives with it it
will plug them into a system and verify
that all of the bits are working
properly and in some cases some of our
customers actually asks us to preload
their software onto the USB drives
that's also done at this process okay so
the next step of the process is testing
the modules in this case these are
desktop systems so what we do is we
basically configure a desktop and we
apply the proper diagnostic tests for
what we're trying to accomplish we plug
in the modules turn on the machines run
them for the proper amount of time to
verify all the bits are working properly
run a bunch of different patterns
to make sure all type of patterns are
working they pass then and they go on to
the next step of the process so another
area of testing in our test Department
is for our HyperX products HyperX cases
we typically will use the larger like
for example a cooler from Coolermaster
where we use it to cool the CPU so we
get the higher frequency testing this is
in the case where we're testing 2426 66
megahertz for the latest technology like
a z87 motherboard okay so now we're in
the packaging Department of Kingston and
what we're going to show you is some of
the processes that we use for our flash
products so if we walk over to this
machine over here this machine is used
for packaging our SD cards for our
customers worldwide so as you can see
here what we do is we bring in the SD
cards from our manufacturing facilities
offshore in these large trays and this
was she basically picks them up places
them into a carrier which then gets
mounted into a retail pack and then goes
directly into a finished box where we're
shipping the shipping box completely so
from beginning to end totally automated
at Kingston in California and if you
look over here through this window you
can see as they're getting the final
packaging and then here you can see the
retail packaging of the devices
if you shoot through this window here
you'll see the retail packs they'll
slide over place the plastic array into
here fold it over glue it seal it they
get placed into the proper 25 packs
which are then sealed and packaged ready
to ship to our customers</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
