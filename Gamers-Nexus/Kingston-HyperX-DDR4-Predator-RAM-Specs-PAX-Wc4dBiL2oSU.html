Astana and I'm here at PAX Prime 2014 it
is day two Saturday I have some predator
Kingston memory with me this is the new
ddr4 memory it clocks up to 3000
megahertz with the XMP profiling and
shipped that 2133 this is available on
kits of 4 gigabytes for kit for 6 of 4
and it is stocked out at 1.2 volts so
it's a little bit lower voltages on ddr3
and of course has more pins it says 288
pins ddr3 was was a decent amount fewer
than that this of course runs only on
the x99 platform right now by Intel
which is the new enthusiast chip and
that just shipped yesterday we have a
video on that check the links in
description below so if you have an X 99
platform and $1000 CPU then he can run
some ddr4 memory we have not tested this
yet it should be MSRP should be
announced on time in September and we'll
have more information for you then
hopefully have a review if we can work
that out
other than that kingston has the rest of
their memory lineup defined as Genesis
being replaced by savage and Blue has
already been replaced by Furies so if
you're buying ddr3 that's kind of what
you're looking for now and I've got a
review of fury up online already so
that's all for the Kingston booth check
the links in the description below for
full coverage and we'll see you all next
time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
