Nexus tonight we were at the Crytek
booth I am joined by a couple of
CryEngine folks here and we're speaking
with Scott who is an engine programmer
and xena who is a 3d environment artist
and today we're talking about PBR and a
couple of the terms that you run into
when researching PBR so for those of you
who follow our star citizen coverage PBR
is discussed very heavily by chris
roberts and the team and they're pretty
excited about it so we're going to
define what that is here today let me
just start with the easy question what
is the top-level definition of
physically based rendering what does it
do for for the gamer the top-level
definition is it has lighting techniques
that treat light the way it really
behaves in the world so you have
conservation of energy you never get
more light out than you put in
you have physically correct distribution
patterns of light and and physically
accurate material definitions so with
mentioning material definitions what
what are the different types of
materials that need to be considered in
the environment for PBR well for example
the very big differences between metal
and nonmetals and this is where we cut
the lines or every nonmetal has a
specific value in spec map and metals
have color in the spec map so this is
the like we only separate non metal and
metal and so you're mentioning spec Maps
specular Maps there are other types of
maps as well can we get an overview of
the the most amost common Maps that are
running - yeah of course so diffuse map
albedo which is barely a without any
lighting information and then
have the normal map and in the normal
map alpha channel goes the goes the
class map and the specular map and the
specular map you only need if there's a
couple of different materials in the
same asset for example wood and metal
then you would need a spec map if not
you just define the value via the slider
but you always need a class map and a
diffuse map on the performance side so I
would imagine a lot of this is GPU side
but is there any actual noticeable
performance impact there's not a big
performance impact it's just computing
light in a different way than it did
before using equations that are just
more accurate so you get a very
realistic look with with less effort the
actual shader computations are not
significantly different more more or
less so so visually for gamers do you
have any examples even using your own
tech demos as a basis here do you have
any examples of objects that are
encountered in game where gamers can
look at it and know this is using PBR
well if they play rice everything's PBR
so you just need to play one of the
latest Crytek games and everything is
PBR so every object they look at will
have physic based rendering or shading
and speaking of Rhys a couple other
games use it when you're star citizen's
using it with Rhys and in development
did PVR on a technique side change how
the game developers are building the the
lighting for the games or did it make it
easier for them well for artists
especially it's a way much easier to
tweak the assets normally you would have
to tweak it for different lighting
conditions will definitely get darker
and everything and with ppi you can make
it with one setting and it would work
for every setting very cool so there's
our top level overview of PBR we'll
cover some of the map the map terms that
were defined here in the article linked
in the description below check out all
the content of course thank you to
Crytek and check out CryEngine for more
information on that we will see you all
next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
