relive and Nvidia shadowplay I said that
we would send today have an update on Oh
cat which is Andy's overlay on top of
present Mon that they have developed to
make it easier to benchmark dx12 and
low-level API applications like Vulcan
so that's what we're talking about today
now unfortunately because of bugs that I
ran into with Oh cat we don't have the
full analysis but I still wanted to
explain how it works and what and these
goals are and how it hooks into present
amount of what presentment is I'm joined
by our senior ok analyst here obviously
but that's the idea for the content so
hopefully this at least gives a
preliminary look at the software what it
does how you can use it but for the
benchmarking that's gonna have to wait
until after it's not buggy anymore
before we get into that this content is
brought to you by our patreon backers
thanks to those of you who are
supporting us on patreon you can check
the link patreon.com slash gamers and
axis if you like our content and want to
help directly so very quickly what is Oh
cat Oh cat is Andy's approach to
basically present mon-sol if you don't
know what presentment is let's go over
the tools first for benchmarking tools
right now your options are basically
things like fraps which despite being
aged and a bit decrepit actually works
really well for benchmarking anyway so
captures frame times it's important and
it captures frame rate and then you can
pretty easily validate that data against
other tools now fraps uses the variable
called
on present as opposed to the on display
variable that's closer to the engine so
on present is more representative of the
framerate as it gets spit out of the
engine and then on display is the option
we don't use but it's fine as long as
you're consistent in the use of
whichever variable you may be measuring
with fraps doesn't do on display to my
knowledge so that's kind of traditional
what people use but on display we don't
use we use only on present for
everything present maaan uses both of
those variables that's good that means
that you've got both possible
methodologies and the side note when
you're comparing benchmarks between
different websites this could be part of
why the numbers are different sometimes
they shouldn't be kind of within a scale
but like total side note so present Mont
why is that not more globally used well
it's really
cool because it's open source and it's
by Intel and Microsoft and also because
open source and it's by Intel Microsoft
and it's not a sold product they have no
reason to develop something like an
interface this was this plugs into
things like etw
and you can really easily hook into the
OS or hook into whatever API may be
being tracked dx12 works with Foulke and
it works with the x11 OpenGL it works
with everything so it's really cool but
it's not super widespread and that's
because present Mon out of the box or
out of github as it were you've got to
download the visual studio which isn't
difficult it's super trivial to do and
actually compile everything very easy to
do but that's a step that is
intimidating to some folks certainly
those who might not be doing
benchmarking for a job but just for a
hobby or a passion or something like
that so that's one step that's kind of
in the direction of obfuscating how to
actually use the tool another step in
that same direction is with present Mon
you do it all through command line it's
really not that hard but again it's an
extra step and it's easy to screw up if
you don't really pay attention to the
commands that you're writing we've been
doing this for months now since dx12 and
volcán kind of came about because you
can't use fraps the benchmark those
games and you can't use traditional
tools at least not well afterburner I
don't always trust doesn't always hook
into the game lots of problems so we've
been using present' mod I trusted a lot
more it hooks into you you WP pretty
reliably hooks into all the other api's
but it's difficult to use for most end
users I think and probably some media
depending on the level of technical
knowledge and time they can put into it
so that's present Mon it also creates
really detailed CSVs and you can do a
lot with these CSVs but again same thing
if you don't know what you're looking at
it's really intimidating and you're
probably gonna be like ok so what's my
fps I don't get what are all these frame
times I don't what do these mean so we
have our own Python scripts that analyze
these CSVs you don't need python scripts
to do it but it makes it easier you can
use an excel template I made one of
those previously that runs the
calculations but our Python script is
way more if
so that's present Mon now Oh cat is
AMD's attempt at building an interface
for it as I said present Mon is
open-source and these Oh cat is built on
top of the very generous present Mon
license the license that they use anyway
and that means I can use the source code
means they can distribute Oh cat as a
completely contained tool so you don't
even have to get present Mon separately
it's all contained in this okat exe and
it's an installer which is also really
nice makes it easier you don't have to
compile anything or install Visual
Studio or anything like that it also
adds an interface through an overlay so
to get overlays working in games you
basically you have to create what's
called a shim it shims in normally
traditionally somewhere between the API
and the game and that's not necessarily
quite as easy with the new API s hence
these new tools coming about so present
mana is the heart of oak at this means
that in theory the results should be
effectively identical and should be fair
so you really shouldn't have to worry
about vendor favoring with for example
and the building a tool that would make
them look better that's not what's
happening here in theory and they are
going to open their source code later so
we can actually inspect it but that's
neither here nor there so the idea is
that they're building on present Mon
which is already trusted and known good
and they're offering an interface and
there's some slight overhead but it's
not bad it's maybe fractions of a
millisecond in the frame times and I
think they've pretty much resolved all
those issues by the time they push this
0.9 whatever beta version of the
software they have now so ok in terms of
the overlay options it puts up in the
top right corner you've got your FPS and
your frame times for the current
milliseconds whatever you're looking at
actively and push a hotkey to record and
stop you can set a delay timer not a
delay timer I wanted the late timer I've
asked them for one you can set a time
expiry which is how long will benchmark
before it expires and stops the
benchmark and then once it creates the
files you've got CSVs that are the same
format as present model which is really
important
because again it's presentment so of
course gonna be the same format but they
don't screw around with it they don't
move any any data or any columns or
anything like that so the same CSV that
means our same tools can comprehend it
and now put our own average 1% 0.1%
little values and anyone spreadsheets
can comprehend it without updates so
there's all good news
basically it makes it easier to use
makes it easier to benchmark it hooks
into dx12 it hooks into volcán having a
lot of bugs within the house like I said
so today I can't been to work
battlefield 1 with it it's just not
working present Mon seems to be working
fine so some issue in there with Oh cat
and that's what kind of put a blocking
issue in front of our video and article
for today was that issue so doesn't work
quite well in battlefield one right now
as following the latest bf one patch and
by quite well I mean at all at all so I
was having issues with it in GTA 5 it
was just not hooking into the into the
game at all and then we've had some
issues elsewhere as well there's it'll
work eventually I guess well
unfortunately these problems came up
after the actual announcement was made
for Reliv so it's not working right now
he can't benchmark it but that's the
idea and it does also work with on
presenting on display same stuff and if
you really don't want to look at the
huge CSV then I suppose you get a slight
benefit with okay and that it produces
kind of a collected summary file so
that's how it works so that is all for
now check back soon I don't know when
yet we're waiting on Andy to update the
software so hopefully it'll work with
battlefield one okay that's the big one
I want a benchmark here because it's
pretty recent and GTA 5 just to have a
DX 11 okay then pop you'll hear
benchmark that we can throw in there
check back soon I guess otherwise we'll
have normal ass yen and all that content
coming up shortly patreon link of the
post trail video to help set directly it

information subscribe for more I'll see
you all next time
