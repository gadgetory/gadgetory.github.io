unboxing embargo lifts going live today
we're gonna cut all the and get
straight to it so I have a couple of
numbers to share with you all so all the
more specs you'll hear from everyone
else we'll put that at the end some of
it is some preliminary preconditions for
testing that we need to talk about
because rise in 2000 series 2700 X the
2600 X 2600 and the 2700 all which I
have here in front of me have some
interesting things that we need to take
into consideration when benchmarking
CPUs they're a little bit different from
the original Rison series and so we
found a couple of things in the past
month of testing where we need to lay a
bit of it out on the table and show what
are we looking at going into the
benchmarking how are we normalizing for
variables things like that so today
we're gonna be talking about the rise in
2000 series I have a couple of caveats
I'll share with you after this ad break
this video is brought to you by thermal
takes view 37 case the view 37 focuses
on highlighting custom PC builds with
its full panoramic window and tinted
front acrylic and our thermal testing
the view 37 performed reasonably well
when considering its looks focus build
which is partly thanks to the airflow
design and the removal of a bottom power
supply shroud for a balance of looks and
performance check the link in the
description below for the view 37
coalminers Andy didn't sample us for
this one technically we're not under
their embargo for the CPUs we could have
posted two reviews quite a while ago
we're not doing it for a few reasons one
of them is out of respect for other
reviewers and the other one is because
just working with AMD for the threader
for launch we talked with them and said
hey this special embargo is for some
media Thane is not cool and they gave us
their word they wouldn't do it again so
provided that remains true we will show
some trust and hold the review until
embargo lifts so even though we can post
it today stick around because April 19th
I think at 9:00 a.m. Eastern is when the
official review embargo lifts that's
when we'll post all the performance
numbers as opposed to just a couple of
short things today but either way a
couple big things I'll just get straight
into it the boards the motherboards are
a big change x4 seventy boards so far we
have a couple of them
and they are much stronger in the
motherboard BIOS Department than the
original rise and launch there are some
memory timing issues I'll be showing you
in a moment with some charts but overall
the boards are better with heatsink
design in some cases as you saw at CES
they are more stable overall we've only
had a few blue screens I'd like that to
be 0 blue screens but so far all the
blue screens we've had have been
entirely related to memory timings and
that can be adjusted for as EFI matures
which the board vendors will do as they
always do post launch so really overall
it's a lot more stable than Rison one
was at launch we're pretty happy with
what we've seen thus far it's looking
like it'll shape up to be a good launch
in general but again we need to finish
up the review and see if there's
anything else to discover boards are
also shipping with some interesting
toggles so xfr 2 and precision boots are
things to keep in mind now with testing
XFR is extended frequency range
it gives Andy an extra couple hundred
megahertz and best cases for limited
thread applications so if you're using
one or two threads you get some extended
frequency range as the name implies on
top of the the advertised base and boost
clocks so XFR is boosted now with acts
of r2 they have a couple of new
parameters we'll be talking on the
review precision boost has changed as
well and these are configured in a way
that some of the board's shipping stock
that we've tested with no modifications
all auto will push the CPUs in a way
that exits TDP so you start increasing
the power consumption by dozens of watts
in some cases over TDP but you get more
performance it's a bit of a question of
what's the correct way to test it and so
rather than asking that existential
question we tested both and then we'll
let you decide in the review but that's
something to keep an eye on because it's
similar in some ways to how MCE pushes
Intel CPUs outside of their
specification the difference is XFR is
an advertised actual feature of AMD CPUs
as opposed to a motherboard vendor prio
ver clock so philosophically they're a
bit different in terms of if you look at
one as fair but not the other then again
though
if it exits the TDP specification that's
another debate entirely and we'll get
into that in the review so something to
keep in mind when the reviews go live is
was XFR to enable those precision
reviews to enabled or any other sort of
overclocking features enabled whether or
not you consider them to be overclocking
features so yeah that's that's something
to keep an eye on something that we had
to take into account because we noticed
really high power consumption in some
cases but not others and then
performance was impacted as well other
considerations for testing outside of
these we need to talk about relative
performance scaling on memory this is
something we've talked about a lot with
Rison we talked about it with the AP use
and it comes down to memory kits and the
motherboard timings and their ability to
interact with those kids
so Rison has been more sensitive to
memory kits than Intel CPUs and it's not
I should say then Intel platforms
because this isn't a matter of
necessarily rising as an architecture
cares more or in toss an architecture
cares less it's more about the
motherboard timings and the tuning and
bios and whether or not it's been
optimized for the specific kit of memory
you're using because Rison is still a
relatively immature platform and I don't
mean that in a derogatory way I mean
it's literally a year old in terms of
market consumption whereas Intel has
been on the same platform for eons at
this point so that's something that all
that that will become better with age
and it's not that bad these days anyway
but there is an important thing to look
at and that's memory scaling so we can
talk about that for a bit this is
important for test planning because
memory kit heavily impacts performance
in some scenarios and it's a bit of a
balancing act we can throw the best kit
we have at the cpu but it doesn't mean
it'll perform well it comes down to the
motherboard and how the timings are on
the motherboard and how their BIOS is
for those tertiary and lower-level
timings some of our best kits strictly
for my timings in frequency perspective
actually don't perform that well whereas
some of the moderate kits perform great
just because the motherboard happens
support that kit better out of box and
the pre-release version of BIOS what I'm
going to do now is show a chart I will
wait till I'm done talking here but
we'll put a chart on the screen
technically if you're under the am the
embargo I think you probably can't do
this but
we're not showing full performance we're
not going into a review we're not using
absolute numbers we're using relative
numbers I'm allowed to do it because I
didn't get the CPU from AMD but like I
said we're holding the rest of it out of
respect for other reviewers and
hopefully and these sticks to their word
do not do special thread Ripper style
and Barbie was this time for four
reviewers that they favor so under those
conditions we're just gonna show some
relative performance scaling because I
can to demonstrate the memory kit impact
and why we chose one kit versus another
and also a bit of discussion on X 370
versus X 470 scaling with rise in 1000
series CPUs I'm not going to go into
detail on which motherboards were using
today we have most of the board's but
I'll talk about the board's more
post-launch
so again these are relative numbers
percent offsets from a baseline 100%
which will be established with our
Corsair Vengeance lpx thirty-two hundred
megahertz kit last year some time we
began using a guille thirty-two hundred
megahertz CL 16 memory kit and this was
provided by Andy with the r5 CPUs so we
stuck with it because we I mean they
sent it and it performed pretty well at
the time now we've kind of learned just
from working with rising to and the new
BIOS and motherboards that that's not
the best kit to use so we did some
testing here and looking at some brief
numbers starting with an X 470 board of
an unspecified make and model we ended
up at about 93 percent of the corsair
kits performance when using guile
meaning that guile performed at about 93
percent of the Corsairs baseline 100
percent performance this is for gaming
only and is more latency intensive than
applications like blender where memory
kit matters a lot less than capacity our
range of scaling as you see here is
anywhere from seventy nine percent to
ninety nine point seven percent of total
performance of the corsair baseline kit
depending on which game is being used so
there's a bit of room here so d nine
percent is it's quite a bit lower and
show us some of the weaknesses in this
kit with the motherboards that we were
testing on but comparing the a 1700 X on
X 370 versus X 470 same CPU different
platforms we noticed that the earliest
EFI revision which has since been
replaced
you'll did poor memory timing
on the X 470 platform with the 1700 X it
was bad enough that even 1440p testing
which should almost always become a GPU
benchmark by proxy but it said 85% of
baseline performance the X 370 board
under the same conditions would post 91%
to 99% of baseline performance and the
difference comes primarily from timing
and tuning settings and other issues in
general just with the early BIOS
revisions of X 470 as we're just
applying X and P for this simple test
but improves a point and for that first
chart it was a 2700 X stock but again
you don't have any absolute numbers to
work off yet so things to consider
memory kit matters a lot
EF 5 revision matters a lot there have
already been a couple of them and the
earliest versions of BIOS that we used
before kind of the the more rise into
proper biases were pushed those had
issues with things like XF are to
behavior and memory timings in general
just potentially causing blue screens or
being loose enough that performance is
impacted that's being corrected which
means that we've been basically
iterating on our testing and retesting
stuff as new revisions have come out to
make sure that we have the latest data
that reflects something close to what
the consumer gets so there may be a 0
our BIOS change there normally is with
all these platforms Intel or AMD what
we're doing our best to account for
those so we'll keep the rest the details
under wraps until I review again out of
respect of other reviewers and Andy's
show of trust to move away from special
embargoes but for now this is
information provided to illustrate what
we've spent the last couple weeks doing
researching fair testing conditions
basically so check back for more
scathing information our review now as
for other stuff oh one more thing I
guess ashes of the singularity was one
of the games in those charts that proves
very sensitive to performance scaling a
hyper sensitive sometimes that's also a
matter of looking into why a specific
game performs a specific way and ash as
we talked about with an Threat thread
Ripper launched about the way it
interacts with Numa versus uma for
example for the memory access stuff like
that so let's get on to the Restless
stuff now and I said you have the
 earlier this is basically that
part but it's still important
information
there are five 2609 x $200 for that part
6 cores 12 threads and frequency listed
on the screen $230 there are 5 2600 X 6
cores 12 threads a bit faster in the
frequency Department the r7 2700 where
it gets interesting
so the 1700 is the CPU that we gate we
gave it an Editors Choice Award we
called it rise ins champion basically
said this is the r7 to get forget the
1800 X it's waste of money 1700 ex-con
in between them and there are valid
reasons to buy those but when I say it's
a waste of money I mean from our
perspective as people who would just buy
the $200 cheaper at the time of launch
1700 and then overclock it in 5 minutes
and have something very close to an 800
X anyway that point aside the 2700 is
300 bucks so that's 30 lower than the
1700 which we heavily endorsed and
really likes at $330 so performance
remains good and the platform remains
good then $300 for 2700 is extremely
competitive and that's something we want
to see the 2700 X which is presumably
the replacement to the 1700 X is $330
and and that one like the 2700 they're
both 8 cores 16 thread the frequency is
3.7 the three to four point three
gigahertz with exif r2 on the 2700 X and
as 3.2 to 4.1 on the 2700 9x you can
obviously overclock they're all unlocks
just like before so I think that's most
the basics here we have some extra
things I'd like to show but like I said
we're gonna hold it what you really need
to know is there's core counts they're
basically same core and thread counts as
the preceding 1 X 0 0 numbers so 1 6 0 0
1 6 0 0 X same idea to the 2000 series
same for the 2700 C's so what we're left
with then is waiting april 19th is when
you should check back we're posting our
review when all the others go live at
9:00 a.m. Eastern on April 19th and
we'll have a ton of extra testing this
by the way as an aside here as kind of a
statement on the industry this
of going through a side channel for a
part has taught me and us as a team a
lot because it's allowed us to get way
more hands-on with something way before
launch and the parts are still more or
less retail ready
so hardware side they haven't changed
EFI stuff like that yes it updates we
have to iterate our testing it's extra
work in that department but the
important thing is that having this
extra time when these companies
typically give you about a week to test
stuff has proven extremely useful and
valuable because it's allowed us to
troubleshoot issues things like blue
screens stuff like that before we're a
zero hour on review day you're still not
sure why something's crashing or perform
badly or crap or any kind of bad
behavior with performance and what
you're left with is having to make a
judgement call of do I mentioned this in
the review and if I do how much emphasis
do I put on it being the platform's
fault
versus how much emphasis do I put on it
being maybe the CPU the motherboard or
tester error because maybe we don't
understand something out of zero hour
and it's hard to get in contact with the
right people who actually know things so
this has given us time now that we've
had several weeks to do testing for once
to look into all that and eliminate any
question at all of what's going on so I
feel much more confident in the review
then most other reviews which is a great
feeling it's unfortunate that you have
to go through backchannels to do it
basically and of course they don't want
to give you the parts too early
partially because they're trying to
prevent things like leaks and all these
companies partially because they're
trying to control the media cycle things
like that limit how much digging you can
really do on a product but what we've
seen so far with rising to is looking
good so expect a reasonable review it
actually looks like how much stronger
launch than last year so I'm pretty
happy about it it's it's just kind of
enlightening to me that going through
this back channel for once for this
specific type of product has given us a
much more comprehensive review and not
in a way that's negative towards the
product just in a way that's overall
positive because it teaches everybody
about what's going on how something
works you can really dig in
the hack so far to work stuff like that
stuff we'd never have time for normally
so yeah I don't really know what my plan
is going forward because obviously you
work on building a relationship with the
companies like I am the Erie building
that relationship after arguing over the
thread repair embargoes but at the same
time I really like understanding how
stuff works ahead of launch so it's kind
of weird we have to make that balancing
act now
either way though check back April 19
