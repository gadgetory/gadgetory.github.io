of ask GN and we have a couple quick
questions this week and then some more
in-depth ones that require actually
separate videos all together so first
off question from Eli do you have high
hopes for amd's n do you also agree on
it making or breaking it I assume it
referring to AMD as a company or at
least their CPU division high hopes so
no as a rule I generally don't develop
the hopes for any of these architectures
because it's really our job to analyze
them based on their merits and
performance not based on what we hope
they will be so I try not to develop any
hopes for them I really have no personal
opinions of Zen right now I've read
about it obviously we know some stuff
about it but that's all in the objective
side and will be used to review content
so I would say I don't really have any
type of hopes for Zen now Andy as a
company would have pretty high hopes for
it because addressing the second half of
the question do you agree on it making a
break in AMD yes it sort of does make or
break their CPU division because FX that
lineup is built on an 3 plus platforms
which is from 2011 and 3 is the basis of
am3+ that's from 2009 that is ancient in
computer terms that's archaic and so
moving forwards pretty important and 4am
for looks really good fm2 FMT plus much
better platforms in a m3 so Andy's going
in the right direction and Zen will at
least hopefully achieve parity with
Intel that would be the the one hope
that I do have is that they achieve
parity because FX is a bit behind in
several ways but as far as it making a
break in the company and he's doing
pretty well with GPS right now they
really have a good opportunity to catch
up a bit with NVIDIA and I say that
meaning market share it's just sort of
irrefutable at this point that anybody
does have a massive amount of the game
in market so this sort of window between
Polaris and Pascal for both
architectures gives AMD a bit of an
opportunity to strike especially with
their current asynchronous advantage in
some games now with the again on the GPS
I'd the silicon manufacturing is being
done by Samsung they're getting kind of
bailed out by Samsung
good news for AMD and then then we'll
see how that goes but that will
definitely be a pretty important mantra
them I don't personally really have any
hopes for it though other than achieving
parity or better would ideally be what
happens because otherwise it's just
there's no point in releasing it so the
next question is from Drake Owens and
Drake asks break out the crystal ball
and tell me what you think will happen
with a monitor seen in the next couple
of gears I have a 1080p 144 hurts
display I wonder what oled 4k HDR and
quantum dot tech mean to me as a gamer
when I want to upgrade so monitors are
interesting it's not really a device you
upgrade to regularly at least I never
have it's always been you get a monitor
and then you just use it until it breaks
or until it's so obsolete that you have
to upgrade so 4k I will say this first
4k really doesn't interest me I don't
think it's going to take off like maybe
the market expects a hood but 1440p is
pretty interesting so on the game inside
1440p is a good middle ground resolution
it often allows or comes with high
refresh rates which is much more
interesting to me as a gamer than a lot
of other monitor display tags so if you
get 120 140 for hertz at 1440p you're in
a pretty damn good spot and that's great
for FPS games and things like that 4k
there's not a huge advantage to it maybe
if you're a really cinematic type gamer
and you can see that pixel difference
but other than that I'm most interested
in ultra wide so like that Easter
predator we looked at which was 34 40 x
1440 that's a pretty cool display not
just the predator but in general that
resolution the ultra wide 21 x 9 setup
that's it's really good for production
it's basically two displays on your
desktop with that takes one physical
slot on the desk itself so it's really
easy to work with i I think ultra wise
are worth paying attention to HDR is the
next thing worth paying attention to I
don't know how far it will go for gaming
but there's some stuff that developers
have to do to really utilize it not a
lot of work though and then HDR high
dynamic range for those who don't know
basically just means you get more bit
depth for the the colors so the colors
are more
here you get better blacks instead of
the fuzzy black that's produced with the
sort of grainy output of TN 8-bit
displays and then certain other colors
blue spectrum are going to be sharper as
well with the HDR displays so it's it's
cool to look at it's certainly sharper I
depends sort of on the cost of the tech
how far it goes that's the problem with
4k it costs so much or at least did
originally that no one's really picked
it up to a mass scale so again i would
say immediate future for 1440p with high
refresh rate that's the one I would look
at in the immediate future Ultra wives
would look at in the immediate future
and then looking out a couple years from
now see where HDR goes and if it sticks
around because that would be sort of
almost more interesting to me than 4k or
something like that the next question is
from Doug who asks do you think thermal
throttling is becoming a bigger problem
with the new high-end laptops and
desktops having desktop CPUs and GPUs in
them so for high-end laptops with the
desktop GPUs and CP is the GTX 980 and
laptops probably the first real example
of that recently and we did see some
thermal generation it definitely got hot
but it wasn't really throttling too hard
so the GTX 980 as an example just
because that is the one that's in
desktops right now and also in laptops
the 980 is a device a GPU that throttles
at around 80 Celsius so once you start
hitting 80 Celsius the clock rate will
throttle itself and go up and down
according to the heat and so it'll drop
and that'll drop your thermal levels and
then it will jump up again once the heat
has gotten under control so that's an
example of how it throttles now whether
it throttles depends on the laptop and
the thermal design of the laptop the
heat pipe design heatsink design the
fans all that your fan curve in the sort
of at a minimum you run a higher fan
speed to keep those devices under
hopefully the 80 Celsius range absolute
value but whether it actually is is a
problem I guess just depends on the unit
so the MSI gt70 to Dominator Pro G we
looked at ran a little warm but not
so much that it was really throttling
noticeably other units especially if you
sort of step down from the massive
behemoth size of the GT 72 those would
have an issue with throttling certainly
next question is from valgus boys who
says how many FPS are used rendering
desktop how was rendering desktop
different from rendering a game things
can move on the desktop two cursors
icons and applications and so on just
with not so many effects as in games so
yeah that's of course true it's not a
lot of effects on the desktop and that's
by design they want it to be as sort of
functional as possible without requiring
resources to just draw windows so that's
correct but how much how many frames per
second to do it if you run something
like fraps and just force it to run on
the desktop you'll see that it just
constantly pushes the refresh rate of
the monitor so if you refresh rate a six
to your desktop will render at about 60
FPS unless there's a problem and the
same is true for 120 Hertz or 144 hurts
the desktop will match whatever your
display is there's no real such thing as
vsync for just a desktop there's no
reason you want 3000 FPS for your
desktop so keeping it locked to the
refresh rate is actually a good thing
here because if you start just
unleashing the GPU Foley one it'll
require more power than really is
necessary just to render a desktop and
to you start running into coil wine
issues with some of the AMD and nvidia
cards where the the gtx 960 comes to
mind some of them i have some coil wine
issues when they start pushing more than
a thousand FPS which would definitely
happen on a desktop next question is
from gaia mo perez who says oh this
one's actually there's a pretty long
question so i have a few questions
bugging me what is the purpose of
pushing the and marketing the GPU inside
of the i7 series since I sevens and at
high end users who would want it when
they're just getting a DGP you anyway so
let's let's just focus on that question
for today or for now anyway the the
reason that I GP is being pushed is
because it's not so simple and I see do
you ask us
would it be better to not just use that
die space for additional course so yes
you do ask that so using the dye space
for additional cores is what they do
with the x 99 series right now the
extreme series of CPUs and that will
persist through until the next
generation with broad well II and
there's a few reasons for it one is
marketing and segmenting the market to
buy what they want them to buy but the
main reason is it's really not so easy
to just take an existing architecture
and by not so easy I mean effectively
impossible take an existing architecture
and then just say not only are we going
to turn off the IGP part of this but
we're going to put other cpu cores in
there it doesn't really work like that
AMD is a good example they sell the ATK
the eights elders athlon x4 cpus those
are AP use but they turn the igp off so
you're actually just sort of disabling
half of the die and then selling a
cheaper product so they do that with
those Intel sort of did that with some
of their previous the g3 258 but there's
not really such a thing as disabling the
igp on an i7 and then putting more cores
in there that's not really how it works
the xeon series does disable that I GP
and it lowers the cost a bit but if you
want to use the dye space for more CPU
cores you really have to go into the
extreme series for Intel or the FX
series for AMD because anything short of
that is either a disabled IGP where
you're just scrapping that hold I space
and you're saving a bit of money or it
is it's it's just all cpu space
depending on what you're looking at next
question is from ill to Xbox this is
actually a big question I want to do a
full proper feature on at some point so
we're only to address a little bit here
but it's about CPU architecture and he's
he or she says hey see we've all hit a
wall with cpu performance Intel improves
our forums by only a couple percent per
generation and people using sandy bridge
from five years ago still use them and
there's still plenty fast enough I agree
with that do you think intel and AMD
should be focusing to improve their cpu
performance or what what do you think
they should be focusing on so you
there's a couple things here one
definitely power power draw needs to go
down it's been going down and needs to
keep going down that's a big market it's
weird in the market in terms of pushing
the products because with the improved
power draw lower power draw means
generally performance doesn't increase
as much and that's hard to advertise as
a good thing so you do see some kind of
interesting battles there between AMD
and Intel with talking about that but
that's where I think it's still the most
important you see this move to 10
nanometer from Intel and ease dropping
their fab process as well that will
improve power draw a lot cram more
transistors in and improving power draw
is good for mobile devices which are
really driving the market right now
whether or not we want it to be that way
and mobile devices they'll get more
battery life and so forth so that's a
good thing for improving CPU
architectures on the whole improving it
on the desktop side caching you want
more cash that's a big limiter one
really interesting thing to think about
is hbm so in the future is already
happening with the Xeon Phi CPUs beige
basically scientific CPUs but in the
future we're going to start seeing this
move where CPUs will incorporate hbm
just like GPUs on an interposer or
something like that on top of the
substrate and as they do that system
memory becomes a lot less relevant to
the average user so I would imagine a
point with them in the next five to ten
years where you might have mainstream
rigs that just run hbm maybe two or four
gigabytes of it will probably for
realistically probably four gigabytes or
more 4 8 16 whatever that's all hbm to
is pushing towards but they'll be
improving these architectures primarily
by integrating memory and either getting
rid of system memory for mainstream rigs
or just minimizing its impact so that's
something really interesting to pay
attention to and I think that's where
sort of the future of CP uses and in the
immediate vantage point and then I GP is
really important as well for the same
reason and for a couple of other reasons
that we'll talk about in future videos
last question leo DS says oh come on no
hair questions here's the one why don't
you grow a bee
to go with the hair that would look
savage it would just be unfair frankly
to all the other YouTube channels so I
mean you know got to compete fairly so
that is all for this week check the

out directly thank you for watching I'll
see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
