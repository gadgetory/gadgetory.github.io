year we encountered a case that has some
of the most airflow we've seen in the
past year and it's not any of the larger
ones in front of me it's actually one of
the smallest cases we've ever seen it's
a micro STX case and this product will
probably never come to market at least
not DIY market and there's a good chance
it might not come to any market so yeah
they've added ventilation since we saw
it at Computex but there's a sad story
behind this case it's the RV's e04 and
there's also this one the VT 0 3 so
we'll talk about those after this before
that this coverage is brought to you by
Thermaltake and the flow liquid cooler
the flow is a three hundred sixty
millimeter radiator with three ringed
RGB LED fans you can program the fans or
custom lighting through software and
then of course benefit from the larger
radiator size and cooling performance
learn more at the link in the
description below
so for these cases these are micro ATX
form factor it was more or less created
by asrock who make still some complete
systems so you can buy micro STX systems
you can get them with MXM GPUs but the
form factor is kind of going away at
least for the case industry and a lot of
that is because of well there's a few
industry forces that don't necessarily
make this happen one of them is on
NVIDIA side the MXM form factors kind of
vanishing they have good reasons for it
if you wanted to get an M X M card
previously it kind of made sense because
you bought laptops that had to make some
cards in them but these days desktop
GPUs are more or less just straight on
the PCB for the laptops motherboard so
why would you have an MX M card that
adds height so those are kind of going
away which also means that Silverstone's
MXM a cooler they showed at Computex
will also not make it to market which is
another very sad story because that was
actually a pretty interesting product as
well so this is more or less a graveyard
of products right now silverstone does
have stuff that's coming out and we
showed it previously but i wanted to
give some history on this so for these
cases the micro STX form factor is 5 by
7 as I said you can still buy complete
systems from asrock but
that the future of that's kind of
nebulous and you're not gonna be able to
buy a separate case for it you have to
use theirs silverstone has the Raven
look on their case that we showed ages
ago and the Ravens zero to one of the
best cases we've ever reviewed so they
had that here and they also even since
Computex added ventilation to the top
it's a bit higher up there's some more
breathing ports on it it still fits the
five by seven form factor it looks
pretty sleek it's got plastic on it and
yet still manages to have air flow which
is more than we can say for nearly every
case last year that was I don't know
about eight times larger than this one
not that I hold a grudge but yeah so
it's it's just that it's not going to
make it out that's the RBZ zero four and
this one I just gives us a good example
of what a complete system would look
like so this has a micro-st export in it
it's got an Intel cooler on it you can
fit small profile coolers like some of
Silverstone zone low profile coolers and
then the MXM card you could technically
run integrated graphics for it but MXM
is definitely more power for you the
motherboard in this one it's got two
sodium slots so if you wanted memory in
there using so dims just like on a
laptop and then on the backside of the
motherboard there are three m2 SSD slots
you actually get a lot of performance
out of one of these smaller 5x7
motherboards and you can fit a lot of
storage on it you can fit two RAM sticks
in it so it's a fairly complete system
overall in this case even has a slot for
antenna to come out for wireless
connectivity and finally just to show
that this actually was planned to come
to market it has an RGB header on it so
there we're going to be LEDs I think on
the front of the enclosure yes there's
actually a kind of a v-shaped front
visor for RGB LEDs so they were ready
silverstone stepped out of there their
norm went with RGB went with a gamer
look and it's just not gonna happen
so yeah we'll see what happens with that
Mike some in the future as rocks gonna
keep trying to make their version of
complete system micro STX devices but
kind of sad for for these cases we will
have more coverage of silverstone but a
poor went out for the RV z0 for
and the vt0 three because this is
probably the last time you'll be seeing
them unless we find something to do with
it later but that's it for this one
