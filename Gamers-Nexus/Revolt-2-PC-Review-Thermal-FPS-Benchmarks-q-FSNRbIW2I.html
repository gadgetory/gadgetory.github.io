of the hardware ecosystem whether or not
you've ever bought from one because they
comprise millions of dollars of sales
and hardware every year and a lot of our
audience myself included do prefer to
buy parts and build pcs based on those
parts but that's not to invalidate the
relevance of system integrators like
Origin PC main gear CyberPower
and iBUYPOWER which is who we're looking
at today we're looking at our powers
revolt to gaming PC interesting
primarily because of its small form
factor and custom-designed case the
revolt 2 uses a custom case that's
actually designed by iWeb power this
isn't some OEMs that'll show up on
Newegg in 6 months that is not the case
here it is available only through our
power and they are the ones who actually
engineered the revolt 2 did their own
thermals and are now manufacturing it
for this specific product that boosts
the premium a bit but it does make for a
far more unique setup and one that's
very interesting to test thermally which
will look at momentarily
unfortunately the enclosure and it's RGB
LED smart lighting are not available
separately for DIY builders which I
really wish that some of these s eyes
would investigate that option but
obviously they're trying to create some
sort of value add to actually buy from
them the thermal design challenges faced
by the revolt 2 are shared by the entire
ITX industry where cases make constant
trade-offs between discretion silence
and cooling efficiency we'll be talking
about thermals than gaming FPS of
benchmarks and then some value
propositions versus the DIY route 3 volt
2 has two fan slots in its enclosure and
they're both on the bottom there to 120
millimeter slots and those do both
support radiators as well so our test
system uses a CLC for the CPU that's a
corsair age 55 and our build and then a
CLC for the GPU as well it's running a
980 TI hybrid and that does make for an
interesting cooling scenario now because
it is limited to two 120 millimeter
bottom fans you're basically forced to
have those as intake fans whether
they're push or pull it's definitely
gonna be intake and the only way to get
heat out of the system is to exhaust it
through the blower fan in this case so
the blower fan works different from a
push fan a push fan pushes the air
straight into the heatsink and then that
dissipates and generally just ends up
back in the case eventually gets forced
out maybe through the CPU cooler with a
blower fan
the fan sucks in air from the front and
the top of the car the faceplate and
then forces it out the back and that is
very useful in the scenario where we
have a lot of heat generated within the
case because there's only bottom intake
now another place that the built-in fans
are useful is the power supply so in
this instance three volt to the power
supply is facing the PCH and sort of
near the memory facing the back of the
video card and this power supply fan for
once is used to pull air out of the
system so it's pulling a hot air from
the system pushing it out of the back of
the power supply and exhausting it so it
doesn't mean higher tolerances for the
PSU is but they're generally pretty
beefy components to begin with so they
can handle a bit of extra heat and do a
pretty good job at getting rid of what's
sitting around the PCH area which you
definitely don't want to overheat and
one thing that I did like this IRA power
actually requires a liquid cooler for
this build and the website does not
allow air cooler purchases so this is a
good thing because even if you find a
low profile cooler that fits which I'm
sure there is one
it would be suffocated for air within
the cramped quarters of the revolt two
and GPUs are not limited to liquid only
but it does certainly help just for the
same reason of trying to get that air
out of the case as quickly as possible
the case mounts it's SSDs in the front
and center as a sort of showroom display
so they're left fairly unventilated but
SSDs run so cool anyway that thermals
aren't really a concern in fact and
we'll talk about this in a future video
SSDs actually struggle when they're
operating to cool and that's from an
Intel conducted study the hard drive
however is mounted just behind the front
panel so it is within that cooling area
and IRA Power has intentionally mounted
the GPU cooler under the acrylic window
so the GPUs faceplate is present and
visible similar to what courser did with
the inverted 600c mount that we reviewed
recently the revolt 2 also inverts its
motherboard by forcing right side access
and positioning the PCIe slots toward
the north of the enclosure and
intentional design choice to avoid using
PCIe ribbon cables to extend the
interface so that means the GPU mounts
straight into the board as normally this
all creates a very tight compact
enclosure that's got potential for
cooling vortexes or entropy concerns is
what we
and in our benchmark we had a range of
12.1 for Celsius between all the ITX and
closures so that's our range for the
chart and it's definitely a large range
for case thermals but we observed
recently with the Manta testing that ITX
concluded someone obviously do operate a
bit warmer 3 volt 2 runs at 8 Celsius
gained over the larger Manta 3 volts who
pushes 50 point 3 5 Celsius on it's age
55 CLC which is a bit warm but well
within the acceptable temperatures for
the CPU you would definitely not want an
air cooler on this thing and because I
buy power disallows air cooler
configurations that's really not a
concern because it was not possible to
add one in unless you do it yourself as
for the GPU we observed the hybrid at
thirty five point two Celsius loaded
about 1213 Celsius higher than open-air
benchmarking of the hybrid which she did
previously and this is a testament to
the hybrids cooling solution more than
anything really which we do discuss in
the Seahawk in hybrid reviews and we
even did a lid open and lid closed test
not shown here which saw the overall
temperatures increased by about one to
maybe two Celsius on average and the GPU
and CPU we decided to change the
configuration so I hope our ships at
stock as a pull setup and we thought
push would be better so we fought with
the case changed it to push and that
decreased thermals by a further 1.5
Celsius now normally this is where I
would suggest that the manufacturer or
system integrator ship their build with
our tests and configuration but in this
case the tubes were somewhat pinched
because the nature of the power supply
mount so in that instance we do agree
that a pole configuration is the safest
and for 1.5 cells is not a big deal
let's move on the gaming benchmarks as
you know with system integrators gaming
benchmarks are really not that special
because these guys aren't making the
980ti they're not making the 6700 tey
which are both two components that are
in here driving gaming performance but
it is still important to look at for an
overview of how this thing performs so
that's what you're looking at right now
the hybrid and 6700 K are able to carry
more than 80 to 90 fps and several games
at 1440p and would be able to push
modest frame rates at 4k which you can
see in one of our previous tests and my
ATI hybrid the 1080p test puts us well
above the 144 Hertz threshold for black
ops
and we observed it no notice will
playback or frame time flaws during
1080p and 1440 be testing across all of
our tests and games you can read more
about these tests on the site which has
a link in the description below we look
at this stuff objectively so I'll leave
the videos and photos to your viewing
for deciding if you like how this looks
but speaking to design not just as
statics there are a lot of things that
IRA Power does very well there's also a
fair few things that they could improve
upon the smallest and most petty
complaint pertains to the enclosures
buried thumb screws in the backside of
the panels the side panel thumb screws
are utterly useless seen as they're
inaccessible unless using a screwdriver
and this is because the screws are
submerged within the panel extrusion the
acrylic window is well done and uses a
quality fairly scratch resistant
material which again is a rarity in
cases I like the presentation of SSD and
GPU components now here's a point of
interest you'll see some of these shots
show our sticker on the side panel
high-power is exploring the option of
more user logo customization which
they've done in the past
and they want to do that for future
system builds but they're not currently
offering the service at this time for
the revolt 2 there are three primary
SKUs of the revolt 2 buyers can
customize the spec to order and our
build is running a non-standard spec
shipped with a gtx 980ti hybrid GPU
upgrade from reference along with a few
other changes bumps our loaner units
price up pretty substantially to 3101
dollars the revolt 2 extreme which is
the highest official SKU without
modification ships from $1,900 runs a
6700 K and unspecified 980 I along with
16 gigabytes of 20 800 megahertz memory
then execute down is the revolt 2 pro at
$1,400 which switches to a GTX 970
dropping another tier from that the
revolt 2 plain build is $900 for a GTX
950 and i5 6500 the value proposition
part for part at the high end is
actually not bad if you were to build
and buy with the exact same parts found
for the revolt 2 high-end systems the
cost is only about $134 more than doing
it yourself and that comes with Windows
and with a custom case so the overhead
is really not that bad but as you all
know the price could change it
drastically bright dropping to a low
respect PSU changing your other specs
within the system to use cheaper parts
but that's not really how it works with
system integrators because this is some
behind-the-scenes knowledge for you all
these s eyes often get MDF sore
marketing development funds and they get
heavy discounts from certain partners
when they're trying to move inventory so
that's why their prices can sometimes
directly match or on rare occasion may
be undercut what is possible through DIY
but it's also why there's a limited
component selection all in all the
revolt 2 is a pretty interesting box
just externally it looks interesting
it's got the acrylic window it's a bit
different with the top facing and GPO
faceplate and that's something that
we're seen as a trend now with a 600 C
for DIY routes and I hope it does
continue because it's an interesting
design that's a bit different from what
you used to because the motherboards
inverted to do that so aesthetically
design wise mechanically it's all very
interesting in terms of the performance
the FPS performance was as expected it's
running at 6700 K in this instance in my
ATI hybrid so very strong FPS
performance with no problems at all on
1440p you can even run 4k if you tweaked
your settings a bit you'll see that on
our site and older articles as well so
that's fine thermals are not bad but
they really could use some improvement
and I don't know that I have a good way
to do that without ruining the look of
the case so overall because they're
forcing CLC's or liquid coolers for the
CPU cooler and recommending one in some
cases for the GPU cooler that does help
manage the thermals and mitigate the
impact of sitting basically in a tiny
box that's just heating up and
generating heat that's having trouble to
escape so the liquid coolers help with
that quite tremendously but they're
still in the 50 Celsius Delta range
which is pretty warm for a liquid cooler
to operate delta T over ambient
high power loses some of its good value
at the top and as you shift toward the
lower end skews so the GTX 950 and i-5
combination is somewhat of a curious
choice at $900 as it is possible to
build an i-5 and 960 system for around
800 or so dollars I just did it the
other day actually IRA powers weakest
point isn't its low skew and the value
increases tremendously as the total
price increases so we would advise
against buying that low-end skew unit at
$900 the last item here
to the communication of Io powers team
so we saw that this unit was actually
being shipped with you'll have to follow
me closely here the power supply
selection for a 970 and an i7 was quote
350 watts and then it said three upgrade
to 700 800 watts something like that
something fully reasonable and actually
a bit more than needed
but the 350 watt mark although they are
not shipping that power supply with the
unit they're listing it there to show as
anyone selling a product will do
listen.you there to show hey this is
what we normally give you whether they
do or not here's what you will get as a
value add or perceived value add to the
user I don't have a problem with that
that's pretty normal
the thing I pointed out to IRA power
before filming this review was you know
hey 350 watts is really not something I
feel comfortable with for the particular
configuration we're talking about we did
all the tests it consumes 290 watts at
load that is definitely pushing it
you're at 83 84 % power consumption on
the PSU depending on the quality of the
PSU it might not be enough so why is
that there I know you're shipping with a
7 or 800 watt power supply but maybe
just remove that completely because it
looks bad it does it's not enough power
and anyone who knows that will spot it
immediately and it would reflect poorly
so I had looked at this and they pretty
immediately went and updated the website
and changed the minimum spec to
something more reasonable I think it was
400 450 watts which is completely
acceptable for the build we were
specifically looking at at the time and
then upgrade stayed the same to 7 or 800
watts whatever was so the reason I point
that out is because the wattage was a
concern again whether or not they
shipped with it I didn't like the
wattage I did not at all agree that that
was enough wattage to drive a system
reliably for a number of years and so I
pointed it out and they corrected it and
were pretty level-headed about taking
the criticism and that is something for
which I think some credit is deserved
now that doesn't change what you all
think of the system so whatever you
think of this externally that is your
choice gaming performance is fine a
value proposition is ok at the high end
it loses a lot of value at the low end
then overall the thermals are acceptable
okay but not amazing and certainly not
competing with most ITX cases on the
market about its unique case a shoebox
toast retains that's what he got for
that an interest of full disclosure I my
power was at one of our sponsors at CES
and that does not impact the content in
any way whatsoever our testing was 100%
independent I wrote that in the contract
the testing and the results the analysis
all of this review content entirely
independent and controlled by us but I
did want to lay it out there that full
disclosure they were a sponsor because
there's not a lot of transparency in the
media industry these days so there's
