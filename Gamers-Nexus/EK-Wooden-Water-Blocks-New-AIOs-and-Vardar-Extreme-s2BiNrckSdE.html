sweet now and they have a couple of
pretty interesting things first off a
lot of this stuff still prototype stage
so don't have prices release date stuff
like that but there's actually an
opportunity for some viewer engagement
here because they're looking for
feedback on a few products so comment
below as you watch that buy suppose and
let them know what you think of each
thing before that this video is brought
to you by thermal takes view 37 case the
vo 37 focuses on highlighting custom PC
builds with its full panoramic window
and tinted front acrylic and our thermal
testing the view 37 performed reasonably
well when considering its looks focused
build which is partly thanks to the
airflow design and the removal of a
bottom power supply shroud for a balance
of looks and performance check the link
in the description below for the view 37
the main thing we're be talking about is
I guess we'll start with the UK wooden
is the current codename product so these
are just wood plates for CPU blocks GPU
blocks stuff like that and right now the
idea is basically a custom kind of
one-off CNC wood plate that you can
choose from but if there's enough
interest ek is considering doing more of
a not necessarily mass-produced but a
non mass product so if you're super
interested in these let them know but I
mean basically it's just a cover so it's
a wood cover they have different types
of wood it's more or less handmade so
it's CNC it and then they go through and
hand garnish and stuff like that so kind
of cool definitely very different and
also the fittings have water on them as
well so that's just quick coverage on
though is the more sort of end-user
products will eventually be this thing
so this is a follow up to the phoenix
line that we covered recently semi
recently and it's kind of so it's got
the integrated pump on it right now it's
a prototype the pump in there isn't the
final version so we weren't able to see
the impeller or anything like that but
it is a it looks much larger than it is
because the fans are housed within the
sort of exterior shell of the radiator
and then there's obviously radiator fans
push through it's currently a 240 240 go
and then the block is where it's a bit
interesting as far as I'm concerned
anyway because the block is
more of an open loop style block you can
also detach the fit-in so if you wanted
to go semi open semi closed loop like
with the phoenix line you can do that by
detaching the fittings and then opening
up the loop with presumably future
products so this one doesn't have a name
yet its prototype as stated but
basically a Phoenix follow up it's a bit
less boxy looking than the Phoenix and
has a bit more brand presence on the
block as well so that's kind of what
they're going for with it there's
another one behind it which will have
b-roll of and that is the fluid gaming
Hydra so this one I don't know the
supplier it's not a Sutekh we'll take it
apart eventually and find out a pol tech
is common Dyna Tron's common cool it is
less common probably not cool it so
we'll take it apart later and look at it
but the blocks interesting too otherwise
standard radiator standard fans and I
should mention the fans there's new
Vardar extreme fan which has slightly
different blade design functionally same
idea just digital RGB LEDs on it and
they can be daisy chains so there are
actually two RGB headers on there if you
want to daisy chain them not really
something we typically cover but worth
mentioning so I know the Vardar fans
have a really cult following with our
viewers and then also the outer side
here has eight different color options
so that's your thing they're gonna have
it and then I think we're getting into
some more of the fluid game and stuff on
this side so these are your GPU plates
so there's an aluminum they're both
they're both aluminum options but one is
UV printed and the other one is just an
aluminum plate so this is where the
viewer engagement comes in if you're
interested in either of these let them
know the problem is with an ek fluid
gaming product you're kind of targeting
budget users anyway so once you start
doing fancy stuff with the plate the
price will go up it's just a question of
would you rather get the fluid gaming
aluminum kit with a more customized
block and pay more for it or forego that
stuff and just go with a copper loop and
it's gonna be less fancy looking but
it'll be copper loops to let them know
also the UV printed version would be a
lot cheaper than the aluminum tops
version that I just held up and then the
final thing to talk about is the thread
ripper stuff so thread it for two's
around the corner we don't a hundred
percent for sure no yeah
what the dye orientation or or which
dyes will be populated on tr2 but for
sure we do know that there's gonna be a
24 course Oh not positive but that's if
that's still gonna be too active dyes or
if they're increasing that active dye
count but the velocity STR for blocks
here have been redesigned and it's more
than just RGB LEDs even though that's
what everyone is doing now so the top
basically water comes in splits between
the the micro fins and they have
coverage over the fins so it's not
direct dye in a literal sense that it's
not directly contacting the dye but I
believe the phrase that UK was using
this targeted dye cooling which is
accurate because basically the water
comes in hits the act of dyes then
there's supposed to be a flow jet flow
plate later where you can reorient it so
if you wanted to you can do an a/b test
of where you think the dyes are flip it
and then see if the active dyes are
actually somewhere else
there's something we talked about in our
thread Ripper coverage ages ago but at a
time it looked like pretty much every
thread Ripper CPU had the same two
active dies so it wasn't variable
presumably this can ship in one
configuration it'll work for everything
with tr2 that's where the question comes
in so if those active thighs change for
some reason you would be able to
theoretically flip the orientation so
that you can still cool everything
accurately with the thread reporter CPUs
and that I think that covers most of ek
is stuff they have a whole lot of it
here we'll have some more information if
we do an article that'll be linked in
