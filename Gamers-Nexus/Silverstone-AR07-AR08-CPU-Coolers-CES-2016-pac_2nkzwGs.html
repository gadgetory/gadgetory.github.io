Donette and we're back with more
silverstone content from CES 2016 this
time looking specifically at CPU coolers
and again all this content for CES 2016
is brought to you by Iowa powers revolt
2 small form-factor gaming PC there are
four coolers on the table here we're
gonna be talking about these two larger
ones more specifically first of all this
one is the AR 0 7 and is sort of a
spiritual successor to the AR 0 1 which
we've reviewed at least a year ago and
liked quite a bit it's an 11 5x cooler
so you want to use that on the z series
motherboards for example with the non
extreme series Intel CPUs and that is
because of the cold plate size it's a
bit smaller of a cold plate it's not
going to be perfect for the larger
socket but that's just fine for Z series
or non extreme CPUs as far as the specs
the difference here between the AR 0 1
is primarily that the fan is not 140
millimeters on AR 0 7 the other one was
120 millimeters so that's a bit of an
upgrade the fin design uses a diamond
edge silverstone calls it fin pattern
and that's for turbulence reasons with
airflow at the top there's arrows which
look like a directionality fin but it
does actually serve a functional purpose
and that is to dissipate heat from the
heat pipes which as many of you know
work by using liquid inside the heat
pipe so the heat pipe is filled with
liquid they're not only six millimeters
or eight millimeters and that liquid
heats up goes to the top cools down and
it has a phase change from gas to liquid
and that's where you get your thermal
dissipation and that is basically all
capillary action so the thin design here
at the top should help guide some
airflow from the top edge of that 140
millimeter fan through the heat pipe
channeling and dissipate the heat help
cool it down and turn back into a liquid
on the other side is the AR 0 8 cooler
and that's a bit smaller it's a 92
millimeter form factor has the same fin
design so everything I said about this
is pretty much true over here it's just
smaller for the most part and then these
two are NT so these are NT series
coolers that are used for small
form-factor cases which Silverstone's
got a lot of here today
we've previously talked about the Raven
series I wanted to those types of cases
the small ones the rvz cases and these
also will work with some of the larger
nook boxes or other SFF form factory
cases we've looked at the only real
difference here in terms of what you
would be picking for your enclosure is
height so if you want a slightly taller
or smaller one you'd pick based on the
headroom between your top panel and the
cpu you actually don't want to be too
tight or too far as the thermals could
be worse with a bigger cooler if there's
not enough room and that's where these
come in so for more information as
always check the article link the
description below and then our previous
videos on this mid tower case it's got a
PSU shroud and things like that so check
that in the channel and I will see you
all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
