this nexus dotnet and I'm going to do a
quick tutorial on how to enable the
world editor in your castle story game
it is very simple so first you need to
go to this folder which is you need to
go to your castle story folder wherever
you installed it and then go to info
leaver a question mark and then you're
going to look for menus group txt first
hi highly recommend backing this up so I
just hit ctrl-c ctrl-v on it and made a
backup and now we're going to edit it so
open that up and you will be presented
with this which is really just a bunch
of on/off toggles for different items in
the game if you would like to for
instance enable doors you can just
remove this and you will now have doors
and that's because these are effectively
commenting out that item so it won't be
available in the game with those in
front of it similarly if you want to
disable something you could certainly do
that by adding the same dashes now for
what you came here for which is the
world editor you want to do a ctrl F for
edit T or and there it is or just scroll
down and the easiest way I found to do
this is copy all the items you want
there quite a few and then paste them
under the menu debug what this means is
that if you have debug mode on you will
then have whatever options you've pasted
over here in the debug mode from the
editor mode available for your in-game
world editing so I don't want all this
stuff cluttering up my screen but I do
want crystals trees and let's go for
grass too because that creates flat
ground I'm going to put it at the bottom
and then it will appear at the bottom of
my debug mode and let's see if there's
anything else either a couple cool
smoothing options some plateau options
but we don't really need any of those
right now so I'm going to save this as
is with my edits and then launch castle
story and I will see you in-game okay we
are in castle story now so for
we need to enable debug mode since we
place these options under it and then
launch a game I will create a new one
and once that is launched there it is
we have our brick Tron's of course and
just click on the build icon and there's
debug mode now if you are not familiar
with debug mode it normally ends right
here at the spawn ball option but now I
have added the if you recall the
crystals trees and grass options to the
to the debug mode from the editor and we
can click on for example grass and and I
mean it does exactly as you would expect
it creates grass so if I wanted to I
could smooth out these trees very
rapidly to gain access to flat ground or
well relatively flat ish ground you may
also want the smooth terrain option if
you do want to smooth out terrain
quickly we also added trees so you can
now place trees individually if you'd
like to build something and put trees
strategically around it or something to
make like some kind of cool fort you
could certainly do that and then all the
other options crystals are also in here
so there you go now beyond this I do
have a full FAQ guide going up so please
check the description below for the
article that will have all the
information that you could want about
cast story if it is missing anything
please tell me and I will add guides for
it and with that please like comment and
subscribe as always and I will see you
guys next time
