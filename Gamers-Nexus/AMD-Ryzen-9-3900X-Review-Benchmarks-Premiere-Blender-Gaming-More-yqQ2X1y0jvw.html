positively just before this review went
live this is for the r9 3900 X the 3600
was a strong start to and these third
generation of Rison processors or a
second generation of Zen architecture
and set the stage for continued
dominance in the $200 price range of
desktop CPUs with that framing in mind
it's time to look at the r9 3900 X a
$500 12 core 24 thread CPU that competes
most directly with Intel's I $9.99
hundred K priced roughly around 45 to
$500 for a frequency focused platform
this review will look first at
production workloads like premiere
blender Photoshop v-ray 7-zip and more
and then turn to gaming power
consumption and additional benchmarks
before that this video is brought to you
by gigabytes X 570 ARS master
motherboard built for the true 14 phase
vrm and for a high-end rise in 3000
series builds the gigabyte X 570 master
uses a properly finned heat sink for VR
I'm cooling accompanied by RGB LEDs in
the i/o cover to makes it looks and
performance gigabyte also includes BIOS
flash features to update the motherboard
BIOS without a CPU or RAM the over built
CRM is the major feature on this board
though and gigabyte has a brand new BIOS
for overclocking the new Rison 3003 CPUs
learn more at the link in the
description below so like the r5 3600
review we're going to get straight into
this today because there's too much data
it's too dense we can't really delay on
stuff we might have some additional
information for you in the opening of
the 3600 review so even if you don't
care about that processor which you
should you should watch the first couple
of minutes of it after the ad break and
see if you can get answer sending
additional methodology questions the
basics though 3200 Hertz for everything
that's done because it works on all the
platforms we're testing today including
the first generation of Roizen so we got
a fair comparison across all the
platforms and also it's pretty common to
buy and we'll do memory scaling later
secondly windows 1903 is used for
everything here using the latest BIOS
updates for Intel platforms and we're
using FC 5 for the gigabytes master
motherboard the X 570 master for testing
here and then additionally timings have
been heavily controlled that's all been
stated in the other video so with that
said the 3900 X is the target today is 5
CPU or reviewing that particularly as
compared to the 9900 K which is another
roughly $500 CPU and I think with that
we can get into it so overclocking will
be included power consumption and just
about everything else that you could
want for the most part we have thermals
coming later as well and these are r9
3900 X is highly competitive in v-ray
which is a Kaos group renderer that has
grown in popularity among 3d artists the
array is measured in time until render
completed so lower is better as it means
the work will be proofed or finalized
faster the 3900 X completes our v-ray
benchmark render in 0.75 minutes one
stock in 0.72 minutes when an all-court
overclocked step four point three
gigahertz a time reduction of about 4%
like the r5 3600 reviewed the RO 9:30
isn't a huge overclock but we couldn't
get it to 4.4 gigahertz with SMT enabled
the 9900 K stock CPU following TDP spec
completes the render in 1.1 minutes
marking the stock 3900 acts as requiring
33% less time to render the 9900 K at
5.2 gigahertz manages in 0.95 minutes
behind the overclocked 3900 X by about
14 seconds the 2700 X at 4.2 gigahertz
finished this render slower than the
stock 9900 K at one point one seven
minutes so this is a big leap from core
count for AMD and generationally Adobe
Photoshop is a very different story for
AMD this chart has a clear divide under
the 90 to 600 K at 5.1 gigahertz where
Intel rules uncontested above that this
serves to remind us all that not every
application is 100% thread bound and can
utilize all of those threats Photoshop
likes frequency and that's something we
always demonstrate by highlighting the
9700 K and the 9900 K both at 5.1
gigahertz where there's a 2x thread
differential but nearly identical scores
that's because it's frequency bound the
are 3000 series has picked up
considerably compared to previous Andy
generations with thanks to IPC and
frequency uplift but this frequency
dependence is still shown on the 3900 X
the 3900 X stock CPUs scored
1053 points allowing the stock 9900 K a
lead of 2% this is impressive
generationally for AMD
where the 9900 case stock led the 2700
ex stock CPU by 24% in this case the
overclocked 3900 X is within margin of
error in this test there are some
workloads that only run a few threads
which means that a stock 3900 acts with
a higher boosting stock turbo table will
do better than an all core OC which is
lower than some of the individual core
clocks when running with limited thread
workloads so all core is higher than
stock all core but it's not higher than
the stock limited thread workload boost
overclocking the 9900 K propels it ahead
of its stock results by 7% and ahead of
the stock 3,900 X by 9%
our next benchmark is a cash test our
Janu compiler collection benchmark
compiles GCC with GCC in a sequin
environment but we've also validated on
mingw with emphasis - and see similar
results when we asked Wendell of level 1
text about this he described it as quote
cash hits all the way down note that we
are not benchmarking compilers against
each other or code quality when compiled
but compile time only other compile
solutions may favour Intel more heavily
but presently this is what we use to
test we may add more compilers if we get
good suggestions from the programmers in
our audience with the r9 3900 X tok cpu
the 64 megabyte l3 cache pulls its
weight with risings victim cache
particularly useful compared to intel on
this test as we noted in 3600 review the
r5 3600 stock CPU can outperform the
2700 x OC 4.2 gigahertz CPU here because
it has more cache at 32 vs 16 megabytes
for l3 the our 939 hundred ex pushes to
a seven point one minute compile time
reduced from the our five thirty six
hundred seven point nine minute results
by 10% and time required the all core OC
doesn't matter here
7-zip testing is next for this one we're
using 7-zip compression to benchmark
millions of instructions per second per
device the ro933 PU reaches 100 3435
mips during compression workloads and
that positions it far and away above the
next processor which is the 9900 k
stocks 66,000 mips a lead of 57 percent
for AMD this is a workload that is
heavily thread dependent and that shows
here overclocking - 4.3 gigahertz all
core doesn't do much but it does provide
enough uplift to get us 1.2 percent over
the stock result for the 3900
the i9 9900 K at 5.2 gigahertz jumps to
70,000 553 MIT's but it's not enough to
come close to Andes compression score at
a similar price 7-zip decompression is
next in this testing Intel doze
comparatively significantly better than
in compression verses itself but not vs
the 3900 X the 3900 X still holds a
strong lead it's 140 mm mips vs. 94,000
moves for an overclocked at 9900 K
roughly which puts AMD at about a 52%
lead in this workload when the 3900 X is
stock and the 9900 K is at one of its
best points stock to stock the 3900
axial leads the United 900 K is 85,000
MIPS results by 68 percent compared to
AMD zone r7 2,700 x of last generation
the lead is similar as the 2700 is
roughly tied the 99 hundred KS stock CPU
previously blender is up next we like
this one because it's alter that we
actually used for instance we designed
our GN a 3d teardown crystal with
blender to build a model in 3d space and
get it laser etched into glass so this
is something that we have a lot of
experience with blender is also popular
for animation and is the biggest open
source solution to 3d modeling and
animation with blender 2.79 the GN
monkey head stress test creates a mix to
work load on CPUs that's heavily thread
dependent in this test the ro 939
hundred X doc CPU completes the render
in twelve point eight minutes a
reduction in time required from the 99
hundred K stock CPUs 20 minute results
by 40 percent that's a big climb for the
dollar amount and is thanks in large
part to the thread increase compared to
AMD's our own r7 2,700 X CPU we see a
10-minute render time reduction stock to
stock and overclocking isn't too
different
note that overclocking at 2700 to the
same frequency 4.2 gigahertz wouldn't
have the same results as the 2700 X at
4.2 gigahertz because they are the same
aside from frequency well point out that
CUDA rendering is often faster than CPU
rendering for blender but there are
instances when we use CPU rendering
internally instead for the most part
these instances are when we exceed cuda
memory with a large object or project
file as we can run more system memory
than we can VRAM
or when we need to render a lot of
smaller tiles in a flat image with a lot
of threads which can go faster than the
larger blocks of CUDA our
mad mad is what taught us this part
despite being a flat image we made it in
blender and for this we find CPU
rendering to be faster than GPU
rendering as we can crush the tile size
down to be more efficient to fit the
higher thread count CPUs where one tile
spawns per thread so that's a potential
use case if you didn't know about it
anyway overclocking the 9,900 cake gets
at the sixteen point seven minutes which
is a huge uplift from stock down 18
percent in render time but still not
enough with the GN logo render a more
intensive raytrace seen the stock r9
3900 ax finishes in 15.6 minutes with an
overclocked finishing 5 percent faster
at fourteen point eight minutes or five
percent less time the intel 9900 k stock
CPU takes 26 minutes for this render
with the 2700 x stock cpu at 28 minutes
and 2700 x4 points you gigahertz all
core cpu the same as a 2700 at the same
frequency finishing in twenty-six point
six minutes this meant that previously
Intel was technically in the lead for
blender despite an obvious price
advantage for near equivalent of the 27
or XOC now though Andy not only
leapfrogs Intel at the price point but
also completes the render significantly
faster now
this changes as you go up into h EDT
parts but the price gets blown out of
our comparison for today for those using
the CPU renderers at home the 3900 X is
an easy choice in this sub h EDT class 4
cycles rendering Adobe Premiere CC 2019
renders our next for this one we're
rendering at one of our 1080p videos
from a show floor basically an RNG or an
Eng environment using all a roll and
b-roll our other test is a 4k 60 encode
comprised of a roll and b-roll in the
studio with some luma tree and audio
correction applied for the 1080p render
the AMD r9 3900 X surprised us where the
r5 3600 and Andy's previous are 720 700
X couldn't beat Intel the ro 939 hundred
X is now finally managing to pull ahead
which is a milestone for AMD premiere
first favors frequency and IPC but it
does make use of additional threads
somewhat efficiently just not typically
enough where it helps AMD this is why
the 31 75 X is better than a 1990 DX e
is better than a 9 800 K at rendering
premiere despite the obscene thread
count on the 31 35 X and lower
frequencies
it does actually begin to make a
difference with that many threads anyway
the 3900 X finishes the render in 3.4
minutes when stock come through in three
minutes when overclocked with the 9900 k
completed in three point eight minutes
that's a time reduction of eleven
percent which considering the thread
count is 50% higher is a nonlinear
increase that highlights the importance
of frequency in this test overclocking
the ninety-nine hundred K to five point
one gigahertz gets it to three point six
minutes but that's the most we get out
of the chip note that as always we're
using CUDA acceleration for these so
these are realistic times or someone
actually doing a render for Youtube
upload we are not artificially limiting
it to just the CPU because for youtube
uploads CUDA acceleration is a good
thing the acceleration applies evenly
leaving the CPU on its own to make up
ground where it can and that's where we
start to see the 3900 X pull ahead where
we actually didn't expect it to
originally the 4k sixty render is more
intensive for this one the our 939
hundred X completes the render in nine
minutes with the four point three
gigahertz all core OC finishing an eight
point eight minutes the ninety nine
hundred K at stock settings and TDP
finishes in eleven point nine minutes
were ten point seven one overclock to
five point one gigahertz the end result
is an eighteen percent time reduction
for the overclocked 3900 X versus the
overclocked at ninety nine hundred K and
for generational perspective although
core counts are not equal the 3900 X our
performs the 2700 X at 4.2 gigahertz
ranked at twelve twenty eight minutes by
30% and the 1700 at three point nine
gigahertz at four point eight two
minutes by 37 percent time reduction
this is mostly from more threads and
that's obviously important here but to
be fair the price is also a bit higher
so the 3700 X will be an interesting
comparison for this one which will be in
a separate review for us before getting
started we need to take a look at how
frequency boosting behavior is on the
3900 X we did this for the 3600 as well
and it helps to illustrate all core
turbos under good thermal conditions in
a blender all core workload the
frequency average is about forty
eighty-seven megahertz across all cores
if you're wondering why the frequency
isn't hitting the advertised boost of
4.6 gigahertz
that's because the listed boost
frequencies only apply for limited
thread load scenarios which blender is
not well next intentionally zoom in on
the charge shifting the y-axis around to
four thousand
and stopping at 4200 megahertz we're
also going to just dump all the lines on
the chart at once even though it's not
particularly legible as you can see here
the Coors boost up and down bouncing
between the 40 50 megahertz and 40 100
megahertz range and alternating patterns
between each core the only time
frequency ever exceeds 40 100 megahertz
is in the pre-test idle period shadow of
the tomb-raiders the last one will show
same thing we're just dumping them all
on the chart at the same time as shown
here forty six hundred megahertz is
sparingly reached under single core work
loads which are uncommon in these
applications except between loading for
example for the rest of the gaming
scenario where around 40 200 240 225 my
guards sometimes up to 40 to 75 mega
Hertz or 40 300 megahertz it all just
depends on how many cores are actively
loaded
total war Warhammer to testing is up
first we use the battle and the campaign
benchmarks for this the campaign map
benchmark is our preferred total war
Warhammer to CPU test with a greater
reliance on CPU power than the battle
benchmark and last GPU intensive effects
as predicted the distance to the 99
hundred K is wider than with the battle
results stock versus stock the Intel
9900 K at 179 FPS average is 28% ahead
of the 3900 X is 140 FPS average these
two CPUs are mostly tied and 1% and 0.1%
low values and there's no perceptible
difference to frame time fluidity to the
user for frame times but the 9900 K does
have a meaningful improvement in average
frame rate overall overclocking the 3900
actually yielded some of the best
results here that we've seen on a 3000
series part so far placing it 4% ahead
so all core overclocking clearly not
necessarily the most worthwhile endeavor
on the 3900 X the 9900 case 5.1
gigahertz OC is an even greater 30.9%
ahead an average FPS versus the 3900 X
at four point three gigahertz all corso
OC vs. Oh see this is a worst case
scenario for the 3900 X competitively
it's a game that doesn't benefit from
high thread counts that much as
illustrated by the stock 9600 K and
multiple generations of old CPUs like
the 7700 K ranking pretty high on the
charts and it strongly corresponds to
increases
frequency and performs worse with SMT
enabled disabling SMT and overclocking
the 4.4 gigahertz pops the 3900 X
average up to 131 fps from 140 with some
respectable improvement in the 1% 0.1%
lows as well pushing it past any of the
36 hundreds results with that sums he on
the 3600 actually outperformed the 3900
X both stock and OC partly due to
thready utilization and scheduling in
this title and because of how the all
core frequencies behave with boosting
differences between the 3600 3900 X the
story is mostly the same at 1440p but
with results at the upper end limited by
the GPU as they were in the battle
benchmarks note that the overclock to
9900 K drops from 190 FPS average out
1080p down to 174 FPS average at 1440p
while the 3900 axis results are hardly
affected this indicates that we are
bottlenecking on a GPU over the 900k but
that the 3900 X is limiting the GPU in
its test the battle benchmark is up next
at 1080p if the 9900 K at one so d1 FPS
average is about 7.5% I had of the 3900
axes 159 FPS average stock versus stock
but as we mentioned before the battle
benchmark becomes GPU limited towards
the upper end of the charge even at
1080p the lack of major improvement
between the stock and 5.1 gigahertz
overclock of the 9900 K indicates that
FPS averages will max out at about 175
FPS with these settings and with the GPU
we're using and we may see a wider gap
in other games without this limitation
this is further proven by looking at the
9600 K and 9700 k OC positions which
illustrate a GPU bottleneck overclocking
did a little better for the 3900 X
ranking at 165 FPS average but it's
still only a 3.3 percent
uplift at 4.3 gigahertz all core as I am
DS per core boosting and games keeps up
with the best all core clocks that we
can push the r5 3600 at 159 FPS average
is performing function equally to the
3900 acts in this benchmark and as a
nearing error for 0on percent lows
although not quite as with the 3600
disabling an SMT to limit the 3900 x2 12
cores and 12 threads had a more positive
impact on performance than the 24 thread
all core overclock this
time we also overclocked it to 4.4
gigahertz with SMT off allowing the 3900
ex to stretch to 167 FPS average to be
very clear here we wouldn't recommend
disabling SMT on any of these processors
as it's hit and miss in games and
obviously cuts production workloads in
half this is more of an exercise to
learn about the performance f1 2018 is
next this is a DirectX 11 game and gives
us a look at the ego engine the stated
competitor for the 3900 X is the 9900 K
but f1 at 1080p is another task for the
9900 K is far ahead about 13.5 percent
stock versus stock with a 313 FBS
average - the 3900 access to 76 FPS
average the modest 3.6 percent
improvement in the 3900 access score
from a 4.3 gigahertz overclock it does
close the gap somewhat jumping to 286
FPS average as the 5.1 gigahertz OC on
the monday had barely any effect and it
was bouncing off of GPU limits this is
another title where SMT overhead hurts
the 3900 axis performance although not
so much that it drops to 3600 levels
this time
disabling SMT and overclocking to 4.4
gigahertz lands it at 302 FPS average
closing much of the gap although it
again advised against disabling SMT in
actual use the narrower range of results
at 1440p means that mean the 3900 X is
effectively equal and performance to the
cheaper r5 3600 whether that's stock
with an overclock that's not likely due
to a GPU hardware limitation elsewhere
in this test either moving on to
civilization 6 this game uses a turn
time benchmark rather than an FPS
benchmark for our charts this is useful
for indicating how long it takes each of
the 5 AI players to process its turn
before passing to the next player if the
average turn time for example is 30
seconds it would take 150 seconds after
clicking n to turn to return to the
players next move
civilization 6 suffers from the same
problems with SMT overhead that's one of
the other titles do based on the 3606
core 6 thread results and the six core
12 thread results for that same
processor but it's also the only game
benchmark that we score by average turn
time instead of FPS I mean you know GPU
bottleneck in for even the high-end CPUs
lower is better and every fraction of a
second is significant because of the low
variance between the runs and all core
overclocked and 4.3
only reduce to turn time by 3.7 percent
which is a fair indication of what's
happening in the sieve benchmark the
advertised boost clock for the 3900 X is
4.6 gigahertz so in benchmarks that
allow the CPU to read single core boost
clock the OC results may actually be
worse than stock disable an SMT and
pushing the OC to 4.4 gigahertz cut the
average time further but even with this
best case scenario the thirty point four
second average turn time for the 3900 X
allows the 9900 K to remain 2.3 percent
shorter in turn times overclock in the
99th K gets it down to 28 point two
seconds which is a 7% reduction versus
the best case 3900 X Assassin's Creed
origins is our next test as we
highlighted in the r5 3600 review this
game actually likes both cores and
frequency with some level of balance
making it one of the best balanced
gaming benchmarks we use for CP reviews
of all the games we tested assassin's
creed gives the 3900 X the best shot at
leveraging its 24 threads as with the
3600 turning SMT off worsened
performance even with the moderate clock
speed increases as it ideally should so
we can ignore these numbers for once the
3900 X doc CPU performed at 134 FPS
average with low as well paced at 93 FPS
1% and 80 for FPS 0.1% and disabling an
SMT while overclocking brought down the
FPS to 120 for a reduction of 8% with
settings that were best-case scenarios
in other games but obviously not all of
them the stock 9900 K runs at 140 FPS
average here and is beginning to bounce
off of 28 eti limits pushing just 4.3%
ahead of the stock 3900 acts as a result
this is a GPU limitation and other
benchmarks with less of a GPU bottleneck
we've seen ranges between 13 and 30%
advantage for the 9900 K when both
products are overclocked for example so
it all depends on how the game responds
to frequency versus threads although
there does seem to be a mean for name
forming that about 13% that said the
3900 exit does pull ahead and 1% and
0.1% lows we occasionally have some
trouble with stuttering an assassin's
creed origins that affects the 0.1% lows
but the 1% lowest sample and up frames
that it's safe to say the 3900 acts is
ahead and frame pacing here the stock
3900
also outperforms the stock 3600 by 17.2%
a refreshingly straightforward advantage
for the higher-end part overclocking the
3900 acts barely improved the average
and it worsened the lows which is to do
with the way the frequency bounces
around based on boost as opposed to the
all core overclock when it's locked this
frame time plot will help illustrate
what's happening remember that these are
the raw numbers from which fps is
derived and so Stan is the most accurate
representation of real gaming experience
and frame-to-frame fluidity is just a
little harder to compartmentalize so
don't use it for every game the 9900 K
starts with overall frame to frame
intervals lower than the 3900 X which is
a positive thing for the Intel 9900 K
lower is better but more consistent is
best for reference sixteen point six 67
milliseconds would be 60 fps the 9900 K
encounters the same amount of spikes in
testing as the 3900 X as this game has a
less flat line than others but its
spikes are more frequently beyond 12
milliseconds this isn't bad on its own
but an excursion from the mean greater
than 8 to 12 milliseconds does start to
become noticeable as a stutter the AMD
r9 3900 X has a higher frame times
overall at roughly 6 to 8 milliseconds
versus intel's five to seven millisecond
range average but it spikes don't hit
the same higher peaks that intel does so
this is why the 3900 X does better in
frame pacing once we use the average bar
chart that we saw earlier the 1440p
results are like the 1080p results but
compressed with a GPU bottleneck now
becoming more apparent overclocking had
no significant effect on either the 1900
k / 3900 acts at this resolution and the
3900 axes lead over the 3600 shrink-down
24.3% there's a reason we still test
CPUs at 1080p even as high resolutions
become popular but this chart allows us
to see that even 1440p does have points
where the CPU start to matter at least
for the high-end GPUs as an aside take a
look at the r5 3600 SMT off results or
the 3900 axes for that matter see what
happens to frame time performance as I
am these threads are disabled with this
game it actually matters in this one GTA
5 is next and is our geriatric came on
the benchmark it's still a top played
game on Steam
and it's the x11 implementation is a
traditional one so we like to include it
the 9900 k leads the 3900 acts in GTA v
stock ranked at 122 FPS average versus
the 3900 X is one 10 FPS average that's
a lead of 11% for the Intel part
although Intel is still ahead it's
leaders shrinking with each generation
versus the 2700 X the stock CPU the
results of 90 3.6 FPS average allowed
Intel to manage a lead of 31% so this
new climb is significant and most of it
is to do with IPC and frequency although
in some games the thread count actually
matters just not particularly this one
the 9900 K improves more with an
overclock than the 3900 acted as
predictably moving to 131 FPS average
versus 113 FPS average of the
overclocked 3900 X that's because the
3900 X is already nearing its maximum
performance potential without extreme
cooling with the CPUs we've tested so
far GTA doesn't scale up and performs
much with thread counts higher than four
so the 3900 X is 5.4 percent gain an
average FPS versus the 3600 is mostly
down to higher clocks the 12 core 12
thread a 4.4 gigahertz overclock pushed
the average FPS up to 118 point five
past 113 for the 4.3 gigahertz 12 core
24 thread OC seemingly completely
unaffected by the loss of threads as
discussed in the 3,600 review the GTA
results we've gathered so far are almost
identical at 1080p and 1440p thanks to
the CPU heavy settings we use in the
game but we wanted to show this chart
anyway just to give you some extra data
shout over the tomb Raider's next using
a modified crystal engine and DirectX 12
then I heard K performs at 170 FPS
average one stock placing it as 18.6%
past the 3900 axis stock 143 FPS average
result and that's with Intel CPU
becoming GPU limited at the top of the
chart despite the GPU limit we have
never tested below 1080p in Jen's
history actually for desktop CPU
benchmarks as we don't believe it to be
an accurate representation of real use I
think the last time we used it might
have been for a fraps versus shadowplay
recording comparison but not for gaming
benchmarks so 1080p is and has been our
floor if it bottlenecks here we just
make a note and move on shadow of the
Tomb Raider seems to only benefit from
SMT up to a point
although enabling SMT
tank the 3900 access performance as it
does in some other benchmarks
overclocking the 3900 acts only got its
average FPS score up 2% but disabling
SMT in combination with a slightly
higher overclock raised by 6.6 percent
even at stock though the 3900 X
outperforms any of the 36 hundreds
results hitman 2 is our last game
benchmark a pattern is emerging with him
and to where the 8 core 16 thread 900k
and 12 core 24 thread 3900 acts both
benefit from disabling multi-threading
while at least 6 core 12 thread 3600
part performs better with SMT on and we
can highlight the SMT off result to
illustrate that it's not as simple as
just saying more than 12 threads is bad
though because the 8 core 16 thread 1700
outperforms the 6 core 12 thread 1600
both stock and overclocked what we can
say for now is that hitman to strongly
benefits from more threads up to a point
and begins to scale negatively past that
point both for AMD and Intel in any case
the stock 3900 act still outperforms any
of the 36 hundreds results and the stock
9900 K surpasses the stock 3900 acts by
12.9% running at 136 FPS average vs. 121
FPS average when both the 9900 K and
3900 ax are stock disabling hyper
threading and seen such uplift
illustrates that we are not GPU
bottlenecks in this title so it joins
the list of titles usable to illustrate
the full range of scaling between the
two stock CPUs overclocking offers a
slight improvement for each but nothing
major for either CPU we showed power
testing an hour our 5 3600 review but
we'll quickly go over it again here and
a blender workload at 100% saturation
across all threads the AMD r9 3900 X
stock CPU ends up measuring at 148
watched on the EPS 12 volt cables which
is far away from the TDP designation of
105 watts it's not even close
technically TDP is not one-to-one with
power consumption but it's close and
being at 148 to 105 is a big difference
we need to investigate these BIOS
versions and see what's going on with
the different platforms for what it's
worth the platform does operate within
TDP bounds during gaming workloads but
not in all core loads like blender we
think this may have to do with the stock
Auto voltages on some early motherboards
but we're not positive just yet there
isn't an mze equivalent option that we
found
and PBO is disabled than all of our
review content unless otherwise stated
because it's not within spec for hitman
two just as a quick measurement we see
power consumption more reasonably
situated at seventy six watts stock
you'll notice that our overclock here
consumes less power than the stock CPU
by a few watts that's because we were
able to tune voltage down below what was
Auto selected in this workload more
power and thermal discussion after we
survive the launch day this was already
too much to do at the time we had so
we'll table the rest of it for now
there's a lot more testing we still want
to do for example we still need to dig
into the thermals we need to look into
the power some more we really want to
look into streaming some more for our
standalone streaming benchmarks and a
couple of other ideas we have for scaley
and testing so it's just there were so
many products that watch this time that
we decided to review about four five of
them five of them and in the two launch
day period and then we'll just circle
back for the other stuff later so hand
tight with us for a couple days whole we
go through all the follow-up testing but
there's a lot more to do yet so power
consumptions our only big remaining
question mark at this point other than
some additional testing you want to do
elsewhere and we won't spoil too much of
that now but as stated it's it's been
like 16 to 20 hours a day for a week and
all of this is the result multiple
videos multiple 30-minute lon really
detailed testing and reviews so we're
not going to dig into the power anymore
right now we need to because it seems to
be a bit high and the Intel platform if
you disable MCE you get it down to
almost exactly in tell us to find TDP
number and again TDP is not one-to-one
but it's really close because ultimately
it all turns into into heat anyway and
into power but yeah so we need to look
into that more and the power consumption
of the chip could relate to auto
voltages they are a bit high and that
does lead into another interesting topic
which is that on the positive side our
r9 3900 ex seems to be we're new to this
platform of course everyone is but it
seems to be a good overclocker so the
voltage was about 1.3 Ford's 1.35 for
that one to hold all court at four point
three we could not get to four point
four on anything until we disabled SMT
on the 3900 X and then we can do four
point four gigahertz that is so four
point three seems to be about the max
for all the processors we've tested so
far doesn't matter the voltage up until
you get to extreme cooling then it'll
matter of course and the higher-end CPUs
have performed better than the low end
CPU we test at the 3600 sample size of
one of each so it doesn't really count
but gives you an idea in theory the
higher NCVS should be been better anyway
because there they have more things
enabled so that would make sense
anyway the 3900 X is a powerhouse and
applications that are thread and cash
bound and calling it a competitor to the
9900 K and these tasks isn't hyperbole
on a and these part for production
workloads it's often better as a CPU by
a considerable margin sometimes north of
50% once or twice north of 60% much of
that is due to the 3900 X's 24 threads
though and AMD has been making thread
ripper chips with even higher core
counts for some time now some of which
are now on Steve sales and dropping
below the nine adder decay in price the
3900 axon needs to strike a balance
between gaming and production
performance to be something new and to
compete with the 9900 K in a way that
thread ripper doesn't already the
results are mixed the 9900 K is just
better in non thread bound applications
and and II can't force game developers
to just flip a switch and make
everything thread focused overnight
which is something we've been talking
about for a few years now the 3900 act
continues the legacy of the previous
Rison processors where we can
confidently recommend it as a mixed
workload cpu and we can confidently
recommend the r5 period so that's a good
place with r5 to be but the 3900 acts
were more in the range of it's it
depends it's not as simple as the r5 is
with 3900 X we can recommend it in mixed
workloads we can recommend it in sort of
budget and budget and quotes tier
production workloads and
that's if you don't want to just buy a
used AMD processor from the last couple
of generations because you can get these
older ish processors for significantly
discounted this one
100 is regularly 200 bucks now now the
3900 X is much more powerful than that
so it's not as simple as the 2700 X
versus the 3700 X but it's a
consideration if you're honest a much
stricter budget and thread Ripper as
noted it has also routinely been sale
first-gen thread if it does have quite a
few deficiencies in some areas that the
3900 X solves but if you only need
threads it's worth considering for a
cheaper solution that's not to take away
from the 3900 X though it does well in
these workloads gaming so for gaming
workloads the recommendation if you're
pure gaming high refresh don't care
about anything else never work with any
other applications maybe work with
premier now and then it's close enough
to the 3900 X although and he does
notably outperform Intel in our test and
premier for once and a head-to-head but
if you're mostly gaming and maybe
premier now and then or Photoshop then
Intel would get the recommendation still
the 3900 X does isn't it's not a clean
sweep it's a good processor but it's not
good at everything all the time and
that's fine it doesn't need to be so we
would recommend the 3600 almost always
at its price category specifically at
about $200 except for against the older
processors that you get for cheap we're
only talking modern stuff that's still
being made so where we would recommend
that basically everywhere the 3900 acts
we reserve recommendations for mixed
workload user who genuinely actually
does some production type of tasks on
the side maybe you're a hobbyist video
editor maybe you do 3d animation and
modeling and you render with the CPU
things like that then or transcoding a
compression especially decompression
stuff like that if you do any of that
mixed with gaming it's a good choice if
you only game it's still gonna be the
99er K from us so that's it for this one
