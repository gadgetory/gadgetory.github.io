news recap for the week for this one we
have a sort of final word on the verge
following a series of Twitter
interactions by its editor-in-chief and
we won't be revisiting this topic unless
they really give us a reason to do so at
this point and in addition to that Intel
continues its expansion and video post
fourth quarter 2019 our Dean's there
their finances are really weird it's
normal for them they're not actually
predicting the future seventy percent of
windows patches are surprised to address
memory issues and more before that this
video is brought to you by us and the GN
store the best way to support us and
what we stand for is by picking up one
of our GN shirts like the GPU artifact
in shirt or to town lightweight hoodies
a new medium system building mod mat
with GPU Tara on graphics G on mousepads
or our cobalt blue beer glasses with
gold trim we greatly appreciate the
community support and will continue
giving back all that we can as we grow
support today at store doc gamers Nexus
dotnet or click the link below we're
gonna try and focus on the positives for
this one that kind of closed the
storyline out so the verge posted an
article responding to criticism we
posted a video Paul did Jay did boogie
who's a very well-known youtuber did and
there were a couple others review tech
USA did and so I mean kind of it was a
very tone-deaf response that they post
and we'll go through some of it here but
not all of it doesn't really deserve it
we invited Knightley Patel the
editor-in-chief of the verge and copy
editor to cool to capitalize the letters
in his own name to come out to our
studio to discuss this matter on camera
alternatively if he didn't have time we
offered to fly up to New York pay for
our our own flights or hotel or his own
flight in hotel to do something on
camera and talk about this sort of the
whole series I mean talk about the
original video talk about the response
which was to copyright strike Kyle and
review tech USA and he did answer on
Twitter his response was quote nah I've
said all I'm gonna say ask me for
comment before you make a video next
time go make something positive for the
world so I wasn't that mad at this a
couple of you did defend us on Twitter
of course I'm appreciative of that but
it really doesn't make me that either
this is clearly coming from someone who
doesn't know what
about us doesn't know anything beyond
the one video we made criticizing his
company's very poor choices so I let it
slide but I did of course have a
response so the obvious question is well
did you contact Kyle or review tech USA
before filing copyright strikes I don't
know four months after the video went
out that timeline sort of indicates some
kind of motive there this clearly wasn't
just like hey that's that's our content
and we don't think they're using it
properly it was four months have gone by
maybe no one will notice when we get rid
of this very embarrassing footage so in
following up on this we said you know
yeah did you contact Kyle you must
realize the irony in that statement and
judging by this response you still have
quite a few things you'd like to say
airfare is on us and following this
because at night.i patel did challenge
us to quote go make something positive
for the world in an attempt to be
incredibly insulting but kind of failed
I I do want to deviate from the verge
and focus on the positive of the story
that he has called for and note that we
donated all advertising proceeds from
The Verge video which was just $270 at
the time we checked plus an additional
$1,000 from my own a pocket to the Eden
reforestation projects a charity that
I'm personally very very supportive of
and have given you regularly over the
past several months now so we gave them
twelve hundred seventy dollars we
challenged Knightley Patel or the verge
to match our donation to a charity of
their choice and so just to kind of
explain what this one is the eaton
reforestation project goes around to
different parts of the world where they
have been heavily deforested and because
often because the individuals who live
there need to use those natural
resources to try and get some economic
benefit so in doing this the Eden
reforestation project goes to those
countries it employs the extremely
impoverished individuals who live in the
villages nearby VT forested regions it
helps them grow trees that are native to
the area and it pays them to do so so
these people get employment they have a
sense of attachment to the forest that
they're planting which should help
defend it in the future a lot of the
forests have agreements with governments
or
landowners to exist in perpetuity and
obviously it also helps offset some
climate change concerns so it's it's a
as a a mountain biker it's obviously an
incredibly important thing to me because
I kind of need the trees to go riding so
and then also it's got other benefits to
like helping out people in extreme
poverty and establishing some kind of
additional assistance for climate change
for any of you who feel inspired by our
actions or inspired by the dickish nosov
The Verge if you want to donate to a
charity in reforestation projects is
great but you might have one in mind
that you like feel free to do so and
then tweet a screenshot of it removed
personal information and do this do a
hashtag something positive and then tag
at reckless that's that be the
editor-in-chief re ce que le SS and at
gamers and axis and let's flood his feed
with something positive even if it's a
dollar just to let him know that the
tech YouTube community didn't do this to
get him or get his company but did the
Virg videos because they needed to be
done and that we are capable of hashtag
something positive so that is our
something positive for the world clearly
again mr. Patel knows nothing about us
or what we do
mr. Patel replied to every single one of
our tweets that addressed him directly
but did not respond to this one which is
I guess wants to put money on the table
everyone shuts up so you know The Verge
Neely Apatow if you really mean it if
you're really going to make this
statement of do something positive for
the world and try to be hurtful then I
challenge you to do the same I challenge
you to do something positive with the
massive resources that you obviously
have to be able to afford to send
lawyers after youtubers who made videos
four months ago which are probably up
until this point barely getting views
although the Streisand effect is now in
full effect so job well done I suppose
anyway that's our challenge to the verge
as a side note if the Virg
wants to do an additional challenge we
would be happy to host them locally in
our office we would be happy to pay for
their airfare and local lodging and if
the verge is interested perhaps rather
than a discussion on well this and how
poorly executed it was we would be happy
to instead not even mention that stuff I
will not say a word about the PC build
video I will not say a word about the
port response after and instead we do a
PC building race you can bring out
whichever editor you want we'll build
against each other on livestream and
then we'll donate any super chats to
charity so that is my final challenge to
the verge and just to recap you on this
for those of you who didn't follow this
stuff Kyle contacted YouTube had his
video reinstated YouTube replied to Kyle
and forwarded their email that they sent
to the verge to Kyle which stated a high
the verge we are very concerned that
your copyright notification may not be
valid for some or all of the videos
identified in your notification please
keep in mind that in many countries it
is legal to use copyrighted works in
specific ways about the owners
authorization particularly for
transformative purposes and the Virgin's
response when they did post their
article that I'm not really going to go
in-depth on did actually in the tweets
Nilay Patel did say that our videos were
all a coordinated attack they were a
coordinated harassment campaign that is
for the specific words used which is
just kind of a really it's like a victim
card thing to do like you do realize
that you hit Kyle first right like you
don't you don't punch someone and then
when they respond you're not like yeah
he is attacking me so anyway the article
complains that everyone should have
simply reached out to him directly even
though he never reached out to anyone
directly and this was still several
months after the videos might have also
said this all could have been avoided if
the party has simply reached out
directly to me and Paul responded to
this and I'm just gonna quote him
because he said it the best at reckless
or the editor-in-chief of The Verge is
oblivious to what hypocrisy is given
that Vox Media Inc didn't do the same
before drafting legal paperwork to issue
Kyle and Richard strikes
and in response to some of the criticism
Nilay Patel said quote I mean I was a
copyright attorney we can go 10 rounds
on 4 factors but the point is our legal
team didn't think these videos met the
definition and YouTube agreed I reversed
that decision
a quick note there is no proof that
YouTube agreed there is proof however
that YouTube agreed with Kyle's response
to this anyway a final quote here from
mr. Patel to be clear I didn't reverse
their decision or analysis of fair use
which I still agree with I reverse the
decision to act on it using the YouTube
copyright strike system which everyone
agrees is broken a little bit what what
so post all of these articles about
YouTube's copyright strike system is
broken
file copyright strikes YouTube's
copyright strike system is broken I've
got I think I have whiplash from this
anyway so the exchange just went on for
a while there's no reason reason to go
through them Paul cornered mr. Patel
several times on Twitter excellent job
haha all he did was ask some questions I
don't think he really wasn't didn't he
wasn't trying to and Paul's question was
did you ask Kyle for comment if not your
complaint that we didn't reach out
carries your weight to which they
responded I don't think our team should
use the strike system no which is why I
reversed it and then Paul said you
didn't answer my question
and then he failed to answer it again
and then Paul said well then obviously
you're the victim here at the mercy of
the techies who were coordinated
harassment brigade which we activated
because we are evil pawpaws awesome
I should subscribe to me if you're not
at Paul's Hardware anyway Nilay Patel
who is either illiterate or incapable of
answering a question probably shouldn't
be the editor in chief if he cannot take
criticism and it cannot answer a simple
question of did you contact Kyle to
which the response was I don't think our
team should use the system comma no
period what whatever anyway anyway in
reforestation project is a fantastic
organization they have a really low
operating overhead I was happy to donate
the proceeds of that video to them for
anyone whose
be a cynic about this because it does
happen no I don't get a tax write-off
for that I take a standard deductible so
it's just money out of my pocket but if
you would like to contribute to them
I'll link their their charity in the
description below and we are of course
happy to make something positive out of
this as a new way Patel suggested
despite his ill intent we have accepted
his challenge and now challenged him to
do something positive as well or join us
on the show but probably too scared to
do that
so anyway Supermicro renewed focus on
consumer motherboards and talking about
things that aren't the verge it seems
that Supermicro is keen on a renewed
focus for high-end consumer motherboards
and this is pretty exciting this is
particularly in the gaming segment Super
Micro has a very large grasp on the
server enterprise market Super Micro
recently spoke with kit guru which is a
site that we also enjoy reading so in
speaking with guru Vic Malala the senior
vice president of field application
engineering and business development
stated that the company intends to
return to the fold of gaming later this
year and this would be to join the ranks
of Asus gigabyte MSI at all the quote
here was in 2019 we will put the pedal
to the metal setting the record itself
showed that we are here but it doesn't
mean anything unless we bring the right
product to the consumer to the customer
we're here to make an impact
they said one point that Super Micro
reiterated a couple of times is that
their top position is in of course
server data center spaces and so they
are a big company even though you might
not recognize the name if you only do
gaming and this afford Super Micro at
thanks some unique access to
technologies one of their key places
they expect to compete as in ddr5 pretty
exciting here and PCIe gen for something
that will become relevant this year so
this is what Super Micro calls its
secret sauce which is sort of a gross
phrase yes but that's what it is I guess
often associate secret sauce with
motherboards especially after the verge
video where they dumped thermal paste
all over their motherboard it's kind of
a secret sauce of the verge so once upon
a time back in the 90s Super Micro was
something that
a household name really and the boards
could be found in a lot of om systems
you can look around at companies like
Dell HP so forth and over the last
decade decade and a half they've really
pivoted to the higher margin server
space so Super Micro is pedigree in the
server marquee could make for a really
interesting consumer motherboard they
have some some unique capabilities some
unique engineering talent that they
could bring into the gaming space and
put a new spin on gaming motherboards we
are excited to see what they do
hopefully it's something good the first
round of course is always the most
difficult when making a product in a
different segment but we'll see how they
do and of course you can check out kit
gurus article for more on this we we do
like their content so worth the read
next up Ireland is next on Intel's
expansion roadmap and a quick note as
always we'll have links to the sources
in the show notes below if you do want
to check out the source websites for
these so this one is from both the Intel
newsroom their official newsroom and the
Irish Times comm business section until
recently confirmed it's Oregon expansion
plans in the US we talked about this
previously a couple of times now and
we've also reported on the rumored plans
which are becoming more final for Israel
development where Intel has a large
fabrication facility as well
so now Ireland is next up on Intel's
plot for world domination with
fabrication plants and in that it looks
like Ireland could potentially see a
multi-billion dollar expansion something
that's also going on again potentially
in Israel and in an Oregon in the u.s.
so this coincides with Intel's
announcement last year that these sites
would receive multi-year manufacturing
expansions to operations this is
presumably to prepare for the incoming
processing nodes expanding business and
to put Intel in a better position to
meet demand in the future so that the 14
nanometer shortage doesn't happen again
because that's been a bit of a the crux
of Intel's problems lately now Intel
recently confirmed that it has submitted
documents to kildare County Council for
revisions and expansion to a planning
permission that was granted in 2017 the
new proposal details an estimated 8
billion dollar expansion plan at the
likes lip campus beyond what was
originally planned in 2017 and was
picked up by local news
the irish times so the expansion should
see construction of a 110,000 square
foot fabrication space and fabrication
I'm sure everyone for the most parts
aware but when you talk about a fab
blant that is specifically referring to
silicon fabrication so it's a bit
different from like for example just a
factory just a generic factory that
might make motherboards or heat sinks or
something
so Intel's got 110,000 square foot
building an expansion planned and it
should employ 3,000 construction
professionals they say an additional
1600 jobs once the factory is online in
a more permanent capacity and the
proposal also includes plans for
widening the nearby streets so it is
quite detailed if you really want to
read about local planning and logistics
of streets you can do it on the Intel
newsroom and I our times wouldn't go
into their official plans so shuttle bus
service for staff planting 6,000 trees
12,000 shrubs yes it goes that detailed
it's really a riveting read it's it just
it grasps you and you are stuck at the
edge of the your seat because because
you're reading about shrubbery Saha MIT
research on strain engineering and
diamond and CPUs is actually a really
interesting story in the past for our
news stories MIT has been the the source
of a lot of just just really cool
science obviously it's MIT but it's
stuff that we might see eventually in in
the field it's not anytime soon this
however does go into talking about
Dimond as a potential replacement or use
in addition to existing silicon for CPUs
so it's been known for a while now that
modulating a strain on semiconductors
can augment the properties of that
semiconductor which leads to changing
performance or thermal properties which
also change the performance and finally
the exact amount of Bend opens up quote
100 million calculations if we want to
map out the entire lastic strain space
which MIT News says so researchers at
MIT joined by scientists in Russia and
Singapore have employed AI to explore
the possibilities Australian engineering
researchers in conjunction with their
neural network algorithms have studied
the tuning of the bandgap in both
silicon and diamond daven to elgianne
ler from MIT News sums it up as
following because to be honest we can't
do it better so we'll just quote him
tuning of a bandgap can be a key tool
for improving the efficiency of a device
such as a silicon solar cell by getting
it to match more precisely the kind of
energy source that it is designed to
harness by fine tuning in its bandgap
for example it may be possible to make a
silicon solar cell that is just as
effective at capturing sunlight as its
counterparts but is only one thousandth
as thick in theory the material can even
change from a semiconductor to a metal
and that would have many applications if
that's doable and mass-produced product
which is a quote from another engineer
at MIT research or in this project
anyway
so the research also found that this is
the kind of cool part that diamonds
could one day be a theoretical
replacement for silicon so Julie MIT
professor of nuclear science and
engineering end of material science and
engineering stated that compared to
silicon technology diamond could perform
100,000 times better in specific
applications however diamonds as
semiconductors are still just an idea
it's completely in its infancy this
isn't something that's happening anytime
soon like any time the next couple of
years the verge will probably learn how
to build a better computer by the time
this happens so maybe sometime in the
next couple of decades so it's a new
idea it poses unique challenges like
being able to properly mount them just
to the substrate so everything changes
with this approach very interesting
though and a great read from news
mit.edu and it is the artificial
intelligence engineering of microchips
article TSMC will ramp seven nanometer
EUV in late march UV extreme ultraviolet
is sort of the holy grail of fabrication
technology for summit for silicon and
this has been something that's been
discussed for decades now but it's been
really hard to get done us and now UV is
finally being applied to things like
seven nanometers so a lot of cool stuff
happening at once with process
technology if you want to get up to
speed on the basics
of EUV we have what I think is a
fantastic interview piece with David
Cantor who's a very technical analyst in
the space when people ask us who I read
to learn that's Miami it's David's
articles so David Cantor did a video
with us a while ago you can search our
YouTube channel youtube.com slash
cameras and axis just search for David
Cantor 10 nm as a nano meter and you'll
find it he talks about UV there so in a
recent report by digit x sighting of
course industry sources but these times
does have a very firm track record of
being accurate tsmc is set to enter
volume production with its seven
nanometer EUV in late March of this year
so ASML which provides extreme
ultraviolet litho equipment is looking
to ship a total of 30 UV systems in 2019
of the units shipped 18 have already
been reserved by TSMC and that is a
quote from digit x so this also goes on
the state that TSMC additionally plans
to move five nanometer to risk
production status in the second quarter
of 2019 with volume production expected
in the first half of 2020 and late last
year TSMC was approved to start
construction of a 19 billion dollar
fabrication plant with a focus on 3
nanometers getting a bit ahead of things
here
next up Puget systems benchmarks the I
$9.99 9 t x e make sure I got the name
right so we've known this for a while
now but the 9990 XE is is something that
was up for bid for auction to si so we
know some sis that only bought one and
they bought it because it was up for our
fan they panicked and they bought one
because they want to be the only one who
didn't get it it's kind of weird that
points buy one but so yeah it's a very
strange product this is not really meant
for mass consumption right not that they
are anyway in this category but this one
specifically was auctioned to s I just
want to highlight that point this was
not like a normal distribution process
very unique not necessarily for any
particular reason other than I guess low
volume but unique nonetheless so Puget
systems has been recently releasing
their benchmarks on the 9999 you
the 9990 AXI and they also divulge that
they paid $2,300 for the privilege of
getting one so there's your bid from
user systems in Taos rare nine nine nine
zero X E is only available via private
auction and only OEMs and system
integrators could vie for a chance at
the chip according to pH it systems the
processor stacks up to nearby
competition as will show on the screen
they've got some charts we can maybe
show or something but in Cinebench r15
multi CPU the nine eight nine DX e
versus the 99 ATX e it was 37 32 points
which is thirty seven sixty points this
largely comes down to frequency and the
higher clocks of the ninety nine ninety
XE the ninety nine forty x irrelevant
comparison was 31 18 points and you can
kind of just do some percentage math
there if you care single-threaded was
much higher at 221 versus 204 the 99 80
XE v array was 39 seconds or is 37 and
they've got more numbers will ie
go check them out if you want ultimately
Puget systems stated that it would not
be shipping any systems of the 9990 X II
because of the following reason quote
availability which just cannot order
more of these from distributors but we
have to wait for Intel's auctions to
purchase more even then there's no
guarantee that we will win any of the
bidding so we cannot forecast
availability for our customers they also
said that price as an impact and I'll
quote that as well because of the nature
of an auction we can never be certain of
pricing either the one we want ended up
cost you know 15% more than a cord I 999
ad XE added multi-threaded applications
it does not perform all that much faster
than the 990 DX e and then also they
said the warranty is a concern it is
sold without warranty by Intel so there
are low failure rates in general as
Puget systems points out but they would
probably still like a warranty there and
then heat is a final concern because the
processor uses so much power more than
other core X models as a result of its
higher clocks because it's effectively
pre overclocked quite a bit so anyway
that's the let's TPU it's kind of just a
halo piece I guess eilat product let's
get through the last few here so
investors or at least one of them could
be looking to sell the stake in Global
Foundries a fabrication technology group
advanced technology investment ATI C Abu
Dhabi's investment firm which is also
the majority shareholder of Google found
could be looking to sell out its
investment last year eighty IC sold one
of Global Foundries fabs to Vanguard
international semiconductor in Singapore
and so I was currently laid off a
portion of the company's employees now
it seems that ATI sees interest in the
fab business has waned significantly
this comes after a Global Foundries
decided to turn back on their 7
nanometer technology and that they would
no longer be receiving payments from AMD
for using TSMC 7 nanometer next up
Nvidia post fourth quarter 2019 earnings
predicting the future as they often do
down 24% and this is again it's just
it's because of how their financials
work but NVIDIA posted their financial
results for the fourth quarter and
fiscal 2019 and while the company did
slightly better than it anticipated
because it adjusted its guidance
downward after the previous bad quarter
making it look better in this instance
than it would have the company is still
down 24% quarter-over-quarter perhaps
more troubling for some is that the 45
percent year-over-year loss and gaming
revenue is quite significant and this is
something we'll have more data for you
on soon from first party it be from us
so we have some interesting stuff on
that according to tom's hardware nvidia
earned only 954 million dollars on the
fourth quarter 2019 compared to 1.7 3
billion and in fourth quarter 2018 tom
source is Nvidia's investor earnings
call
jensen wanna attributed the severe
decline to a number of issues including
slow adoption of r-tx cards big surprise
that the delay of the RT x 2060 which we
actually were quite fine that fond of
that was a good product but did launch
lates that didn't really show up on the
earnings and other issues like
cryptocurrency so this oh and I guess
also the sort of macro economics in
China were to blame as well lack of
support for ray-tracing games oversupply
of ten series cards stuff like that
so overall the company came out slightly
above their lowered revenue guidance
with 2.2 1 billion for the quarter and a
21 percent gain in the full fiscal year
which helped Nvidia stocks rally and the
hours after trading and then finally 70
percent of Windows patches aren't to
address memory issues to no one's
surprise a Microsoft engineer recently
stated that 12 years of Windows updates
amounted to 70% of them being
specifically for memory often memory
safety issues or security issues and
this blame is shifted to Microsoft's use
of sea
and C++ which it thinks are insecure for
memory and opens up memory attack
vectors among the most commonly
exploited issues on the windows
platforms so just kind of an interesting
statistic for you on that one but that's
it for this one as always you can
subscribe for more and on the verge I
probably won't be saying any more on
this unless they give us a reason to
we're depending on the comments we see
to this video I might bring it up in an
ask Jian or something feel free to ask
anyway
if I feel it's important I'll bring it
back up but we are of course blown away
by how tone-deaf the response was and I
mean it's this constant like I'm a
victim but I created this scenario I'm
in it's been several months everyone
forgot about it I brought it back I
don't like I don't get it at all
and they just the editor-in-chief
constantly shifts blames everyone else
it's it's the youtubers didn't contact
me they're evil they all worked together
to create these videos even though I
filmed mine at 5 a.m. when everyone else
was probably asleep saying things like
well our lawyers did it I didn't know
and we have 800 employees how can i I
mean it's just it's one excuse after
another there's zero responsibility zero
demonstration that they are willing to
accept responsibility for anything and
so anyway what happened I whole word on
it I guess the verge you're welcome on
the show I'll shut up and like let your
people talk and then I'll ask questions
and you can deflect them and say but i
but i retracted the claim up but i but i
retracted it but i retracted it over and
over and over so subscribe for more as
always go to patreon.com/scishow and
exit stops how directly if you do want
to give us money of course we greatly
appreciate it some of you have after we
donated to charity but I would rather at
least for now that you take some of the
the money you feel inclined to give us
today and instead give it to the in
reforestation project or a charity you
find suitable and you can do a hash you
just tweeted at a tweet a screenshot of
your donation I guess remove personal
information tweeted at reckless and add
us just to let them know you did
something positive for the world
so he can feel good about himself for
causing this I guess that's it for now
subscribe for more i'll see you all next
