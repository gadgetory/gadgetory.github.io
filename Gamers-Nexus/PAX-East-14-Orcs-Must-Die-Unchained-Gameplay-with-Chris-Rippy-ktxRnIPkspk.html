nexus donna and we were here at PAX East
2014 it is currently day three we've
been here since Thursday we checked out
some star citizen stuff check all that
in the links in the description below
today we're looking at orcs must die
Unchained following up on omd 1 and 2
which I've covered pretty extensively
because killing lots of stuff is awesome
so why wouldn't you cover that exactly
killing lots of stuff in fun ways and
seeing lots of Bart parts and violet
little flying everywhere blood right so
I am joined by Christian fihi as a
producer on request I unchained which is
the game we're talking about today and
like I said I've got rid of it for those
of you who aren't familiar can you give
us a sort of elevator Jerry yeah
absolutely the original works must die
games are kind of a hybrid tower defense
action strategy game where you've got an
enemy who's sending a series of minions
at you trying to get into your rift and
you're building traps to try and stop
them but you're also on the ground
shooting them so you're down in the
middle of the action while there's traps
going off and just creating a lot of
chaos that way the second game we
introduced co-op so you can play with a
buddy and today we've got it works with
Scion chain where it's actually 5 p-5
multiplayer so going at each other we
got some lane action going on so I like
it about I felt a little bit of a MOBA
insurance I don't know if you had one
there what about some traps for me were
the biggest thing right yeah so and
traps carry over to this game too so not
only are you we've got 10 heroes here at
the show but we'll have a lot more
heroes you'll be able to actually create
the minions decide what minions are
going to be sitting with you to attack
their r if they're doing it to you so
it's everything from the first game kind
of head-to-head match together and traps
or what you use to stop their minions so
you've got that get that as well
and playing a little bit of an offense
the event split between yeah for sure so
they're going to be coming at you and
you've got a certain set of heroes we're
probably better on the defensive side so
they have skills that are better around
the traps or maybe holding people back
while you get guys who are on offense
who are good at guiding your minions
through and pushing through to get to
their rift and I understand there's a
new interface where we can select all
this all the traps on the cards
beforehand right and you walk us through
that yeah so at the that kind of highest
level is if you play the original games
we add a spell book and at that point
you decided well I'm going to take this
because I know that the enemies are
going to be behaving this way is this
type enemy so I'm going to take these
traps well we completely blown that wide
open so before games you can say I'm
taking these traps I've bought these
cards so I know it's got these minions
in it i want to take these minions to go
after these guys so there's a massive
kind of meta game around it where you're
talking with your buddies and saying
okay you take this card said I'm going
to take this card said that all kind of
fits together in a cool way many new
minions traps or items that you want to
highlight here well yeah we said we're
probably not showing too many new traps
of the show but we've got a whole ton of
new stuff back at the house we're just
going to start trickling out as the days
go by and many new minions yeah so here
at the shop grunting what's new we've
got we've got bears in the game now
which are awesome to get these big guys
and armor we've got Giants on your side
God Seder so we have human soldiers now
instead of just works at gap kind of
both sides there so it really fills out
and they're all you know they all matter
in their own unique ways in the game and
when can we expect a launch is there a
tentative date sure yeah actually we're
an alpha right now you can go into early
access alpha now if you go to Orcs Must
Die calm join into that and then we'll
start rolling out the bait of this
summer and launch soon thereafter and
any thoughts on MSRP this is going to be
free-to-play game actually yeah this
will be free to play so this is not
something we talked about free interview
this right this is the shocking moments
with a shock like shock how uh how are
you monetizing so what why we talked
about the card so you'll be able to buy
card packs from there and in the cards
will have different heroes and minions
and so you'll just start building up
these great collection two things to
customize your gameplay so it's a really
great way to kind of build up around
your hobby a cool place tile so we've
got a little bit of a ccg element a
little bit of a MOBA element we're
keeping the original orcs must die
silliness and gym right it's a a little
bit of those things in a whole lot of
works must die I like that so it links
