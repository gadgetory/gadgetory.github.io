nexus donna and today we're talking
about the Zalman r1 case this case is
Zalman's first pushback with a cluster
of other cases so this is the Zalman r1
and it is truly the height of case
engineering and confidence I firmly
believe that this case has pushed the
industry to new levels when it comes to
design and in all the wrong ways
starting with the specs for the case and
then we'll start talking about design
flaws and hopefully other manufacturers
can learn from this the case has three
fans it's very simple there's two
exhaust one in the back one of the top
which is problematic and then one in the
front as intake and these are all 120
millimeter fans the one of the front has
an LED the back to do not and that's
really all there is to it in terms of
cooling there's very limited liquid
cooler support of course as this is a
after rebates $35 case before rebates
between 50 and 70 depending on which
retailer you look at it's about 50 right
now on Newegg rebates brands down to 35
just for quick reference other cases in
that range would include the Corsair
spec a1 that's about $40 the NZXT source
210 about $40 and that if you add 10
bucks you got like the 200 R and a whole
range of very good cases Silverstone's
PS 11 B is I believe $40 or $45 also so
very fierce competition in that price
range and the Zelman r1 is attempting to
enter it
starting with cooling on the case we did
some thermal benchmarks you can see the
charts now and it's not the best case
for cooling this was tested against
other 70ish dollar cases including the
NZXT s340 and anti XP 70 which is an
identical chassis it is the same as this
chassis there are om the exterior is a
bit different though and that doesn't
impact cooling so this thermal benchmark
shows you that the r1 is not great at
cooling but more importantly it's not
great because of a lot of things like
this top flap and when you pull it up
first of all it's not a great release
mechanism but when you do pull it up you
see that the plastic over the top
mounted fan is covering the most
critical parts of intake for
really any fan they're all pretty much
the same it's covering those air
pathways for intake exhaust so when
you're trying to exchange the exhaust
out the top of the case it's running
into plastic and then you have issues
creating vortexes or looping the hot air
in the case and more obviously than this
if you leave the flap on which is the
only way the case has any semblance of
looking somewhat okay I guess it would
be the best way to describe it if you
leave it on it is completely blocking
the exhaust the fan has no where to push
the air when this thing's on that's not
entirely new to cases something like the
Thor or the throne do this by design but
they have a grill in the back of the
case so that the exhaust still has
somewhere to go it doesn't just get
circulated back into the CPU fan which
is sitting and of course directly
underneath this if the rear exhaust
isn't bad enough the front intake fan is
completely choked for air by this front
panel and this is a design feature in a
lot of cases I have a feeling it is less
so for these al-manar one there's a
little bit of room for the fan to
breathe through this cheese creator
matched on the side and this is also the
only place you can see the blue LED from
a fan that is completely obscured by the
front panel so they've elected to put an
LED in a blocked fan very interesting
choice
very good allocation of resources and
once you open the front panel there's a
few more problems first of all there is
a dust filter here that's an okay idea
but it's not gonna filter any dust
because of no air and with that dust can
get through a solid piece of plastic the
solid piece of plastic solid is a loose
term here because it's actually I don't
know what the exact spec is we're
probably about a millimeter thick and
the only reason this foam that you see
on the front panel exists is not for
sound damping it's to make the front
panel stronger it is extremely flimsy by
default and this is just a the nature of
very cheap plastic very cheap
manufacturing it's a cheap product but
the spec Awan the source 210 all these
other cases are substantially better and
that's really saying something for other
competing $40 cases so we can flex this
really easily which isn't great and
if you peel the film off which we'll
show here I'm guessing that there's an
extremely limited amount of plastic for
the panel and that it's really got no
bulk to it moving to quality control and
aesthetics issues the top panel was
installed off camber and is not flush
with the chassis itself as you can see
by looking at the two screws as your
landmark here in this shot you can see
it's not straight so that's a major
quality control issue and a severe
design oversight speaking of design
oversights the side panel and the top
panel are not adjacently they're not
aligned properly when you look at the
top panel it sort of juts over the back
that's not a feature that's again a
design oversight and if you look at any
of the good cases on the market
including these sorts of to ten
including the 200 are including the spec
of one these are $40 cases $50 cases in
some instances and they're not great as
no case at that price will be but they
at least get that right they get the
paneling and the alignment correct for
the most part and the quality control
will allow that to persist in all the
cases that are manufactured more or less
the front panel again same issue and
even there are other small issues like
the feet which have no rubber padding
the Antec p70 if you recall is the exact
same chassis as this Samms some things
will look at momentarily on the inside
but the exact same chassis the footing
on the p70 is different because they
elected to install different footing
it's rubberized so it actually stays
still on your surface if you have it on
a solid table and you can see as we're
moving around of this shot here the the
case is very prone to sliding and it's a
bit it makes me a bit uneasy as a user
as a system builder other issues with
the paneling and quality control would
include a cross threaded screw on the
bottom here this is not installed flush
and you can see that just maybe barely
in the camera shot the metal paneling on
the chassis at the top is dinged it's
not severe but at this angle really at
most angles you can see the light
reflecting off of the dents in the
paneling that is on the outside of the
chassis so another issue for quality
control and
installing the side panel alone is
difficult enough because you have issues
getting it flushed to the front flush to
the top and then screwed in through the
holes one of which is cross threaded so
we've just got issues all around
finally on exterior design flaws of the
plexiglass or cheap plastic paneling
here I guess it's really just a cheap
clear plastic if we push on the corner
just a little bit it will slide inward
on the rail that's holding it in place
and I really shouldn't have to explain
why this is a design flaw I'm sure you
can quite reasonably on your own draw
those conclusions but it definitely is
not how it should have shipped the
upsides of this glass window despite its
flexing nature is that you can see the
floppy drive bay from certain angles so
we've just got issues all around with
the paneling and the outside of the case
and we're not even to the inside of the
case yet it's one of the more technical
items worth complaining about would be
the fan controller when we use the fan
controller it has a max a low and I
think that's really it for the settings
aren't being off but when you use the
max setting it doesn't get a stable 12
volt
to the fan and if we plug a multimeter
in there you'll see it sort of
fluctuates just below the 12 volt range
this fluctuation can cause fluctuations
in rpm which impacts thermal testing
impacts thermal results in the real
world and this is an issue it's not
something I expect anyone to really
bypass in a cheap product like this but
at that point why are you including a
fan controller it's really the the only
thing that I get out of it because
you're better off plugging into the
motherboard at that point or using some
aftermarket controller that's much
better moving to the inside of the case
we see the same chassis that is used in
an Tex P 70 and I first want to
introduce you to the floppy drive bay
this is something we haven't seen in a
while it is on these Alan r1 so that is
a major plus for legacy systems I
suppose and the floppy drive rails come
bent in the system that was a feature
added to it that we encountered and the
bending is not too bad because you can
actually bend it back just like sprue
and modeling or miniatures or figurine
cutouts so you can bend it back don't
bend it too far because it will snap but
that is the floppy drive bay don't want
to spend too much time there because
many other things to worry about like
the random drilled holes in the
motherboard tray that will do absolutely
nothing for anything including cooling
and behind the motherboard tray a very
limited space for cable management
you'll be doing most of your cable
management in the case proper and moving
on to issues that are perhaps even more
noticeable to the end-user I had
difficulty by which I mean it was
impossible to thread screws through the
expansion slots for the video card we
ended up just tethering the the video
card to the case itself by using a zip
tie the opposing side of the case from
the unthread of all video card expansion
slots we have the SSD bay this is a
special bay that was installed on the
top of the 3.5 inch base so this is
actually foresight I'm glad that it's
here for a full list of grievances on
these al-manar one check the article
link in the description below
Patrick Nathan our reviewer has already
talked about all of them he did a case
roundup looking at this one the Antec
p7e and the s3 40 the reason for those
three cases is because at the time of
starting the roundup they were all about
$70 60 to 70 now this one's got the mir
rebate for down to $35 and even at this
price point I have a very difficult time
arguing in favor of the r1 it is at the
point where it's it's so poorly designed
and so bad that I would really strongly
encourage everybody to spend an extra
five dollars and get almost any other
case and you don't even have to spend an
extra five dollars the source 210
bounces between 35 and 40 pretty
regularly the Corsair 100 R is about $50
to be fair but it is the same chassis as
the spec series cases which did better
in Asia than in the US and the spec
series cases are perfectly fine for a
budget build about $40 as well and the
Silverstone PS 11 B which is the same as
the 100 R is 35 $40 so there's a lot of
options out there to replace this and
they're all better designs they have
more functional uses that make better
sense and most importantly the quality
control in our experience with them is
just a lot better and we've got videos
of those on the channel from CES so that
is the Zalman R 1 this is elements
return to market I wish
stronger but it is not it's simply not a
case I can recommend right now all the
others are better options if you like

subscribe as always check out our new
patreon page you can hit that link after
this video and that's a new campaign
we're starting up to help move forward
with better lighting better camera
equipment all that so again link in the
