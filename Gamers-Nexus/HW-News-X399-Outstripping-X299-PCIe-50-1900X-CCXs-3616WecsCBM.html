the retailers and reporting on thread
repair performance we have something to
add to that after talking to some
vendors 1,900 X e CX configuration some
news on peripherals at the show at PAX
West and a couple of other news items as
well because there was so much news
while we've been traveling we'll have a
second Hardware news video probably
going out tomorrow or the next day to
add to this one because there are a few
other topics that are worth talking
about in separate detail before we get
into that this content is brought to you
by the Thermaltake flow RGB closed-loop
liquid cooler which is a 360 millimeter
radiator plus 3 120 fans that are RGB
illuminated if then we'll take it ringg
fans at that this is a 4.5 done a detect
pump which is one of the faster pumps
you can learn more at the link in the
description below so the first news item
news from one of Europe's largest
retailer suggests that a.m. these
combined cpu sales to DIY enthusiasts
have now surpassed intel's combined cpu
sales to enthusiasts at that particular
retailer we wanted to add to this story
so speaking with vendors the word on the
street is that looking at X 299 for Dex
399 the vendors with whom we spoke and
have said that the first few days to
first week depend on which vendor of
sales for X 399 products related
products surpassed the first month of
Intel X 299 product sales from those
same vendors not retailers but actual
manufacturers so from the extra nine
standpoint that makes sense we've seen
on the media side a lot more interest in
thread Ripper than in Intel's enthusiast
platform part of that is because people
are bored of Intel part of it is because
Andy is coming back in a big way and
this is their first high-end desktop
part in a long time they've done server
they've done some level of enthusiasts
but this is a gdt from a company that's
finally competing with Intel in the
space so I think that's why a lot of the
interest and thread Ripper is out but
specifically on the vendor side the
manufacturers seen increased sales in
the first few days the first week of
thread or X 3 99 parts versus the first
month of X 299 is a big deal that means
that there's going to have to ramp up
production because I think thread Ripper
is doing better than a lot of
manufacturers expected and I think X 299
is doing worse than a lot of
manufacturers expected so but that was
just to build on the news about mind
Factory and their sales with X 399 well
not just that but risin as well where if
you look at the charts they've published
the AMD parts to DIY enthusiasts are
finally surpassing Intel again to two
items note here one at that particular
retailer so at mine factory and - that's
DIY enthusiast so while this is a major
victory for Andy and one that's critical
for their continued success in the CPU
Department and he still has to fight
back for a share in om systems and
laptops and things like that so the war
is far from over
they've got a lot more ground to gain
but this is a good start for Eisen and
thread Ripper and and hopefully we
should see the effects of that
competition soon and that will be in the
form of coffee lake so we'll have more
information on coffee like when the time
has come but that it's looking like
Intel sirens on right now they have had
coffee like more or less in the wings
this is CPUs take a while to develop so
these things may have been taped out for
a while now it's possible they've been
manufacturing the silicon for coffee
like since Rison launched or before
Rison launched the zine has been done
for at least a year I looking at a
refresh or a the old tic-tock cycle the
cadence was about 18 months from design
to shelf for an architecture that
already existed when they were iterating
on it so that means that coffee legs
probably been more or less ready in that
it was being produced as Rison was
coming out and starting to make waves so
it's not like this is a full response to
Andy but the parts that are one we don't
know if Intel would have released the
rumored six core i5s and the rumored six
core 12 thread i7s without some pressure
we also don't know
if Intel would have branded for example
there I nine CPUs as I nine CPUs without
the thread Ripper pressure so even if
its parts that already existed or would
have existed having the marketing the
branding and the naming shift to move to
I nines and other marketing segments
like focusing on streaming for example
with the seventy nine hundred X that
shift is definitely somewhat of a
response to threat upper end and rising
so Intel's responding in some form which
is good that's what we need to see until
kind of needed to kick in the rear end
to get moving again so it looks like
that's happened and to be fair to Intel
it's not easy to do what they do so it's
not like the company has stagnated or
has tried to stagnate and has gotten
lazy it's just that it's hard to keep
pushing see view performance when you've
already shrunk in the process so far but
there's still room to improve and it
looks like they're they're finally
acting on that in a more public visible
fashion for enthusiasts not just servers
other AMD news before moving on the 1900
x c CX configuration was somewhat
detailed by TPU tech power up so they
learned that the 1900 ax is running a
core configuration that's the same as
the other threader per chip so four dies
top left bottom right oriented I believe
right side up are the two active thighs
and then on those one CCX is disabled
each and this gives the CC X's all the
usual access to memory channels and i/o
and keeps the 8 megabyte l3 cache per CC
X available should also help with
reducing latency particularly in memory
intensive operations which would be the
ideal solution to keep gaming reasonably
accessible in the 1900 X as it's more
likely to be used in systems that are
doing some level of gaming as opposed to
the 1950 X or it's more likely to be in
workstations and side note on that just
with the launch of the 1900 X and E has
lowered the cost of entry into there h
EDT series of CPUs so threaded for 1900
X CPUs are 8 core 16 thread variants
priced at $550 making them slightly more
expensive than an 1800 X but adding
another run
- Andy's product performance ladder the
1900 axis clocked at 3.8 gigahertz 4.0
boost 64 PCIe lanes and 180 while TDP
this is something you primarily used for
the lanes and risin 7 or really risin 5
would be the better option for gaming if
that's your pure focus if you're trying
to stick with AMD you would want
probably rise in 5 1600 Class CPU
whereas if you're going higher-end
gaming the Intel i7 7700 case still the
best there is presently now Coffey Lake
will shake that up quite a bit but we'll
see how that goes
so yeah 900 X is a cheaper option and
Andy's h EDT platform in non AMD news
PCIe Gen 4 is supposed to land this year
and PCIe Gen 5 has been fast-tracked for
2019 and this is information obtained at
the hot chips 2017 conference which
indicates that the PCIe a 4.0 standard
is set to arrive this year rendering the
4.0 a specification fleeting 4.0 is
supposed to bring with it 16 Giga
transfer per second and 64 gigabytes per
second of throughput while 5.0 will
effectively double that the PCIe 4.0
does indeed get ratified this year it'll
mark a seven-year gap between the launch
of 3.0 and the ratification a 4.0 which
is a lon gestation period that the pci
SI g group ascribes to industry
stagnation as the 3.0 interface has
afforded adequate bandwidth and
throughput for many years it wasn't
until the advent of AI and machine
learning and increasing popularity of
nvme based storage that more bandwidth
was needed there are also a lot of
smaller announcements or subtle launches
at PAX in the peripheral cases and
cooling Department so we'll go through
those quickly gigabytes got a new CPU
cooler that they showed up packs we
don't know the name of their cooler or
their case the rep with whom we were
speaking represented motherboards not
cases and coolers so didn't know the
names but we've got footage of them so
there's no CPU cooler it's got two 120
millimeter fans and I think it includes
an angled screwdriver for installation
so I don't know that it's gonna be the
easiest cooler in the world to install
but they're trying to do coolers and
it's it's just another you see these
companies that traditionally do
motherboards and things like
expanding into coolers and cases a lot
of it is for margin because margin and
motherboards is really bad margin and
videocards is even worse
keep talking less than 10% margins for
best case scenarios so to add
peripherals coolers and cases means that
they can produce products that are much
higher margin not sell as many and still
walk away better off than they were
before and that's why you're seeing the
companies start doing this more so
they've got a CPU cooler there was a
gigabyte case that how is the cooler
that's a new case it's got exceptionally
limited airflow on the front sort of
like the EVGA dg7 sort of like half the
other cases on the market right now
pretty disappointed in that trend and we
didn't get a ton of information about it
other than that but that's that's what
we know from the gigabyte side on the
coarser side they had their Boyd Pro
headset present which was shown off
somewhere recently they added an antenna
to the transmitter updated the memory
foam in the ear cups and then there's
also a new microphone that's got a 50%
larger driver the drivers for the output
have also been tuned for frequency to
some extent and aside from that there's
Dolby Surround on some models it's
available in USB if you weren't 5 and
wireless options HyperX also had a new
version of the cloud headset so this one
was the first cloud model done in the
house they have done the stainer and
whatever the other one was the revolver
in house previously whereas the first
two clouds were partnered with cue pad
the cloud alpha is $100 headset set to
either pre-order or ship on September
25th
it's got inline controls an extension
cable 2.3 meter cable on with extension
plus what's coming out of the headset
new memory foam and ID there's new
stitching and the interesting part is
it's got a dual chamber driver so it's a
50 millimeter driver the driver on the
sides of it has basically venting ports
where some of the sound escapes and
those are as I understand it vertically
stacked in a way that one port vents
into a smaller inner chamber in the
earcup and we have actually cool 3d
print out that's dissected to show you
for that and the lower port outputs into
another chain
so on smaller ones larger the larger one
helps with theoretically base and this
means that HyperX hasn't done a lot of
tuning on the frequencies because they
can just output the sound wave to each
chamber and then I guess hope for the
best of that so this isn't new to
headsets but it's new to gaming headsets
we're not sure exactly how well it works
yet keep an eye out for a hundred
dollars on that one and the ear cup
design is the most unique aspect of it
in Razer news they have development of
custom switches continued and the Razer
purple switch is the newest one it
represents their foray into the world of
optical switches optical switch
technology stands to offer hot swappable
switches with no debounce and the
possibility of analog sensing all of
which is to say that optical switches
could theoretically add more response
and customization to keyboards there's
more than a few words that can be set on
this topic so definitely easier to refer
to the sources for more information and
a primer on optical switches should that
be necessary you can check out a Tom's
Hardware article on the Razer purple
optical mechanical switch if you're
interested in more and as for my strays
just got a new basilisk gaming mouse
aimed at the FPS devotee it was
announced at Europe's efo but was also
at PAX the basilisk comes equipped with
the same 16,000 dpi sensor the I believe
3389 that's found in the Death Adder
elite and Lance had tournament edition
the mouse will offer raisers mechanical
mouse switches on the fly dpi adjustment
and programmable buttons so the thing
here the basilisk Mouse honestly looking
at it in person and messing around with
it it's not that different from most
other mice basically the point of
differentiation is they've added a small
wheel on the bottom to adjust resistance
to the scroll wheel so you can make it
it's sort of close to a logitech hyper
scroll except it doesn't actually hyper
scroll it still and you can go like that
and it still only goes one tick whereas
Logitech would spin for two minutes so
it's not quite there but it is very low
resistance or get to a point where it
requires a lot of intentional force to
move it now is that that marketable a
feature I'm not sure you'll set it once
and you're not
touched again I guess the point is
whether or not you set it to where most
mice are anyway which would largely
invalidate the function or if there's
actually some usefulness there may be a
very small specific audience would like
that kind of thing but it's just another
Mouse it's the basilisk 770 dollars for
MSRP and the 3389 sensor so another one
of those chroma RGB I believe is also
enabled on it and that the premature
absinthe maps they also have the new
blade Pro which was at PAX West and the
blade pro is a same as the previous
laptop except it has a 1060 in it it's
got the same dual fan cooling design
priced at $2,300 120 Hertz display and
one thing here that's worth note is they
do upgradeable dims now so it's actually
got DIMM slots instead of the soldered
memory which is just really undesirable
for the type of laptop we look at so
that's good to see it in the very least
and liquid cooling news EK water blocks
does make good on their promise to
expand the fluid gaming series and as of
now they offer a 120 240 and 360
millimetre radiator expansion pack in
addition to stand-alone @gp blocks a
multi GPU connector kids and new soft
tubing fittings in different colors and
configurations such as 45 degree in 90
degree adapters so they're expanding
this line to start approaching the kind
of customization get from other loops
that are normally made of copper rather
than aluminum additionally the ek
supremacy ax aluminum block and
compatible pump and reservoirs can be
purchased individually making buying a
kit not required but the idea originally
what the fluid gaming series was to make
it so that you pick up one kit with
everything in it build your loop and
you're done to create sort of the intro
to cooling so or to open loop cooling
anyway so that's news from ek news from
Alpha cool they've got their new ice
Becker helix and he likes light
reservoirs so this new family of
reservoirs with the ice Becker helix is
basically shaped like a DNA strand
running the length of the reservoir
interior and the 60 millimeter model
will include a UV cathode
to eliminate UV reactive liquid new
reservoirs come in four colors black red
green and blue with fifty and sixty
millimeter sizes and that's it for this
news roundup for the last week we'll
have another one of these with more news
items because more stuff has happened in
the last few days got a couple of cool
topics talked about but as always
patreon.com slash cameras action stops
out directly we'll be back at home base
soon to work on the usual in-depth
testing coverage in the meantime
