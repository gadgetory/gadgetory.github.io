newest full-size ITX tower the Manta has
just launched today and we've got the
reviewing with thermal benchmarks built
quality analysis and more NZXT says it's
bubbled case with rounded exteriors is
inspired by the ferrari four five eight
and you can see that in some of these
photos where we've got both of those
things together definitely an uncommon
occurrence the new Manta uses a stamped
curved steel paneling all around which
as far as we're aware is the first case
to use the stamped and curved steel side
paneling it is an all steel enclosure
with all steel external paneling and
uses some plastic reinforcements and
clips in a few other places the
full-size ITX Tower sells at $140 ships
with two front 120 millimeter fans and
one rear 120 millimeter fan it's got
support for alternatively two 140
millimeter front fans if you want to
replace them or put a radiator in there
two 140 millimeter or 120 millimeter top
fans and then you can fit up to 280
millimeter radiators in the top and
front or 120 in the rear CPU clearance
is good for 160 millimeter coolers the
curved exterior is obviously the biggest
feature here and a bit of a risk for
NZXT you can see they've gone with their
trend of axing the five and a quarter
drive bay is something that I definitely
agree with and allows this full ITX form
factor but in terms of whether you like
the rounded edges or not is really up to
you not me so I will leave that to the
video and photos to discuss in terms of
actual component features there is a fan
hub on the rear side of the motherboard
tray over here and that's a pretty smart
inclusion because with ITX cases you're
going to have an ITX motherboard and
those generally have maybe one or two
fan headers so that is a big limitation
with ITX boards and by adding a fan hub
in their stock they can take care of
that immediately there's also an LED
controller for the PSU shrouds and ext
illuminated text which is something
that's been done since the maybe the H
440 I think may have been the first one
to institute that and the s 340 has
carried that on with the Noctis 450
following after the s 340 so it's got
the PSU shroud unlike the previous
cases I just named there are no SSD
sleds on top of the PSU shroud and
that's because the proximity of the
video card there's basically no
clearance however the top of the PSU
shroud has been changed so that it's got
these sort of grilled drafts in the top
instead and that allows in theory a tiny
bit of air to get through to the GPU now
it's not a lot and if you look closely
at the front of this case where the fans
are installed stock our setup has it so
that the lower fan is actually halfway
into the power supply shroud and so
you're funneling audio air straight into
a wall basically then the top one is
lower and in line with the exhaust fan
so that one does make sense I would move
the front fans up a little bit though
and we did actually test that but we'll
talk about that later speaking of tests
we did a lot of them with this case and
we're pretty excited about it this has a
lot of tests on the fan position size
and radiator location in the case so you
can see optimal fans set up in a case
like this but most of that will be in
the article hit the link in the
description below for that we'll go over
some of it briefly here in this video
speaking to a few points about the case
in terms of build quality aesthetics and
overall feature set the case is almost
entirely made of steel with a few
plastic inlays supporting the hardened
shell and it is very much like a turtle
shell it's sturdy surprisingly heavy for
the form factor and inflexible which is
a good thing looking inside the outward
bowed window we see an interior that
resembles a shrunken version of the s
340 with PSU shroud cable management bar
and cleared front for airflow and
minimalism the SSD sleds have been moved
off that shroud and into the immediate
East area of the cable management bar
unfortunately that actually restricts
installation of non SSD 2.5 inch form
factor devices so for example NZXT sq+
RGB LED controller does not fit in those
two SSD sleds and that is a huge
oversight and a very unfortunate one
because I really wanted to install it
there to get sort of the NZXT look for
you know nice shots for video but it
didn't fit hail management cutouts exist
in the usual places including directly
in the PSU shroud for routing the PCIe
wiring straight to the GPU two other
minor criticisms I have
immediately our the USB 3.0 front io I
think this may be their factory defect
or something else that's probably not a
wide issue but the headers didn't line
up perfectly with the top panel so in
order to get those to line up we remove
the top panel not hard to do and then
just sort of warp the headers back into
place so that USB 3 devices could
actually use so that is a problem we've
seen before in NZXT cases and it's
probably just a factory thing the thumb
screws are another factory issue for
basically all the manufacturers at this
point Corsair and NZXT are the two big
ones that I can think of where the thumb
screws aren't really thumb screws
because you have to use a screw driver
but that is such a minor issue
we really can't dock any real points on
it because you're building a system once
and then you just hand tighten it next
time but I'm still mentioning it because
I want to see NZXT and coarser and all
these other manufacturers actually fix
it so their thumb screws are useful
without the tool that's not to speak ill
of the case though because there are a
lot of good things about this case
without even getting to the benchmarking
and one of those is just how sturdy the
paneling is and how easy it is to remove
so the front panel you just pull from
the underside and it clips in with
several plastic clips that are thick and
won't break easily which is a problem
I've had with a lot of cases the Corsair
400 C included that review is coming
this week where we snap the alligator
clips that hold the paneling in place so
that didn't happen with this it's very
sturdy and it is somewhat reinforced so
I did not have to worry about that the
case is also exceptionally quiet and
this is something I wish we did
benchmarking for but decibel levels are
one of the only factors and any type of
component that we don't currently review
because it's very hard to do accurately
we can't do it accurately we don't test
it at all
subjectively I can tell you that the
audio emissions the noise emissions
coming from this case are fairly low and
that's because of the thick steel
paneling there's obviously some pretty
limited airflow here the meshing only
exists on the sides of the top and front
panel but that does give you some
benefit of noise level control so you
trade off a bit of air for noise levels
and something like the thermaltake cor
v1 another mini
Eck's case does the opposite it's all
mesh so it's got superb air flow
potential anyway but it's a bit noisier
so there's a trade-off to be made there
and that is up to you to decide on what
you want more let's get into the testing
all the test methodology is on the
website we use the thermaltake core v1
ROS what legacy w1 I weigh power revolt
2 which is not available separately and
the NZXT Manta for these tests the first
charts show thermals at equilibrium for
only the mantas fan configuration so we
don't have the competing cases on here
just yet after these we'll move to the
comparative analysis first off this
matrix shows our testing configuration
for the Manta only benchmarks the goal
was to define the most effective fan and
radiator configuration and that's
exactly what we tested here for CPU
temperatures the triple exhaust
configuration produces the lowest
readings at 34 Celsius though idle is
noticeably higher at fifteen point two
Celsius it does not necessarily follow
that the coolest load configuration will
produce the coolest idle configuration
there's a bit more involved than that
this is something we've seen in a few
other cases as well but correlating the
triple exhaust setup to the GPU chart
now it becomes apparent that this is in
fact one of the worst configurations
possible because it pushes the GPU into
the seventy 1.4 Celsius delta T over
ambient range which means that once you
factor in ambient if we assume about 20
Celsius or 70 degrees Fahrenheit
thereabouts we've now got a GPU that is
thermally throttling at 90 Celsius for
absolute temperature and that is not
what you want so we can't use the triple
exhaust setup that's not good for
thermals conversely the GPU is the
coolest with three fan stock setups so
if you just use a two intake one twenty
one rear exhaust 120 and the radiator
configured in the rear so it's not front
mounted in this instance the GPU is at
sixty three point two delta T over
ambient four Celsius readouts and that's
achievable because of two factors one
the front intake is unobstructed and
does not pass through a radiator which
obviously pushes a bit of heat into the
case though not much and the exhaust is
a single fan setup and not overpowering
the blower fans ability to cool itself
so it's not stealing air from the lower
part of the case this setup though is
the worst for the CPU by a couple degree
at least several degrees actually the
best setup overall that we found if
you're using a radiator anyway is to run
the one by 120 millimeter top rear fan
and a front radiator so that gives the
best value without going to a five fan
setup which is really pretty poor value
overall because the thermal gains are
marginal it's kind of middle-of-the-road
and it's more expensive and it keeps the
GPU temperatures at a superb at sixty
three point three Celsius which for a
reference cooler is pretty good
comparatively two cases of this size
especially it only raises the CPU to
thirty seven point zero eight Celsius
which is not bad either considering it's
a case that focuses at least somewhat on
silence and discretion and since most
radiators include a fan it's likely that
CLC users will be running for fans
anyway let's move on to the comparative
charts thermaltake score v1 is the best
with both GPU and CPU thermals at
equilibrium producing thirty eight point
two one Celsius CPU temperatures against
the amantha's forty two point three
Celsius the legacy is only slightly
warmer than the v1 but sits at
significantly higher idle temperatures
with a five point one Celsius readout
the differences between these cases are
mostly inconsequential until we get to
the revolt to which we'll discuss in a
future review the GPU temperatures for
the V one are at sixty two point six
eight Celsius load and run pretty warm
idle with an eight point four for
reading the idle readout is warmer than
the others because thermal tape relies
upon the GPU to pull its own air so it's
got to pull its own weight as it's
slightly off-center from the intake fan
in the front the Manta sits at 63 point
two five @ Celsius load which is really
not bad at all for a small case it's
barely more than the therm will take v1
which is pretty darn cool for again a
small case overall we've got nothing to
complain about in terms of thermals for
the most part it's long you set it
upright don't do the multi exhaust setup
though because that one is a bit
stressful for the GPU because it's
siphoning all the air from it and that's
why these tests were fun to conduct
because we can look at the airflow
patterns of different radiator setups
and learn for instance that a
front-mounted radiator is very efficient
at keeping the CPU cool because it's
pulling in fresh air from outside the
case and pushing it through now that
some heat into the case and also
obstructs intake a little bit so that
can impact the GPU however if we stick
to just one fan in the rear exhaust slot
it doesn't steal air from the GPU and
it's able to keep cool on its own just
using the blower fan so pretty
interesting test if you want to learn
more about these tests do check the
article link in the description below
let's get to a conclusion though at $140
the Manta is definitely a steep buy and
in an odd market segment many ITX cases
are competitive and tend to either be
expensive
like the silverstone SGO 8 or pretty
cheap like the throne will take corvy 1
which is $50 right now the mantle ends
middle-of-the-road and its price just as
it does with its size and that's one of
the most interesting points for the case
it's not a shoebox like something the SG
10 or SG o8 r from silverstone or the
core v1 not quite a shoebox but
definitely smaller and it's also not a
mid tower like NZXT s340 so where does
that put it it puts it in this sort of
strange full ITX tower category which is
not to say it's bad or unusable just
that it's different and that means that
for me personally I would not have this
in a home theater setup I'd go for
something smaller again like Silverstone
options or any number of other small ITX
boxes that are more shoebox-sized that's
what I would go with for a home theater
setup where I want absolute discretion
and out of sight out of mind type of
setup for the enclosure for something
like a literal desktop computer like
this being on a literal desk it does
start to make sense and that s340 would
fit on a desk as well for the most part
but if you're looking for minimalism you
don't care about the extra drive bays
you don't care about the extra space for
an ATX form factor motherboard and you
want an ITX setup that's I guess a
little bit more portable like this is
then it's not a bad buy at $140 it's
certainly somewhat expensive it enters
the enthusiast range but the materials
are all very heavy-duty steel it's a
quality construction and personally
speaking I think that it looks good I
was originally a pretty vocal I was I
was not for or against the design and
article
in the past I referred to this as the
whale because I thought it looked like a
bloated whale but that was used somewhat
in jest because we didn't have a name
for the case yet so we had to call it
something and whale just stuck for a
one-syllable easy name and I will say
that the sort of wide-angle lenses we
use don't do the case justice it's not
nearly as warped as it may look in some
shots you'll see online depending on
what kind of lenses people are using but
it is absolutely bowed outward a little
bit and if you don't like that that's
completely fine don't buy it buy
something that's a little more boxy
instead or whatever suits your taste so
that is the one point here that I would
say is a potential negative for most
people because thermals are fine they're
not amazing nothing to write home about
but they're not bad and the form factor
is a bit strange but again not bad so
it's just in an odd market segment but
the look is something that is either yes
or no so that is ultimately the deciding
factor and then of course 140 bucks is
pretty deciding - so that's all for this
