net and we're here at fantex suite at
CES 2016 looking at this massive case
then later in the video we'd be talking
about some new smaller mid tower cases
before getting to these all this content
is brought to you by I by powers revolt
to small form factor gaming PC for this
case this is the project 916 so this
doesn't have a finalized name yet some
of the specs are subject to change but
we can talk about the overview how
everything looks right now as it is set
up here there's actually mini-itx board
installed a complete system on the top
of the power supply shroud area and then
above that is your standard ATX installs
it's actually two systems in one and
this is a concept that fantex has been
doing since the mini XL which we looked
at previously it's a bit different than
the mini XL but same idea in that you
can fit two and one it's also got two
power supplies in one and they have a
new power splitter and power combo block
that you basically plug all of your
headers into for each power supply you
can split or combine them as appropriate
for the use cases for that it's pretty
limited people who are just building
normal gaming systems may not need it
but on the render side on the high end
production side it gives some redundancy
or combined power if you're trying to
take two existing power supplies that
you already own and combine them rather
than buy a new larger one as for the
exterior it's all five millimeter thick
aluminum and that's pretty heavy metal
we're not sure what the exact weight is
but doesn't quite matter the size once
you put it down it's not going anywhere
so that's five millimeter thick aluminum
on the inside it is currently in a point
eight millimeter steel may change
depending on how things go going forward
and then for the other case is on the
opposite side here will show some b-roll
of those there's the p400 and p 400s
which is the silent edition and those
are mid towers they're more consumer
targeted at the entry level budget area
with seventy dollar and eighty dollar
price points the shroud the psu does
have a shroud so it's similar in concept
to the s3 40 in that regard but the
shroud it extends all the way across
it's got the usual found the front
exhaust top rear and then there's
actually a pre-installed LED and the
front bottoms that can light sort of the
like an under glow neons car type of
thing and that has 10 colors that can be
cycled through with a button
on the top concealed under the top panel
so that is the fantex sweet hit the link
