Nexus Donna and today we're talking
about windward a high-seas fusion of
strategy forex MMO and RPG elements it's
a call back to Sid Meier's pirates for
those of you who remember that game just
without some of the worst game mechanics
ever
not that there were any of those in Sid
Meier's pristine pirates game
windward puts players in control of a
single ship which they captain freely
throughout a piratical procedurally
generated world the player does have
some control and designating faction
placement within this world if they so
please before jumping into it the world
is populated with four major starting
factions and two additional factions the
Pirates and a crime network you discover
later all of these groups are vying for
control of the conveniently square sized
sectors on the map these are effectively
zones for functional and playability
reasons and the house cities and create
points of engagement within the game
which we'll discuss momentarily players
can trade explore fight and quest their
way to faction control of each sector of
water and doing so unlocks abilities and
zones as progress is made to this extent
everything in so far should sound pretty
familiar to really any MMO although this
I really don't want to bill as an MMO
because I do not consider it to be one
or any really strategy game that's been
out in recent years but that's not a bad
thing because when this game was
originally in Sept 'add it was sort of a
challenge to sid meier himself who
stated in a GDC panel that game
designers and developers should borrow
ideas from games to improve upon them
and this is a direct response to that
panel when dword implements its MMO like
mechanics in a less offensively grindy
way and this is because as we define
those Chris Roberts in a previous video
grinds are really something that is
undesirable as a player it feels as if
it's forced upon you in order to make
some progress it's a a reward for a
punishment when word is more freeform in
its execution of quests killing and
control of the waters it's also a
single-player but does have multiplayer
allowances and this lets players pick
and choose points of progression as they
get a feel for the game single-player
and multiplayer modes are both available
and multiplayer doesn't necessarily
require player interaction with others
so you can simply coexist in the world
while making independent trade trade
runs
if that so pleases you strategy emerges
primarily in combat where you cross the
T as they say and this is because the
ships have cannons only on the sides
because that's where ships put their
cannons and they must broadside
opponents in a fashion that causes the
most amount of damage while sustaining
the least amount of damage from the
enemy's broadside so you normally really
can only do this by effectively crossing
at e so you're firing at their front
under back-end or their rear panel
quarter panel area so that they really
can't return fire in an efficient
fashion some mortars and other more
mobile guns become available later in
the game but that's the gist of it I had
tremendous fun attempting to cause
maximum damage to enemies while
sustaining minimum cannon wounds to my
own ship and this seems a very basic
mechanic for really any type of combat
in any type of game but the uniqueness
of broadsiding it makes for navigational
challenges while in the middle of combat
and that's something that I really had a
lot of fun doing I also had a lot of fun
with the trading for instance you can
visit different towns and check the
rumor mill to learn where you can buy
and sell coffee for the highest profit
margin something like that and as this
is done the towns will actually level up
unlock more progression options for
players new ships new colors things like
that and we'll also look larger on the
map we first started covering windward a
few months ago it is an indie title made
by two Sharan and we followed their
early announcements of the game and
found it really promising as a concept
especially personally I liked Port
Royale and I've also played pirates we
ultimately published opinions from our
video editors playthrough at PAX East
this was done live on the show floor of
PAX East a few months ago and it was
Keegan Galax first interaction with the
game I had already played it I decided
to let him play a game for once instead
of just filming me talking to people so
he called the game relaxing
quote-unquote and noted that he almost
completely forgot about the chaotic show
that was going on around us as is the
nature of PAX this is really a statement
to windward and I'd agree with him on
the fact that it is a pretty relaxing
game the game can be billed as a more
casual title
I hesitate to slap that label onto it
because it's got some negative
connotations associated with it
I don't necessarily consider myself a
casual gamer but I did immensely enjoy
the ease of drop in drop out gameplay
afforded by windward it feels very
freeing that I can just play for a few
minutes and stop and not feel like I'm
gonna be totally lost next time I start
playing the game can be picked up for a
few minutes at a time or four hours at a
time both with ease as you get drawn
further into the neverending tasks of
trading exploring building new cities
gaining map control and buying new ships
you only control one ship at a time but
you can hire allies in the form of npcs
to help you complete tasks and take over
cities and things like that the allies
are very inexpensive almost to the point
that it sometimes feels like it is off
balance but I actually found this played
out very well the ease of access to get
allies makes for a better single-player
experience makes for a more accessible
game and makes for more fun without the
stress of a lot of other games that
requires so much effort to make such
little progress the game feels akin to
some tabletop strategy games and
instances related to map domination it's
a constant tit-for-tat with pirates who
really don't stop acting a nuisance
until a zone is entirely controlled by
your neighbouring faction as you gain
control of cities within the inner
portion of a sector cities closer to
points of ingress may get attacked by
pirates and be reclaimed
hiring NPC or Allied PC ships for
assistance makes for a fun bout of RTS
inspired attack and defend commands
which you can issue though I want to
heavily emphasize that this is without
the micromanagement and other
intricacies of a true RTS it's really
all about you it's all about your ship
your ability to navigate and broadside
and things like that
but you can still task your NPC
followers with attacking and defending
towns which should help in maintaining
control strategy is present in just
about every aspect of the game but isn't
so deep that it becomes overwhelming the
game is a truly accessible title that's
enjoyable to most types of gamers I
would imagine and based on our own
experience but is perhaps not the best
for hyper-competitive folks who maybe
only want to play things like csgo it is
absolutely worth a look though and we
awarded windward with an Editors Choice
Award and our written review linked
below in the description for its high
gameplay value and really fairly
reasonable price point about $15 anymore
than that I would begin to question its
value but where it sits now is perfect
when word is relaxing easy to pick up
and easy to play between work projects
and then dropped for later and it offers
mechanically intuitive but fun
implementations of combat and mercantile
nothing is really inherently brand new
here it's on the unity engine it's using
a lot of borrowed mechanics from other
games but why redo something that's
already working and what matters here is
that it is a somewhat unique setting
there's not a lot of pirate and
mercantile games out there anymore Port
Royale is long overdue for yet another
game but it's still more complex than
windward is and for that I have to give
when weird some attention learn more
