Andy's Vega architecture I have some
information for you it's not as much as
I want we'll get there eventually but
they've given us some cursory stuff this
is going to be a more casual format
because it's an architecture discussion
shot at a trade show is so it's we don't
have the time to look into the real
depth and fortunately and he has not
provided much more depth than what we
have here anyway so before we get into
that this coverage is brought to you by
cyber power and their cyber x el gaming
system which has support for inverted
motherboard tray layout and has an
acrylic window on one side which you can
choose which side I guess if you want
link in the description below for more
information on that so and these Vega
speaking of links in the description
below will have an article links below
if you want to recap of all this stuff
in a more concrete form the basics the
Vega architecture their cursory overview
we have it's not guaranteed to be hbm
for every Vega enabled video card abut
hbm two is on Vega of course as we've
known for quite some time HP cash is
something we'll be talking about here as
is what Andy's client rapid packed math
basically precision switching based on
contacts between FP 16 FP 32 it has FP
64 capabilities integers in there as
well I can switch 16 and 32 and that's
the most of it I don't have product
details at this time so AMD has not made
available to the press or anyone else
the shader counts the memory capacity
the price the specific skews anything
like that we just have top-level
architecture for the time being so
starting off one key thing to note right
out the gate is that the traditional see
use more or less still exists to the
compute unit if you look at a block
diagram for a compute unit it from what
I've been told looks pretty much the
same with today's NC use so that's what
vega uses it runs on NC use i think from
what it sounds like that's not a fully
defined publicly anyway acronym yet but
it's something like new compute unit or
next-gen compute unit so NC use or what
we'll be talking about when referencing
the traditional see use and then the
rest of it we go into things kind
of speaking about high bandwidth cash as
the immediate lobbyist topic since
that's what Andy is going to be talking
about in all of their slideshows and
presentations high bandwidth cash is a
new phrase that is more or less
replacing the phrase vram as it pertains
to vega architecture and this doesn't
necessitate that the GPU or the video
card run hbm in order to be to fall
under the high bandwidth cash phrasing
it could run gddr5 or 5x or whatever
some other memory as long as it is quote
sufficiently fast then it will be
considered high bandwidth cash just
based on the rest of the architecture
now what sufficiently fast is I don't
know I don't know what the cutoff is
there to be considered high bandwidth
cash but what is it well we have one
slide that's sort of useful for this
explanation you can see it's basically
just a block diagram layout of the
traditional caches your l1 or l2 and
then hbm which is acting as somewhat of
a cache it's a bit of a tertiary cash
and that's because hbm as with fiji and
the fury x is located on the substrate
it's adjacent to the GPU dime or less I
don't know if they have the same
interposer architecture as previously
but previously it was sort of substrate
GPU and an interpose or all that stuff
and then the memory can be stacked and
that's continuing with vega you can
stack the memory so that reduces the
physical space requirement and reduces a
few other things like power consumption
this is not news with vega it's just
kind of how hbm works in any of its
implementations that we've seen so far
using and these words here to describe
things a bit more other than breaking
the things into smaller data into
smaller pages with the HP cache
controller it's also more intelligence
which but you know who knows what that
really means exactly but the prefetching
routines supposed to be a bit more
advanced I don't have details on that
but it should be better at prefetching
it should be better at man
the incoming and outgoing memory of the
data streams so if you're streaming a
large texture and theory HP cash will
know better how it should break up that
texture memory bandwidth SAR upwards of
a terabyte per second this has been
known for a little while now Vega in
theory this this part is kind of
interesting in theory vega from what
we're told can support up to about a 512
terabyte virtual address space that
doesn't mean of course that you'll get
that but if you have the rest of the
system configured 512 terabyte virtual
address space is going to be your
combination of things like system memory
and HBC on Vega and that would it's sort
of a unified memory and he wants to
avoid the phrase unified memory because
they've used it in the past for their AP
use and that could cause some confusion
but it can be thought of in some ways as
a unified memory I'll have more
information on that eventually again
that's what a lot of this is going to be
the will have more information later
unfortunately as for other things I'm
curious to see how that integrates if at
all with Intel CPUs I don't know if they
will have access to the Intel memory bus
in a way that would enable it fully
there might be an abstraction layer in
there the AMD CPUs or apos might perform
a bit differently in that regard but
we'll have to talk to AMD about that
maybe get an engineer who can explain it
a bit better than the press deck and the
the slideshow applications so here's the
the main part that they'll be talking
about this idea of rapid packed math
with Vega Vega is taking the fact that
for every single application or every
data set and computing you don't need
just single precision some of them of
course might want double precision if
you're if you need more accuracy or if
you're working with something like deep
learning where there is just a huge
amount of data and missing on one or two
pieces of information is largely
irrelevant than half Precision's just
fine and it speeds up the operations and
is generally going to be more favorable
than crunching on on numbers with two
times the amount of precision that you
need so rapid packed math allows
switching between FP 16 and 32 and I
believe integer as well and that means
that if there
a specific piece of data or a task that
you're completing that doesn't need the
precision it's faster for gaming this
doesn't really have a whole lot of
immediate implications it might not have
any implications for any amount of time
that's relevant to Vegas existence as a
product but basically I suppose AMD was
tied us that there's some evidence of a
development house working on the ps4 pro
looking into the idea of precision
switching that's all I have right now
for gain so this is more of an
application for deep learning
environments Vega strikes somewhat of a
a it lands right in between trying to be
a gaming targeted architecture and
trying to fill a space and deep learning
where AM d is definitely behind right
now they have made any major plays there
so this will be part of an attempt to
gain some ground and deep learning deep
neural Nets things like that so that is
not a gaming application necessarily I
would not get too sucked into the rapid
packed math notes slides that are going
around it's it just week there's no
development support for right now for
gaming and that would probably have to
be explicitly supported by the
application at least at some level and
game developers traditionally are not
very good about doing that sort of thing
look at Direct X 12 and Vulcan where
either there's very little support or
the support that exists is not fully
executed in a way that is what you would
expect based on the marketing materials
with maybe one exception being dim with
Vulcan that one was done pretty well
same idea there though wouldn't get too
sucked into that marketing hype the rest
of it that's that's really most of it i
suppose reading off the notes here from
our conversation with AMD some other key
key items they sped out where more than
doubled the geometry engine peak
throughput per clock that cert the
important effectively higher IPC higher
instructions per clock with the vega ncu
also important higher frequencies are
capable with vega and see you I don't
know what that's compared against i
would i would assume Polaris as the
previous architecture but higher
frequencies on the clock
traditional NT use built around 32-bit
operations and this can handle more
diverse work loads and the AL use can
process to 16-bit operations in parallel
which is also relevant to what we were
talking about there's a next-generation
pixel engine handles rasterization which
is if you don't know polygon to pixel
conversion and handles post-processing
of pixels decides what's visible like
anti-aliasing theoretically does better
calling of things that would produce
overdraw so that's all the the
highlights hopefully have more
information at some point in the near
future otherwise link the description
below for more information thank you for
watching I'll see you all next time
