on net and we're just settling back in
after Patsy's 2011 which was amazing we
have some interviews with robot
entertainment about works must die we
also talked to the portal to devs so
check our channel for that youtube.com
slash gamers Nexus you can also check
our website gamers Nexus Don net or
Twitter account twitter.com / cameras
taxes or any other social networking
devices which are all in the
descriptions below I know it's just as
annoying for you guys to manage them as
a distrust so we're doing our best to
promote all the information pack these
this video will be specifically focusing
on battlefield 3 we weren't able to sit
down with the developers of battlefield
3 at PAX East and get a press preview we
were not allowed to get a hands-on due
to bugs but we do have some new
information for you guys most of the
information I have from pax east we
actually saw this fault line in episode
2 there and we saw a playable version of
it as well not just the video so we will
be talking about that however I'm not
going to talk directly about the video
I'm just going to play the newest video
in the background and tell you guys some
of the new stuff we learned because what
we learned at PAX East was much more
than what following up said to will be
showing us so the biggest thing for the
battlefield 3 Davis was that they're the
only game running frostbite 2 right now
the quote was frostbite 2 is a game
changer for us and they really wanted to
push that and make sure we told you guys
so as we find more about frostbite to
its engine we will tell you guys will
probably do some more videos I have
confirmed that battlefield 3 will be
released this fall we it will be
released this fall according to the devs
so we found out the major enemies are
the insurgent group called the plr we're
not sure plr stands for so if you know
please comment below we noticed that the
urban environments as we talked about in
the last video the urban environments
are taking the the forefront the video
the first video where the earthquake
zone is where the guy says we're 90
clicks away from a major fault line that
is actually a school environment it's
kind of interesting to see schools
actually getting some level design and
some folks on the levels because they're
not normally things that are included
but it does add to the realism of the
single-player campaign and I'm sure
it'll be fun to take cover behind
teachers in multiplayer the next thing I
want to talk about is if you remember
the end of the last video where I said
cars were exploding and a lot of a lot
of people say cars aren't really going
to explode that was just an RPG okay I
want to confirm that cars do explode
just from normal mg or or pistol or m16
rounds whatever just like in call of
duty 4 and every of
a game that's come out since then cars
are explodable they catch on fire it's
not good to sit near them they're used
to kill enemies and that's pretty much
the end of what I want to say about cars
if you also remember the end of the last
video the guy was knocked down and it
looked like he died from the RPG blast
that was actually an RPG knock back we
saw him doing the same thing on the
trailer in the demo at PAX and it looked
like he was just kind of lining himself
up to get killed but then we noticed
that he was sitting far enough away from
the blast where it didn't damage him
sufficiently to kill him however it did
knock him down on his on his back and
then his character jump back up and
started fighting again so there will be
explosions that didn't will knock your
character down that can be as tactically
to ensure that if you want to give a tea
bags i want to knife them while they're
still alive i'm sure you can have fun
doing that by knocking them down with
grenades we noticed in the first video
and a lot of you pointed out that there
was a guy that slid behind cover towards
the end of it did not mention it because
i thought it might have been cinematic
however we saw it having several more
times in the past these 2011 demo so we
think sliding behind cover will actually
be a gameplay mechanic that the player
may be able to perform and possibly a
multiplayer too but absolutely the NPC's
perform some kind of slide it's not
necessarily hugely affecting the
gameplay but it does kind of look cool
and who knows it might speed up your
movement behind cover and it's it's
always harder for snipers to shoot you
as long as the hitboxes are drawn
appropriately the crawling animations
change for each environment we saw a guy
crawling through an air duct in the PAX
East demo and he was probably forward
with his gun forward instead of kind of
more an army crawl honest in a lot
flatter of an open area kind of thing so
that the carling animations changed that
was nice to see this is this gonna sound
stupid but we saw the main character sit
in the chair and disarm a bomb so the
sitting in the chair that was just the
cinematic animations probably not going
to be an act of action however if you
recall and one of the earliest trailers
a lot of people analyzed where there was
a punching seen that looked a lot like
of some kind of torture that was
actually really well planned out by the
devastating even though it looked like
it the punch scene was when we were
disarming a bomb in a basement and we
got ambushed from behind by by some you
know insurgent and he started beating us
up and then we performed several mouse
button clicks or controller clicks to
fight back and do some kind of cinematic
fight sequence which it was a lot of fun
to watch but it's probably not going to
be
it's not going to play out that way
multiplayer for sure we saw towards the
middle of the the package trailer we
were on top of the bridge shooting down
at the guys below the main weapon that
the devil was armed with was in the mg
with 200 rounds if you guys know
anything about what that means go ahead
and post what weapon that is below and i
will add in the annotations so the mg
had 200 rounds it also had a bipod that
was deployable or packable he laid down
on the bridge and started shooting at
the cars and blowing them up there was a
lot more accurate when he used the bipod
so it's really nice to see bipod to come
back into play that'll probably affect
sniping a lot if snipers get them so
that's pretty much all we wanted to say
there were some cool scripted
earthquakes with building collapses in
single player in the PAX East mi just
like in this battlefield fault line
episode two trailer we saw the guy shoot
a building and collapse it with with
rocket launcher we also saw at the end
of the PAX East demo and another
scripted earthquake happened where the
ground split in half and what it rose
about five feet high on one side and
we're on the lower side and then a
building collapse and it fell on top of
our character and that was the end of
the demo that we saw so it's definitely
really cool looking game look out for it
in fall we were not told in exact month
but it will be released this fall they
say look out for more information about
frostbite to check our website WWE music
has done it for more information check
our YouTube channel frequently we have
interviews from pax east so if you're
interested in horse must die or portal
to definitely definitely check those out
and we might be posting some small
articles about some of the other games
there so keep an eye out and we'll talk
to you guys next time little</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
