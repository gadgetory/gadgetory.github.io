ask GN where we answer questions as many
as we can anyway from the comments so as
always leave a question below I've seen
a couple repeats from the past few
episodes so I am trying to pull those up
to actually talk about them but we won't
get to them all but do leave a question
below and I'll try to get to it for next
episode before we get into the content
today it is brought to you by AMD so
we've got a couple Andy devices on the
table the RX 480 of course is at one of
the highest end cards that while the
highest end card that they make in the
current polaris generation and that's
available around $250 gigabyte models
and then the free sync devices that
we've been talking about for the last
few episodes so we got one of those on
the table because the RX 40 is can drive
1440p displays now so that's pretty cool
but the only other thing to note I guess
is that this look looks fake
looks like spent photoshopped in but I
assure you we have painstakingly
arranged it so that it is not reflecting
too much light from the lights that you
all likely take for granted because
there's about 2000 LEDs in my face so
the first question is from comenz√≥
rollit AKA Sam who loaned us the Titan
XP previously Sam says is there a need
for a hyper threading on ten core CPUs
at like the 69 50 X if you're going to
use them for gaming or can you disable
it to gain more stable overclock if
needed so it's a good question you can
definitely disable the hyper threading I
know Sam knows this but for those who
don't you can go into BIOS and actually
turn it off and it's a pretty
interesting way to just test is there
actually gain from hyper threading and
in some games there is so you'll see
this in our battlefield one CPU
benchmark it probably went live
yesterday we're filming this before it
went live but the CBO benchmark shows
that a 6700 K with hyper threading
actually performs reasonably different
from the 6700 K without hyper threading
and it was I think it was about maybe a
10% difference I think was about a 10%
difference so in that particular
scenario the FPS was so high anyway
because we're using a 10-8
ftw at 1080p but there was a real
difference that you could see with
hyper-threading and that's also true
primarily for low values so when you're
looking at 1% in point 1 percent low is
in our metrics or the longer frame time
is the worst frame times in a benchmark
that's where we see the biggest
difference with hyper-threading it's
true for Metro last light and it's true
for battlefield one as well so that's
dated yes there's a difference from
hyper-threading we've also seen a
difference with the 59 30k which is not
a 10 core CP like this one Sam's talking
about but I don't have the 10 core CPUs
that are out right now so I don't know
how much impact hyper-threading has with
those I can say we've seen an impact in
FPS again about 10% and that would help
you get to 144 Hertz if you're trying to
push a 144 Hertz display or something
like that but it does depend on the game
quite a lot depends on how they've
optimized their game now as for other
use cases I know with Adobe software for
example a lot of those kind of cap out
at utilizing threads maybe six cores
efficiently so there's limits in
production software some production
software use that record that you throw
at it or every thread that you throw at
it so there's going to be a more of a
benefit there than with games but not
always because the Dobies Creative Suite
is actually pretty limited and the
threads you can utilize which is a shame
but they're getting better with it as
for gaming there like I said depends on
the game if I had in your case if I had
a 10 core CPU you're basically looking
at do I want to potentially increase my
overclock a little bit and get the clock
rate game gain in games that are clock
sensitive or do I want to keep
hyper-threading and get the hyper
threading gain and games that our thread
sensitive and I would say that in most
of our current testing and I need to
catch up on the more recent launches
other than battlefield most of our
current tests we we do see more of a
gain from the core increases the clock
rate increases then from the thread
count in
creases but that's changing as we roll
forward so I'll let you know how all
that goes as we continue to have to do
next question is from dirt zoo who says
there's a quick
there's a question for the am the expert
cat who we just kicked out of the room
I built a red machine for battlefield
1fx 9370 gigabyte motherboard to XFX for
80s and crossfire DirectX 12 does not
seem to support crossfire in this game
week a battlefield one he says DirectX
does not seem to support crossfire tried
the x11 but it is unplayable tearing and
just bad things happen in crossfire do
you think the x12 will support cross
right in the future so what are we doing
here oh I'm to 144 Hertz monitor okay so
yes that also depends on the game I
guess the rest of the question here is
actually also kind of important saying
I'm getting 90 ish fps now and on ultra
with one monitor but I used if I use two
it stutters bad lower settings a
resolution does not seem to help so I
don't think it's a power issue
addressing the last part of the question
850 watts is plenty for two for 80s and
well yeah 1993 70 you're pushing it a
bit but not that much you're still you
should still have enough power
uh-huh so I don't think that's gonna be
your issue unless your PSU is not
outputting what it should be but that
seems that's uncommon and unlikely
especially for an 80 plus gold P SES but
as for the rest of this crossfire is
again going to be game dependent so in
DirectX 12 versus DirectX 11 the only
game that really really does multigp
well right now is ashes and that is more
of a benchmark than a game but ashes
does what's called MDA multi display
adapter this is different from link
display adapter or the more common
implementation and that's something
we've talked about in the for in in the
past with the ashes benchmarks with
1080s with the crossfire 480 testing we
did and the sli 1070 testing we did
which needs to be updated but
MDA is what you're gonna see with the
x12 that kind of bypasses the need for a
bridge and goes through the PCIe bus
instead and then it also reduces some of
your latency concerns but it's not
really prevalent right now so ashes is
the only game that's really doing it for
the most part I don't think battlefield
one does but maybe someone does know and
can count I haven't actually researched
that yet DirectX 11 I it's so basically
you have an issue of latency with multi
GPUs always going to be a concern
because especially with AFR or something
like that where the GPUs have to
communicate and then build frames
together intersperse the frames one
after the next so there's always going
to be a worse frame time output with
multi-gpu so if you have two rx for ATS
you might actually see that stuttering
you're talking about where I think the
word you used was tearing but normally
it's more of like a micro stutter type
thing where the latency between frames
is disparate enough that the gap exceeds
sort of an eight millisecond window so
once you have more than eight
milliseconds one frame to the next it
starts to become more visible to a human
player that's where you see the
stuttering and that often happens with
the multi-gpu just because of the
latency involved with to display devices
computing the frames so as for your
specific question I guess I would have
to know more is this happening with
other games or not if the way you could
troubleshoot this you can buy first of
all power is ever a concern is for
anyone out there you could buy what's
called a kilowatt power meter for the
wall they're not expensive they're maybe
20 or 30 bucks not the most accurate
tool on the planet but pretty damn good
for testing how much power your computer
draws so that's just kind of general
advice if you have a system you've built
you're trying to figure out do I have
Headroom here to add another card you
can buy one of those for a couple bucks
20 bucks or so and see how much power
you're drawing at the wall so that would
answer that question I don't think it's
a power issue but I think it's basically
a game issue so the 9370 will definitely
bottleneck either
so the the VF ones benchmark we just did
the CPU benchmark should be live on the
channel
did not test the 9370 we tested the
83-70 and we're seeing some pretty
decent bottle knockin on the GTX 980 ltw
hybrid so you can check out that content
if you're curious more about about that
bottleneck next question is from John
Smith he says coming from one of your CP
review videos I have a question could
you add gaming and recording as one of
your CD and GPU benchmarks so we've
actually tested that first of all
recording software nowadays is mostly
moving to encoders on the GPU so these
are physical components on the GPU that
handle encoding or capture of live video
or streaming of live video and they are
a lot more efficient than the way that
it used to be done which is to the point
of this question on the CPU so these
fraps that's all CPU so you're recording
with fraps pretty much uncompressed
lossless AV is that hammer the framerate
down about 50% lower than what it was
when you're not recording fraps is doing
that on the CPU so that back when that
was really one of the only ways to do
this that would be a great benchmark
because it was the only way to do it
so now though this software like shadow
play and like GVR or whatever it's
called these days it does it all on the
GPU encoder and OBS can do it on the
encoder on the GPU as well whether it's
aim the or Nvidia and video has special
codecs that are supported and the does
it as well in different ways but for the
most part GPU encoding is supported with
all the major software suite I know of
for video capture as for the impact we
have an old old video now shadow play
versus gbr versus fraps
you can still find it on the channel and
an old article as well same title and
that shows that with shadow play from
memory I think it was about a 3% hit to
performance overall the actual frame
rate performance in a game and that's
pretty good
GPR was very close to that it was a
couple percent but it did depend a
little bit I think on may have depended
on the software settings but GBR was
pretty damn close and that was AMD a
solution at the time they've
rebranded it a few times since so I'm
not sure what it's called right now
OBS does take more of a hit so OBS is
harder to configure there's a lot more
options it's more built for streaming
that would be one that might be worth
adding to a benchmark but for the most
part I would say we probably won't be
benchmarking with recording scenarios
because for CPUs because so much of it
is just done on the GPU now and the hit
again is like three percent depending on
the south resolution if you're using
something accelerated by Nvidia or AMD
specifically the hit is so small that
it's it's negligible but OBS would be
more of a concern for sort of live
streaming and that's still it's getting
optimized on the hardware so it's kind
of fading away as an issue but it's
still worth discussing so hey we'll look
at that in the features and benchmarks
or something like that next question is
from sir papa who says for the next ask
GN why is it that AMD has a larger
performance gain on dx12 than nvidia
this is for the new and old cards will
this be the same going forward Vega vs.
Volta Vega versus Walt I don't know I
don't know anything about the
architecture of either of those and that
is really what matters the first part of
this question why is the performance
gained larger for AMD
a lot of that is dx11 optimization
NVIDIA invested a ton of resources into
their drivers or dx11 optimization so if
you watch our interview with Rajat
Kaduri you can kind of learn in there
that what these driver teams do for
Nvidia and AMD both they'll go into the
game basically indirectly through the
driver and they will rewrite how the
game is drawing different effects so if
md says you know our hardware handles
this better if we use these shaders or
if we use this arrangement and the sort
of the the hardware stack what
components specifically within the GPU
are being used to handle what processing
is demanded by the game or the engine
nvidia has invested a lot of resources
in dx11 optimization I would say that's
probably a lot of it because you know
there's this discussion where the
architectures are different and people
keep hearing a ce4
and E or compute preemption for NVIDIA
and I think the common internet place to
jump is well am these scales better
because of a CES but that's not all
there is to it and these scaling looks
as good as it does because they're dx11
performance just wasn't as good as
Nvidia's was and part of that is GCN
architecture so what you end up with is
scaling that either looks potentially
slightly negative on Nvidia or equal at
best and scaling that looks really good
for AMD depending on the implementation
doom with Vulcan would be an example
especially with their actual implemented
async compute and ashes is another good
example but an Ashes you look at the
dx11 performance with an D it's really
bad and the frame times are really bad
too
so DX 12 there is actually the
implementation of it a DAC is actually
really useful and that's again because
of the optimization done on the x11
drivers by Nvidia and because of the
optimization done by Andy for DX 12
they've shifted their focus but there's
not as much driver interfacing with
these new api so with this is what I
again talked about with Raja kanuri
going forward a lot of this onus will be
on the developers to build their
software so it actually leverages the
APS properly the way you have games like
Battlefield Wan which put out really
really a spotty performance at the x12
best-case scenario you're about equal
maybe one FPS better with the x12 but
the frame times are all over the place
and that's because the developers and
AMD and NVIDIA can't do a lot to fix
that because this is the game talking
more directly to the hardware the driver
is not really interfacing as much in the
middle it's not interfering with what's
being drawn as much as it used to with
the x11 or OpenGL so the short answers
the question is what why is it that AMD
has a larger performance Gandy x12 if
you're looking at percentages AMD will
look infinitely better that's because of
the x11 performance is not great and a
lot of games tested and then there is
something to be said for the
asynchronous hardware support
stuff like that and video does async
compute as well through compute
preemption for the most part and we'll
talk about that more in the future once
Vega and Volta actually have
architecture information out there but
right now we don't we don't have any
information so I can't predict what
it'll look like in the future but for
now yeah and these seemed decent scaling
on games that actually support the extra
properly if the developers have
optimized for dx12 and for Andy hardware
but a lot of game still zero scaling so
it's it's a mess right now ap eyes are a
big mess you can watch our battlefield 1
GPU benchmark to learn more about it and
why that is the case next question
- Kulu says do you use for mark
sometimes it's a very very simple
question I guess I use fur mark to
validate Tom's Hardware its findings on
the EVGA 1080 FTW so that's what they
use to generate the numbers that
generated so we use it to validate their
numbers and see if there's actually
concern I don't use it in everyday
testing we use other tools normally next
question is Peter custom who says you
mentioned it as possible in the previous
previous video to move workload from the
CPU to the GPU what possibilities are
there out there to do that I have an FX
8350 which is really bottleneck in my
bf1 performance so I want to use this
shift as an interim solution until Zen
comes out so unfortunately what I was
talking about in that video is not
really something you can just do as a
user this is when I was talking about
shifting the workload from the CPU to
the GPU I was talking about api's this
is related to the sir powers question
about the developers actually using an
API to pull draw calls off of the CPU so
the GPU can focus on them without
needing to communicate with the CPU for
every single piece of primitive or
geometry drawn and that's that's not
something you can control as a user
that's done by the developers so the
best thing you can do and battlefield
one will definitely battle a bottleneck
on an 8350 we show that again in our cpu
benchmark for the game that should be
out by now the best thing you can
probably do short of buying a new CPU is
to overclock it so if you have a decent
cooler on there or if you buy these in
cooler
should be able to overclock that thing
pretty decently in battle
one does respond to clock rate increases
we saw that in our testing so I would
recommend that as the immediate solution
or the interim solution until you get
Zen because it looks like you're waiting
for Zen based on this question last
question is apple juice apple juice balm
says hey gamers Naxos what is the
theoretical minimum size that a GPU die
set could be manufactured to before
electrical resistance halts the
shrinking process that's a pretty hard
question then then the follow up to that
also by the same user also what does the
naughtiest thing the cat has done while
you were trying to film the first part
of the question the one about the GP
diet I can't really answer that I'm not
an expert in silicon engineering so
that's something that we will certainly
be asking experts in the future as we
talk to Intel and AMD more maybe at CES
I don't have an answer off the top my
head several years ago I spoke to a
former Intel employee who had moved
around the industry a bit talk to him
about silicon manufacturing process
things like that he was saying that
around 8 nanometers there starts to be a
big wall and the the actual tools used
to manufacture the product would change
but I don't know much more than that so
I don't have a good answer for you I'm
sure there are people who have
researched this I'm sure and on champey
has talked about it but I'll look at
that in the future as for the second
part the question the naughtiest thin
the quote unquote that the cat has done
while trying to film was probably
knocking over video cards I think in one
of our comparisons she we made it we
even included a clip where she just
hopped up on the table over on that side
of the table just jumped up while we
were filming and then proceeded to knock
a video card over but it didn't fall off
the table so it's all good so that is it
