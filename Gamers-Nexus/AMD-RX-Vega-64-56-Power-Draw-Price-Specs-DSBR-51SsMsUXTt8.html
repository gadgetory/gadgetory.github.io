$500 for our ex mega64 and we think $600
for our x-ray s 64 aqua the liquid
cooled version which is a price that's
basically derived from the Delta between
the one card and then the bundle back
speaking of there are bundle packages as
well which are your usual discount plus
games plus flight increasing price we'll
talk about those but the main pricing
index is 400 to 5 or 600 depending on
what you're looking at
we are also covering today the finalised
specifications not rumored anymore for
rx Vegas 64 and 56 and then we'll
further be going into information on
architecture in a separate video so we
have a separate deeper dive I'm not
going to say deep dive because it's not
quite as far as I want to go we'll have
more for you closer to launch but we
will have a deeper dive into Vega
architecture in a separate video so
subscribe to that if you aren't already
but let's dig into our Vegas 56 and 64
for today before getting to that this
content is brought to you by the
Thermaltake flow RGB closed-loop liquid
cooler which is a 360 millimeter
radiator plus 3 120 fans that are RGB
illuminated if then we'll take it ring
fans at that this is a 4.5 done 8 attack
pump which one of the faster pumps you
can learn more at the link in the
description below ignoring Vega F e the
flagship rx Vega product is V 64 it has
64 C use hence the name rx Magus 64 $500
to the reference card indicates that we
should expect 500 to probably 600 for a
IV partner models your usual ASIS or MSI
or other cards of that ilk so we're
looking at that for the price range
there's a bit of room above that for
liquid cooled models we are aware of
some from AIT partners that will be
coming out can't talk about who
specifically just yet but there will be
liquid cooled rx Vega models and based
on what you've seen with our own testing
of liquid coin Vega at eversion even
reducing power leakage improves your one
your power consumption and efficiency
and to the performance in terms of clock
Headroom overall in a non-trivial way
the bundle pricing so there are three
different bundles to talk about that
more in a moment but the one for the
liquid gold card
is $700 so you spend 700 you get the
liquid-cooled 64 version and then you
get the other items that are thrown in
there which we'll get to and so we
basically assumed well it's probably
$600 because everything else is one step
up $100 more for the bundle versus for
the standalone card 56 or 64 here's a
chart we made of the known
specifications for rx make it 56 and 64
the names are indicative of Cu count on
each rx Vega 56 has 56 si use or compute
units and so has 3584 cores 64 cores per
compute unit as always the RX at Vega
64 has 64 si use equating 4096 cores
keep in mind that AMD and NVIDIA core
accounts are not comparable directly as
the architecture is different of usual
disclaimer for anyone new here each Cu
has 40 m use with andis architecture so
a 64 CU rx player card will run 256 TM
use while these 5060 you option will run
to 2040 m use big attends rendered
back-end also allows it to push 64
pixels per clock whereas Polaris 10 did
32 pixels per clock it's a bit of a
change to the render back-end which are
responsible for Delta color compression
and memory and color buffer compression
to save power and memory bandwidth and
things like that general optimization
than performance bandwidth and power the
cards also have a 4 megabyte l2 cache
and use the same 2048 bit memory
interface as the Vega F II card that
means that RX Vega is still running to
HBM stacks which you saw in our Vega efi
coverage except now they are at 4
gigabytes per stack for 8 gigabytes
total instead of 16 there's a single
graphics engine as well for a CES which
we've detailed in the past with our
Polaris deep dive last year and 4 of the
revamped
geometry engines people like to talk
about TDP which can be a bit confusing
because there's difference between the
total GPU power and the total board
power tgp is something we independently
confirmed at 165 watts for RX vega 56
and 220 watts for the RX vega at 64
model with total board power for the 56
estimated at 210 watts on the reference
model and about 290 watts for the RX
vega 64 air-cooled model the aqua model
has a total board
our targets of 350 watts one note here
Andy change these numbers a decent bit
depending on who you're talking to so
there's a chance that other outlets
report different numbers maybe of 150
for example instead of 165 but again
that's PGP not total board power and we
were ultimately told 165 by someone with
a fair bit of authority so that's the
number we'll go with as for power
profile tuning we asked whether the
power changes were a result of just
tightening the power target versus efi
or if actual power performance features
were enabled under the hood
turns out RX Vega isn't just a matter of
restricting power target they're
actually doing something for that power
optimization and lowering it overall
other than maybe the Oracle model we
couldn't get explicit examples at this
time one thing we do know is that the
voltage targets change this is something
that can be done through drivers the
voltage checks are at different
frequencies than f e and voltages we're
told should be lower per frequency point
we'd also expect that this would align
with our findings and the under volting
testing on Vega Frontier Edition where
power consumption can equalize while
improving performance it's still a VFS
but it's just a better tuning profile on
efi we also asked Andy's architects
including Mike Mansoor about whether T
SBR was actually disabled in Vega
frontier Edition or if it was just a
rumor there's a lot of talk about that
the official confirmation at least
loosely by the architects was that
tile-based rasterization was in fact
disabled for frontier editions launched
which we think mostly aligns with
statements made about pushing the card
to make it to market in time and the
team also noted that T SBR will be
enabled on both Vega F II and rx Vega on
the launch of rx Vega we asked about
expected performance or power
consumption improvements but weren't
given any specifics at this time so
unfortunately we can't quantify how much
that change will matter or in which
applications it will matter wait for
launch on that there will have all that
information eventually as for launch
date there isn't one yet this appears to
have paper launch so we have
specifications and pricing but we know
that the launch date is sometime in the
middle of August
one more big thing is the clock so as we
know it now rx Vega 64 the reference
model will run a base clock of 12 47
megahertz and a boost clock of 1546
megahertz
and just as a reminder Vega FB had a
targeted booze clock of 1600 but very
rarely held that clock without
increasing the power budget and you
could undervolt things and kind of
equalize power plus 15 watts but the
point is that rx Vega may be different
from Vega Fe where fe e just couldn't
hold 1600 what it tended to do out of
box and this was on a thermal limit
there's a power limit was it would say
that DPM 5 or 6 rather than seven there
are seven total DPM states now five or
six five is 14 40 mega Hertz five of my
head and six top of my head is 15 28
megahertz I want to say and so it would
sit at one of those two frequencies
rather than 1600 because we're hitting a
power limit so that's a bit different
potentially from RSA because the RX Vega
one is a lower clock and two it has some
power differences that we'll be talking
about as well the architecture overall
looks very familiar the specs look very
familiar so there's not a lot of new
stuff here to learn if you already know
Polaris from our 480 d5 that is not to
say that Vega is not fresh and
interesting it's just to say that if you
have a base understanding you can apply
it here and you have a pretty good
starting point of understanding Vega
so that stated a few additional items to
note included power saving features we
spoke with Andy at this event and
learned definitively not rumors as time
that specific power Pete saving features
of the card were disabled for Vega Fe
when it launched and that was to quote
get it out the door which is sort of
what we said in our coverage they wanted
to hit quarter 2 and they did it by
about 2 days so they hit quarter 2 but
some things were disabled and that makes
power consumption look a whole lot
higher from what we've been told on
those vs. on Vega our X version gaming
version a few other items of notes the
video card we're showing is the silver
model which is a limited edition the
main aversion will be black and will
have a logo on the fan as you'd expect
in addition to that there's a card we
didn't talk about the WX Professional
Series cars WX 9100 Radeon card and
and sort of a long's like that there's a
new SSG card which has on video
cardboard solid state drives basically
for two terabytes of on card storage for
large project files and applications
like AutoCAD or something similar to
that but those are out of scope for
today as for the packs the bundles and
things like that this is all kind of
more marketing side stuff which we don't
we don't normally talk about this kind
of thing but it is somewhat significant
here so just kind of walk through it the
packs are there's a black pack a red
pack and an aqua pack allows something
quite obvious what it is the packs are
$600 for Vega 64 aircard with a 200
dollar rebate on a 34 inch ultra wide
freesync display and then that also
includes a $100 discount on a risin 7
plus X 370 motherboard combo and two
games so basically you pay $100 more
than the base price for the card you get
a $100 rebate on an X 370 plus r7 combo
and you get a 200 dollar rebate on a
monitor which is a large expense so you
better you just kind of consumer advice
here I'm not saying it's a bad deal what
I'm saying is consumer advice you better
want that thing before I told you about
this combo to get value out of it if you
are in a position where you are trying
to use the 200 dollar rebate by adding
an expense that was not expected there's
a problem but it's not a bad it's
actually a pretty good deal if you
already want those things it's very
wrong r7 x 370 and a freesync display
it's a good deal if you did not want
them then look at the price without
those things it's $100 cheaper and you
save $100 of actual cash not rebate our
last thing is they include two games
which may or may not be of interest to
you the games vary by region so we won't
specify them here because they will
probably change the banana where you
live and that is that pretty much wraps
it up so $600 for the Vegas 64 version
of that air cooled and then there's a
another one aqua is $700 liquid-cooled
plus the same things the last ones of
our ex Bega 56 as
a $500 price point they're all $100
offset so discounts are the same for all
of them all that stuff and then for the
deeper dive architecture stuff check
back for that shortly but otherwise this
gets you the very basics and hopefully a
quick format so thank you for watching

out there already if you want what we
already what we already knew plus the
new stuff from this weekend because
there is some new stuff including one
new SKU of thread Ripper that wasn't
officially talked up before click the
