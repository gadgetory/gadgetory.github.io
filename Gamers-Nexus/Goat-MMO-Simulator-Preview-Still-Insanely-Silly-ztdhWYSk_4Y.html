to stop net and today we're talking
about goat simulator the MMORPG that is
right goat simulator has returned and
goat simulator if you didn't already
know is marketed by the developers
coffee stain studios as the world's
dumbest game and they may be correct it
is openly branded as a bug fest and it's
pretty buggy it's got some actually
really cool physics simulation and
graphics tech in it but it's it's just a
silly game called goat simulator you
live your life as a goat and you destroy
everything and now there's an MMO
component of it coming out as a free
expansion pack for owners of the
original goat sim which is a ten-dollar
game from the developer directly so the
MMO pack comes out on November 20th and
it's it's pretty silly it's that's what
we're going over today first of all you
play as one of several classes you can
be you can be a tank go a magician goat
a hunter goat which is effectively a
ranger or a rose goat which I suppose is
the goat language way of spelling rogue
and then you can have no class at weekly
microwave and the microwave is an
untextured pair of legs with a microwave
on top of it so now I'm really not
kidding you can actually play as a
microwave in goat simulator that MMORPG
and the game it keeps it silly style
it's got just as a sort of a jab at
world of warcraft which just upped its
level cap to a hundred levels the goat
simulator demo or go MMO stimulator
whatever it's called is officially a 101
level cap so that makes an objectively
superior to warlords of draenor and it's
got leveling it's got a couple items on
the five items on the hot bar so from
the screenshots what we know is that
you've got an inventory you have levels
you have five abilities including a one
that's a picture of a fish I'm not sure
if that's throwing a fish or if it's
fishing one that is a fishing pole that
you can use to tether enemies to your
fishing pole and run around with them
swinging around on you like a rag doll
with physics interactions on the
environment one that is effectively
ramming your head in
to the enemy one that's s+ left mouse
button which i think is some kind of
going backwards attack and then there's
some kind of tana tak as well so if you
play as the microwave you your abilities
change into the first ability being
pizza and the second one being something
that looks nuclear reactive so that is
goat simulator I thought I'd do a quick
video on go MMO simulator let you all
know that it exists that it's coming out
for free for owners of the original goat
sim that you can pick it up for 10 bucks
if you don't own it probably worth a
look it's something that can kill an
afternoon kind of a silly game so that
is something worth looking at out for
and I will see you all next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
