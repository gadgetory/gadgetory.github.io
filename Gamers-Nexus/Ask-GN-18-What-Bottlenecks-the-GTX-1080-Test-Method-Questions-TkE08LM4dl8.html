episode of ask GN and this is our last
one before flying out to Computex or
Taipei for Computex we might do one
there but I'm not sure it's going pretty
crazy the first question for this
episode I can remember which video I saw
it on by do remember it being asked by
one of the regulars so maybe Leo das or
Street guru but whoever was asked how
much variance there is in testing data
and so the question was basically you
guys run three tests for parity on all
the FPS benchmarks is there that much
variance the answer is yes so a lot of
these other outlets will present data
it's maybe 22 games tested or 30 games
benchmarked or something like that and
that's just an absurd amount of
benchmarks to run unless they have
multiple systems running it's normally
not really feasible in the review time
that we have so if you run I could
certainly run more benchmarks if we only
did one pass per game but the thing is
with these even though automated
benchmarks there's still a variance of
sometimes 1 2 3 fps and that's a big
deal when you might be comparing things
that are 1 to 3 FPS different so it just
it depends on the game and the
throttling where the game throttles if
it's more intensive on one component or
the other if you're testing GPUs and
it's more intensive on the CPU then
you're going to hit CPU throttles and so
the CPU boosts or does any energy
control which we turn all that stuff off
then you'll see fluctuations there but
normally it's only a couple fps so not
enough to be an invalid tool for the
test suite but enough where you want to
run it multiple times and that's just
because if maybe the first tested card a
test at 76 fps and card B tests at 73
fps that looks like a pretty reasonable
difference but over multiple task passes
they might average out and be the same
or very close to the same so yes there
is actually difference and it is
important to do multiple passes
especially and this is the important
part with the frame time so anyone who's
doing frame time testing should do multi
pass testing
because especially with the 1% 0.1% blow
is that we use 0.1% might only be a
couple frames that might be like 5
frames for the entire test sequence so
that's a pretty low sample small sample
size doing multiple tests will smooth
out that data and make sure that from
one's the next it looks consistent and
if it's inconsistent in one of the
passes we know we need to run it a few
more times just to try and understand
what's going on if we can't repeat
reproduce that inconsistency then we
know that it's basically an outlier we
discard that particular piece of data so
that hopefully answers that question
next question is a marker show who says
dude to benefit from the NATO GT X 1080
am I going to need a new CPU and
motherboard my current C views and I 540
670 46 17 on K I've been saving up for a
rift my current GPU is a 780 and then
some other words I'm just making sure
there's no other questions in here do I
need to say for a whole new machine if I
want to see benefits from the 1080 so I
haven't tested this yet but I can tell
you from really brief testing I just did
on total war Warhammer which are
benchmarks aren't up for that yet really
brief testing they're using a 59 30 K
which is more powerful than the 40 60 70
the 59 30 K at 4.2 gigahertz versus
three point six or eight gigahertz at a
15 or 20 fps Swain and that was with the
GTX 1080 so what that tells us is that
in the very least frequency in that
particular game has a huge impact and
will throttle the GPU in if you sort of
extrapolate that any other games that
act similarly that are maybe CPU bound a
lot of racing games or CPU bound like
grit and dirt those are instances where
you will be bottlenecking the GTX 1080
out of 46 70 because we were
bottlenecking it on a 59 30 so that
would be certainly a consideration the
46 70 is still a good CPU but I I need
to test it more personally we are
working on that but it'll be at least a
few weeks till it gets up because this
Computex trip it is something that you
may end up replacing though so just be
aware of that
the next question zero Sami Sami Sami
who says hi recently I switched to a
mini ITX low end motherboard but the
former overclock I sustained on my r9
290 GPU couldn't be achieved on this new
board what could cause this I only
switch the motherboard and nothing else
so I know for sure it's the motherboard
but why it's possible dependent what you
had for your previous board it's
possible that maybe there were
additional phases or something the
better power cleaning going on that was
stabilizing your clock so that would
work on stabilizing voltage supply to
the GPU in that case that maybe that's
what it was but that's not super common
for a change like that to destroy an
overclock it could also be maybe the I
don't know maybe the PCIe lanes are
handled differently or something like
that but that doesn't really doesn't
make a whole lot of sense to me so I
would probably suspect two things I
would look at BIOS or UEFI and see if
there's anything in there that handles
PCIe timings or latency or PCIe bus
clock or something like that bus speed
that would be one place to look the next
place to look would be the power
delivery design on the new board versus
the old one and see if the old one is
better and on mini ITX that may be the
case because they're really limited on
space so those are the two places I
would look of course also look at your
CPU clock because maybe well depends on
what you mean by you can't achieve the
same clock it may be the case though
with for gaming FPS that you were
overclocked on one board and you're not
on the new one for the CPU that would
impact it too but if you're just
straight not seeing the new clock be
achieved on the GPU then it's one of the
first two issues I thought of the next
part of this question was also I cross
fired r9 290 with an r9 390 and my
friends high end machine for fun to see
performance scaling I noticed in the GPU
panel that the second card ran at x4 or
by 4 or 4 tap PCIe noting that my
friends rig has a devil's canyon i7 that
sounds like a motherboard potentially
motherboard things so I don't again
don't know what motherboard this is it's
not listed but boards will they even
though it's there's a full length
pcie slot that would normally be called
x16 even on new agra amazon a lot of
those slots even if there's four on a
board a lot of those slots will only be
electrically wired four by four or by
eight and that's basically so they can
put a full slot to fit the cards but
with crossfire you may end up running
like X X 8 X 4 X 4 or something like
that so it's possible that the slot used
was just not wired electrically 4 by 16
setup but if it's a full by 16 slot you
also need to check the manual and make
sure that it's not suggesting that you
run a different slot for SLI or
crossfire because that is also something
that happens next question final
question Homer Thompson it says see what
do you make of the price inflation we've
seen in GPUs the last 5 years in 2011 a
GTX 560 Ti was sold for 250 in 2012
doubled for 500 for full-size the GK 104
GTX 680 $50 price increased to 550 for
the NVIDIA uncut GM 204 and then another
increase to $700 for the equivalent
uncut GP 104 in the 1080 how much until
we're paying $350 for the small GM 206
equivalent in GTX 960 yeah that's a real
concern so the price gains are there's a
few things I'm not 100% sure what I
think of this Jessie I'm still thinking
about it but one thing is these cards
like the the 560 TIG P equivalent of
today they're a lot more powerful in the
games aren't necessarily growing in
their demands a lot of games anyway so I
guess that you can get away with a low
end or mid-range card a lot better now
than he used to be able to so that's one
thing that might help the companies
justify the price increases the next
thing is just a general competition
I guess misalignment so because then
video is not super threatened right now
in their market share they have a ton of
market share and just strictly speaking
to gaming PC's we're not counting
consoles here gaming PC's and videos AIB
presence is 70 something percent so
they're certainly not feeling the the
threat to lower their prices and these
putting pressure on the low end
but they've always been there now
another thing that I think is more
relevant than that
is Intel and AMD with their apos they're
both really pushing this low-end market
so that the demand for maybe a GT 740 or
something that demand has kind of
evaporated because the reason you would
buy one of those is if you didn't have
on board video or you didn't have one
that was good enough to play some simple
games but you also didn't want a full
and full mid-range or low on GPU you
would buy something like a GT 740 or
whatever now you don't need to do that
because the CPUs have these iGPS ApS
have their their GPU components so those
kind of invalidate the need for a lot of
the really cheap GPUs and I think that
probably creates a weird gap in the
market where now the low on GPUs are
priced a little higher than they used to
be and that of course raises the price
of everything else but of course there's
also just general inflation but I'm not
a high percent sure what I think of that
just yet I do I will say that $700 for
founder's Edition 1080 is too much but
the $600 price point seems good if any
of the IB partners actually reach that
price point when they make their cards
so that seems good 700 certainly cheap
we don't know what am these stuff will
cost yet but we'll see and analyze that
once we're reviewing the Polaris tough
players 10 so that's all I got for you
this week as always pay Charlie
commercial video if you like this
content will be in Taiwan China and
Macau next week and we're going to be
doing factory tours headquarters tours
and the compy tech show floor and we'll
probably do some kind of random walking
around the giant empty abandoned mall
and Shenzhen so that'll be fun but check
back for that thanks for watching I'll
see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
