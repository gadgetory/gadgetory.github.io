are pretty interesting rare decided to
focus its efforts primarily on making
highly physically and visually accurate
water and reflections off of the water
allowing the rest of the graphics to
follow a more cartoony simple cue sea of
thieves is exceptionally playable on
even ancient hardware for PC making an
Xbox at versus PC comparison
particularly apt the two should be a
highly comparable in visual quality
we'll be looking at that and at Xbox
framerate and frame time performance in
today's content before that this video
is brought to you by Thermaltake and the
view 71 enclosure the view 71 is a full
tower case that's capable of fitting
three video cards and most
configurations it's also one of the
better cooling cases in our recent case
testing bench lineup the view 71 has
hinged a tempered glass doors on either
side that make it easy to open and show
off and it comes with at least one rain
fan though you can get the RGB version
if you prefer learn more at the link in
the description below sea of thieves is
one of the first particularly big
multiplayer titles to be added to the
xbox play anywhere program this means
that it's playable on both Xbox one and
Windows 10 you could buy one key and
play it on both devices PC and Xbox it's
also somewhat oddly a Windows 10
exclusive game yet it uses DirectX 11
either way though the Xbox and PC
players are free to encounter each other
and sea of thieves and they can even
party up together so the only downside
here is that you're forced to interact
with the Windows 10 store and
marketplace and the Xbox app but
otherwise these two aspects make a PC
vs. Xbox comparison interesting because
any player who owns both could switch
between them and so we wanted to look at
how the graphics compare and what is the
equivalent group of settings between sea
of thieves on Xbox and sea of thieves on
PC thanks to Xbox and PC cross-play we
were able to sync up PC and console
footage easily by accruing a ship with
two accounts one on each platform an
interesting side effect of this method
was the discovery that the worlds are
almost entirely in sync even on
different platforms makes sense that the
wave patterns
must be synchronized because they
effects the ship's position but even the
clouds are pretty close to identical
although they are subject to the PCs
greater draw distance as far as settings
go it seems that the PC and Xbox
more-or-less look the same when the pcs
on max settings the Xbox version of the
game is pretty close to maximum fidelity
on the PC there are a couple of
differences we'll be talking about
through this content but overall they
are very close the lighting and some of
the draw distance and poppin elements
are the biggest changes with the Xbox of
course having shorter draw distance and
later poppin but otherwise a couple of
quick notes we originally set the
default standard color space intended
for TVs rather than PC RGB on the Xbox
and then we switched it back later so a
couple of the Xbox scenes used in this
comparison may look washed out that's
not a game fan it's an Xbox thing if you
use the TV color space let's get some
charts and gameplay footage on the
screen to start out with as a reminder
for our footage playback in console
comparisons we illustrate frame pacing
with a left-side scrolling ticker in
binary red indicates a drop or in this
case a tare while green indicates a
successfully generated new frame walking
through the most interesting footage
where we're swimming in the storm but we
encounter several frame tears on the
Xbox one X that are both observable and
measurable these don't occur frequently
and seem largely relegated to this very
specific load intensive scenario overall
we don't believe this screen tearing to
be of significant detriment to gameplay
but we did want to highlight its
presence
servicing from the wave shows a hard
tear in one instance we can also see the
bow of the ship get torn as the frame
refreshes out of interval and so forth
our framerate analysis program detects
tears as unique frames right now but
that's okay in this case tearing can be
seen in the charts where frame x dipped
to sixteen point seven milliseconds as a
reminder framed Heron is functionally
the opposite of stuttering at a 30fps
target our frame to frame interval
should be 33 milliseconds between frames
or sixteen point six 67 milliseconds at
a 60 FPS target if the GPU can't prepare
a frame and time to hit the 33
milliseconds target with vsync enabled
it should replay the previous frame this
causes a stutter what we're seeing is
the
opposite of a starter here though we're
seeing a tear these happen when the GPU
is completing frames out of interval so
it may be pushing out runt frames to the
display and rendering out of vsync
refresh intervals in this chart of the
swimming and the storm test we did
you'll see occasional dips to 16
millisecond frame times this typically
would indicate a 60 FPS frame something
that's actually desirable in our present
in-house benchmarking software though
again this is indicative of one of those
tears it looks like a frame delivered
faster but the frame quality is lower as
a result of the tearing you'll also see
a couple of spikes up to 66.7
milliseconds and 50 milliseconds for
individual frame presents but nothing
too bad or experience harming both of
these would be representative of
stutters or dropped frames our next
demonstration is when sailing towards
the island and playing around with the
cannons the game is nearly perfectly
steady at thirty three point three
milliseconds or 30 FPS for the entirety
of the test pass eventually we encounter
some framedrops that pushes up to sixty
six millisecond frame times remember
lower or more consistent or both better
and then we encounter a tear and then we
encounter a severe series of frame drops
at around the 900 second mark in this
chart we encounter a frame time of 233
milliseconds meaning that it took about
a quarter of a second to draw the next
frame that's a long time to be staring
at a series of frame drops again
fortunately this is not common and it's
not significantly detracting from the
experience that said it's an occasional
problem and we hope that rares upcoming
performance patch that was promised for
Xbox will address this issue we can show
some footage of the sequence happening
in our video capture for anyone curious
there are a few instances of this type
of frame drop occurring but overall it's
not bad the same goes for tears they
happen in really intense scenarios and
then seem to go away for the rest of the
game graphics settings are relatively
sparse on PC options include these five
settings shadow detail model detail
texture detail water detail and lighting
detail model detail and water detail are
among the two most important settings in
the game model detail impacts pop in LOD
scaling at longer view distances and
mesh LOD water detail of
wave reflections ripples and impacts the
performance on both the CPU and the GPU
in our testing we observed that dropping
from mythical the max settings all the
way down to a minimum of curst there is
relatively minimal quality change over
all sea of thieves seems to mostly
exaggerate the texture details setting
and the water detail with the rest
impacting visuals in limited ways tax
for detail for instance oddly impacts
loading screen texture resolution and UI
elements water is where rare invested
most of its graphics resources clearly
and you can see that in reflections
there are some oddities in water for
example some of the reflections that
show through will occur when we're
swimming through taller waves and you
can see what's supposed to be a
reflection of a ship or island in the
distance
however it's being shown on the screen
incorrectly when that object is nowhere
near us overall though the water looks
highly realistic and it has white caps
and other physically accurate elements
that would be reflected in an ocean we
did notice that the Xbox's model detail
setting is lower than on PCs highest
settings the models that load in so far
away on the PC that's actually difficult
to discern any popping in at all but
that's not true on the Xbox one example
of the pop and distance disparity would
be the barrels atop one of the boathouse
roofs that we saw in the game where the
PC version loads them in early before we
ever really notice them and the Xbox
version hasn't caught up yet also on
Xbox it's occasionally possible to see
sharp lines beyond at which waves are
not rendered while on the PC the
distance is again so great that the line
is invisible we didn't do an SSD versus
hard drive benchmark this time but for
what it's worth we also noticed that the
Xbox easing its stock hard drive took
something like 40 seconds longer to load
into a game and loaded textures are more
slowly than the PC using an SSD at the
time of this writing rare is planning a
fixed to quote performance issues on the
Xbox one X in a patch that's shipping
early next week the week of the 25th the
issues apparently occur in specific
unnamed places and we don't think we
encountered those areas during testing
but if we did hopefully they're resolved
soon other than that we only noticed
some subtle lighting dip
says there was it less reflected glare
from the muzzle flash of cannons on the
Xbox and the shipwrights tall was more
brightly lit on PC due to sunlight
either bouncing off of water or just
more directional light being rendered
than on the console there are also some
differences in occlusion and overall
though the primary difference was just
that draw distance finally lens flare is
absent on console which is odd seeing as
it's a computationally cheap
post-processing effect it's enabled on
even the lowest setting on PC like it or
not and it's entirely absent on the Xbox
it's also possible that there are other
small differences like these but if so
they're difficult enough to detect that
they don't affect the experience
lighting and reflections on and under
the surface of the water itself seem
identical but Whitecaps on PC contrast
more and are better defined this is an
example of one of those smaller
differences that's kind of hard to
notice so that's it for the Xbox
Performance and the PC versions
comparison we didn't really bother with
PC performance testing because it's
irrelevant you could run the game on
ancient hardware they even call their
lowest setting cursed and for what it's
worth the lowest setting on PC aside
from a couple of details looks pretty
darn close to the max settings on PC
it's almost indistinguishable so the
main things you'll notice would be
slightly delayed popping and if you
lower water detail that'll look a lot
worse but everything else the character
models meshes static meshes all of the
other objects in the game look more or
less the same so
textures are the big difference
basically if you wanted to tune your
settings for low-end Hardware we'd
recommend keeping texture resolution
high keeping water detail medium to high
and everything else should be pretty
much the same in terms of visual quality
you'll lose a bit on draw distances but
that's it and that's not a big thing to
lose if you're on low on hardware so
that's the that's everything you need to
know about C of Thieves graphics it's
really pretty basic in terms of the
graphics options available the water is
where they spent the entirety of their
time there are some odd reflection
behaviors in water as we demonstrated
but other than that it looks really good
and it's probably some of the best water
we've seen in a game so job well done
too
for that the rest of it is really more
of a stylized look anyway as always you
