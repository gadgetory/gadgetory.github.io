a.m. the RX 5700 xt this is a non
functional model its mechanical sample
we have a functional model as well that
we've taken apart after this to put
thermocouples on it but this is the same
board team cooler same everything as our
functional model it just allows us to
keep doing some testing while we still
do a teardown so we're taking this apart
today we're gonna look at the vrm
components the cooler assembly see if
there's any glue hidden in there and and
see the overall build quality of AMD's
5700 xt before that this video is
brought to you by us and the gamers
Nexus toolkit on store document access
net our brand new toolkit just launched
and contains 10 custom made drivers for
video card disassembly reap hasting and
tear downs the 8 core tools are made of
high-quality chromium vanadium alloy
steel that's built for long service life
and resistance to wear during use the
other two tools are carbon steel hex
heads that were custom ground down for
capacitor clearance on video cards all
the tools are easily mounted to a
pegboard or stored in the GN made tool
bag for easy transport
learn more at the link in the
description below so here it is this is
Andy's new blower cooler on the Radeon
5700 XC couple of immediate comments
when I was asked by AMD just casually
what I thought of the cooler design I
said I think Batman called and he wants
his Batmobile back but that's not
actually a good or a bad thing another
thing that is maybe a little amusing is
we had a Patrick Stone who did the
wiring in our office for Ethernet came
by he had not seen this card before he
saw it on the table and he said yikes
what happened to it so this dent is
intentional just before anyone gets
confused that is that is something AMD
meant to do so we did not drop it
although Linus is training me I'm his
apprentice so my card is a an early
revision we're gonna take apart our
production sample as well when we are
done with standard testing and put
thermocouples on it that'll be done
before the review if there are any
differences between the two then this
video won't go up at all so if this
video is up then they are identical
so let's start with just the back plate
back plates got a couple pH one size
screws Phillips screws this we're just
using the GN toolkit on store documents
excess net you can pick these up they
are brand new and thanks to all of you
who have picked them up already it's a
tremendous support it allows us to keep
operating with good independence and
then I'm out on top of the Aegean mod
mat as well so one two three four five
got the old and the hot surface sticker
haven't seen that since probably
probably the 290x era is the last time
we saw one of those warnings well
no thermal pads on the back plate that
is disappointing I don't believe we can
only just take the back plate off of our
testing model I need to do stock their
own testing on some of this the
components on this which is why I don't
want to disassemble the whole thing but
let's just make sure the back plate soon
man I think there's some debug
components on our mechanical sample that
are not on the final sample so what's
gonna happen is I'm gonna end up sending
bill joy both of these photos and asked
them to explain a few things to us like
this I'm not sure what that is
it says gh1 5e but I'm not sure what it
is we can ask him if he knows and that's
on the mechanical sample but not the
final one and then this same story for
that same story for that so I guess
we're gonna end up opening both um but
oh this one we'll have to wait a little
bit so anyway there's no no no thermal
pads on the back layer that's that's the
point that how was it was annoyed about
right so I'll set this aside this needs
to do some more testing anyway back to
this the vrm components are all the same
at least even though there's a few extra
components on the back of PCB and the
coolers gonna be the same
but pretty interesting so the reason for
a disappointment about the backplate is
that this is actually like aluminum and
it's a good heatsink surface and you
could pull a bit of extra heat through
the PCB yeah it's not like it's not the
end of the world end of the day you're
not changing the thermals of the GPU
you're changing the thermals of the
components on the other side but there's
no reason not to I guess it's kind of
the the point we're making so anyway
under that there's these three screws go
to the blower and you can see that right
there
looks like the same one used on the Vega
designs for the the mounting and then
one two three 13 I think screws for the
rest other than the four for the GPU
let's start with the GPU and this is
gonna be a pH zero
it's a pH zero driver which is also in
our tool kit and once we have this off
the ideally what happens is the whole
heatsink falls off the card and that's
it but on these reference models by both
Nvidia and AMD that is not the case we
have to go and remove all these as well
I'm just tracking the screws on the mod
mat as well though this card looks
pretty simple I don't think I'm going to
don't think I'm gonna need the reference
at the end of the day but but it does
give you a visualization of where the
screws are laid out there's another iOS
screw in the back or in the front of the
card sticking through these aren't gonna
be longer we're going to leave those fan
screws in there for now and see if the
designs changed it all from Vega if you
if you have to remove them to pull the
cooler off I think you do though so pH
one for the screws that are in
DisplayPort and HDMI alright so I Oh
plate comes off cards still going to be
stuck because of the screws holding the
fan in and past Vega models these three
screws are actually a different size
than the rest of the screws
but had the same head so that was
annoying but it looks like they fixed
that that's good three five two one
seven controller on the back which is on
the production model that we just opened
as well and then it should be a thermal
pad in here which is part of why I
wanted to use a mechanical model first
to verify if it's a thermal pad instead
of paste because if it's a pad then we
have to take some more care with with
disassembly and reassembly we did a lot
of thermal pad testing on Radeon seven
actually I'll get a sheet to demonstrate
it for you this is from Radeon seven and
so this is pressure paper that we use
and what you do is you just apply it and
then you mount the cooler and see where
the pressure is and so this is just
Radeon seven mounting pressure you can
see what you want to see is this whole
square should be red and this is
different mounts so different times of
applying the cooler and on none of them
did we get full coverage there's always
blank spots in the middle which we we
ended up trying a Thrall pad replacement
replacing it with paste because a paste
should be better than the HMO three the
Hitachi
HMO three pad is what they're using here
and it is a high-end throwing pad it's
got a good thermal conductivity but it's
not all about thermal conductivity which
if you just look at the numbers and you
see I don't know maybe 20 instead of six
and twenty you would think is better but
in reality it's more about contact
pressure and thinness of the material
and with their own pace you can get a
thinner application which will have
better thermal transfer characteristics
than this if you can have an equal mount
but with the Radeon seven card the
amount was bad enough that the extra
thickness of the thermal pad plus the
malleability of the thermal pad while
still having the thickness to reach down
to the GPU from the cold plate those two
things allowed this problem to
be sidestepped not resolved but worked
around and that's why they used to the
thermal pad in in my that's my theory
for why they used it Andy has some other
potential defenses or justifications of
using the pad in that it is a
potentially better long-term solution
because as thrown pace the ages on every
GPU it gets bad cracks a lot of times
companies you should not sue paste or
Dow Corning this is Dow Corning paste
this is actually what ACC is we bought a
lot of this so that stuff doesn't age
well and if their old pad will age
better so in in AMD's defense it's
reasonable for that use but we think the
real reason is for mounting pressure
anyway they're still using that and
haven't done a mounting pressure test
yet but we could do that separately as
for the rest if you did want to
disassemble your own Radeon and the
reference model card at some point just
be aware that there's probably a thermal
pad on there and if there is even though
it's the HMO 3 which is a nice one it is
at some point going to start falling
apart as you disassemble and reassemble
it so you do need to be careful of that
and if you replace with paste you can
and on radium 7 we were eventually
successful with it but in order to
replace this thermal pad successfully
with the paste what you need to do when
you reassemble the card is for this
thing the retention bracket you need to
add a small washer underneath each of
these four screws and that'll increase
the mounting pressure enough that you
can get the cooler to come down low
enough to contact the GPU and that
solves the mounting issue so you just
need like four plastic washers basically
the same kind you'd find any EK water
box mounting kit alright so a cooler
we'll start there throw up had we've
gone over thoroughly you can see well
maybe depending on the camera angle you
might be able to see some small circular
divots in the bottom here and if the
camera ever catches the light correctly
let's they appear there's one here here
here here
and those are from the vapor chamber so
we actually have footage from a
Coolermaster factory that we can
hopefully drop in here I got to build a
vapor chamber and big air quotes there
they stood next to me and told me how to
do the the powder application stuff like
that of vapor chamber but you can see
the inside of one in that video and
that's all that is the vapor chamber
plus the cylinders to hold it up the
blower fan is going to be Delta it is a
if you ever need to replace it the model
number is bf b101 to Sh a zero one and
it's a 12 volts 2.4 amp fan if you need
to replace that which is quite a lot of
power for a fan but it does go over
5,000 rpm from memory and that will be
in the review the rest of this we need
to separate so we can see the internals
of the chamber it looks like there's a
screw in here and here and there those
are all pH one size I think
yes pH one size as for the cables I
disconnected this one next to the screw
driver that should probably be an LED
cable and this one is obviously the fan
cable oh those are some massive screws
check that out
and Loctite pre-applied I will say that
I appreciate having the mechanical
sample this time because taking the
cooler part with the production sample
always sucks because you don't know if
you're gonna be able to get the throwing
pads back on the way they came out so
even if the board components are
slightly different like the addition of
two of those or three of those back
there this part is made much easier for
us to go and greater depth okay aluminum
base plate pretty simple so you've got
shroud shroud I was correct on this that
is an LED cable you can normally
identify them because it's just a red
and a black wire ground in power so LED
shroud very simple this shroud has on
the opposite side of the in on the base
plate side there's a
Gide here a flow guide so the fan sits
in here and this is standard for every
blower fan basically ever put on a GPU
and even though the front end of these
things kind of looks like it can pull
air in because there's there's this
heatsink here and you've got the hole
here that the heatsink is shown through
actually there you go that's made easier
so if you just look at it it kind of
looks like it pulls air in through here
but that's not what happens and it's the
same on the old Nvidia cards air comes
in through here and there's no channel
between these two or very limited of one
if there is and that means it's it's
guiding the air straight through the fin
stack which is an aluminum fin stack
interested in why this part is not
covered but the other is why would that
be is it because of the dent maybe this
might be soldered or TIG welded together
I'm not sure but it does not push out so
what I wanted to do was push the
heatsink out and flip it and see if the
shroud would still fit if they just
eliminated the top of the flow guidance
to accommodate the dance in the shroud
that would be kind of amusing but anyway
aluminum fins stack vapor chamber on the
bottom partially identifiable because of
that which is where it's sealed vacuum
sealed and some additional fin surface
area over here some fins over here not a
whole lot but enough to maybe help a bit
with the MOSFET cooling this is located
near the MOSFETs and inductors
and yes this sits right on top of the
MOSFET so those have a direct heat path
heat sinking and then the fan I want to
try and get this out just because it is
a mechanical like it's not like it's the
whole purpose is to be disassembled and
then we could also cut it open don't
think we're breaking the part I want to
break maybe this will be the first time
we've separated this part of the cooler
because I it doesn't need to be reused
so that is really cool good opportunity
we might end up breaking some of the
fins off the MOSFET fins or I think
you're going to be compromised but it's
not usable anyway so we have not had
that opportunity before so I will go
ahead and say thank you to Andy for
providing a mechanical sample not sure
this is what they had in mind but we
don't get to do this normally because it
is a destructive form of disassembly
okay so we got the thing off and this is
where I'm not 100% positive what the
solution is to bond the chopper part of
the vapor chamber to the base plate so
feel free to post what you think that
might be below my initial thought was a
really strong thermal adhesive but the
fact that it can't be really removed it
felt a bit sticky but it can't be
removed and it stripped the metal where
they were contacted and pulled apart
tells me it's it's maybe a more
permanent solution like I don't know a
welder solder or something but not sure
let us know what you think there's a bit
of you can see like some oxidation or
corrosion on either side of it but that
shouldn't really matter the reason you
would bond them together that strongly
though is for thermal transfer
efficiency because the base plate is
responsible solely for syncing
from the vm components but also the
memory which are all in this area and so
that allows the vapor chamber to
effectively sink both the GPU and the
memory heat which does mean that the GPU
is sharing its cooling solution so
that's not not ever the greatest but
it's often better than the alternative
which is overheating your memory so
that's why they do that what do you
think is the best solution to cut
through the vapor chamber safely and
open it up
okay so we took a couple approaches to
try and drill this out to demonstrate
what we know is in there but it's not we
can't really get the perfect
demonstration so if we haven't already
we'll drop in the clip or do it again of
cooler masters factory whenever there
and China assembling sort of the inside
part but vapor chamber that's what it
looks like there is an air gap in there
hence the name vapor chamber but in this
one we ran so we first tried an angle
grinder and the the problem here is we
think that the metal may have been like
folding back over itself or we were
filling in or Reed resealing via heat
the small opening that we were hoping to
get with the cross-section and then when
we what I ended up doing was taking just
a metal drill bit to punch a small hole
and then I took this one oh there's no
battery in here but then I took this one
which is a stepped bit and that is what
we used for our previous coolermaster
q500 i'll video where we fixed it if you
can call it that
so this you just kind of can keep
drilling deeper to widen the hole and we
could go a little more better needs to
charge but yeah you can see a little bit
unfortunate it's not the demonstration
we were hope it's not as spectacular as
we were hoping but internally there's a
small gap in there where you can see
where the actual part of the vapor
chamber is where the the couple drops of
liquid would be so anyway that's your
pseudo cross-section it is very thick
copper though but let's move on from the
cooler and look at the PCB yes
all of these are thirties so I'll send
that information and some photos of the
board of the well I'll probably wait
till you take the take apart the retail
sample and send that we'll do it along
with this one and he can look at the PCB
quality for us for our channel so we'll
have a separate video on the PCB
analysis but 31 70s for the vrm this one
is a
seven plus one phase and then the other
the 5,700 Excel should be a six plus one
I think but I haven't taken that apart
yet so this one uses Samsung GTR six
we've got a three five two one seven I
our controller up here big blank space
on the PCB where the fan is and then the
rest of this like I said I'll send the
builds right and we'll figure out if
there any other differences with this
and the retail sample and if they are
they'll end up in this video but I'm
thinking they're probably not any other
than what we already saw definitely got
some of it to go away I don't know if
you can see it but it is less flat here
very more flat here and this one feel
that you can feel a difference okay so
that will wrap this one we drilled some
holes in the vapor chamber you can kind
of see the actual vapor chamber part so
that's cool like I said not as
spectacular as we hoped but we do have
footage from those factories to help
visualize it you can't sort of see it
though think if I took like a really
skinny file and got in there then it
would work speaking of things falling
off the shelf behind me also a lot of
people commenting about how these look
dented we fixed that on this part
couldn't fix this part of the dent but
they just thought I'd try and smash out
the dent and it worked for part of the
card so that's gonna be it the PCB
analysis will have up by builds I'd
separate Lee and the die itself is not
exciting and he doesn't print their
taxes on the dies so that's nothing
really to see there other than the die
and we already have die sizes online I I
guess I'll know this one was assembled
in Taiwan which is not too common but
board partners are starting to move any
faction there because the tariffs so and
these a bit ahead there but that'll be
it for this one check back you
the review should already be live at
this point so go watch the review if you
haven't you can go to store documents
nexus dotnet to pick up a toolkit like
the one I was using today with all the
different screwdrivers you'll need for
this card and lots of other ones and
