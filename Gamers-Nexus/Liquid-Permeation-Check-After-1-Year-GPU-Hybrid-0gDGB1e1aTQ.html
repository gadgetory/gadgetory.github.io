our Titan X Maxwell card which is
labeled as nine ATI but it's not why it
kind of stopped working so this is a
card we've used in our render machine
since one of our updates last year we
turn it into a hybrid it's done pretty
well but recently the machine was
heating up the card to a point of like
90 degrees Celsius when it was barely
doing any work so clearly something's
very wrong
and the card wasn't performing well we
were having actually laggy input and
window movement on the monitor that this
card was powering specifically so I had
to be taken out and replaced and we're
just gonna try and diagnose it here I
don't know if I'm gonna find an answer
but the plan has taken apart look at
some of the power components and then I
don't think I would to see anything
there so what we're probably gonna do is
empty the liquid cooler and see if it
still has liquid in it or if it's fully
permeated before that this video is
brought to you by thermal grizzly makers
of the conductor hot liquid metal that
we recently use to drop 20 degrees off
of our temperatures thermal grizzly also
makes traditional thermal compounds we
use on top of the IHS like cryo not and
hydro not pastes learn more at the link
below so this card was in the render
machine it's been through a lot it's got
a liquid cooler on it obviously and the
radiator for the CPU is positioned above
this liquid cooler but it was still
operating reasonably cool and we have
three front fans in the case so it
should be getting enough air back to the
GPU so really it should have been okay
thermally from our end it's possible
that the liquid is reaching 60 degrees
or higher but that's pretty unlikely and
very uncommon especially when it's in a
case that's as well ventilated as our
PMO one is so we'll see it might not
even be the liquid cooler that's the
problem it might just be something else
went wrong there could be poor contact
maybe which we'll see by looking at the
thermal compound spread maybe that's
gotten
contaminated or super dry you can see on
this card too
this is when they put the memory on the
back of the card so I think this where
was this car this card was positioned in
which slot it might have been the bottom
slot I think yes I'm pretty sure this
wasn't about in the lower slot and
there's a 1080i above it so it's
possible the memory was overheating or
getting hot anyway but without a thermal
probe on there it's hard to really say
if that was the problem but we could add
a backplate to it to try and help that
yeah that's really not that bad so dust
here but nothing that kills performance
this was clearly installed cleaned from
the silkscreen you can still see it at
the borders it's pretty dry but that
wouldn't cause it to go to 90 ya SK
Hynix that's memory there's memory on
the front too I guess these were half
gigabit modules or something I don't
remember how much this card has so no
capacitors that are exploding is that
liquid right there or what is that that
looks like liquid it might just be
grease from the thermal pads although
actually you're gonna see a droplet of
it on this pad but I took this out a
long time ago so like
you see that so there's some clearly
some liquid here I can't tell if it's
glycol or not doesn't smell like it
that's actually maybe it sounds I can't
tell I think what we need to do is
remove the cooler from here and see if
it has any liquid left in it so if
anything's spilled in here you can't
really see it at this point but I took
it out a while ago so it should be dry
by now I guess some of whatever is on
the thermal pad whether that's just
grease from heat or actual liquid
remains to be seen what that is but I
guess we can probably open this up see
if the problem has something to do with
the pump or not or though look cool and
permeating the tubes that's right these
stripped themselves really easily
I can smell propylene glycol now the
fact that you even had any of it could
come out yeah that's that help seal it
typically you got a little bit of
leakage when you reason when you remove
that plate so
so there's the st. the thing a Sutekh
goes crazy with making sure their plates
are secured to the point where it's
really easy to strip these if you don't
apply a lot of force because they're so
tight and that prevents any leaks from
the coke plate area so a leak really
shouldn't be a problem
there's no way liquid got out of this
part if any got out at all what's more
likely is that there is permeation if
the pump is even the problem and it
might not be or that the pump itself
just died which is also very rare
because pumps tend to only die if
they're not getting enough liquid or
they're not cooling off which is because
they're not getting enough liquid
see this one we've ever take my screws
out there's coolant in there but it
didn't come spilling out so let's see
how much we get out of here really - no
it was a permeation problem I'd have to
open another one of these that's brand
new which I I do have them technically
and then measure them against each other
so it's pretty empty so so far that has
not told us anything
there was coolant in there it doesn't
look like a lot hundred litres that
might be and for one of these first we
might as well see if the the pump
actually works on this just do that
enough to get all the liquid out I know
it sounds like it's spinning
yeah
pump spinning for sure as possible this
isn't even the problem but now out of
curiosity and science we're gonna open
another one and just see if it's the
same amount of coolant or not so our
starting point is exactly 100
milliliters which is awfully round of a
number leads me to believe that we don't
really have any permeation but let's
find out for sure actually we can look
at the micro fins too and see if there's
any gunk in them there in a bit there's
definitely a bit in there but it's not
that bad there's some debris down in the
middle okay next one
they're both like 100 milliliters so we
didn't have permeation much like yes it
sucks to open one when we didn't need to
but also looking at it from my
perspective I don't want to suggest that
there was permeation and then locate
their product without checking it
because a lot of people watch the videos
so we don't want thousands of people
you're going off of a baseless
assumption is not fully baseless but it
without being proven you know I can't
really say anything so that's like one
completely unusual not completely a
pretty unused unit and one heavily used
unit and they both come out through 100
milliliters like exactly almost so I
would say that's not the problem
permeation that is let's see if this one
has this same amount of debris in it
this does look a bit cleaner but that I
don't think that accounts for 90 degrees
operating temperature don't think it's
the liquid cooler say my two liquid the
pump works on the old one hopefully it's
a little dirty but it's okay probably
unless it's like super jammed up no
that's fine so that leads me to guess
maybe my guess is overheating memory
well no because I said the GPU core was
overheating I don't know it could be
thrown paste drying up it could be loose
contact between the plate and the card
capacitors look fine
and logic would tell me overheating
memory on the backside given the
circumstances but again the core wasn't
overheating so the fan spun up when we
turned that on to the fans fine the pump
spins there is liquid in it so what does
that leave
I gotta go with poor contact if it
loosened a little bit you know if it was
if it if it were just a little bit too
loose and we were microns off that would
be enough to cause the problem so what I
think I'm gonna do is it's probably put
the reference cooler back on or an
Arctic cooling aftermarket cooler oh
that's a cool ship I actually never
noticed that before
total sidetrack just kind of cool how
it's raised up like that I think we're
gonna put a different cooler on here
just just to be sure
see how it does with air and if it does
well then I might put it back under
liquid if it doesn't there's clearly
something very wrong with its ability to
regulate the temperature basically but
it doesn't seem like the cooler was at
fault and that was the point of opening
two of them to make sure if I blamed the
cooler we were sure about it
vrm should be fine because it wasn't the
vrm that was overheating so yeah you got
to go with loose contact or something
like that so I will I'm not sure what
I'm gonna do this maybe we'll end up
doing it on a live stream instead but
I'm going to put a different cooler on
here and test it and see if the
temperature comes down if it does then
my assumption is poor contact but just
thought we'd do some Diagnostics I had
to do it anyway might as well film it
and in the very least you get to see how
much liquid exactly is in these coolers
if you were to empty your own you could
check against ours and see if there is
permeation
if it's the coolers fault it's about 100
milliliters basically and as long as the
pump spins then it seems like another
problem as far as the cable I used these
are pretty useful too so maybe you can
use this if nothing else in this video
these cables I think I bought from China
they're for pin for pin pwm to a 4 pin
like a GPU fan cable basically so that's
that connects with your pump and video
card fans and then you're able to
connect that end into the motherboard if
you wanted to slow down the pump speed
and make it quieter but we use that test
the pump works and it dies so yeah
basically not sure why it's having
issues it's not like it failed the card
still boots and everything is just
having problems with temperature so I'll
look into it more and maybe we'll do
another video publishing if we're able
to fix the problem but for now it's it's
haunted with some kind of thermal ghost
so we'll leave it there thank you for
