donna and we are here at PAX Prime 2015
this is the first day of the show and
we're currently at the intel booth where
a number of system integrators or sis
are present including maingear who have
built this system we could not find a
manga rep to talk to but I think I
figured out the specs here so pretty
straightforward and we just want to show
it off because it's a it's a really nice
looking system and it has insane cable
management so what we've got here from
what I've looked at is it looks like a
480 millimeter radiator a 4 20
millimeter radiator in the top so pretty
massive radiators and this is all an
open loop cooling solution using the
pretty sweet green fluid and that runs
through the two GPUs there to an sli I
am not sure which GPUs those are and it
goes to the CPU which is an i7 6700 k on
the Z 170 chipset using an asus
motherboard I believe it's the Z 170
deluxe a motherboard based on the
aesthetic so that's what we've got in
terms of the chorus pecs and then for
ram it looks like 64 gigabytes of ddr4
kingston's memory it is the predator
memory which is their premiere and I
believe debut ddr4 line for consumer so
that covers the memory there's a PCIe
SSD that has one point two terabytes of
storage it is the Intel 750 SSD so
that's really we just want to show off
the machine but mostly it's got some
pretty impressive cable management so if
you look closely at the b-roll footage
you'll see that it is individually
sleeved cables and they're all mounted
using some some basically advanced twist
ties and zip ties and things like that
so that's the first video for the intel
booth check the channel for other PAX
Prime 2015 videos we've got Sword Coast
legends going up battle born and some
other games assassins creed so that's
all for this time I'll see you all next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
