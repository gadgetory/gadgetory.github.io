we've worked on in years
normally when games are somehow unstable
it's at least predictable or consistent
in the behavior of that instability with
no man's sky we're seeing frame drops
that are spurious and unpredictable a
fact that results in such severe
stuttering that by extension the game is
not only unplayable but also impossible
to accurately benchmark and we've
generated a few sets of benchmark data
on the Titan XP the Pascal card thank
you to Sam one of our viewers for that
and also tested out a 980ti just to make
sure it wasn't an architectural thing or
a driver thing with the XP and then we
tested again on an RX 480 to give a more
mainstream and also a look at AMD
performance so these three cards give us
a pretty wide berth of coverage with no
man's sky in terms of performance driver
sets architectures three different
architectures three different driver
sets and we still had instability across
the board this isn't an instance where
we can just test anyway and produce the
charts and see what it looks like
because the framerate is so varied that
you would actually end up with cards
that really make no sense hierarchically
it's definitely within reason that a
Titan X Pascal could be outpaced by
something like a nine eighty or ninety
eighty Ti or whatever or that on our X
480 could be outpaced by an Rx four
seven yeah why would that happen the
reason is because of the way the frame
drops work and you can watch our what is
a 1% low video for that but because the
way frame drops work they drag down the
average so hard and they're
unpredictable so it's not like this
happens necessarily every single test
run that the result is cards even
between average two test passes will
just really almost randomly and
chaotically fall on the chart so there's
no there's no valid reason the benchmark
cards against one another if they're not
actually going to be representative of
performance and any measurable and
repeatable fashion so before getting two
examples of why this game is not
reliable to test here's a quick note it
looks like Hello Games just released an
experimental branch of no man's sky
that's supposed to resolve a few issues
shader caching will
with the game's intro at least I'm not
sure if that will help with the gameplay
itself but certainly the intro and among
the stuttering issues we also had some
issues launching the game on different
hardware configurations tested on three
different machines just to make sure and
saw a varied behavior across the board
all windows 10 by the way we've seen
spurious mouse movements the FPS cap
doesn't work and generally imposes a cap
that is not equal to the game settings
so 30fps doesn't equal 30 FPS in the
game and you can't play the game with
the monitor configured to a non-native
resolution I know this is a really rare
use case but that's a result of the
render setting with rendering words
within the engine so a lot of small
issues and some pretty large issues here
a few of these will be resolved by that
experimental branch put out by hello
games but we're not testing that yet
because it doesn't fix the core issue
which is severe stuttering in actual
gameplay we'll wait for the that patch
to be ratified until we test for that so
that's the basics the first chart shows
the Titan XP running one test execution
and that's what the game configured to
its lowest settings that's what you're
looking at now here's a chart for the
first test pass we did multiple this one
is at 1080p it measured over a 30 second
period and let's just stress that for a
moment this was only 30 seconds of play
and that's what is normally acceptable
for testing but if you look at multiple
passes these spikes are seen in almost
all of them which means that you should
expect to encounter one of these game
interrupting stutters at least once
every 30 seconds if not more in this
instance we've actually got the Titan XP
stalling for a full 100 milliseconds
before the next frame is output and it
gets worse from here by the way if you
hang on a minute
when we discussed frame times we
normally talk about deviation from the
mean latency as being the most jarring
ie if you move 16 milliseconds from one
latency to the next then that could be
pretty noticeable in gameplay and
produce a terror but in this instance
it's blowing out the graphs limitations
so to speak the result is an output of
138 FPS but 836 fps 0.1% low and a
minimum effectively of zero for that 100
millisecond period which really is a
pretty long amount of time and
this next one shows the second test pass
where we go from an average of six-month
second frame time to 20 in the worst
case scenario and that's certainly
observable but not nearly as bad as the
last time so a deviation is still
exceeding that 8 to 16 millisecond range
at times and that's where you will see
some noticeable swings and performance
our numbers are at least somewhat more
consistent here though let's look at
what happens if we configure the
settings to what actually makes sense
for a tighten XP just a reminder those
were low settings here's a ultra with
1080p first we'll look at the rest later
notice again that we've got a 100
millisecond spike drag in our 0.1% lows
down to an impressively atrocious 31 fps
at 4k we're looking at an output that
spikes to 1,000 milliseconds that's one
full second and that means that during
gameplay while walking our fixed and
looping and repeated benchmark course we
had a stall where the game effectively
froze for a fall second this dragged our
0.1% lows down to 18 fps though the
minimum value was again 0 FPS for that
one second period out of the full 30
second benchmark let's look at the 980ti
a now before moving to the arts 480 just
to make sure this isn't a driver or
architecture-specific
issue we tested the 980 I reference card
with low and ultra settings looking at
low settings we're seeing spikes hit 40
milliseconds at times in the 30 second
test period resulting in a 2x deviation
between the 0.1% lows and the average
the second set of data perfectly
illustrates why we've decided against
benchmarking this game right now showing
a dip in frame performance from the
previous 122 fps down to 93 fps and
that's in the second test pass of the
same settings same graphics
configuration and same part of our test
course that's a huge swing 30 fps and
these two test passes were conducted
within one minute of each other in the
same area we see 93 FPS average and 3
FPS 0.1% lows are produced by the
outburst of a 4200 millisecond frame
latency and again that's exactly why we
use those little metrics though here
they're really you need something worse
than that you need actually a minimum
for once because it's not
an outlier and that's because a 93 FPS
average looks pretty damn good aside
from the fact that the game was
unplayable from four seconds out of 30
so you four seconds out of the thirty
second pass
you can't move that's just it's
effectively lag or stutter or I think
some some people call it hitching
whatever you want to call it it's not
playable to further diversify
architectures we looked at an msi our X
480 gaming X which is an Adam board
Partner card and that's in addition to
the two reference and video cards with
low settings low at 1080p we hit one
snag of 1500 milliseconds or 1.5 seconds
and another of 1,100 milliseconds 1.1
second that was in the same test pass by
the way with also a 380 millisecond snag
and that's nearly three seconds of
frozen game time in a 30 second period
dispersed across about a 15-second range
of testing so within 15 seconds
you freeze three times for periods that
are longer than in some cases one full
second so that's about 10% of the entire
30-second test pass that you can't
actually move in the next pass we saw
better performance but not much snags
we're at 120 milliseconds at least
wasn't a thousand and several were
clustered at 60 milliseconds resulting
in a 0.1% low of 19 FPS things weren't
much better at Ultra either with a 3 FPS
0.1% low in this test pass resultant of
an 1,100 millisecond frame time followed
in sequence by a 500 millisecond frame
time then a 300 milliseconds frame time
or latency between frames so this game
even if you're able to sort of play it
just by fighting your way through these
things drop the settings enough that
you're only experienced only only
experiencing his 1 second hands every
minute or so and I know some folks have
reported they can play the game
obviously this is hugely dependent on
hardware things like that but we did
validate on three systems 2 X 99
identical 100% identical platforms
except for RAM RAM is different and that
one z97 platform with a 4790k so we've
got 250 930 K is a 4790k
all three of those platforms validated
the same performance more or less and we
have three different video card
architectures with the Titan X Pascal
certainly at the very top end even that
thing is having trouble with this a
980ti for a last gen architecture look
just in case maybe driver maturity maybe
the game developers built on last gen
architecture certainly within reason and
of course the polaris card rx 480 which
was an admin board partner card so we
really did given how much of a mess this
game is right now we really did cover
all the bases just to kind of make sure
ok is this thin something we can
benchmark properly and the answer was no
just looking at those 3 cards with the
three systems 9 total configurations we
kind of backed away from it decided okay
let's just let's see if they actually
fix this thing first because right now
as you saw in one of those test passes
we had a Swain an average of something
like 30 or 40 fps and sometimes it
freezes that 0 fps so that's not really
the here's the here's the thinking okay
so because of those swings yes we could
benchmark the game we could still
perform maybe 5 passes even and average
the numbers and all of that and say look
it's really not performing that well
right now but the problem is because the
purpose of a GPU benchmark is to compare
one video card to the next for its
performance against a competitor or
whatever an Adam board alternative
because that is the purpose it doesn't
make sense to do a benchmark right now
no man's sky because it's really at that
point not looking at video card
performance looking at the games
performance which is dismal and so to
plant cards on a chart I pick them
against one another and declare victors
at different settings and resolutions
and what-have-you is really unfair to
the vendors GPUs all that because we're
not even looking at isolated GPU
performance anymore
looking at totally random spurious FPS
output again with fluctuations from 6
milliseconds to 4200 and frame latency
the deviation is just it's not even
enough it's not an outlier
no it's not an outlier because it's
happening every single test pass and
sure sometimes it's a hundred
milliseconds but at least four of these
examples I gave you just now we're over
a thousand so the short of it we are not
benchmarking no man's sky today I really
wanted to it's not gonna happen because
it's not fair to the GPUs and it makes
no sense to do so and we just be making
stuff up at that point because you're
looking at frame rates that don't make
sense
so hopefully they fix this there is a
patch forthcoming the experimental
update that's out there right now you
can grab on Steam if you own the game
does resolve a few issues like the
shader caching things like that it does
does lessen the workload in areas where
the workload does not belong but it
doesn't fix everything and it's
experimental
so I'm not showing the results today
we'll look at it once the patch is sort
of matured and been ratified into the
game code officially and see if things
have improved but for now on our
hardware we tested it's not playable I
would not recommend playing it I know
some folks certainly many of you I'm
sure have the game operational to some
level I know I've seen reports of people
saying you have to play it for an hour
per session and then it will stabilize
that's really not it's not acceptable to
me but I'm not telling you don't buy the
game but if you haven't bought it yet
maybe consider waiting of it so that's
all for this video as always pay
challeng to post your video tell us how
to directly subscribe we have some
pretty big stuff coming up this week
actually a lot of it and you don't want
to miss that thanks for watching I'll
see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
