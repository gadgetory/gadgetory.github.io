view and while it is not the perfect
case no case really is it's pretty
interesting fan tax does a lot of
different things with this one they have
for example a top mounted ITX bracket
they can buy separately that is then
powered in a split system set up with a
single power supply so fan tax gets
credit for doing something different and
unique fan tanks also does some things
that we've seen in the past and didn't
necessarily like and we'll walk through
all that through this system as well
some examples are shown here to be
discussed momentarily the case is about
$200 stand alone it's about four hundred
sixty-five if you buy with the power
supply and with the sheet of metal that
adapts the mini ITX system to the top of
the case before that this video is
brought to you by the be quiet dark rock
4 and dark rock pro 4 CPU coolers these
high-end coolers to focus on a smarter
approach to air cooling by adding a mini
fin stack on top of the direct contact
cold plate adding small bumps to the
fins for increased surface area and by
using silent wanes 135 millimeter fans
custom-built for high performance
cooling without too much noise the pro
is a dual Tower cooler rated for 250
watt TDP while the dark rock 4 is built
for 200 watt CDP's learn more at the
link of the description below so this is
on loan from Chris one of our viewers
and thank you Chris - for sending this
we really appreciate it because we
didn't get one and they're kind of hard
to get it's a really popular case
apparently or the quantities low or a
bit of both
so fan tax absolutely has driven
interest with this case and there's not
a ton of availability out there - just
to just pick one up this one was a combo
unit so this was four hundred and
sixty-five dollars for the case and the
combo 80 + platinum power supply it's a
sea Sonic foundation power supply that
splits so you can power a bottom system
a top system they just have a power
button for both and if you wanted a
streaming system built inside of the
case with a main system for gaming and
then one captures the other you can do
that it's a bit convoluted we talked
about that through Patrick's build notes
later but it's absolutely doable and
that's pretty interesting so we tested
that thermally as well because it is a
very unique use case and when she
deserves notice the overall build
quality the layout the design of
case it will leave a lot of the
aesthetics to your own personal take but
from a design standpoint thermals are
actually not that bad
despite the front panel looking like
they're pretty bad there's enough of a
gap here and the bottlenecks are
actually elsewhere not the front panel
the bottleneck is primarily in the dust
filter or the fans depend on how you
look at it either you look at it as the
dust filter is too restrictive and
impeding intake or the fans don't have
enough static pressure to pull through
the filter rather than maybe push for
example through a filter and so that's a
potential design challenge as well that
pantech spaces but we'll talk about the
thermals momentarily their overall far
better than we expected which is saying
a lot
honestly the evolve X looking at it we
thought it would be very bad thermally
but it did okay and we'll talk about
that later even for the mini ITX dual
system thermals it was not too bad for
design elements we don't like talked
about some we do like let's talk about
so we don't like fantex is still going
with the weird halo 1 plasma gun
plasticky design they have where it's
trying to look futuristic in ways that
it really doesn't look futuristic and
they've done this before for example
this sliding plate on top of the power
splash shroud it's why it doesn't look
good it's like it's one of the only
things that's plastic and it has no real
functional purpose they're more sliding
plates in here and the drive cages the
case doesn't include two and a half inch
drive sleds where it really should even
though they support them you have to buy
them separately and this is something
that fantex likes to do where they saw
stuff that we think are basically
necessities as separate items and you
can't say that it's saving you money by
not including it because it's $200 or
465 with the combo for the Paris play so
anyway this should be included two sleds
here but they're not included
instead you work with these panels and
these are interesting well give them
credit for this interesting kill
management design it's very easy to work
with easy to work with then some of
cooler masters but when you mount the
SSDs in this drive area it's very easy
to pinch the SSD connectors
something that we've seen in other cases
before and one which is potentially bad
for your SST if it rips the connector
out we actually had that happen on an
old Rosewell case that had a similar
design approach so interesting door but
not well executed really and and that's
kind of problematic for that specific
use case of having I don't know a drive
in your system so we really do think it
should include some here and not be a
another DLC approach but the case does
do a lot of very interesting things as
well as discussed and one of them is
apparently being kind of difficult to
reclose that door there we go
another quick interesting thing what
we'll talk about and Paget's build notes
is the three slot vertical GPU mount so
it allows you to space the video card a
bit further away from the panel then
typically and that is something that
should be good as you'll see in the
thermal section you have a two and a
half for a 2.75 slot card probably still
don't use it though and then also the if
you wanted to have a top system with a
riser you can route it to this slot and
run your video out there or a capture
card there unfortunately at $465 they're
not including the riser cable you have
to buy that separately as well so it
might be easier to just use an IEP
system of the top which is what we did
for our testing but let's go through
Paget's notes and then the thermal
testing data getting into the case is
easy enough the side panels hinge
outwards from the front but they clip
shut behind the front panel for thamma
screws can be put through the panels to
hold them more securely but we'd
recommend leaving them out unless the
system is being moved otherwise the
front panel must be first removed in
order to take the screws out the hinges
work well the doors swing a full 180
degrees and lifting the doors off of
their pins is easy we would like to see
more hinges like the view 71 s where the
pins are of unequal height so that they
can be lined up and inserted one at a
time like the C 700 M the Evolve X has a
very easily removable front panel where
the spring-loaded pins connecting the
built-in LED strips so this is a good
move for cable management the default
LED patterns are smooth and unab noxious
is enough to be usable but they also
accept a D RGB control or three pin five
volt the cables are tucked away and
clutter isn't too bad
in fact the factory kale management was
a little overzealous as the power button
cable had been stretched too tight and
unplugs when we received the case kale
management in general is good thanks to
the built-in velcro straps and hinged
metal cable covers there are also
sliding plastic shields that can cover
unoccupied cable cutouts but these
aren't especially useful and are more
just kind of extra plastic that sounds
nice and marketing doesn't really do a
whole lot fantex is big on extras and
features some more useful than others
one pleasant surprise was the plastic
box with various screws already sorted
out in it there's also an airflow cover
quote-unquote anyway that we didn't get
a chance to test but which is designed
to block air from recirculating through
unoccupied fan mounts something we
experimented with in the BitFenix enzo
there's actually definitely validity to
this idea and so it might be worth using
if you do end up with a sort of circular
air path the vertical GPU mount isn't
anything new here but it's three slots
wide on the Evolve X rather than the
usual two that means either GPUs that
take up more than two slots can be
mounted vertically bad idea or GPUs that
take up two or fewer slots can be
mounted vertically with actually decent
clearance from the side panel pretty
good idea so this is something that you
should be using if you want to go
vertical GPU I'll show you why in the
thermal section the top radiator and fan
mount is removable which is always a
nice and good feature but we'd like to
see a similar removable mount in the
front of the case as well there is only
one major fit and finished problem the
case fans have a raised rim at the end
of each blade and one was wedged tightly
into the front fan mount when it first
arrived fixing it required slightly
loosening the fan screws or else it was
impossible for the fans rotate part of
the problem is that the front fan mount
is made of thin flexible pieces of metal
that can buckle inwards towards the fans
the fans are plugged into a hub by
default the hub can either run the fans
at full speed or accept PWM control but
there are no other buttons or sliders to
control speed eight a report at the top
fan speed has roughly 1,200 rpm
regardless of whether they were attached
to the hub or directly to the
motherboard the ITX bracket was easier
to work with than most
the small form-factor cases we've
reviewed it's just a metal frame with a
power button that screws into the
motherboard this in turn can be inserted
into the upper rear of the main case and
attached to the top fan or radiator
mount unfortunately the mini ITX frame
clamps the radiator mount to the chassis
it'd be more convenient if it were
possible to just screw the ITX system on
like a radiator and then pop it in or
out of the case so this is overall an OK
implementation but one which definitely
has avenues for improvement it's not bad
it's just it could be more convenient
and it wouldn't be that difficult to
make it more convenient
moving on to thermals and noise and as
always check the link in the description
below for the article on this with more
information on how we tested we did to
torture passes rather than the normal
one just to verify our baseline results
because this is a more complicated case
than normally for simplicity's sake
we're listing the first run they were
within margin of area of each other and
validated we also tested with a vertical
GPU and the two slots closest to the
motherboard we did another test without
the front panel we did one without the
front panel or the filter and we also
did some dual system testing by running
fire strike on the main system and
streaming it with the secondary one it
isn't directly comparable to other cases
but it is comparable to the regular fire
strike results for this case we'll talk
about the dual system thermals towards
the end as usual we're starting with a
CPU torture testing we'll start with
just the fan text results and then move
on to comparative data CPU temperature
average 51.2 degrees celsius delta t /
ambiens and torture testing for baseline
taking the front panel off had no
significant impact on the delta and
landed us at 50 1.9 degrees over ambient
that's within margin of error of the
baseline and so is functionally the same
for its relatively low pressure fans
fantex is getting sufficient air flow
around the front panel this would likely
become more of an issue with higher
pressure fans and as you'll see in a
second the filter can help validate some
of this despite appearances of a choked
front fan Tex has done a good job of
space in the front panel away from the
intake fans enough and leaving wide gaps
for airflow removing the filter as well
as the front panel did lower CPU
temperature down to 45 point three
degrees though revealing the real
bottleneck the dust filter heavily
impedes air flow which is a mixture of
stock fans with
low static pressure performance and the
filter itself mounting the GPU
vertically raised the CPU temperature
slightly up to fifty two point seven
degrees thousand T over ambient but that
could be a good sign since we sometimes
see CPU temperatures drop when the GPU
is being suffocated in a vertical mount
we'll show the other half of this result
in a moment
comparatively fifty one point two
degrees over ambient puts the Evolve X
and the CPU temperature range of the
stock 1/2 X or the C 700 mm with its
front cover removed that's respectable
company to be in and is a bit better
than the center of the pack the straight
front to back airflow pattern between
the upper intake fan and the rear
exhaust fan provides benefits for our
CPU cooler which sits exactly between
them other nearby cases that did well
include the H 500 non-p mesh case at
$100 operating at forty nine point nine
degrees we previously praised this one
as a good mix of value and performance
for clarity that's the H 500 space mesh
not the H 500 P mesh nor the H 500 M and
definitely not the NZXT age 500
hopefully the editors figure out which
one we're talking about eight 700 is
similarly priced or cheaper if you go
for the H 709 I and ends up a couple
degrees warmer than the Evolve X age 500
P mesh get that right the aged 500 P
space mesh operates at an advantage 48
degrees over ambient and is also
similarly priced GPO Torture
temperatures are next for the evolve X
stock GPO temperature is 53 degrees
Celsius Delta Z over ambient on average
it was more responsive than the CPU
through moving the front panel and
dropped down to 49 point eight degrees
over ambient and drops further with the
filter removed down to 48 point four
degrees delta T over ambient the
vertical GPU test was also a bit cooler
than the baseline test which is truly
impressive given how many times we've
seen GPUs break 60 degrees Celsius DT
when mounted vertically often entering
throttle territory pretty hard fan tax
has provided enough clearance with the
side panel and the CB cooler that for
once it may not be a terrible idea to
use vertical mounting with an air-cooled
card as long as it's in the slots
closest to the motherboard if you were
to mount this in the slots closer to the
panel or to use a 2.7 slot r-tx
it would definitely be a problem just
like normally so be careful with that
DP tortured temperatures for the Evolve
x comparatively are up next the corsair
270 r and thermaltake corp III are
comparable in terms of GPU cooling the
p3 is open but has no fans and the 270
are only comes with two 120 millimeter
fans but they're both average performers
as for cases priced similarly to the non
combo evolve X about 200 bucks the H 500
P mesh operates a GPU temperature of
fifty two point two degrees over ambient
and the H 700 I ends up at around fifty
two point five degrees these are similar
in performance to the evolve axes 53°
stock temperature results there's a
steady supply of air along the bottom of
the case from the lower intake but it's
not quite as direct as with the CPU
3dmark GPU temperature is fifty five
point six degrees Celsius over ambient
on average within a company in CPU DT of
twenty five point seven degrees Celsius
that's the same as the silverstone pmo
to an average to below average case that
suffers heavily in comparison to the PM
oh one the Evolve x ends up around where
the h 500m performs with the glass
installed and that's a similarly priced
case or around the C seven hundred P
also sort of similarly priced age five
hundred mesh runs at fifty one point
five degrees and is toward the top end
of the charge for something expensive
that is also cooler both the CPU and GPU
salts are important to note this time
since they're the baseline temperatures
for our dual system test coming up
here's the test everyone's been waiting
for a dual system build in the same box
testing thermals in a real-world use
case this isn't just a torture test we
actually used it like we think you
probably would as a reminder we used an
i-5 8400 as a stream capture CPU with
OBS set to 12 megabits per second and
faster
realistically we'd recommend an r5 1600
or 2600 for most builds kind of like
this but that requires some sort of
display out as well which is both more
complicated and increases the thermal
potential issues the i-5 8400 is still
perfectly capable for an encoding system
for a live stream and also has an eye GP
so you don't need an addition
video card in there to handle the video
out or other simple tasks that really
don't deserve an a whole component
taking up more space in the bottom of
the case anyway this isn't a build guide
it's just a CPU to generate some heat
for our lower system we used a fire
strike extreme on loop and then captured
its output with the top system the
stream test with two systems installed
resulted in a lower GP temperature than
the ATX only test the new results is
fifty two point six degrees over ambient
for the system running fire strike with
capture actually slightly lower than the
stock fifty five point six degree fire
strike test originally there's a good
reason for this with a new gap in the
rear of the case and an additional CPU
cooler exhausting some air out of it
more GPU exhaust with drawn upwards this
helps reduce radiative heat traffic near
the backside of the GPU which causes our
two degrees Delta this is reflected in
the thirty-three point three degrees CPU
temperature of the fire strike system
which is much higher than the original
CPU temperature of twenty-five point
seven degrees so this is strictly an
airflow path and pressure system that's
changing the results you're seeing here
all that extra heat from the top CPU has
to go somewhere it's not going to be
just cooler everywhere and the extra
heat in this instance is getting pulled
through the primary CPU socket area the
mini ITX system was responsible only for
streaming the output from the ATX system
using an external capture card an
internal capture card or secondary GPU
for video out would increase temperature
accordingly of course from both using
more space and generating more heat in
terms of watts used within the system
recorded thermal data for both systems
but the hard numbers here are of limited
use without anything to compare them to
the main takeaway is that it's not as
much of a thermal hotbox as we might
have expected which is partly thanks to
modern CPUs drawing lower power like the
i-5 8400 we used a low-profile cooler on
our Mini ITX streaming system because
the CPU cooler of the main system was in
the way and that's likely the approach
most users will take that ended up at
around 53 degrees over a mins which is
definitely getting warm it worked fine
using the smaller system exclusively for
streaming but any additional load or
overclock you know would push the limits
of such a small cooler regardless of how
good or bad the results are it's hard
not to think about how much better the
thermal
would get just by taking the secondary
system out of the case and running it on
the desk beside it but that would
require space to permit this build and
that's a big point here but it would be
probably cheaper almost certainly than
spending four hundred sixty-five dollars
on a case and power supply combo because
you're paying a lot for that ad plus
Platinum power supply rendering on the
CPU brought the Evolve axis CPU
temperature to thirty seven point nine
degrees over ambience between the land
cool one and the 500 D and still almost
exactly in the middle of the chart
rendering on the GPU brought GPU DT to
twenty six point four that's about the
same in terms of chart positioning but
between two all glass cases this time
the view 71 and alpha 554 the standard a
single system test bench for noise
levels we measured the noise level to be
41 point 9 DBA at max fan speed which is
loud relative to the other cases on this
chart although the glass panels have
rubber seals along the edges there's not
much obstructing noise from coming from
the front case fans the case fans don't
need to run it maximum rpm all the time
but keep in mind that they will unless
the fan hub is connected to a
motherboard header and you set a decent
fan profile it doesn't choke the air too
much that's the case that's the fan text
evolve acts it is absolutely not alone
in the $200 price class there are a lot
of $200 cases some of them pretty damn
competitive so just to go through the
list again at 150 to maybe 300 or so
you've got things like the aged 500 Pete
match we received it very positively we
like that one is the follow-up to the
original
H 500 P and did a great job overall at
improving you have the aged 500 M if you
prefer the same design just a bit
fancier it's kind of more direct
competitor to this the be quiet dark
base or dark dark base 900 Pro that's a
DB 900 there dark face Pro 900 whatever
it is it's got three words than a number
that's Thea the next 200 $250 case
that's in the same kind of competition
but it's bigger
so that's consideration as well if you
wanted more large alternatives there's a
view so d1 or view Sonia on RGB editions
about the same price the NZXT H 700 dama
dition or 8 700 eyes about the same
price there's the CMC 700 P there are a
lot of cases at this price point that's
that's kind of the point so you have
plenty of options used
we've reviewed most of them they're in
the charts if you care about thermals
we've talked about build quality if you
care about that none of those
alternatives really do quite what this
does which is the two and one build
option with the integrated power supply
that splits power as opposed to doing
two power supplies what you could do you
could do it in the Leon the O 11 dynamic
which is like a hundred bucks but that's
two power supply so it's a completely
different approach that said it's
probably cheaper to do two power
supplies if we're being honest it's just
it's a different approach to building so
there's nothing wrong with either one
you just didn't really not saving money
by doing this but this isn't about
saving money at nearly five hundred
dollars for the combo version that's I
mean that's that's an Argentine x27 at
that price so if you want it I mean it's
pretty unique the case overall is fine
we do have some some fundamental
problems with some of the design
approach discussed earlier thermals are
actually pretty okay they were
surprisingly decent the fans could use a
static pressure improvement they're weak
in that department but not terrible and
overall it's reasonably competitive and
it does something that most the other
cases that do compete with it don't
which is the two system thing so if you
want that it seems fine so overall this
case is fine the build quality is quite
good in general notwithstanding a few of
the plastic elements but the build
quality is fine the power supply is good
the dual system integration has ways to
improve but it's pretty good overall and
the thermals are far better than we
expected so it's it's really not a bad
case the case has receives probably more
praise than it deserves it's been a bit
overhyped but now that you've seen this
you hopefully know exactly what you're
getting in for we don't have any major
gripes with it there are things that it
does well things that it does kind of
mediocre so yeah plenty of other options
