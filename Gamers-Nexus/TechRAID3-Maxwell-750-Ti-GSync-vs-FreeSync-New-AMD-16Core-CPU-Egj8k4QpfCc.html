nexus net and we are back with our third
episode of tech radar video roundup
series of all the latest hardware news
topics for this episode include Nvidia's
impending maxwell launched a new 16 core
AMD cpu AMD's free sink and Nvidia's
g-sync variable refresh rate
technologies compared and 80 plus
titanium certification let's start
simple with this one this week saw the
approval and implementation of a new ad
plus certification standard level by
ecova 80 plus titanium has been around
since about 2012 dell and delta
electronics work to produce the first
titanium class server power supply so it
was not a consumer unit and we saw
titanium efficiency psus emerged last
year in the consumer market or begin to
emerge they weren't released yet and the
standard only officially got approved a
few days ago the 80-plus titanium
standard has a ninety percent efficiency
at ten percent load which is damn
remarked welfare power supply to achieve
and it boasts a ninety-four percent
efficiency at fifty percent load to give
you an idea that vs 80 plus platinum
ninety two percent efficiency at fifty
percent load so a pretty big jump there
considering we're working with power and
that's not so easy to be efficient with
in power supplies moving out to cpus is
a bit more interesting and these got
some news to share regarding new server
processors the reason i mention it here
is because a lot of server technology
finds its way down the supply chain to
consumers so it could be relevant to the
future of enthusiasts class cpus should
AMD continue making them the new 16-core
steamroller cpu isn't yet branded with
marketing labels so its operating under
the fabulous name of family 15 h model
30h 3fh with multiple cpus in the same
family essentially name 30 h dash for fh
or 20 h or so on so the one we're
looking at is the 30 h dash 3fh model
existing and the opteron server CPUs
claim to offer 16 cores but they do so
by using two CPUs on the same substrate
with the new steamroller chip will see a
single silicon die housing a single CPU
which then houses
eight dual core modules as most AMD CPUs
utilize and that's a total of sixteen
cores for those shaking heads at the
core account keep in mind that server
implementations do tend to actually
utilize all the cores on like games and
especially when taking virtualization
and bleeds into account if you do like
VPS hosting or something like that the
30 H dash 3fh cpu makes moves to
integrate the pcie 3.0 controller on to
the CPU itself which furthers the
movement of motherboard components to
the die as the memory controllers did in
ages past and this action reduces
latency between the CPU and the
controller by shortening the distance of
travel and eliminating other buses so it
makes things a bit more streamlined for
the CPU I could see this potentially
turning into some sort of FX product
down the line if we're lucky it won't be
at least a year and probably two years
before we even see the CPU in the server
market though so don't get your hopes up
it should be based probably on 20
nanometer class architecture because of
this fab delay moving into video
hardware we now turn to news of Nvidia's
maxwell launch as posted by the sweet
clockers website sweet clockers claims
that a source close to video card
manufacturers has informed them of an
impending 750ti GPU running maxwell for
februari 18th i don't have any way to
validate this it seems pretty legit
sweet clockers is generally fairly
trustworthy but I can't validate it
let's suppose it's true for sake of this
content Maxwell is the next step after
Kepler and aims to make great strides in
memory efficiency and it does this by
utilizing the existing CUDA instruction
set which allows programmers to
eliminate explicit copy and export
functions between the GP RM and the
system ram among other things and
maxwell is able to further unify memory
addressing in its architecture so the
significance is greater efficiency and
reduced overhead which is something that
both Andy and NVIDIA have been working
to improve so going forward the cards
will be able to leverage more of their
power for functions that you actually
care about some of the strides have been
taken with AMD technologies like the
mantle API among other things so our
hardware greatly right now it greatly
overpowers most software in terms of the
and so we're in an optimization stage
right now this is part of a normal
healthy cycle for for hardware
development and we are optimizing right
now which hopefully will yield less
overhead and more efficiency the 750 ti
would supersede the existing 650 Ti
boost boost be an important likely
landing it in the 150 to 180 range
depending on memory capacity so finally
we look at new display synchronization
technology we recently interviewed
Nvidia at CES a link below to discuss
how Jesus actually works and the very
same day and they announced it's free
sync technology which of course Nvidia
couldn't comment on at the show but they
release that and it's it's a somewhat
humorous slam against Nvidia's you know
costly geez Inc tech and and so we have
free sync and g-sync right now so let's
discuss the similarities and the
differences between them first of all
both technologies aim to do the same
thing they both want to eliminate
tearing or stuttering which is
introduced by asynchronous frame
delivery between the video card and the
displays refresh rate with a fixed
refresh rate of say 60 Hertz or 120
Hertz on your monitor your display is
expecting a new frame to be prepared for
it by the GPU every 16 milliseconds or 8
milliseconds depending the GPU does the
rendering as we all know it renders the
frame and then send it down the pipeline
to the display and then the display
presents it to the user so the problem
here is that when the GPU misses its
window it's 16 millisecond or 8
millisecond window because of a more
complex scene we either get tearing or
stuttering depending on what vsync is
doing a vsync is enabled or not with
vsync off you're all familiar with vsync
in game settings with vsync off the
display outputs the frame as it is
rendered meaning that we can end up with
tearing so it's actually it's spitting
out the frames as they are drawn there
is no delay and the instance of multiple
frames being rendered on screen
simultaneously is what happens in this
case so you end up with tearing as the
name suggests the objects kind of don't
line up the textures don't line up and
it's something you really you don't
think a whole lot about until you see
until you look for it until you see
smoothness that these new technologies
offer with vsync on we sacrifice tearing
in favor of stuttering that is generally
inadvisable for most gamers that's why
you see vsync always recommended as off
on competitive gaming forums and this is
because we can as gamers mentally
compensate for tearing far better than
we can for a missed frame because I
missed frame is missing data so you
can't compensate for that which does not
exist as far as you're concerned but you
can compensate for tearing because you
kind of you just see where stuff belongs
a stutter occurs when the GPU misses its
render window and so the monitor
displays the previous frame a second
time and that's far more influential and
competitive gaming g-sync and free sync
both make it so that the monitor slaves
to the video card so the display refresh
rate is now variable meaning that the
frequency will update as the video card
dispatches new information this results
in far smoother gameplay and free sync
does it using a V blank underscore V
blank attribute look it up available in
some monitors all all through software
meanwhile g-sync does it with a hardware
accelerated module that lives on the
display thus increasing the cost of the
display marginally so we haven't yet had
an extended hands on with free sync but
that kind of gives you an overview of
the two I wanted to touch on it since
since precinct was just announced and
