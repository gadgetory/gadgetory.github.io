of liquid metal we normally talk about
how liquid metal and d-lighting improved
thermals and overclocking Headroom by
allowing for higher vcore at lower
temperatures but today we're going to
show you how liquid metal allows for a
reduction in noise levels by a perceived
2x while still allowing equivalent
thermals to stock Tim but with higher
clocks overall that'll be our concluding
chart for today
thrash to leave power and thermals for
the Intel i7 8086 k before that this
video is brought to you by NZXT is new h
500 case which we recently found to have
an impressively effective cooling setup
that is entirely negative pressure when
stock the H 500 is the successor of the
S 340 and s 340 lead offering high build
quality that's all steel and glass and
Cale management features that are also a
top class for the $70 compact mid tower
case H 500 is a part of NZXT Zanu H
series lineup which also features
options from mini ITX micro ATX and full
ATX builds learn more at the link of the
description below originally when asked
if for when we would review the 8086 k
we basically said no we're not going to
it's kind of pointless and that still
stands because ultimately it's an i7
8700 K except it's pretty selected so
these are the highest Bening 8700 KS
that's it that's really the whole
difference of the CPU at the 8086 K so
everything else gaming performance all
that stuff stands for the 8700 KS the
same exact processor except for
overclocking results and we decided to
do an overclocking livestream which will
be already done by the time this video
goes up where we basically bend the
processor and see what it can achieve so
we decided might as well do some D
Lydian thermals and noise test and while
we're at it and use this processor as a
vessel to prove an important point that
is overlooked with liquid metal which is
that liquid metal isn't just good at
improving your overclocking Headroom
reducing thermals allowing higher v core
it's also good at just keeping the same
thermals with lower fan speeds you can
do the trade-off and end up with
significantly lower noise levels and
that is kind of an untold side
Madeline something I want to talk about
today so the 8086 case in background
Intel made a limited amount of these
it's not that limited we know how many
it is and it's a lot so not super
limited but they made they basically
pre-selected a bunch of 8700 KS and
that's the 8086 is for a good bit more
money the bigger takeaway again here is
fan speeds for liquid metal we're using
thermal grizzly conductor not as we
normally do and then we're also doing a
really important thing here we're just
scraping off the silicone adhesive in
order to reduce the gap between the die
and the IHS that's where a lot of the
thermal improvement comes from not just
from the liquid metal so pay attention
to that as well
we'll start with power consumption here
go through thermals and then get to our
noise discussion at the end for power
consumption testing as always the
methodology will be detailed in the
article link in the description below
but for the basics we measured power
consumption at the EPS 12-volt cables
going into the motherboard this measures
the cv power consumption and includes
the vrm power consumption as well is
much more isolated than wall meters and
way more accurate than wall meters but
still includes the vrm power consumption
in there additionally our test cases
include Cinebench single and multi
threaded indicated by n t and one t in
the charts times by fire strike physics
fire strike combined as a gaming
benchmarks standard it's the same kind
of workload split between CP and GBS
gaming blender which is av ax prime 95
29.2 which is a VX and we used 8 k in
place FFT is for prime95 29.2 which is
one of the most thermally and power
abusive test you can do so that will
stand as our basically hitting the
thermal limits of the CPU test with
blender being a bit more realistic but
still a B X so prime95 is the most
abusive let's start there for the
thermals and the power tests running 8 k
FFTs in place we started with a complete
auto test including default bios
settings in the Maximus 10 motherboard
and only enabled XMP on our corsair 3200
kit the result was 130 watts of power
consumption at the EPS 12-volt rails
overclocking trivially it's a 5
gigahertz and 1.3 volts which was
sufficient to sustain this clock
resulted in a 194 watt power
at the rails 5.3 gigahertz at one point
four or five volts measured 250 watts
getting awfully high at this point and
starting to require some extra help on
cooling the vrm fortunately the Maximus
board has built up enough vrm that over
temperature is not yet a concern our 5.3
gigahertz and 1.41 volt test did not
pass prime95 8k and neither did the test
the 101 BC LK they both failed this
particular application for blender using
GM's in-house built specially tailored
CPU benchmark we measured 92 watt power
consumption for the auto configuration
this is relatively close to intel's
advertised TDP at 5.0 gigahertz and 1.3
volts we measured just 135 watts a steep
60 watt drop from the prime95 abuse we
saw at the same setting both our AVX
workloads 5.1 gigahertz though at one
point three five volts Dru 149 watts
with 5.3 gigahertz at one point for five
volts pretty high drawing 198 watts for
blender we didn't actually require one
point four or five volts this is just
for scaling though our five point three
gigahertz tests at one point four one
volts passed and did so successfully as
time consuming 178 watts each even with
101 B CLK both which failed for prime95
fire strike is next including both the
physics stand-alone test and the
combined gaming workload the combined
test is more accurate cv power
consumption when playing a video game
that splits load across the GPU and CPU
the results aren't too distant with
combined often a few percentage points
under physics stand-alone the most
noteworthy results are 5.1 gigahertz at
one point three five volts consuming
only 105 watt because these cpus are so
heavily Bend our volt frequency table
allows much leaner power consumption and
here's times by just if you're curious
this one is more intensive but is still
well under blender and prime our 5.3
gigahertz overclock at 1.4 1 volts past
at 155 watts but the 101 BC LK
configuration failed this test Cinebench
is last this one shows at both
multi-threaded or NT and single threaded
or 1t results for the 8086 k here we see
power consumption scaling up to about
197 watts with our more aggressive
voltage provision
with 177 watts for the 1.41 volt and 5.3
gigahertz configuration compared to
stock our Delta is nearly 100 watts
versus Auto but performance is
significantly uplifted 5.0 gigahertz at
one point 3 volts provides the best mix
of processing power and power efficiency
at 133 watts single threaded consumption
skyrockets to 100 watts with the 5.3
gigahertz and 1.45 volt configuration
but otherwise remains under 70 watts for
all other tests the 101 BC LK
configuration did not pass this test
with the voltage we set it to for
thermal testing we combined the two
solutions prime95
8k FFTs which again it's the most
abusive in terms of power consumption
which means that it follows that
thermals will be higher as a result
ultimately that's all that matters it's
how much power is being consumed by the
CPU and being output as heat for the
cooling solution to soak in this case
including either liquid metal or the
stock thermal paste which we sometimes
refer to as Tim though they're both
technically Tim so for this one prime95
8 K F of T is for the modes of use of
thermals and then blender for realistic
but still high thermals both of which
are AVX these results will show both
dee-lighted and stock thermal results we
used the same top layer of thermal paste
for each set of tests with a crack and X
62 cooler maxed out for rpms we also
tested with thermal grizzly conductor
not liquid metal applied under the IHS
and atop the die this is something we've
done regularly over the past year and it
often provides 10 to 20 degree
performance improvements a lot of the
improvement though comes from carefully
scraping off all the excess silicone
adhesive around the borders but more
still comes from the highly thermally
conductive liquid metal thermal paste is
a polymer compound comprised largely of
silicon whereas liquid metal uses indium
and gallium to improve thermal
conductivity to nearing 70 watts per
meter Kelvin depends a bit on the
composition of the particular liquid
metal they all use slightly different
mixtures either way in the 70s for watts
per meter Kelvin thermal conductivity
versus at44 in tile space is quite an
improvement well link to the thermal
grizzly conductor not tube below in case
you want to buy it for your own D lid
let's start with the harder prime95 8k
test first the complete stock Otto
- measured an average core temperature
of 46 degrees Celsius over ambient
meaning that we were in the upper 60s
when considering ambient temperatures of
about 23 degrees Celsius this isn't bad
at all and largely is thanks to the low
voltage required for an 80 86 K to hold
the stock clocks running with thermal
paste Tim that is at 5.0 gigahertz and
1.35 volts temperatures increased by
about 20 degrees up to 65 point six
degrees over ambient this is from
overclocking and over voltage although
the voltage required is modest when
considering our 8700 K needs one point
four volts to hold five gigahertz going
to liquid metal completely negated this
and brought us down to about 47 degrees
over ambient equal to the complete stock
8086 K with Tim when left on auto
settings and yet this one was at five
gigahertz core decor Delta's weren't as
bad as we've seen on other Intel CPUs
like these 79 ATX
II we have a chart for this one for the
8086 K we think that the reduction in
corticoid deltas is because of the
relatively small die size when compared
to hed T CPUs resulting in tighter
thermal performance across the die for
auto testing with Tim we measured a
quarter core peak Delta of six degrees
which is one of the better measurements
we've seen overclocked with Tim we
measured a quarter core delta peak of 10
degrees which reduced to about eight
degrees with conductor not applied let's
move on to blender with blender we
measured an average load temperature of
36 degrees over ambient when left to
auto and thermal paste which again we've
labeled as Tim on this tart despite
liquid metal also technically being Tim
with Tim at 5.1 gigahertz and 1.35 volts
that increased 15 degrees up to 51
degrees over ambient using thermal
grizzly conductor not with this same
volt frequency profile we measured 39
degrees over ambient a reduction of
about 12 degrees from the 5.1 gigahertz
and 1.3 5 volt Tim test the vigor news
here as before is that this also
corresponds with only a three degree
increase from auto yet we have a 600
megahertz increase in frequency with Tim
at 5.3 gigahertz and 1.25 volts which
proved stable and blender but not prime
we measured a 60 degree over ambient
temperature liquid metal at the same
frequency and voltage 5.3 1.35 measured
just 49 degrees a reduction of 11
degrees Celsius in this test finally to
of a point we ran an overclock at 5.0
gigahertz with 1.30 volts and fan speeds
of just 60% with this balance of voltage
and frequency and using liquid metal we
were able to reduce our noise levels
considerably down from 51 DBA
to approximately 40 DBA this acoustic
reduction is perceived as slightly
greater than 2x2 a human
due to the logarithmic scale of the
decibels and illustrates our biggest
point with deleting efforts in this
particular CPU so that's the important
thing that we wanted to convey today
even when dropping 10 DBA off of our CPU
fan noise which is substantial 10
decibels is roughly perceived as about a
2x change to a human observer because it
is logarithmic and 3 DBA is about where
it starts to get pretty noticeable to
most people just for kind of a scale of
reference so even drop in 10 DB out the
CPU fan speeds we're still able to
maintain a 5 gigahertz overclock part of
that in large part actually is because
of the CPU of course but outside of
silicon quality you still have cooling
quality and that comes from our delayed
efforts where we scrape off the silicon
adhesive it's just kind of the unsung
hero of this and then also apply liquid
metal to it which is highly thermally
conductive so 5 gigahertz overclocked
with the same temperatures that are
about equivalent to the stock clocks
with Tim so that's really the bigger
advantage here is if you've never
considered liquid metal as a means to do
things other than increase your
overclock and over voltage Headroom this
is kind of the point we're trying to
make 51 DBA to about 40 by deleting and
scraping off compound and putting on
some better stuff instead so further
just to kind of note on the 8086 k we're
not doing a full review on it we're
greatly looking forward to the live
stream which will be in the past when
this video goes up should be a lot of
fun but the kind of big thing here with
8086 K the reason it's worth an
overclocked live stream and not a review
is because of its Binda nature so this
CPU is doing 5 gigahertz trivially at
1.3 5 volts for reference our 8700 K the
first one could barely do 5 gigahertz
and if it did it was at like 1 point 4
or 5 volts in sort of lighter load
application hour later 8700
could do 5 gigahertz at one point four
zero volts as opposed to five with 1.35
for the 8086 k and then the stock
operating voltage is also significantly
lower on the 86 k is it worth the extra
money for an 80 86 K Bend CPU probably
not if you have a really specific use
for it and you're definitely going to
overclock past 5 gigahertz and you think
that is inherently fun to you sure but
it is not inherently natively better in
any meaningful way in terms of gaming
performance than an 8700 K hence not
bothering to review it because you're
really at that point all we're doing is
testing the OSI performance what we're
doing in a live stream anyway so anyway
that's the big news is the noise
reduction something we haven't actually
measured with liquid metal before but
have talked about so hopefully that
helps you out with some ideas on what
