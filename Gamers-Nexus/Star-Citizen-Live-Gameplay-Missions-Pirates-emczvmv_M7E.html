places you can spawn in it's sort of
your habitats not you have it you'll
also cabin so when you join the large
world /a c alpha there's various
different rooms you use your own
particular rooms so here we got four of
our folks here and we're on portales are
so i think we're going to head to the
atrium
okay and so when you when you spawn on
the space station you can go to these
different terminals and call up one of
your ships to be on one of the landing
pads so we're going to pull up a
constellation so we're all right cuz ya
and so it tells us what landing pad
landing pad for how many learning paths
we have on portales are 10 and he was
ten landing pads so you spawn you have
your ship spawn and they'll stay on that
landing pad for a period of time if you
don't claim after a while they'll be put
back in the hangar basically so we'll
get let's get our merry band of brothers
together and head to the constellation
and the whole the space stations built
out with access to all the foil and all
the ten landing pads and stuff so it's a
it's built out and a much larger scale
than we did on the gamescom demo do we
go to the wrong door to get to the
landing pad okay what what about one of
our players is taking a Hornet so we're
taking Horner and the other three are
going to be on the so I guess this is on
landing pad su and then the other guys
are on for which you can see over here
and if we look over here we can see the
guys walking out the landing pad
okay let's get up as a consolation the
constellation is almost done will be
done when we flip this is missing a few
little bits but if you take a look it's
beautiful so as we said before the
constellations had a complete overhaul
it's built up to the quality of the
retaliator is now whole extra level of
detail
and the aerospace all systems online
disengage moving
we should cut back into the consolation
how about a view from inside to be kind
of cool huh
okay then we're going to head to this
communication satellite to put it back
on which has been sort of sabotage by
pirates there's likely it'll be pirates
wedding yep so we're in hyper joke so
you may be ready to move around here a
little bit so it's kind of pretty cool
for deactivated alright so here we are
going up to the communication satellite
okay that looks like there's some
pirates around here so we probably
should go fight them so I know it's a
surprise okay so this is part of the SC
alpha 2.0 so there's various eras so
like these are AI pirates that would
spawn around the communication sunlight
and disabled don't see the Hornet just
go past go should we get into one of
them someone getting the turret okay
Bogie's any
alright
we're going to stop here and will show
another feature which is allowed you go
in and out of e VA and any vehicle
including single-seat fighters so
so I headed here to us
you can see me being right there colette
CVA into the communication satellite
okay all right
all right okay so we've totally come
satellite back online and we'll have
some new nap coordinates now we'll just
get out
as you can see the best of damage was
taken on the constellation and we're
going to go and I'm we get in our ship
will go and head and repair it so let's
go into the Hornet
quantum drive activated
deactivated
and so this is one of the many refuel
repair and rearm stations that will be
in the SVR for 2.0
bogey
yeah on the repeal rhian paths
landing gear deployed
Landon complete
and here come and pick up the dress
and we're going to have a more involved
repair panic for players and also for
the NPC's when we as a subsisting
universe progresses but short term this
is the first iteration which longer term
when you've got a you can earn UEC and
persistence which will be one of our
next milestones beyond this you could
earn money doing missions and then it
costs you money to repair rearm refuel
right okay raised Oh disengaged so now
we're going to go to security port Korea
and check that out was this is sort of
the kind of dedicated FPS area we are
and longer longer term as we carry on
building this out we're going to have
areas that you will have not just a I
ships but hey I you know individuals on
foot that you will also have fights with
in combat and meet them and talk to them
do all the rest of stuff so as I said
the what we're doing here is absolutely
the foundation of everything that star
citizen is going to be
quantum drive activated
deactivated
i wantam drive deactivated bogey all
right
and this is the area that will be in the
first release that will have sort of
weapon drops and stuff so if you come
here you'll be able to grant weapons and
stuff that you would normally have and
then use those to shoot other people if
you want or defend yourself I had one of
the two pigs
there you go yeah shit it's a big ship
you got to be careful with it
alright
come out here we'll see the rest of the
folks some point coming out we go down
we go
yeah they come
and I believe is that there's a data
center the center of it you can
reactivate which i think is where we go
in
and it's sort of like a command and
control points so if you come and you
control this area you'll get missions
and stuff and so the idea is when we
have this running people hopefully come
here and track control and fight over
the area so well there we go here we
have some people do it right now so we
have four for outlaws that have been
playing by the four guys over on this
side and there's also some western crops
around here so hopefully we can find few
of them
and there's a recharge stations for
energy weapons they're missing ammo
drops and various weapon drops around
here
ok these the outlaws out more out law
how did you guys kill all the Marines I
guess again I guess they're going to
stay like a constellation now
so we don't actually rehearsed this
sometimes the Marines let win sometimes
the outlaw guys win I think this was
pretty much a whitewash
I guess it's all your bases belong to us
or all your constellation belongs to us
feels good
to use stamps here we go
these are the various destination you
can see so it's going to be a huge
amount of just even in the first truck
there's going to be a massive amount of
places to visit in a large bowl and play
so we're pretty excited by that we've
been sort of playing this the last week
or so here in the UK and it's actually
kind of fun people going to each other
in the face and flying around of doing
stuff so you know one of they think the
big things from this is to let you guys
know that we sort of decided that you
know FPS is really integral to the whole
experience and so we just would you know
our focus is we're going to give you fcl
for 2.0 with all that that's actually
going to be I don't want to give you
dates because everyone gives me shit
forgive you days
so let me say it's in the near future
we're not very far away from being
content and functionality complete in
that so I'm pretty confident that that
will be in your guy's hands in the near
future and in the near future I mean
inside sue so there's been a lot of hard
work to get all the stuff in there
there's going to be a little bit more
hard work for it but I think it's going
to be a great experience and I'm really
looking forward to seeing everyone fly
around and adventure and kind of make
their own little stories up and then
we're going to slowly build out from
there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
