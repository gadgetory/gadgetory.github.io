as it turns out for this year's best
cases of CES roundup we won't have
anything from NZXT coarse hair fractal
or Coolermaster the usual suspects
because none of them had a major case
presence at CES that's not to overshadow
though the show of fours from several
other manufacturers in this best case is
roundup will go over EVGA SD g7 deep
cool in when silverstone Thermaltake and
Liam Lee enclosures which that one's a
bit unique from CES 2017 before we get
into that this coverage is brought to
you by cyber power and their cyber excel
gaming PC which speaking of cases uses
an invertible motherboard trait layout
and has an interesting injection of
molded front panel check out more in the
link below starting off our coverage for
the cases roundup deep cool CES presents
included the new arc 90 enclosure the
Earle case liquid and the baron and
there's also the quad stellar for a bit
of an honorable mention we're mostly
interested though in the arc 90 this is
a full tower II ATX enclosure that's got
the expected tempered glass
accouterments and PSU strata the bottom
and like everyone else on the planet
LEDs interestingly the arc 90 includes a
deep pool captain 280 exa IO liquid
cooler including a flow meter in the
front center of the chassis the flow
meter is pretty damn cool it splits the
left and right compartments of the
enclosure cleanly down the middle using
an LED backlight to create something of
a Stark Industries effect to the meters
to other LEDs are positioned on the CPU
block and PSU shroud where deep pools
logo shines through and the arc 90 in
terms of cooling can accommodate up to a
360 millimetre radiator though it does
again include the 280 millimeter a i/o
unit pre-positioned for installation on
the CPU the arc 90 will include a unique
ventilation system on the non glass side
panel a ribbon cable extender for
vertical GPU installation and three 140
millimeter fans pre-installed
availability should start in May of this
year at a TBD pricing and are on the
list review this one so check back for
that review once it's live probably
closer to May the article linked below
has more information on all these cases
by the way and specifically on deep
pools entire
up evj is enclosure this year is a
strong departure from last year's DG 87
case which went with the odd approach of
throwing every scrap of metal plastic
and mirrors onto the largest body
possible the new DG seven meanwhile is a
much smaller case it's a simple
mid-tower chassis with support for up to
seven total fans but we don't know how
many fans will be included just yet the
enclosure is fairly simple in every
aspect it's got a sort of Corsair C 70
green colored exterior almost military
green grey a thin steel power supply
shroud and an EVGA logo cut out of the
shroud for my EVGA tells us that logo
will be modified using LED backlights
before the case is finalized and ships
and the tent will be lightened on the
tempered-glass side panel and by the way
it does have tempered glass side panels
like everyone else it also sounds like
EVGA might be adding a much darker
tempered glass side panel to the right
side so they can still tick the box of
having tempered glass everywhere but
without actually exposing the cables and
the things that you wouldn't want to see
on the backside of the case for now the
case should be priced around $100 which
is actually pretty damn competitive with
NZXT s340 elite and Corsairs 400 series
cases but we'll have to check and review
the case once it's more finalized and
has the fans back completed enter Max's
tron like showcase at CES 2017 primarily
featured an updated version of the
ostrog advance now the case that was on
display is using brighter LEDs and it's
dubbed the saber a the enter max a ray
will use enter Max's new LED fans with
illumination for the blades it's a bit
different from some of the other LED
fans that are Inlet and it's capable of
mounting radiators and sizes of 360 280
and 240 millimeters this includes a
compartment in the sidewall of the
chassis which is a bit unique and
there's also a compartment in the front
panel and the top panel for radiator
mounting the case is a fairly standard
mid tower layout other than the side
wall fans that we mentioned that we're
still not sure yet if those are included
in the final product in terms of
actually fans that ship with the case in
when in one's booth hosted several new
spins on the n1 303 they seem to have
been bitten a bit by their own bug and
they are going crazy within one 303
remakes this n1 303 remake suite include
is a a shrink-ray version of the 303
it's a shrunken down 303 units that is
mini ITX form factor and then of course
they've got a version that's been hit
with the RGB LED bug but it actually
makes some functionality differences
that pattern to the latter of those two
the n1 303 type C is exactly the 303
chassis but now with a USB type-c
connector in the front of the case big
surprise this is a good value ad moving
forward in the world of cable a can damn
for chipsets and other than this anyone
has done what everyone else has done on
the planet they've added LEDs to their
case and increase the cost though there
is still a TBD on the price so that said
in one has asked us to ask you to leave
a comment below on how much you'd be
willing to pay for the in win 303 type C
now that's said with the sort of snark
aside on RGB LEDs and when's
implementation is at least unique and
this is the only thing really that
matters at this point because everyone
has the RGB LED strips the 303 type C's
is some sort of laser etching on a side
panel which is powered via a simple PCB
and pin stemming from the chassis so it
doesn't add extra cabling also in wins
booth and more importantly this one we
think is the most noteworthy out of
anyone's lineup that was the in win 301
mini ITX case this is a shrunken version
of the 303 and is almost entirely
identical other than the fact that it's
smaller the 301 looks like it could have
some ventilation and breathing
challenges for the front panel and so
we'll rely entirely on bottom intake for
the GPU and CPU cooling the 301 uses a
top mounted PSU as a result of this
cooling layout and should have some
limited radiator support in the final
product version that we're not sure
again because it's not a finalized
product CES often shows prototypes and
sometimes the products don't even make
it to market quick side note anyone also
had the medieval metal case from BS mods
and that is a production unit but it's
$1,000 so it's not really going to land
on our consumer roundup Thermaltake
while on the topic of Mini ITX form
factory cases we've got two more for you
one is from Thermaltake and the other
from Silverstone the Thermaltake core p1
TG is another use of the industry-wide
shrink-ray serving the Mini ITX market
as a smaller version of the core p3 case
which was preceded by the larger core p5
case the Thermaltake core p1 you
the TG suffix quote-unquote as an
indication of its use of tempered glass
though this is one of the few instances
where tempered glass does actually make
a lot of sense including the Lian Li and
since at the end of this video the
reason it makes sense is because the p1
doesn't have traditional side panels it
also doesn't have a front panel or a
back panel and is effectively an
open-air test bench that's been pretty
DUP a bit like the p3 the core p1 T G
can be wall mounted using somewhat
standard mount and can house an ITX
system with full open-loop cooling for
peak showmanship the case leverages a
semi modular layout for the video card
installation and uses a support bracket
that can install the card to be
front-facing or removed for more
traditional motherboard installation of
the video card price is TBD on this one
Thermal takes also got the tower 900
just as a reminder which seems to be all
over vendor booths at CES this year we
won't spend too much time on this one as
it's been out for the while and it
wasn't just a CES but it's worth a note
the tower 900 is sort of like a display
case using tempered glass on three sides
and now supporting full cooling loops
for customization the tower 900 does
actually have a price unlike most these
others it's all at $250 getting back to
the Mini ITX cases Silverstone's at new
SG 14 is in full prototype phase and
still has several iterations to go
through the SG branding as part of
Silverstone's super go series of
enclosures relying on small form-factor
for deployment as an HT pc gaming setup
the SG 14 uses a more vertically
oriented layout and relies on a single
140 millimeter air penetrator fan at the
bottom of the case which pushes air up
and out of the top meshing the case
currently uses bowed polycarbonate side
panels with tinting for front and sides
and has each semi backlit by
pre-installed RGB LED strips that said
silverstone asked us at CES to ask our
viewers and readers what they think of
the LEDs silverstone noted that the
price could be below $100 if there are
no LEDs pre-installed but they're
feeling the pressure from other
manufacturers to add more flash to the
enclosure that flash of course comes at
a price hike regardless of the LEDs the
chassis looks like a good mini ITX
replacement to the old su 10 and s go8
enclosures that we previously reviewed
price will be less than $100 that
full-hd XPS these are supported as our
GP is up to 11 inches in length though
that may change to 10.5 the final
enclosure isn't really a proper
enclosure it's more furniture that's
because it's Li omni is a dko 5 desk
case that we saw at CES this is Li Omni
is a standing desk case with a glass top
this time the tempered glass actually
has a purpose namely to put stuff on the
d.ko five-can has two full systems up to
e ATX and motherboard form factor and
uses two separate front panel
controllers on either side of the desk
for separating the systems the desk uses
an electric motor to drive the legs and
comes with four presets for desk height
each of which can be modified with
incremental adjustment from plus and
minus buttons we didn't measure exactly
but the desk comes up to about a meter
high and uses a front angle of about 60
degrees to better fit chairs under the
desk than the previous models where you
kind of bash your knees on the desk the
desk will include something like eight
to twelve fans depending on the how the
final design shakes out and to the
support at least some minimal level of
liquid cooling a iOS but we're still
waiting on final details price for the
Lian Li DK o''h 5 will be about 1700 to
1800 dollars but it's a bit of a mix-up
furniture
