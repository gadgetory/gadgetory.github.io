net and I'm joined by Patrick stone
agian and we have not shot three of
these consecutively they were in fact
filmed on separate days hahaha
today we're talking about PC
troubleshooting and specifically some of
the most common practices to
troubleshoot basic issues like no video
output or fan spinning up and then
spinning down again oh boy
things like that things like we face all
the time so you were just facing this
recently with system bills what was the
yeah so as a matter of fact it was just
today helping a friend working on his
first PC and he was pretty excited when
he got his new parts in and then in the
end it turned out that he had a bad
graphics card it took us a few steps to
get there though and using the common
troubleshooting tips that's how we got
to the end so like what's maybe one of
the most common things that you would
say hey check this well cables power
cables and the amount of times that I
have personally overlooked the CPU power
header is nothing short of embarrassing
and that is a I think a common issue or
at least that's why Tom I saw CPU power
had it needs to be checked 24 pin header
needs to be checked and then the seating
of the components Ram is help seated
properly make sure the tabs are actually
clicked in yeah they should snap when
you push it down the video card often
needs to be seated mm-hm and then
there's the CMOS battery
yeah the CMOS better just to kind of
clear settings out like sometimes for
whatever reason some of the settings get
hosed and just pull the power from the
computer so you got no power going to
the computer pop the CMOS battery out
and then the CMOS settings cannot remain
if you make sure that board has no power
right yeah and then some modern boards
do have a clear CMOS button as well so
that is another way to do that so those
are the probably the basic intro things
I would do before looking at things like
if it's a modular PSU make sure your
connection is one in the right spot yeah
shouldn't be possible to plug it in
elsewhere but usually keep you can you
can't force it them mmm and then I'll
stay there it's it's actually seated
yeah yeah is it
like all the way clicked in that I've
seen that on the ATX 24-pin main power
where it's kind of like crooked in the
connector so there's kind of a gap on
one side and that connection isn't solid
but there is there's an easier first
step before all that to do though yeah
just just some some that'll give you
some heads up as what's going on yes
post beeps Smurfs yeah so a lot of times
motherboards as far as I know every
motherboard that I've seen has got this
four pin connector on the front panel
headers the front panel headers the
place is whether the reset button is a
place where the power LED is hard drive
LED and the power button right there's
there's a speaker connected there to
Mnet's it's four pins wide but you
really only make use of the outer two
pins and you plug in just this little
what we call PC speaker and it's like
it's going to give you some beep codes
if things are going well and a lot more
beep codes if things are going poorly
right single beep versus many beeps
exactly exactly and quick clarification
here because I've seen it on our forums
before plugging in your actual speakers
or headset to the three point object
won't produce this the sound you need a
specific PC speaker that plugs into the
board yeah and it on some other boards
they include it in the motherboard
accessories package and in other cases
they include it with the actual case a
little plastic bag with other
accessories and then there's the
7-segment display as well which is a
hexadecimal output more powerful
absolutely this is like the digital
numbers you've seen before we call it
seven segment because it's got yeah two
two on the sides and then one two three
and that way you can create whatever
numbers and letters you want and the
reason is that's more powerful with
because as opposed to just giving you
beep codes like as in like three
consecutive beeps or three beeps a pause
and a fourth B percent one deep short
beep yeah instead of having just that
kind of stuff now you've got literally a
huge possible combination of letters and
numbers that you can put together that
have specific meanings but then how do
we get those meanings manual right
absolutely yeah so and the same with the
beep codes if you're relying on those
rather than the display either way
you're cross-referencing a manual
and for the Beeb codes there are bios or
UEFI manufacturers or vendors within all
them like Phoenix the ami so you'll
check those vendors for the beep codes
if it's not available in your manual and
then for the 7-segment stuff you just go
straight to the manual yeah and see what
does it mean and a lot of times it's
it's fun to have your paper manual out
you can reference paper manual but maybe
you can't find exactly what you need
right away
protip just search yeah use PDF use PDF
and search it absolutely right
other than that I would say if things
are still going poorly you running
through the list again want to check the
connections just redo all of them
despite thinking that you may have done
it right yep just redo it all take take
her advice on that check the CMOS powder
and reset it just to be sure do
Ram seeding reseeding of the RAM yeah
absolutely that that's so common it's a
matter of fact Steve mentioned earlier
what we were talking that it's a lot of
times people think that they're not
getting video output because of a bad
graphics card right and it turns out to
be Ram right so just yummy it takes what
at five seconds it just receipt it and
give it a shot yeah and that's that's
important to note just because it's a
video output issue doesn't mean it's the
video device there could be an error
earlier in the pipeline yep that's
preventing you from ever even getting
there and if none of this stuff works
you have to start going bare-bones which
to pay on who you ask might mean
different things but in my opinion
there's only one proper meaning of bare
bones and the essentials and that's to
go down to the CPU yep one stick of RAM
and if you don't have an eye GP or an
APU then your video card is essential in
that case otherwise eliminate it and use
the onboard video and of course the
motherboard is the platform and you got
to have power going from the power spot
those five things really right and then
just start switching out the RAM sticks
the troubleshoot those and if you take
the GPU out use the IGP and see it works
then you've found your problem
normally and I think that about covers
the very basics that's it yeah so check
the link in the description below for
more information we'll try and do a
couple more of these
if you have specific questions so if you
have a troubleshooting question or maybe
something that you've solved and that
would be interesting sure
share it and we'll do a video as always
check the patreon link in the post role
if you like this kind of content and
we'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
