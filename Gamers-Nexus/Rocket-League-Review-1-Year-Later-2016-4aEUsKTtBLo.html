leap their sequel to start which stands
for supersonic acrobatic rocket-powered
battle cards to both PC and PlayStation
4 chances are you haven't heard of start
before and that's probably because it
was only released on PlayStation Network
in North America back in 2008 it
received fairly mixed reviews but did
well enough to merit a second try rocket
league was released last year on both PC
and PlayStation 4 to much higher praise
than its predecessor since then science
has been very busy with further
development of their game let's talk
about developer support
sanok's is fairly responsive to the
community on reddit and other social
media and has offered some of the best
developer support I've experienced in a
long time Sonic's also has nearly
doubled their in-game content since
released their first patch was released
shortly after July 9th of 2015 since
that day they released 23 more for a
grand total of 24 patches that comes out
to roughly 2 patches every month for
about a year to give that number some
perspective in the last year csgo has
had 45 patches which comes out to about
3.75 patches per month this number may
be misleading though because many of
those patches were small bug fixes and
not content updates rocket League has
had plenty of bug fixes but they have
also added new game modes cosmetics cars
and additional gameplay functionality
like many popular online games including
League of Legends dota or csgo psionics
has released seasonal patches for rocket
league during the holidays last year
Sonic's released their first custom game
mode called snow day a hockey influenced
game-mode that was popular enough for
SATs to bring it back permanently after
what was supposed to be an initial
limited time run Halloween and Christmas
also received seasonal patches all of
which have been free for anyone who
purchased the base game there are many
random and fun items unrelated to the
holidays like recently added item rarity
and new rare items alongside these new
rare items the company added an
inventory management system with a
trade-in functionality that mimics CS
gos inventory and trade-in functions
psionics announced both item trading and
loot crate's will be added to rocket
league soon rocket needs existing
feature list is robust as is including
extensive graphic options and camera
settings cross-platform play is
available between Xbox and Playstation
players which can be toggled if desired
powerful custom match mode for playing
with large parties of up to eight is
accompanied by mutaters for altering the
ball-shaped physics and other gameplay
settings for those who prefer to play
solo offline and AI base season modes
are available as for leaderboards and
laddering stats tracking and powerful
replay saving and viewing tools have
been in place since day one useful for
ego checking friends and filming your
favorite moments a number of training
modules allow for mechanical improvement
for goaltending striking and aerials all
of which are accompanied by three
different difficulty settings this helps
reduce the barrier for entry for players
who may feel like they are late to the
game or miss the boat and rapidly brings
those players up to speed which brings
us to the value of rocket League of
course there are some cosmetics you have
to pay for including all additional cars
the base gaiden costs $15 and it has
been on Steam sale for as low as 10 if
you want all the DLC excluding the two
soundtracks it will cost you twenty six
dollars which includes cars wheels
decals and other cosmetic upgrades
rocket League includes seven unranked
game modes including rocket labs which
is the place where psyonix is planning
to test new maps before adding them to
the competitive map pool and for ranked
game modes are available for more
serious involvement psionics does all of
this while doing their best to support
their competitive community the company
is currently running their own
professional series called the our LCS
which stands for rocket League
Championship Series that's open to all
players its first season will be coming
to an end soon at the offline finals in
Los Angeles California the grand final
