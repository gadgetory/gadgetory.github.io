prior to embargo lifts the I 373 50 K
had up the most interested for Intel's
upcoming platform the 72 50 K is the
first overclockable i3 that intel has
shipped to the enthusiast market and
reminds us in some ways of intel's at g3
to five eighth anniversary edition
pentium that overclocked so well this
time though it's a dual core quad thread
cpu that stands to displace some of
intel's own a low-end i5 market will be
benchmarking an overclocking the 73 50k
in today's review find out how well it
positions itself before we get into that
this coverage is brought to you by our
patreon backers over at patreon.com
slash gamers nexus you can help us out
there and it's a direct contribution so
there's no better way to support the
channel if you like this type of
coverage the i3 72 50k has a few
important specifications of note one of
them of course it's a to physical core
CPU but has four threads so its reliant
on hyper threading for the rest and in
terms of clock rate there's no turbo
boost on this one it's just a hard fix
number four point two gigahertz which is
higher than the base clock of the i5
7600 k but the boost is of course where
it's at for that processor because it
does actually have boost functionality
cache is also a bit different and is
another major point of differentiation
the i3 70 to 50 k has four megabytes of
intel's at smart cache where the i5 k
skew cpu has six megabytes or two extra
and the i7 case q has eight megabytes so
it's four six eight pretty easy all of
this also means that until you overclock
it you can expect the 7350 k to run at a
lower power consumption that it's more
expensive KS you brethren the 60 watt
TDP is an indicator that smaller coolers
can also be used to keep the starting to
busy k under control so it's $180 price
point suggest that you might really be
better off overclocking this thing and
putting it under a good cooler that's
more worthwhile
this isn't positioned like the i7 case
qcb is where people buy it and use it
just to sort of quote have the best
because it's not the best and it's a
case Q and it's $180 and it's an i3 so
in order to get any value out of this
then you really should only be buying it
if you're going
during overclocking don't even bother if
you're just going to throw it in the
system in the hopes that maybe one day
you might want to in terms of
architecture the 14 nanometer plus
branding for the process all that stuff
it's all the same the specs are mostly
the same everywhere else except where
we've already listed the differences and
architecture hasn't changed from the
7700 K review so if you're interested to
learn more about the under line parts of
the cpu and check out the 7700 K review
it's the same thing that doesn't change
testing methodology as always the link
in the description below has be full
written review and more importantly an
entire page dedicated to testing methods
that were used for this processor if
you're confused or curious about what
motherboard memory drivers video card
any of that stuff that we used for the
testing check the article each platform
is defined there with regards the CPU
present we're now more or less finishing
the Intel i3 - i7 stack for testing so
we'll next we move into ad and the FX
CPUs to the bench we've already tested
the 83 17 we'll be adding a few more
after that so keep an eye out for the
imminent Zen review each addition of a
skew takes considerable amount of time
hence why we've been adding them
incrementally the thermals we're seeing
the I 370 350 K operated around 65
Celsius when under these same AVX
intensive workload as the 7700 K and
7600 K is shown in the table on the
screen now the 70 250 K has power draw
close to 60 watch when under load and
we're operating at the same one point
275 or there abouts fixed voltage as in
the other test it's not necessary to use
the kraken X 62 at max rpms that we're
using to cool this CPU you'd be able to
keep the 73 hook EK under control with a
wide variety of simpler air coolers
making this chip much easier to work
with then it's hotter counterpart and
just sort of a side note here thermals
are really important is this is the kind
of thing that people skip over a lot but
temperature especially with KB Lake is
something that you should be paying
attention to because it's a little bit
higher than skylake we've seen on
average how there's chip-to-chip
variants always so not as big enough
sample size to make a definitive
statement but on average we're seeing
six to seven Celsius hotter than the
counterparts from the previous
generation
and although that's not murderous if
your motherboard is running a high V
core auto and you're not going to change
it then that's a problem
gigabyte just fix this issue with their
gaming seven board they're good now but
previously was about one point four
volts - I so you're going to run really
hot and it's not necessarily the chips
fault it could be the motherboard and
Auto V core but the processor itself
doesn't matter as well because the Tim
used on these new KB Lake CPUs is not
impressive starting off with blender for
the benchmarks and we custom render
benchmarks that we made in the house
where we are rendering various monkey
heads with different effects applied
we're seeing the i3 73 50k at 4.2
gigahertz stock completely seen render
in about 91 minutes so that's lower than
the overclocked 2500 K and faster than
the AI 535 70 K stock compared to the
previous generation i3 we're seeing an
improvement of about nine minutes or
roughly 9% reduction in total render
time required for comparison the i-5
7600 K it lands us at around sixty eight
minutes pre overclocked with a 7700 K
chart topping at 42 minutes pre
overclocked overclocking the i3 70 to 50
K won't get us to the top of the chart
of course because this is a thread
limited test but our 5.0 gigahertz OC
gets us about seventy eight point three
minutes required to render the scene a
reduction of about sixteen to seventeen
percent in total render time from the
stock version of the i3 case Q this also
lands us ahead of the i5 4690k a stock
CPU and just under the stock i7 2600
this new i3 case Q is on par with a5
generation old i7 which really is not
bad considering the workload is thread
intensive in frequency only helps us so
much to throw some standardized
synthetics in here at Cinebench post the
70 to 50 K just below the I 535 70 K is
stock CPU going for 66.5 cv marks though
the i3 has stronger single core
performance thanks to the boosted
frequency the i3 6300 last gen CPU that
we had on hand is awarded for 22 cv
marks or 163 for single threaded
performance after overclock in the new
i3 70 250 K KB Lake CPU to 5.0
it's with a 1.35 beak or wheel and just
below the overclocked 2500 K at 4.5
gigahertz for multi-core performance so
that's well ahead and single core
performance and also below the i5 4690k
stock CPU for 3dmark and times 5
benchmarks we've got fire strike and
time spy in the article link list
written below on the website you can
find those charts there if you want more
standardized and comparable paths to
check maybe how your current system
compares to an upgraded one but now
we're going to roll into watchdogs to
and some other gaming benchmarks
watchdogs to is one of the most thread
intensive modern games we've looked at
yet showing significant performance
benefits with the hyper threaded i7 CPU
is over even higher clock I 5 CPUs the
i3 then should comparatively struggle
with this game and it sort of does
what's the 73 to TK stock CPU operating
around at 67 FPS average compared both
to the performance of the Ivy Bridge I
535 7ek quad-core from a few years ago
looking elsewhere on the bench we see
the 70 to 50 K operates at around 20 FPS
slower than the stock I 570 600 K or
percentage reduction of almost 30
percent and it's nearly two times
flowers on the i7 7700 K for this
particular game most gtx 1060 and RX for
a TDP purchases and ops at 1070 1080
would be bottlenecked by an i3 Sony 350
K but again that is game specific and
not a blanket statement applies
everything overclocking with CPU gets us
an extra couple FPS but we're more
thread limited again in this particular
title then clock limited so there's only
so much we can actually do so we're at
least seeing a market at 10 FPS
improvement over the i3 6300 from
skylake
that will kill one places the 72 50k CV
at around 124 FPS average with lows
tightly times in the 70 to 80 FPS range
even the i3 6300 can keep up pretty well
with lows again in the same range
although both CPUs are technically
bottleneck in a GTX 1080 they're not
really posting a significant bottleneck
threats to more realistic cards paired
for the platform again like a 1050 or
480 the i3 73 50k ends up right around
where the i5 35 70 K is
has annoying mix of numbers from a few
generations ago and not far below and i5
4690k from the more modern era of Intel
CPUs as a reminder on tour Warhammer
this game is a bit more variable and its
performance than we're used to with the
low frame time metrics so those numbers
aren't our driving factor for
performance in these benchmarks so for
CDs have team they normally aren't
moving the total war Warhammer then the
AI 323 ZK stock costs only marginal
improvements over the ICC 300 stock with
a former scoring around 122 FPS average
and 72 FPS 64 FPS for the lows while the
latter
lands at 114 FPS average and 66 fps or
59 FPS for the load using the AI 373 50k
as it should be used that is overclocked
in at the 5 gigahertz we see a
significant performance gain up to 140 F
gasps average with lows now in the 70 to
80 FPS range that's a gain of about 15%
from an overclocked not bad and puts us
nearly in the performance range of an i5
4690k stock finally the ashes of the
singularity CPU bound benchmark on high
is abusive and is more meant to give us
a hierarchy than useful FPS metric since
we're more or less ignoring the
existence of a GPU the AI 372 50k stock
CPU lens just below the 4.5 gigahertz
overclocked i-5 2500 K on the chart and
just above the 35 70 K stock CPU
overclocking the 72 TK gets us up to
about on par performance with the i7
2670 PU and just below the i-5 6600 K
again not bad hierarchical placement for
an i3 CPU especially considering the
power of the previous gens we're
comparing to we were only able to
stabilize an overclock of around 5.0
gigahertz and that's with a 1.3 5v core
setting manually and couldn't really
push higher without doing something more
extreme and more tuning intensive still
5 gigahertz for an i3 isn't anything to
laugh at and the performance scaling
overall isn't bad post overclocked just
a few games where it's less exciting
than others like watchdogs because we're
so thread limited in that particular
title
still this CPU has a lot more hips and
requirements attached
with only previous cable HCPs that we've
looked at for this generation primarily
the IC 73 50k again is a CPU that you
should absolutely not purchase unless
you're planning to overclock it
basically on day one if this is one of
those I might overclock it one day and
would like that functionality don't buy
it because chances are you won't and the
performance for the price is not that
great if you overclock it the argument
gets a lot better but still at a hundred
and eighty dollars it's a huge amount to
ask for for an i3 even an overclocking
one at $180 you're approaching non-case
qi5 territory like the i-5 7500 9k which
is about two hundred four dollars and
other i3 CPUs are significantly less 150
to 165 the i3 70 to 50k feels like it
should be priced at around the 165 mark
that's what the 1k unit pricing is and
that's probably what the consumer
pricing should be because that's just
where the value is better so this wasn't
as exciting as say a $60 penny mg three
two five eight that was a fun ship to
buy for 60 bucks and push it with
overclocking and see what kind of
performance you get because you really
couldn't be bit mad at that point for
$60 like who cares you get a year or two
out of it and you move on and it's
really not a bad chip if you're trying
to tie yourself over this one is out of
that well out of that range three times
more than that was of course more
powerful it's got more cores it's got
better staying power in the future with
the thread difference that it has but
that doesn't make it a good purchase at
180 so kind of over all the opinions
here would be if you are planning to
overclock and you cannot afford for some
reason the 7600 K then it's maybe worth
buying to play around with but there are
Pentiums out there too that we will be
looking at soon hopefully and this just
kind of lands in a very weird price
point between a pretty good CPU that
will handle just about any game and true
budget CPUs that have more priced
friendly markups and positioning in the
market so that's all for this one
hopefully the numbers help you figure
out if it's worth it for
you definitely overclock if you buy it
we've got Rison coming up eventually
soon TM so maybe wait around for that I
haven't tested it it's not being coy we
just we haven't tested it so give it
away if you can subscribe for more
