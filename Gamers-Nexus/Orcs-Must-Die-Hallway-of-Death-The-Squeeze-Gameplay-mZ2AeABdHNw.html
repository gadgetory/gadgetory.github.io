Donna and I am playing it works must die
right now I actually was not intending
to record this but my traps are amazing
in this level this level is just
fantastic for encouraging automating the
killing of ores if you do not already
know orcs or thigh is about killing orgs
and not letting them get to your rift
which is that shining beauty right there
it's essentially a tower defense game
mixed with hack and slash that said I'm
going to make this pretty quick so I
really wanted to show off my trap system
here now this is fairly it's not super
complex or anything but it's definitely
a little bit elaborate and I God so what
we're going to use for this setup is to
semi synchronized swinging maces you can
see that every every tick they will
synchronize and every other tick they're
out of sync which does leave a bit of a
gap or worse to slip through however
might our traps will slow them down
these are those black things on the
floor so they should stay they should be
slowed up where they hit when the
synchronized tick is lined up there I do
have three arrow shafts and yes they do
overlap a little bit but it does help
keep this decoy alive which I will
explain in a second the arrow traps
essentially just shoot out in kill doors
for a couple seconds at a time and then
they rearmed my decoy is what ties it
all together here it looks strikingly
like I do except slightly taller and not
quite as handsome and they will charge
that deep
and just try to attack him over and over
because they think he is me so the decoy
will only stop being attacked when it is
killed and that will only happen when
that does happen it will explode so it
does have an added bonus there this
final piece here is a grinder which will
suck works and grind them to bits more
arrow traps here and then not much up
here which it was just to open for my
taste in the vent so I chose my choke
point to be under this bridge now I have
loaded this up with the archers they are
not the best placed they are dealing
with flyers that gone through there now
the next trap i want to show you before
i start this yeah i do have a lot of
guardians by the way so they're just
kind of haphazardly place because I was
desperately trying to stop those flyers
from coming in so now this is a pretty
standard setup and it's not nearly as
intuitive as the other trap I just
showed you it's just Tar Pits with
archers on a bridge yet it sounds kind
of lame but it's extremely effective and
I just you know you can always spend so
much money on these reinders and stuff I
do have as close to the other trap as I
as I could over here I bet I'm just
soaking it up now I might get some more
upgrades and I see I have the flaming
arrows upgrade and of course the ones
that lead over to it and I have the over
coiled springs and oil trap ears so they
reset faster and the over coiled Springs
makes physical subtract traps effective
ogres let's finalize this
and then i will start this actually we
only have two waves left in this level
because i spent the rest of the time
setting those crabs I'll and so I'm
going to go ahead and start right now
and we can finish the last two levels
first before I want to I start this I
want to point out top right look at that
mini-map up there and you will see my
kill zones for where I kill the most
orcs the most efficiently and of course
right here in the top right you can see
all that red right there and then down
on the bottom left they are just dying
from those tar traps so let's start this
level here we go I only have one more
this is the last rolling log off so I'm
going to save it for the last way if I
can this over is going to be
but if I let me get through hopefully my
looks like my archers will take Matt's
fight flaming arrow is not super
amazingly effective against theirs as
you know the walls are crazy fast
they make life very difficult depending
terrific it looks like I'm getting
attacked on the top right now they're
moving through and hopefully I can say
this decoy before it explodes but i'm
not entirely sure it actually hasn't
been impacted because at archive of
slowing them down and up with both of my
sweetie maces I'm doing all the work
along with the arrow traps and that
grinder of course how these with the
archers are going to get rid of a
problem for my trap because they
you passed this week
however works are never smart they will
run
and they are getting taken out rapidly
by my arches I'm on the top of the ridge
the bridge excuse me with flaming arrows
looks like we took out that way pretty
easily there's only a small group left
down here that made it past the archers
but that or two no match for the
five-ton base that just hit him grab
this coin from a go-gurt and next round
is starting now I'm actually going to
set up some more arrows because I don't
have a lot of time to think about what i
want to put down i'm going to put down a
decoy over here that way i can simulate
the traffic top then run back over here
and you know what hey yeah let's say
that let's keep saving nothing move over
this way and see why this wave is so
much smaller than the last one we must
be stronger unit or so
oh that is definitely wide as much
smaller than laughing we have not one
but the two fire overcoming it and they
are going to get through this crap no
problem if I don't stop them early
hopefully I'm not Tyler I hope my
upgrades will make this swinging mace
effective but again not entirely sure
about that let's find out right here
can I tell if that was affected by sweet
nature by the grind it was died and that
is all that matters now trying to stop
it's over
for the explodes mice a beautiful
replica here because that is what ties
together all this beautiful wrapping
this where the orgs are going as cards
that represent and then die I have a
couple fighters over here I can take
them out with a freedom purse just like
that and I three is because fire does
not do well against ice currently just
like Pokemon I you know anything happen
for last with you let's we are down to
the very last wave it looks like
unfortunately all my orders over their
dead so I am down to just traps
defending me at this point I have a ton
of money so just like Starcraft I'm
gonna try and spend that and have oh man
that is a lot of buggy cobalt drink is
going to go problematically need to set
up many more defenders down here that
can
I know there's a limit though I'm going
to reach out soon so I may have an issue
luckily it looks like the cobalt are
getting caught up in this trap looks
like a lot of them have already died
down to just wires up at the top and I
hope my artist and think that I've had
to trust them to do it I move over here
now and shoot this blog trap so that
hopefully it would take out anyone that
has just kidding they are dead i was
actually looking at the wrong spot i
just wasted that log cup totally i
thought i was of a copyright so there
are more guys coming in the bottom up
I'm now moving back over the top right
trying to help my artistic job because I
don't want any more dye that you respond
that around the edges no it's usually I
have died because we are just more
ethical than that over here I can take
back the words are making it extremely
aces but they are
it looks like my arrows are actually
doing a lot of them
blows not to mention my archers down
there are still able to shoot them
looks like the fire to go into the rift
they're not going to make it they're
taking out where are the eyes welling up
no one made it through over here so now
we are just left with the guys on top up
and they are dying out this very second
that is a big over that with you luckily
he's already damaged a lot I'm gonna try
and breathe life as much as possible and
i miss Glasson another over should have
frozen slightly elyria so there's
traffic am
but I could not hear stunned me now so I
need to jump away take out this crease
before he resurrects anyone and that's
the ground guys they just won that round
amazing around i love that trap set up
when you can really combine them like
that it makes a masterpiece of traps so
definitely an awesome game looks like i
finished slightly beyond par so that
took away one school for me i'm not sure
if it counts time when you're not
actually in a round but either way still
did an awesome job and I love love those
traps on this map I just had to show it
off because it was so much fun so keep
an eye out for the upcoming levels I
have these are my upgrades for those
that are wondering a review will be
coming hopefully tomorrow or tomorrow at
this point will be today because it is
actually past midnight let's continue
see what the trap I unlocked is and then
cool looks cool so I'm guessing or you
can see by the diagram here orks love
the mushrooms apparently it and then
attack other orcs so it looks like some
kind of crowd control object a quick
peek at this level and then I will
finish up this me I almost fell down
there keep on fighting until the
sorcerer this is pretty awesome looking
guys there's actually 2 rifts one on
either side which we have seen before
Pro jump right there we've got two doors
at the bottom and i will show you if it
turns out to be an awesome level i will
show you a video of that as well but for
