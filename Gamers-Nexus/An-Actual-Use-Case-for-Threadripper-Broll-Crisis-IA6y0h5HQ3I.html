review for production tasks and now
we're going to actually put the things
real work not just benchmarking and show
an actual use case for this Corrin
thread count because depending on what
you're doing normally in day to day you
might not be able to find one but we've
got a good one for it and that is
resolving our data crisis we've talked
about this in the past so right now
linked to our 4k upgrade and just doing
more videos in general we're doing
something like 50 gigabytes a day we're
using about 1.5 terabytes of data a
month I can't afford to buy that many
hard drives so what do we do you either
delete everything in it which sucks
because I'm paying someone Andrew to
film that stuff and I don't want delete
work that I paid for and the other
option is find another solution so buy
storage don't want to do that I can't
afford a petabytes server like Linus or
you compress it and you take the
approach of building some kind of
software or script to compress this data
down losslessly as much as possible and
then keep it in a much smaller form
factor so that's what we're doing and we
will be using Red River for that task
because it is going to be best for this
particular workload will show more of
that as we get through this testing
before that this coverage is brought to
you by cable mod already well-known for
their work in custom sleeved power
supply cables cable mod is now venturing
into liquid cooler tubes leaving with
their new a i/o sleeping kits compatible
with Corsair and NZXT as of now check
the link in the description below for
more information
so bring everyone up to speed the last
time we talked about our compression
script was probably in December and
basically what it does is it uses the
handbrake CLI it's a PowerShell script
we wrote ourselves and it goes through
all of our files compresses them and
does a couple of other cool things that
help us with data preservation while
also making a ton of room so this can
save us something like hundreds of
gigabytes per day but the only reason
we're not currently pulling that much
data back out from being occupied is
because we need the system to do
premiere and rendering and video editing
because the same system that compresses
everything that does all the editing and
daily production so that's where this
comes in I can't
keep thread Ripper occupied permanently
for this task so what we're going to do
is build a system let it compress the
thirteen hundred or so files to need to
compress and then probably after a
couple of days of sitting there doing
nothing about compressing we'll be able
to reclaim it for other testing and and
articles and things like that but to
give you an idea of the outcome here
we're looking at a reduction of around
80 percent in the space requirement so
we go from about forty one point five
terabytes one point four terabytes to
about two hundred eighty gigabytes per
month used just think about that for a
second that's that's buying a 4 terabyte
well three four terabyte hard drives if
I want raid 5 every couple months every
two to three months versus compressing
all of that and then just being able to
use the same dryers for years actually
so that's what we're doing and we're
going to be nineteen fifty extra taxes
16 cores 32 threads and handbrake really
likes threads so what I'm going to do is
build this in basically an open-air
bench it's the p3 I'm going to be
putting this on the floor so I do
actually need a case which I normally
don't like a whole lot but where you're
going to use this case because basically
an open-air bench so I need to mount
this first okay so we're going to start
with getting the board set up and I'm
going to use the new Noctua coolers that
came in just because they're kind of
interesting and haven't worked with them
yet so we're going to get a chance to
actually install one of those we'll test
it very shortly this from our test in
mind you eat we did actually test it on
paste application is going to be about
enough for thread Ripper
so before anyone freaks out with a hole
that's way too much what are you doing
we actually did do contents on the
amount that's required to really cover
this thing so here's what we're working
with before I install this this is the
tr4 it's an Nhu 14 I believe NHE 14s so
it's got a wider cold plate than the
previous version it's a wider cold plate
then actually then one of these this is
the Corsair H 100 I or something B -
there's your normal cold plate size so
we've got a much bigger cold
that it'll let us contact more area it's
not going to be a better cooler than a
liquid cooler I don't think it's
possible but I'm not that's not why I'm
installing it I mean sonic if it's gonna
be easy and because I don't want to
mount a liquid cooler so these screws
come all pre-installed on the thing I
didn't I didn't pre do any of this for
the knock to cooler and it's kind of
like X 99 or X 299 in that way it's just
got screws that mount straight into the
socket you don't need a backplate
retention kit because it's all on the
board as part of the socket okay I don't
remember exactly how handbrake responds
to memory but we're just going to use
this G scope kit g.skill sent over some
extra of this this is the Trident II RGB
memory and this particular kit is 3200
megahertz and it's a CL 14 which is
actually pretty damn good so 3200 CL 14
32 gigabytes I don't know that we're
gonna use that capacity with hand brakes
but we'll find out okay there's our
memory oh this by the way I don't like
these covers so I took it off
so if gotten exposed family if you're
wondering that's not how it actually
looked what are we next we need the fan
for the cooler well that was that was
easy so I mean that was the whole point
of installing an air cooler I'm not sure
if it'll be liquid or not I don't think
it will if we're not concerned about
noise and stuff but we'll save that
judgment for the review what I really
wanted to do was avoid having to
actually do work it's called a radiator
in the case we need to stand off up
there oh this is the actual real reason
by the way that I took the cover over
here off this cover protrudes up and it
was interfering with one of our test
benches getting in the way right that
might be a problem here I'm not sure
damnit Asus okay so the one problem with
this cooler that I'm seen immediately is
clearly we're not going to the top slot
fortunately it's irrelevant for a number
of reasons one of which is we don't need
the top slot there's three other ones
and this build is ever going to need the
top slot and it's also not going to be a
long-lasting build the other reason it's
relevant because I'm just going to
install Arizer cable and call it a day
because we're not doing anything GPU
intensive anyway which is why there's a
1080i well that's why I guess that's why
we're putting a 1080i thing if I can
make this somewhat presentable I'm not
going to pull a Paul or Kyle and make it
pretty though tell you guys that right
now because this is to be functional for
a few days and then reclaim all the
parts 6ke 4+4 cpu we can't use this
power supply I might not even manage
these cables I might just kiss I'm not
going to do that
Patrick built this for us as a display
system there's some b-roll so it's
managed very well it looks nice and I'm
just going to come in here unbilled it
all and then not even manage the cable
on done super nova 750g - oh one thing I
do like about it is they're all
Universal connectors so you just move
them around based on where you want them
all you said I'm not cable managing this
I'm going to treat this like a test
patch the only difference is it's going
to be on the floor standing vertical
instead of on our very limited table
space sitting horizontal it's me that's
the Israeli test right now so we're just
going to connect everything as
efficiently as possible which does not
involve making it pretty okay what's
left drive aren't you gonna mount the
drive Steve I'll tell you where to put
your drive I think we're gonna go with
gothe right there now looks pretty good
okay that's not going to move got the
video card power cables power cables
times 3 power cables power memory am I
missing anything that's it other than
style and class okay so we just need to
make sure this works move it into the
other room turn it on and let it
compress stuff for a little while yes
does it stay lucid it's fogging a power
cycle yeah power cycle number one white
LED over here that means we're good that
one down there went from red to white
like green okay so the system works now
we just got to set up to compress
everything so I was the numbers here now
that we've had it doing some compressing
we used a test clip to get started and I
first of all had a 4960 in that system
originally in the render machine and
that one was completing the transcode in
11 minutes
so that was a 4k file to a 4k output
same framerate same pretty much
everything but some reduction in quality
on the placebo side so it looks
basically the same but it's a lot
smaller it's 56 to 80 percent smaller
depend on there is to compress so that
was 11 minutes when we upgrade to the Z
on a couple days ago which we haven't
really talked about yet that's the 12
core 24 thread part from x79 era as well
and that is doing it in 7 minutes so
it's pretty good reduction from 11 to 7
and that allowed us to do something like
regain about 50 gigabytes of data every
three hours or so so leaving the script
running for three hours if we're at 50
gigabytes to start we come back we've
got 100 gigabytes now we have all the
original files dealt with and the new
ones are just compressed fairly
losslessly so that was every three hours
about 50 gigabytes and now with thread
Ripper the 1950 X we're doing the same
test file instead of seven minutes we're
doing it in three minutes 19 seconds so
it's like about half actually a little
bit better than half of where we were
with the Xeon 12-core 24 thread part
from X 79 era that's also better than
the sub 900 X we'll do mind you not
nearly as much but it is better and that
means that if we assume about half the
speed perhaps the time requirement I
should say to perform the same task
instead of 50 gigabytes every three
hours we're gonna be gaining back 100
gigabytes every three hours so running
the thin overnight means that when we go
for a let it run for let's take a number
like eight hours make it easy we're
going to be doing a couple hundred
gigabytes every night that we can claim
back and because we pretty
is about 50 gigabytes of data on that
machine per day will be net positive so
that's good that means we can turn
through the 1300 or so videos compress
some gain back probably I don't even
know probably like a terabyte plus of
data I should think I would think it'd
be one to two terabytes back for those
files we've got a 3 by 4 terabyte drive
set up on that machine raid 5 so I think
we should reclaim a couple terabyte
stuff so it looks good
thread refer the 1950 X this is an
actual use case where there's something
we've wanted to show for a while when
Rison came out we spent a lot of time
talking to Andy as did a lot of other
folks and the problem we had there was
there wasn't very good communication
between the technical people and the
people with whom we have contact that
would be like PR or tech marketing and
so they probably run into is when we say
back when they see a hard X launched
what are some use cases for this help us
out we can test premier but we're seeing
kudos faster so what we do to premiere
to make sure that you can actually see a
difference in CPUs because blender could
is faster what do we do in blenders to
difference with CP is how do we make
these things relevant was the question
we were asking and there weren't a lot
of good answers at the time but now that
we've had our own time to work on Rison
for what three or four months now we've
pretty much figured these things out and
this was one of the best real use cases
where one we can't gpu-accelerated it
accelerated in a meaningful way that
produces better result and we just kind
of trust the cpu more when you're
dealing with compression and then
getting rid of the source file and -
this thing really uses cores and thread
more than a lot of other stuff doesn't
care about frequency as much doesn't
care about memory as much doesn't care
by the GPU at all so this is a
real-world application of what you can
do with something like thread Ripper and
that's $1,000 and it's better than the
7900 X for the same task so great use
case for it now how many people do this
type of work probably probably not that
many in our audience but hopefully this
opens some eyes as to the question of
what
how do I do with 16 cores why do I even
care about that processor they see this
question and it's generally because
they're not good for gaming so you look
at it I mean they can game but value
wise it's not a good value and that's
because they're not built for gaming as
we've been saying they're built for
things like this so this is the
real-world use case of where you are
most efficient with something like a
high thread-count processor and of
course you use your cheaper stuff for
playing games because the value
propositions are so much better but yeah
hopefully that opens eyes as always you
