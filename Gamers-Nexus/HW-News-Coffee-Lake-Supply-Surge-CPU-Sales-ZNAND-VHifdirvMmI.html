hardware news recap for the past week we
have a couple things talked about one of
them is that we're doing a lot of
roundups for this week primarily
focusing on recapping our coverage for
the past year basically putting all the
data together into one compilation and
then hopefully guiding you to the most
appropriate purchases for your system
building needs so expect a lot of those
for the next couple days or so one of
them will be hosted by builds I'd in the
immediate future about am for
motherboard so that'll be a good one
other than that news in the industry
Intel's got a lot of stuff going on
right now they are trying to keep up
with coffee-like demand so they're
spinning up a new plant in China G
skills got 44 hundred megahertz memory
Firefox quantum came out Samsung has new
zine and SSDs and then there's some
stuff on Intel obtained as well before
getting to that this content is brought
to you by the Thermaltake flow RGB
closed-loop liquid cooler which is a
three hundred sixty millimeter radiator
plus three 120 fans that are RGB
illuminated if then we'll take it rain
fans at that this is a 4.5 gen a stack
pump which is one of the faster pumps
you can learn more at the link in the
description below for the first news
item several the CPUs that we included
an our CPU Awards show the other day are
actually on sale right now at least in
the US the thread Ripper 1950 X that we
listed as one of the most important CPUs
of the year is currently $800 so it's
marked down about 20% from its usual
$1000 price and the other r7 and our
five CPUs are also on sale so the r5
1600 and 1600 X which we assigned the
best overall value award for the year
are currently about 190 dollars down
from the usual price point the r7 17
100x is around 270 though some folks
didn't point out that Micro Center had
it as low as just like 210 bucks or
something like that so the reason Andy
can do this if you're wondering is
because of the multi chip module layout
of Rison all the rise in CPUs including
thread Ripper use the same Zeppelin dies
so they actually use a smaller die and
then as we discussed over the year they
have interconnects which AMD calls
infinity
fabric between them so Andy is basically
placing multiple chips on the substrate
on the package and their smaller chips
so they're cheaper to make they have
higher yields you can fit more of them
per wafer and that contributes to the
cost and because of this MCM design Andy
makes a single CPU piece of silicon and
they put that on the r3s they put it on
the r5 r7s the thread Ripper CPUs all
the way up the line and then they just
sort of fuse off cores or maybe some
cores failed validation things like that
and that's what gets your product
segmentation with thread wrapper there
are four of them and two of them are
basically active so the other two are
more or less sort of silicon substrate
interposers so to speak to create a
mountain resistance so that's why the
CPUs can drop so much in price because
if you imagine a $120 r3 CPU is the same
components aside from some fusing
differences or whatever validation
differences as the r7 CPU is maybe some
bending differences you can see that
there's a lot of margin there which
would explain why the prices are so good
right now and competitive and on sale so
you can check the link below if you want
to find those we have a short news
article with all the sales and links to
them if you're in the u.s. so first for
the website news we're gonna have a
couple of articles that will be
published only on the site and won't
make it to the YouTube channel for the
next week or two so make sure you check
gamers Nexus dotnet for those and that
will include a cherry keyboard review
we've also got some roundups on monitors
the best monitors that you can kind of
buy in various categories right now and
roundups on SSDs that will be hitting
the website not sure if they'll make do
YouTube will try though we do have
motherboard roundups and cooler roundups
GPUs all come in to the YouTube channel
very shortly though for the first real
news item Intel is beginning coffee lake
assembly and testing out a new plant in
China so this is obviously addressing
the huge issue of not being able to
really buy 8000 series chips including
the 8700 K and 8600 K especially which
we still haven't been able to get ahold
of though I've wanted it for
while now for testing so to ease some of
the constricted supply and prices
hopefully Intel has added a location in
Chengdu China to test and assemble the
i7 8700 K 8700 the i5 8600 K and I think
also the 8400 not sure if the i3 s will
be there but I sevens and i-5 s for sure
the processes will be identical to that
of the assembly line that already exists
which is in Malaysia and most of coffee
leak has come from there so far so from
what Intel says the China made CPUs
should be shipping around December 15th
if not slightly before then so hopefully
supply eases around that point kind of
kind of very close to missing the boat
on holiday season for Intel but
hopefully that helps out a bit and
hopefully the prices drop because most
recent check I did was $420 for an i7
8700 K on nuoc which is sort of
upsetting because it's actually really
competitive at the initial rough 370
dollar price range but at 420 it's
getting kind of up there so hopefully
this helps out another news item from
Intel octane 3d crosspoint dims will be
arriving in second half of 2018 so this
was a presentation at the USB global
press conference we actually talked into
all about these obtain dims months ago
first half of the year right after
Computex
but we were embargoed for a long time on
those it looks like they're finally
making some movement so the octane dims
use the proprietary memory that Intel's
been talking about for a while now but
it will fit in a dim slot mechanically
and electrically the octane dims will be
compatible with ddr4 slots which is
really interesting motherboards will
probably have to make some updates at
least on a BIOS level if not elsewhere
to accommodate the obtain dims but
electrically and mechanically they
should be good to go so this is where I
think it's a lot more interesting in its
initial deployment obtained as a memory
technology on the small SSDs use as a
cache drive to us was pretty unexcited
seemed like the the problem Intel was
trying to solve there was one that
doesn't really exist for our audience
it's kind of a problem of slow
transaction time slow responsiveness
from using a hard drive which really
that's that's more an issue for like the
best buy five hundred four hundred
dollar machine that someone's
grandparent buys so it didn't help a lot
for the enthusiast audience that just
you just buy an SSD did not help much
there but obtain memory it looks more
interesting so we'll keep an eye on it
that's second half initially the dims
are headed for server and enterprise
where big data is obviously more
important and then we know that the dims
will not be jeddak compliance on the
onset but they predict 3d crosspoint
ballooning somewhere to an eight billion
dollar market by 2021
so as time goes on it looks like Intel
thinks opting it's going to work its way
into consumer and more relevant ways for
our audience the next news item is also
about memory types this one is Samsung's
zine and the Samsung zine and will
somewhat replace the old and now rare
SLC NAND or single-level cell and we
actually have a full video on what these
acronyms and initialisms mean you're
curious about how NAND works you can
check out that video full with
animations to learn more Xena and
intense reduced latency below the levels
claims by Intel obtain memory it's
keeping intel's of focus on latency but
driving it further Xena and also will
start its drives with the sz9 85 which
is an 800 gigabyte competitor to the
Intel op 10 P 4800 X the sz9 85
advertises 750,000 random read IOPS with
an advertised 3.2 gigabyte per second
bandwidth these are both impressive
numbers that are highly competitive with
Intel things look a little less
competitive for the 985 when you look at
the write speeds where compared to Intel
solution it's an advertised 175 thousand
IOPS versus Intel's 550 this isn't a
consumer product just like the high-end
octane Enterprise Drive is not a
consumer product but once again you
should probably see it work its way down
to us eventually
next news item is on cases so case Labs
has their Magnum case the SMA 8 that
one's been around for a while for them
but they've just refreshed it with some
new design elements so if you're not
familiar with case labs they're a bit of
a premier manufacturer which when I tell
you the price of the SMA 8 you'll
probably agree it's looking like $600
though it's an expensive case the case
is targeted at these sort of enthusiasts
who would do a full custom dual loop or
something like that I suppose you could
build like a small home server in there
and have a pretty good one but the SMA 8
is going to be updated now with
additional cable and tube routing
options it's got some more cable clamps
and USB type-c more drive cages and also
case lighting that effectively amounts
to a light box on the bottom of the case
so that's a that's that's a new way to
do it haven't seen that deployment of
light in a case yet it's not unicorn
colors and strobing so who knows if
it'll be picked up by the wider market
Firefox has a new version quantum this
week
Mozilla released the newest version of
Firefox out of beta to combat Google
Chrome with a renewed vigor and the most
newsworthy aspect of its release is the
touted memory usage it's 30% less than
Chrome according to firefox so anyone
who likes a lot of tabs probably time to
move over to this one or at least
considered it quantum is also allegedly
beating chrome in browser speed tests
that we haven't confirmed these numbers
for ourselves in a bid to leapfrog
Corsair g.skill is now laying claim to
the throne when it comes to the world's
fastest 32 gigabyte ddr4 kits on the
night Corsair said they had about a week
or two ago the numbers are coming in at
forty 400 megahertz with timings of CL
19 19 19 and 19 at 39 like Corsair the
memory modules are made using prebend
Sam's on ICS Corsair recently suggested
that their memory kit should only be
used with prebend coffee like CPUs
something we'll be talking about very
soon and g.skill echo is a similar
sentiment memory overclocked this high
on her
we're like coffee lake really isn't that
practical that's not to say coffee like
can't do it in fact it's one of the few
CDs that can the problem is you enter
territory where now you're bidding for
the IMC in addition to probably the core
because you you don't want a great IMC
in a bad core that you get stuck at four
point nine or four point eight or
something so it adds a lot of cost adds
a lot of challenges we've spent the last
several days working on memory
benchmarking and it's not trivial to get
it working so it's cool but just keep in
mind that if you actually want to buy
something like this there's a lot of
work involved in getting it to work next
one cooler master cooler master is
adding RGB to their ML 240 and 120 l
closed-loop liquid coolers this is
joining the RGB party a bit late but
they're making it there and the company
released the master liquid ml 240 L and
120 l RGB versions with six different
effects through an RGB controller it's
also compatible with integrated
controllers if you prefer those from
various motherboard vendors including
asrock Asus MSI and gigabytes and both
models support the latest AM for socket
from AMD and should be available the
fact of immediately the ML 240 L will go
for $70 while the smaller 120 will go
for 60 making these some of the cheapest
if not might be the cheapest coolers of
comparable sizes with RGB support on the
market we haven't tested those but I
think we might be planning to test one
of the non RGB ones which would have the
same performance finally Corsair has
their mlpro RGB series fans leave these
have been in the news for a little bit
now but we haven't really talked about
them these are based on Corsairs
magnetic levitation fan tech that
they've been using for a little while
now for the uninitiated this bearing
creates a magnetic field so that the
bearing and the fan shaft have little to
no surface contact which results in less
friction thereby reducing noise and
increasing reliability the new mlpro RGB
fans will have four zones from which
light will emanate and will integrate
into any of course there's lighting
products including the node pro or
commander Pro the fans are supposed to
be 120 and 140 in sizes and have
interchangeable rubber corners taking a
page out of
the knock to a book recently the 120
option is a range of 400 to 1600 rpm
while the 140 runs 400 1200 and they're
going to be expensive
$35 for the mlpro 120 and $40 for the
140 variant both of which have a
five-year warranty so that's all for
