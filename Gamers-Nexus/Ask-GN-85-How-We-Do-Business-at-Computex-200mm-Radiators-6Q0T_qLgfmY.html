after coffee tax and we're doing a quick
copy text rapid-fire ask GN format we've
got another patreon task GN as always
and good at patreon.com slash gamers
Nexus page to gain access to that one
it'll have a couple of extra questions
some of which pertain to combi text and
how we set up and then we're planning to
do a full normal format in depth that's
Jen as well see if we shoot that here
once we get home though so anyway we're
in Japan now and we'll have some content
online some of our patreon or otherwise
or just YouTube if you want to see stuff
from this trip for the first question so
these all came through Twitter before
that this video is brought to you by
EVGA and the X 299 dark motherboard for
the Intel high-end desktop CPUs the X
299 dark is one of the only motherboards
on the market with proper vrm cooling
we've tested this and found a
significant performance increase over
those without active cooling on the BRMS
this board was used in our recent
attempt to set a top-10 record in fire
strike and you can learn more about the
x-29 dark at the link in the description
below so the first question these call
came in from Twitter this time first one
was from El Jefe 0 for 2
who said did fantex snub you guys I'm
optimistic about the evolve X but before
I commit to buy I'd like to see it run
through GN thermal tests we fantex was
unable to accommodate a meeting after
multiple attempts we are planning on
purchasing the case ourselves once it
comes out because it got a lot of hype
and I'd like to see why so we did not
see it in person we tried to get a
meeting with them a couple of times and
they were unable to accommodate one and
so we plan to purchase one of the cases
basically is what it comes down to if
you have any other cases you'd like it's
like us to look at let us know below if
we missed anything from the show we saw
a lot of stuff but it's not possible to
see everything and not every vendor is
able to make time for us so yeah we saw
that we saw a coverage of the case I
didn't personally watch any of it
I barely know what it looks like but I
know that I got a whole lot of
sensationalize sensationalized titles on
youtube so I guess that means it's worth
purchasing I'm looking at and next
question 80 81 37 where's fan tax unable
to accommodate a meeting a useless
philosopher says were there any vendors
or manufacturers there
who completely snubbed you or refused to
give an interview does it seem like the
industry is moving towards better
customer service in general first
question refer to previous - I guess
they I don't know I'm not gonna use the
word snubbed like three out of three
viewable views but certainly unable to
accommodate us second question does this
industry seem like it's better customer
service in general if you mean like in
terms of interactions with literal
customers it's hard to say because
people like Eva J for example they put
out a thing where they increased their
warranty period by quite a lot an extra
two years on top of ten years so I guess
that's an increase in customer service
other vendors have also been moving more
towards focusing on some customer
service improvements but in terms of
media relations I'd say nothing's really
changed it's pretty much the same as
it's always been which overall is
agreeable right now so we don't we don't
necessarily need a ton of changes I'd
say the biggest thing on the media
relations side is that it seems like
companies now are moving more and more
towards dealing with influencers rather
than tech media and so they don't quite
understand the relationship anymore when
we show up and they think that it's a
completely different type of interaction
in some instances then it should be
where we're here to report on a product
you know we don't charge to be at the
booth we're just asking about the
product so we can report on it because
the thing we get out of being there is
the coverage not being paid to be there
because we're not a marketing arm so
that's probably the thing that's
changing the most in the industry right
now I think some companies just don't
quite understand what a traditional
technical media outlet does anymore but
we do try to keep everyone informed on
why we're present at a particular booth
and what our plans are on things like
that and then we just cover it and push
it to web that's really that's the whole
point isn't it is to cover the stuff
from a reporting standpoint not to be a
marketing arm so customer service yes
I'd say some companies are pushing as
always it's not really a big surprise
really that people are trying to improve
customer service media relations are a
bit odd at times but otherwise unchanged
the bold man is the next one says how
much work goes into editing each video
for events like combi tax I think you
guys did a segment a couple years ago
about your mobile editing setup has that
changed at all
it's actually
most of the work is on the ground going
to the different venues so all the real
work is before the event where we have
to coordinate logistics basically look
at where each company is at the venue
because they're not all in the same
place or the same floor or whatever and
make sure when we're at company a the
next meeting which is often minutes away
is somewhere within walking distance so
that we can min max our time spent in
each quadrant of the show and we had
four people present at Computex 2018 so
we had two teams of two and we have
basically sometimes split into into even
smaller teams but generally two teams of
two going around and try to sort of
screen some of the boots were unsure of
what they'll have and then figure out if
we want to actually go there and shoot a
video or if it's more deserving of
something like a news roundup or if
they're just completely wasting our time
which is also a possibility I show like
copy tech some vendors for example
really only have stuff like a new retail
box not really worth my time to go see
so we try to screen that stuff as far as
editing editing the videos that Computex
takes a lot less time than at home base
when we're doing stuff like reviews that
takes hours of editing and shooting and
then potentially days of testing
whereas Computex you're kind of in and
out of meetings within an hour for sure
sometimes even shorter than that the pan
if we had a team like a recon team ahead
of me and then the actual editing
process we try to be as quick as
possible we were uploading videos every
four hours during the show for the first
two days so I think that pretty much
gives you an idea but we the quality
still high it's just these videos are
much much shorter than reviews and
mobile editing setup we're in three
laptops as primary work machines then
two sets of camera gear next question
Jason Christoph says why no review of
the see sonic cable bar it looks sick
well see sonic we talked some before the
show they wanted to meet up I said I
need to know what you have in order to
go to the booth because it's really
expensive to go to Computex we don't
charge to visit booths so I have to make
sure I can actually do a video or cover
something if we visit and they said
we're gonna have any retail box they do
not tell us about the cable master bar
so we didn't see it also it's a cable
management bar I'm sure it's very
interesting but we don't want we don't
do reviews of things at show as we do
just like a
use video on it it's not never a proper
review and to its calebheart so I don't
know maybe we'll look at it later but
doesn't seem inherently all that
complicated and I'm sure you can get
what you need out of another video next
one beta for pres do you think it's
worth going to Computex that is other
than being your job of course I think
it's certainly worth going to for us
it's fun to be in Taipei and surrounding
areas like we're in Japan now is noted
which has made much much easier by going
to Taiwan first because it's basically
put it in perspective it's about 24
hours for us to get from home to Taiwan
total a little bit less coming back and
that's a lot of it's a lot of torture
being on planes that long but yeah it's
worth it it's it's a fun place to be in
Taipei and the show itself is pretty fun
being very competitive makes it a lot of
fun for me personally just because I
like to be there on the ground and see
how much stuff we can do how quickly and
competently but as far as going as a
consumer unless you're already local I'd
say no because that's a really expensive
thing to do if you're not local and it's
a very far journey potentially if you're
nearby though yeah it's worth it same
goes for CES next question md grump says
jet lag tricks the the only trick is
book your flights as best you can so we
landed about 6:30 p.m. in taiwan which
means we don't have the fight stay awake
that long before we can go to bed and
that pretty much fights most the jetlag
otherwise just hits you at random times
j from j's two cents landed early in the
morning on his whole first day he forced
himself to stay awake so he's you'll see
them pretty tired in that first EVGA
cheap HQ video and that's why next one
general roger says do you typically
stick to a set schedule of what you're
going to cover how easy is it to deviate
from the original plan if you see
something unexpected or interesting
pretty easy that's why we have two teams
the first two days our back-to-back
meetings non-stop so there's really not
time for launch or anything we try to
get food in the morning go to the show
cover events non-stop throughout the the
first however many eight hours or so
that the show is open and then that's
basically it's all editing from there
and as far as deviating from the
schedule we can do it we try to keep an
eye out for things that you all tweet to
us always be sure to tweet
interesting stuff to us during the show
but it just kind of depends on what day
so we always try to leave some time open
for for that for finding things that we
did not schedule for it's not every
vendor will talk about it like the see
sonic cable management part but I didn't
hear about that till too late Batman or
nine with the influx of two hundred
millimeter fans and cases are we're
going to see two hundred millimeter fans
and radiators rather to match either for
a IO or custom loops the answer is yes
cooler masters working on two hundred
millimeter radiator as we speak and
we'll see how it does really curious
about that because two hundred
millimeter fans are not inherently good
for a static pressure they they really
don't push very hard
next one William four or five nine so
forth says how did this year compared to
other years some of the coverage I saw
mentioned that there were fewer finished
products and more prototypes for
products that have been shown at CES or
last year's Computex one opinion was
that the lack of new GPUs worse or
anything down that's really interesting
so lack of GPS does actually impact the
industry because these smaller companies
have told us that their sales and their
performance as a company actually
somewhat hinges on CBO and GB launches
because that's when people build new
computers so if you make cases and
that's all you make and you're a small
company and no one's buying new systems
because memory is too expensive GPUs
aren't out CPUs are not that interesting
or something like that then it impacts
them a lot and they don't have a new
product to show us results of it so yeah
that does impact it the show is OK
overall there was a lot of really
interesting stuff but you had to work to
find it we had to sort of create the
interesting content by really working
hard with the vendors to say no ok we
get it
cut through all the show us the
thing that's actually unique and that
takes work it takes really knowing who
you're talking to when you show up at
the booth and knowing how to cut them
off when it's time to cut them off and
talk about the thing that we're able to
identify as actually interesting for the
audience and basically tell them shelve
all the other stuff maybe another time
so it is possible to find interesting
stuff but you have to be a bit of a jerk
sometimes and just you know stop the
conversation because otherwise they're
going to show you all this stuff that's
totally uninteresting to anyone and
really at the end of the day we know
what the audience wants to see so we'll
cover it and figure it out a couple more
crackling nice one can normies go if you
need to buy a ticket how much
does it cost I actually don't know how
large is it seeing a booth at a time
doesn't give me to give much scope so
for how much it is don't know for comi
Tech CES is 100 bucks for quote norm
Hayes and they only open the last day I
think for non credentialed visitors to
non exhibitors non-media it's not super
common to see non credential people
attending but we'll see a bit of it on
the last day typically and it's worth it
if you're local as noted in the other
answer as far as how large it is it's
pretty damn large so I think CES for
comparison is something like 2 million
square feet for the Convention Center
plus basically every single hotel on the
strip and so we need about an hour just
to get between meetings to make sure we
get from A to B in time Computex Izzie
is here it's all in one giant convention
center it's like six stories and it's
six stories of huge convention center so
there'll be I don't even know dozens
like probably approaching 100 booths per
floor so it gives you some idea I think
I don't have a square footage but dozens
of booths per floor and next one EVGA
underscore Jacob F that's I don't know
maybe that is interesting did you ever
sleep question mark no not really
david fw 55.5 I was pretty darn
important to go out there but as it's a
crucial or as is a crucial event on the
calendar but the very long flights and
all do you actually have time to enjoy
the events itself as a whole or is it
more of a necessary evil so to speak so
yeah we get to enjoy it it is definitely
a lot of work kind of answered part of
this and the other question but I don't
know I like it and we go for a long
period of time to make up for those
flights so we've been out here for like
two weeks that's why we go for so long
because it's 48 total hours of planes
and airports to get here and back so
yeah we try to stretch it out for that
reason and I think that's all of them
yes that is all the Twitter rapid-fire
