our last day I've hacked a 20-17 I'm
joined by Chris working on dollars it's
design director is that correct that's
correct absolutely
let's do it quick I'll bring everyone up
to speed
dauntless if you are not familiar I'll
make a really easy Monster Hunter
comparison they obviously are different
in a lot of ways but if you have wanted
to play mops or hunter on PC this is
kind of the thing we would push you
toward we just did a quick demo Chris
also first used for the elevator pitch
overview of dauntless sure so don't list
is a free-to-play PC game coming in the
action hunting genre where players
cooperatively can get your friends
together be awesome go on two islands in
the shattered Isles fight giant behemoth
perhaps awesome armor weapons and
ultimately hopefully save humanity
saving humanity is always against the
head for the most part so we fought two
monsters a moment ago or but he missed
or whatever they may be called there was
a strike right and then was it hangar
hangar okay so can you tell me about
those sure so strike is one of the
behemoths that we'd have fairly early in
the encounter kind of a giant bear and
owl together kind of vicious likes to
rip things up line around really really
the challenging encounter I would say
but not nearly as much as Bhangarh who
is our philosophy teammates that we're
demoing a pack this year much bigger
much badder
representatively the broth element and
putting in a bad state if you're not
careful and so there are different
elements how do the elements work for
the monsters so we haven't revealed all
elements yet but we're showing here
we've got a lightning behemoth a
frosting Hemus and we've kind of seized
ember main on our site which is a plain
behemoth and as you'd expect there's
some elemental strengths to weaknesses
that players will be able to use on
their armored weapon and in terms of
gameplay so there's a normal attack and
dodges combos
like that which by the way the tumble in
the demo is actually functional which I
was really happy about often yeah other
than that what about weak points on
monsters things like I like the tail on
hang gar what can you tell me about that
absolutely so each of our behemoths
individually has different parts you're
seeing several Bowl locations here so
cutting a tail off either the panga or
the drafts will change up that encounter
and players will be able to experience
sometimes it makes it easier sometimes a
little more challenging especially if it
triggers a rage on them but eventually
and not in this demo but as we move
towards beta players will use those
parts in crafting awesome weapons and
weapons and armor that they'll need for
the next encounters so is there a
central hub for players after the
encounter yes so we have Ramsgate which
is our central city hub we haven't
revealed too much about that yet but it
will be the hub for Slayers socially
crafting quests everything you would
need to do in between the various hunts
that you go on and what are the plans in
terms of I guess there were four
character classes I think we had here
can you walk me through those sure so we
don't have any specific classes for
dauntless so everything is derived from
a combination of weapons and armor so
the characters you're seeing here were
made specifically for the demo to kind
of show off what we can do with our
character creator but there will be full
character creation and then what you can
earn on the islands of what you craft is
what you know you're going to have and
it what will influence your fight very
cool so for all that more where can
folks go to learn more about dauntless
absolutely so you can find us on social
media at play dauntless and play
dauntless calm and you can look forward
to or open beta coming this fall pull
links in the description below for more
information if you want to find those
sites and our own article coverage of
the game Chris thank you for joining me
my pleasure and good luck we'll see you
all next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
