the child of a partnership between a
Messiaen coarser cost $750 as a bit
different from the gtx 1080 hybrid that
we were talking about shortly for this
card Corsair provides the cooler in 855
cooler with some slight modifications
and MSI provides the board and access to
Nvidia for the GPU itself and as far as
these two cards we'll be comparing them
directly in a very soon to come video
before we get into the content and the
review this content is brought to you by
iBUYPOWER and their element gaming PC
which comes with the arc LED fans under
glow for neon effect on the system and a
large tempered glass side window let's
get into the content first off we tore
down the hydro graphics in another video
it's already on the channel the teardown
process involves a handful of screws for
the back plate that reveals ultimately
that this is an MSI low-end card that's
been outfitted with a CPU cooler for
liquid cooling and the corsair cooler
does not use a protrusion for the cold
plate like EVGA is does but does appear
to be flat rather than curved like most
CPU coolers cold plates are they've not
really got that slight concave Bend to
them that accommodates the IHS and the
hotspots on a CPU what you don't want
for GPUs because the silicon is flat and
no curvature is required the board is a
Founders Edition board with a 5 plus 1
phase VRM but a backplate has been added
in addition to the liquid cooler Corsair
uses a radial blower fan for the cooler
solution of course aren't MSI since it
is basically a Founders Edition cooler
other than the liquid and that's
something we'll talk about more in our
upcoming EVGA hybrid versus Seahawk /
hydrographics coverage for specs it's
the same thing as any other gtx 1088
gigabytes of gddr5 xgp 104 - 400 GPU and
all of that which comes with the GP 104
400 GPU but the clock is pre overclocked
to 1847 megahertz about the same as the
MSI GTX 1080 gaming X and that's a
reasonable gain over the founders
Edition 17 33 megahertz
used note that MSI pre applies the
overclock mode to this reviewer card but
it will ship to consumers in gaming mode
and that can be changed with BIOS
updates or with the software that comes
with the card so for today we're
benchmarking the thermals most
extensively obviously it's mostly a
thermal solution here and we'll be
comparing that against our 1080 hybrid
that we built different from this one
but using the same CPU GPU CLC so you
can check that content out previously
we'll be comparing those two directly
for now this card came in today as we
were about to start filming this video
so we haven't tested it just yet I mean
the plastics still on there but today
we're looking at this card almost
exclusively will be doing thermals games
and overclocking starting with thermals
our tests consist of peak average
thermals using delta T over ambient and
of endurance thermals that represent the
GPU diode temperature only this helps us
to find thermal throttle points and
clock rate instability as correlated in
our versus time charts let's start with
the peak average thermals the GTX 1080
hydrographics lands first among the
high-end Pascal GPUs in a good way at
eighteen point five Celsius delta T over
ambient load and this plants corsair and
msi the amalgam ahead of our DIY hybrid
that we built a few weeks ago this used
the EVGA cooler and a less official
implementation of that EVGA cooler our
version of the GTX tennety hybrid the GN
hybrid operates at 18.66 Celsius so it's
0.16 C warmer and has a lower clock rate
than the Corsair card which of course
also impacts Heat we believe that part
of the difference comes from the
implementation we use longer screws that
weren't really meant for it and that has
imperfect mounting pressure applied as a
result and we also rendered the blower
fan mostly useless by sacking the shroud
and so neighboring components get warmer
but we'll see how that does in a soon
become test for reference the founders
Edition GT X 1080 operates at around 50
7.51 Celsius delta T / ambience a swing
of about 39 C and that's with a higher
clock on the hydro graphics card here's
the temperature overtime plot this shows
the same data but plotted over time and
demonstrates our automated test
execution kicking off the load test at
the same point for all cards this is
mostly used for internal data
integrity and validation that helps
provide a look at ramp up time for each
of the cards looking at our unique
endurance charts this chart shows
frequency versus temperature and time
plotted over a two hour burnin period
the clock rate is fairly tamed for the
first 90 minutes with the average
frequency range at about plus or minus
80 megahertz depending on boost and
other factors later we start seeing hard
drops to 215 megahertz and that's with
an advanced cooling solution on the
hydro graphics so it's clearly not a
thermal issue we've seen this behavior
on a couple of Pascal GPUs thus far and
it always starts to happen around the
same 90 to 100 minute mark at this point
the clock rate will occasionally for a
one-second period
drop to 215 megahertz from the near 2
gigahertz mark previously one second
prior we've reached out to Nvidia to ask
about this anomaly and more depth as it
is occurring somewhat regularly on
Pascal in this instance it's not a
thermal throttle obviously and likely
power or boost functionality and video
has informed us thus far that this is
partly normal boost functionality but
we're waiting for further feedback to
understand better why this happened on
some cards and not others on the whole
though Nvidia basically says not all
their cards are created equal especially
with GP Boo's 3.0 and that we would need
a much larger sample size to get a
proper idea of what's going on but
that's what the chart shows for now
anyway for power consumption and noise
tests check the article linked in the
description below where we've got the
full depth on everything for now let's
go into FPS charts all our methodology
again is defined in that article linked
in the description below if you're
curious about how we test you've used
some helpful videos are also embedded
which include 1% and 0.1% low
definitions starting with Mirror's Edge
catalyst we see the Corsair
hydrographics topping the single card
charts at 51 FPS average for 4k high
with a 42 fps and 38 fps 1% in 0.1
percent lows respectively as usual we
see the biggest improvement over SLI in
the form of low values the MSI GTX 1080
gaming X clocked the same performs
nearly identical e to the hydro graphics
which is again a board made by MSI for
the Seahawk in some games we may see
some difference in FPS thanks to
improved thermal solution that helps
sustain a flatter clock rate for longer
even though the clock is to the same
spec this is something we discuss in our
tight next hybrid results at 1440p were
seeing 95 FPS on the hydrographics with
slightly favored lows over the gaming X
card founders edition 1080 is running at
89 FPS with a 1070 cards in the 72 FPS
range at 1080p as expected this is no
trouble for any of these devices at
least not until the 960 and 460 which
run below 60 FPS average the
hydrographic sits at 139 average with
low as minimally at 77 fps and with the
1080 game index at 137 FPS average or
nearly 74 fps 0.1% lowest the founders
edition card is at 135 FPS average
that's a difference of 4 FPS from the
hydrographics or a change of about 2.6
percent
moving on to GTA 5 we see the
hydrographics performing at 59 FPS
average with 4k ultra settings with lows
of 46 fps and 43.7 FPS that plants the
corsair and msi card just above the
amazon 1080 gaming x at 58 point 3 FPS
average and with imperceptibly slower
low FPS the eff e card sits at 56 FPS
average or a change of about 5% to the
hydrographics one step down the 1070
gaming X sits at 47 FPS average with
significantly lower 0.1% lower values
moving to 1080p GTA 5 the hydrographics
is capable of pushing about 135 FPS
average with tightly times lows 1080p
gaming act sits at 129 at 7 FPS or a
change of about 4 percent and the GT X
1080 EFI clocks at 125 FPS average so
we're starting to bump up against the
CPU limit in some instances with this
test black ops 3 is a vendor neutral
title that tends to show some favor
toward Andy just the way it was
optimized at 4k high we're seeing the
GTX 1080 hydrographics perform at about
73 FPS average with lows that are mostly
in step with the msi 1080 gaming acts
they're marginally reduced as a result
of boost clock functionality during this
particular title but the hydrographics
does maintain about a 1 FPS lead that's
really all we can expect from two cards
on the same silicon at this point in
this particular title crossfire and SLI
configurations will outperform the
single 1080 hydrographics although with
disproportionately lower
per sentence 0.1% level metrics at 1440p
we see the hydrographics pushing 143 FPS
just at the 144 Hertz point for FPS
players you care about that and with
high sustained low metrics 1080 gaming X
is about 1 to 2 percent slower with a
gtx 10a TFE a full 8 FPS or 5.7 percent
slower 1080p is a little unnecessary to
test again but we're doing it anyway
because so much of the market is still
on 1080p with high settings we've still
got room to go up to extra as well but
we're pushing 212 FPS out the gate
average with high settings and the 1080
gaming X is just behind the EFI is
showing roughly a 5% change as with
previous tests moving on to ashes this
will be our last fps benchmark before
overclocking results check the article
link to the description below for
additional benchmark games including
Metro Mordor and the division first
looking at average millisecond latency
between frames the coarser hydrographics
is chart-topping and ashes of the
singularity for its average latency in
DX 12 posting 12 point nine nine
milliseconds between frames the MSI
gaming X sits at thirteen point one nine
milliseconds with Fe card at thirteen
point three eight crossfire Rx for ATS
are the next trailing configuration at
thirteen point eight eight milliseconds
average in DX twelve but with way worse
dx11 frame time is partially an artifact
of multi-gpu looking instead at FPS the
1080 hydrographics at 1080p is posting
seventy six point nine five FPS average
for DX 12 25 fps a gain over DX 11
performance the same scaling is shown
for the 1080 Fe though that card is
about two FPS lower on average than the
hydrographics moving to 4k high and
ashes shows the hydrographics just above
60 FPS average at 62 203 the 1080 gaming
X is a couple FPS slower at fifty nine
point six FPS average with the crossfire
cards but in between the FeO and the
gaming X again for more game benchmarks
check the article linked in the
description below and now that we've
gone through the basics of these we're
gonna go through some of the
overclocking so for that if you want to
see that methodology
again down below it's a lot of words so
how can I go through it in every single
video overclocking methodology is
basically the same as it's always been
for us we're using manual tuning rather
than scan it with C it just doesn't work
well for what we're trying to do here's
a look at our overclock stepping chart
for the GTX 1080
hydrographics we ultimately landed at
twenty one twenty six megahertz peak
core clock that's the max with an
average baseline of about twenty fifty
megahertz reliably the core offset was
stable at plus one seventy-five
megahertz with a fairly sizable memory
overclock as shown here power target
only gets offset by five percent on this
particular card so 105 percent is your
max and GPU v core seems to peak at one
point oh five volts here's a look at the
FPS impact we're seeing a couple FPS
maximally in some titles shadow of
mordor and mirrors edge being two of
them but that's about it the card is
mostly at its limit out of the box
despite an increased range with the
overclock that's so much the performance
we've seen with every other 1080 thus
far part of this limit comes down to
power again 105 percent offset there's
not a lot of room for extra power draw
that's permissible anyway through the
software and without volt mahad and hard
mods and then part of it is v bios can't
really increase voltage with these cards
it just doesn't work and the max we're
getting is 1.0 5 volts so not a huge
push on that with the overclocking
support at $750 Corsair an msi are
certainly asking a lot for the hydro
graphics or the Seahawk if you prefer
it's not unreasonable given the price of
the founders Edition card which kind of
shakes up the market a bit in some ways
that we don't necessarily agree with but
prices should fall eventually this
though is certainly a value-add it's an
extra $50 or so over the founders
edition card so it's asking more money
but you're getting the liquid cooler
with it as I understand it this thing
should fall out about 7:30 so we'll be
looking at this shortly but strictly
speaking to this card performance is
about the same as every other GTX 1080
as one would expect this is not news to
any GPU or architecture they pretty much
perform within a few percent of each
other until you really get into extreme
overclock and that's just because the
silicon is exactly the same naturally
so FPS out of the box is more or less
the same this is technically the
chart-topper it is the best performer on
the charts right now for single graphics
card configurations and power management
and v bios limitations for this
generation do seem to somewhat
invalidate some of the higher and
fancier boards like the custom PCBs and
higher-end VRMs things like that so
Coursera and Imus are getting away just
fine with the sort of bare-bones vrm and
PCB for this setup because they're not
targeting hard mods volt mods extreme
overclockers folks like that so if
you're not one of those people the
configuration here is pretty much fine
there is some certainly some power
limitation but it's hard to be too mad
about a 20 50 megahertz offs or
overclock total 175 megahertz offset
it's not as good as our founders Edition
card that we overclocked and especially
not as good as it after we applied
liquid to it we were able to hit 21
something 21 68 I believe megahertz with
a peak of 2200 - that was unstable at
that point so not quite there but that
seems consistent with a lot of these 10
80s that are not the the sample that we
got initially it must have been a good
sample overall thermally this is far and
away superior to all the other cards
we've looked at right now it's very
close to the DIY hybrid we built which
leads me to believe it should be very
close to this competition will be really
tight between the two cards depending on
even the EVGA implementation outside of
what we did their solution may be better
than what we saw previously but it is a
higher overclock as well it's actually a
little bit higher than this card pre
overclocked though if you're changing
the settings anyway it doesn't really
matter what it comes stocked because
that's easily made up for the hydro
graphics is undeniably the highest
performer of the single GP is currently
on the bench including the MSI GTX 1080
gaming decks that we previously tested
start performing the founders edition
card by about 5 to 6 percent most games
stock further validating our statement
that the reference designs from both
Andy and Nvidia are generally best
foregone by consumers in this market the
next thing for you to do is to wait for
this review should be coming out very
shortly now that we finally have one
it'll be an interesting battle for sure
$750 I don't think is unfair but I think
it's a bit too much on average and I
felt the same way about the $700 card so
I would wait a little while hopefully
these fall on price a bit something in
the 700 to 730 range does feel better
750 is pushing it a bit much for me
personally of course your mileage may
vary
depending on how much money you have so
that's kind of the basics of it if you
want more depth as always the article
will cover it the thermals are of course
the most interesting check back for more
on that with this one the differences
between these two will be discussed in
that content so thank you for watching
