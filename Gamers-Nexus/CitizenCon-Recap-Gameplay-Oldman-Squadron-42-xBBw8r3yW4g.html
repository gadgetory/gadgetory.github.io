dotnet and we've got some star citizen
and squadron 42 coverage for you this
video is looking at the citizen Con 2015
event which had chris Roberts and team
showcasing the new squadron 42 Hollywood
cast the star citizen alpha 2 point 0
impending launch which Chris in his
demonstration said something to the tune
of i'm not giving dates because
everybody gives me shit for dates so it
will be coming within the area of and
the crowd interrupted them and suggested
the word soon so Chris went was soon so
the update is coming soon with no date
this time probably a good thing and
other than this information we saw a
demo of the multi crew that was
functional we saw EVN or zero gravity
propulsion from your spacesuit between
ships and satellites and things like
that and then got some information on
the squadron 42 cast which is the single
player version or single player
accompaniment to star citizen definitely
an important thing that's been fairly
undiscussed up until this point the
b-roll I'm showing you is primarily from
the demonstration it shows the star
citizen 2 point 0 alpha and its new
features including a functional multi
crew alongside the constellation
demonstrating a multi crew combat where
some players are Manning the turrets
others are pilots and things of that
nature there's also a Hornet pilot which
is a single crew fighter ship and we
later see that player eject from the
Hornet and then EV a or transit in space
suit flight from their ship to a comm
satellite and that satellite is
deactivated in space their mission was
to reactivate the satellite which is
what we see going on here and that's
done by navigating through a series of
very Star Trek Geordi LaForge like tubes
and vents and things like that with some
pretty decent graphics for a game that's
in an alpha so you can see all that
other big news for star citizen alpha 2
point 0 includes integration with
missions so there are 38 playable
missions as of the present
stations announcement there is social
integration first person shooter combat
EBA or zero gravity transit Space Flight
as has already been in the game and
Space Flight will now include a more
precise version of the landing and
takeoff setup so if you have issues with
it in the dog fighting alpha it's
because it's not built for landing and
takeoff it's built for combat so that's
an upgrade as well and in addition to
this there's functional buggies
functional respawn increased players for
instance count if you're curious about
the instancing system check out our
previous content with Chris on that and
then perhaps more interestingly there is
what the team called our large world
technology which introduces a playable
area of 1 million kilometers squared by
200,000 kilometers high so that's pretty
big area if you do the volume of that
it's couple quadrillion kilometers so
this is to put it into comparison
probably the largest game world I've
ever heard of at least even with some of
the other space sims in terms of numbers
that we have access to not all game
worlds reveal their size but to put in
perspective the CI g team in the
presentations of the Elder Scrolls too
which is the largest game they could
find a square area for as a 161 thousand
kilometer squared playable space
obviously there's vertical space as well
in star citizen and squadron 42 so
that's a big addition to this but star
citizen's team and chris Roberts as the
presenter clarify that there will be
controls in place to ensure that players
don't spend several hours traveling and
boring low propulsion or even light
speed travel from one system to the next
so there will be controls in place
they're making sure it's not just all
dead empty space but that it's still big
enough to make it clear that you're
actually in outer space let's talk about
squadron 42 this is the single-player
campaign component of the game it's been
pretty undiscussed up until this point
but it's made big news at the citizen
Khan 2015 event squadron 42 introduces a
Hollywood grade cast of voice actors who
interestingly were involved in the
motion capture process as well this is
not standard
in games generally you hire the voice
actor they take a booth or a studio
record their lines and then there's
effectively a stand-in who performs
their actions in game and that's because
you don't normally need the actor there
to do stuff like pretend to swing a
sword or walk around or whatever in the
case of squadron 42 they've involved
Gary Oldman they even involved the other
actors Mark Hamill who is known for
playing Luke Skywalker in Star Wars of
course and they got them on site to act
their lines live and do all the actions
live so that they could record by way of
facial scanning and 3d tracking the
actual face movements the mouth
movements all that stuff of the actors
so you get a more true to feel
performance as would be found in cinema
or TV the cast is comprised of a couple
of well-known actors we don't have all
of them yet but we have a good amount of
them as you can see here we don't know
all their characters either we know that
Gary Oldman is playing Admiral Bishop
and he is best known probably for his
role as commissure co commissioner
gordon in the batman movies gillian
anderson is known for her x-files roles
and she plays Oldman's characters
daughter in squadron 42 Mark Hamill
known for being Luke Skywalker in Star
Wars was present we don't know who his
character is just yet and the same is
true for Mark Strong he's known for
roles in kinsmen and sherlock holmes and
imitation game john rhys-davies played
in Lord of the Rings as Gimli and he was
present in our b-roll we received as was
liam Cunningham who played Captain white
in squadron 42 that we don't really know
who that is just yet the first major
content from squadron 42 includes
Admiral bishops speech as performed by
gary oldman and that can be found on our
YouTube channel separately from this
content so hit that gamers Nexus link
the icon and then just click one of the
most recent two videos you will find his
speech there it is about four minutes
long and provide some backstory to
squadron 42 including discussion on war
with the vanduul or the aliens who are
somewhat comparable to barbarians in
space so that's what the speech talks
about we have some further coverage
come in talking about the technical
underlying nitty gritty features and
development process when it comes to the
face tracking character animation and
creation of the characters who are
related to motion captured actors and
all that stuff will be coming shortly so
subscribe to the channel if you like
this kind of content hit the patreon
link in our post roll video definitely
helps us remain independent and produce
high-quality content like this and
you'll find a full article linked to the
description below if you'd rather have a
written version to pass around and we do
encourage sharing it as always so thanks
for watching I will see you all next
