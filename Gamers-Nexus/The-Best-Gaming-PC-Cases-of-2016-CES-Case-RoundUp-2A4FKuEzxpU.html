dotnet and today we're talking about the
best gaming PC cases of CES 2016 we'll
be looking at cases that are flashy
structurally sound or purely functional
all of which were demonstrated at CES
last week during our run-through of the
show all of our CES 2016 coverage is
brought to you by iWeb powers revolt 2
small form-factor gaming pc we're
starting off with in wins reimagined 805
case now fronting an infinity mirror
effect on the panelling n1 isn't yet
sure if they'll bring the case to market
but they said it'd cost about $60 more
than the existing 805 planting the case
approximately in the $220 range the
front panel uses a one-way mirror on the
front and that is see-through from from
the users perspective and an inset
mirror just a quarter inch behind it
creating the appearance of a deep front
panel with a black hole effect thanks to
the LED RGB lighting and that RGB LED
strip sits between the two mirrors
echoing backwards effectively infinitely
in creating that black hole effect the
interior of the case is standard and
equally matches the existing 805 it's
front panel was new at CES and when
asked us to request viewers to comment
on whether they want to see this design
brought to market on top of the existing
805 so post those comments below and
what you would pay for it to help them
out this was easily one of the flashiest
affordable cases at CES the rest of the
insanely flashy cases generally ran the
hundreds to thousands of dollars range
so that makes this one of the more
affordable ones this in 1h tower as an
example that you're looking at now is
being sold via pre-order for $2,400
pretty cool but we're excluding it from
this video as one of the best cases
because one it was shown at Computex
last year too it's really not something
that anyone's going to buy anyway check
out the channel for more information on
this case if you want to see how it
works and why it's cool the next case is
NZXT it on named mini ITX enclosure the
case delivers a smaller form factor
while sticking to the standard vertical
oriented board layout and NZXT is doing
a few unique things here primarily
using stamped steel paneling in its
curved side panels something that to our
knowledge anyway is an industry-first
we're not yet allowed to show the inside
the case but given NZXT t's history with
its h4 40 s to 40 and n 450 it probably
has a PSU shroud and focus on cable
management though the smaller form
factor is certainly a challenge to that
the case lacks optical drive bays has
made apparent by its single plate face
there's obviously no cutouts there for
optical drive bays and will better
accommodate tight component fit as a
result of removing this OD d bay NZXT is
going for a mini ITX case that feels
more familiar to users of mid towers and
the company is investing most in its all
steel frame and exterior a merging of
NTSC sold mostly plastic design and
current mostly steel design philosophies
depending on who's asked the cases
exterior is the type that's either loved
or hated and a lot of our photos were
wide angles so that does amplify the bow
in effect a little bit speaking of NZXT
the success of the s340 one of the best
cases we've ever worked with has
prompted a follow-on of direct
competition Silverstone's new RL 0 5 B
enclosures outfitted with a similar
tooling there's a PSU shroud on the
bottom if you buried 3.5 inch drive
spots in the bottom front and they clean
layout overall the case is still in the
final design stages and silverstone was
keen to take press suggestions for
improvement at CES so things could
certainly change and as with most of
siller's Silverstone's products they're
focusing on the RL 0 v b4 high cooling
performance and airflow underscored with
its dual 140 millimeter front intake
fans and rear slot for a 120 millimeter
fan or radiator shipped empty the case
is targeted at the $60 price point
making it seriously competitive to
similar solutions on the market and it
looks like the RL 0 5 B will be cooling
focused clean and easily cable managed
for budget gaming pcs definitely wanted
to pay attention to though I do wish
Silverstone would take a page from their
competitors books and learn how to name
their cases in a way that's a bit more
user friendly
Silverstone isn't the only company that
was inspired by NZXT s340 the fantex
Eclipse p400 and p400s cases bear
striking resemblance to the s340 the are
l05 b and rose wills gun near case the
latter two were just announced at this
show the PSU shroud and driveway
limitations or strip downs seem to be
the new trend for 2016 but it's not bad
to have options out there between the
similar style over all the options
altima tell preg you late market prices
and establish new standards in the
industry neither of which is a bad thing
the p400s uses some additional foam
padding including optional top panel
inserts that block off top ventilation
in favor of noise containment fan tax
appears to be using sound absorbing
material rather than deflection or
reflection methods used in some other
cases and the P 400 and 400s hosts a PSU
shroud in the bottom with drilling for
breathability in the PSU compartment
optional drive sleds can be mounted in
the front of the case in normal drive
bay area where a single intake fan is
pre installed radiator support is
available for at least 240 millimeter
radiators in the front and kale
management isn't quite as clean as the
s3 40 but still good we wish that fan
tax would drill out some holes in the
top of the PSU shroud though for PCIe
cable pass-through is something that
currently lacks the P 400 and people are
under 2 s will be priced at $70 and $80
for the silent version and buying a
white version of the case increases cost
and additional $10 on top of that
project nine one six is what fan tax is
currently calling its next primo case
the back of the P nine one six card set
primo pro we're not sure if that's
actually the name but we're told there
is not yet a permanent name for the
massive aluminum encased enclosure
project nine one six it uses a 5
millimeter aluminum outer shell and
rests upon an L shape underside which is
somewhat unique the 5 millimeter shell
though is the most noteworthy if you're
not familiar with cases they're
generally maybe a millimeter thick in
the outer shell so 5 millimeters is
gigantic
currently the interior is built a point
8 millimeter steel something that fan
tax tells us may change as design
iterates and finalizes and the enclosure
is one of the heaviest we've worked with
recently though is unn
measured at this time for weights and is
easily one of the largest that's because
fantex is sticking its DS tag on project
nine one six or dual system and the case
will be supported for Mini ITX
motherboard and dat ATX motherboard
mounting simultaneously the mini ITX
board mounts atop the PSU shroud the ATX
board in normal vertical layout and then
the case fits to power supplies for
independent redundant or combined power
provision to these systems learn more
about this in our separate article and
video just search for project nine one
six on the website or on the YouTube
channel EVGA is huge case may not be for
everyone its massive uses a lot of
plastic and subscribes a bit to the
older philosophies of case design still
it's worth paying attention to and makes
a few interesting design choices the
case is yet unnamed the EVGA uses large
plastic paneling in the top front and
even rear of the case all grilled for
intake and exhaust the rear panel pulls
out for cable management at the back of
the case and is even equipped with dual
rear exhaust fans another oddity that's
interesting large radiator support is
available in the top and front panels
and the front area is concealed by
tempered tinted glass with a laser
etched EVGA logo that's illuminated with
RGB LEDs the PSU shroud uses a mirrored
side plate that's got backing LEDs for
fan speed control so you can see red and
green text for the fan speeds intake and
exhaust and it's definitely a weird case
and a bit unorthodox and large but worth
watching as EVGA develops this behemoth
because EVGA quite obviously has been
expanding very aggressively into other
markets lately and cases could well
become a new area that they look at
seriously Corsair spec alpha and 400 C
accompany the company's existing 600 C
case which we already positively
reviewed for its chart-topping thermal
performance especially with GPUs the
spec alpha is more targeted at Asian
markets as were the previous spec models
and is built atop the spec Oh 2 and spec
oh 3 tooling Corsairs got a plastic
extrusion that appeals to those non-us
markets a bit more than here and retains
its usual focus on
function and cooling so that will be
sold in the u.s. if you want it but it's
not their main focus for something
cleaner the 400 C follows the 600 C
launch is more focused on the US market
and reverts the motherboard orientation
from the 600 C's interesting inverted
layout to a standard ATX layout it also
removes the optical drive bay from the
600 C making the total size of the case
significantly smaller and reducing case
height but retaining a PSU shroud and
other 600 C features that's it for this
year's CES case roundup as always check
