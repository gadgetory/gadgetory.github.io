enough of your RAM and CPU cycles of
Bethesda is now rolling out its Bethesda
dotnet launcher which is another games
publishing tool similar to the likes of
Steam Epic Games launcher Nexon launcher
battlenet GOG galaxy Windows 10 store
Rockstar social club and no there's one
more in there at least but that's just a
few of them did I say EA Origin because
there's EA origin - how could we forget
so that's at least 10 different software
utilities that you can use just to play
games and this is being rolled out it's
actually believe it or not good news and
I'll tell you why it's good news it is
good news for the SSD market because in
order to launch those 10 launchers to
play your one video game that you want
to play and also launch Logitech LGS
Corsair qnz xdcam and video geforce
experience AMD gaming evolved or raptor
plays that TV or any of the other
hardware software MSI Afterburner EVGA
precision of the million tools you need
to get use out of your gaming system
you'll probably want an SSD so I guess
it's good news in that regard but this
Bethesda dotnet thing if it's not
obvious is clearly not something I'm
super excited about and that's just
because it's it's another one of those
why and here's the thing it's good to
have competition steam should not
control the entire market without real
competition I definitely think that
competition is good and steam is even
something I was very small most scared
of in the early days because I wanted to
buy my games physically and install them
and not have to use software to play
them but that's the way the world is now
that's the way PC gaming is now with
validation with social tools with
authentication all this stuff we kind of
need these things so competition is good
but does it need to come from publishers
I don't know I don't know that I want to
go through a publisher to play their one
game that I own when I could just buy it
somewhere else whether that's steam or
another option and I'm thinking about it
now and they're all really from
publishers except for I guess GOG galaxy
which is kind of a publisher because
they have a very close relationship with
CD Projekt RED but
that's really their one tie to a major
publisher other than just strictly
selling and remaking the old games and
here's one curiosity I have about this
Beth has a net thing that I want you to
all to pay attention to do you remember
the paid mods Fiasco on Steam a while
ago with Skyrim that kind of went away
and there were a lot of reasons it
didn't work out we wrote a whole big
article on it it could potentially work
out it's certainly not bad for these
modders to make money if the game
developers will enable them legally to
do so but I do have a feeling that there
is going to be a return of paid mods
through this Bethesda dotnet launcher
the fallout 4 creation kit is being
rolled out through it
Dec might be rolled out through it who
knows if it's gonna be exclusive or not
through the launcher I would certainly
hope not and I wouldn't expect it would
be but it is a possibility and if they
do make a return to these paid mods I
just hope that Bethesda does it in a way
that is not as as catastrophic for the
modding community as their original
attempts but at the end of the day maybe
the mods will fix this new Bethesda
launcher so that is all for this quick
