booth now at Computex 2018 and we're
looking at a few new KS is here so
Coolermaster has continued to iterate on
their aged 500 series cases but they
also have an SL 600 M next to me before
that this video is brought to you by
Thermal Grizzlies high-end thermal paste
and liquid metal thermal Grizzlies cryo
knot is an affordable high quality
thermal compound that doesn't pay some
of the aging limitations of other pastes
on the market cryo knot has a thermal
conductivity of 12.5 watts per meter
Kelvin focuses on endurance is easy to
spread and isn't electrically conductive
making it safe to use on GPU dies
thermal grizzly also makes conductor not
liquid metal could Previews to drop 20
degrees off some temperatures than our
dee-lighted test by a tube at the link
in the description below so the SL 600 M
is brand new it's the same tooling as
the master k series
it's got bottom to top air flow though
so similar in some concepts to the Raven
o2 but very limited into similarities
because that's an ancient case and it
was inverted anyway this one with two to
hundreds in the bottom has nothing for
exhaust fans instead they're just
relying on air going straight up and
through a CPU cooler now at the top of
the cave tom the case has a removable
panel on it and it's an aluminum panel
so all the silver colored things on this
case that you see they're aluminum
panels you can take it off if you don't
like it if you take it off it's match so
that's what we want to see the bottom
actually has a substantial amount of
space underneath the case and you can
really actually get exposure to air flow
there great thing to see as well cooler
master seems to be taking a lot of notes
really and moving forward on improving
their designs so anyway as the air comes
up what they've gone with here is a
couple of options with a PCIe expansion
slot similar to it there holds a case we
saw the show you can rotate the PCIe
expansion slots 90 degrees so if you
want them to be vertical you can do it
vertically you want a horizontally or
horizontally the one item of note here
typically we're pretty hard about the
vertical GPU mounts because normally all
it does is incinerate your GPU unless
it's over Lou
in this instance coolermaster has a lot
of slots available so because it is
rotatable you can push the GPU a lot
farther back
in the case which exposes it to more air
so it is actually able to get some more
air flow through to the GPU then
typically with one of the vertical gb
mats that would be up against the side
panel so good work there as well this is
on the PCI expansion autorotation also
interesting is the power supply so power
supply mounts up in the front of the
case it has routing underneath the case
for the power supply cable and then you
could adjust the power supply
positioning in terms of where it's
specifically located because it's just
got a couple of screws so if you want to
higher up you go higher up you want
lower down so forth pretty
straightforward on that but it moves the
power supply around and the big thing
here with the SL 600 M is puller masters
going for basically noise normalized
performance efficiency so rather than
just going flat out thermals or anything
like that or flat out noise they're
trying to raise the isolate off and pour
it on off all of the areas of the case
where noise typically escapes it goes
towards the user including the typical
rear exhaust port on this one so that's
just a steel panel for this case and
basically the noise escapes primarily
out of these holes go straight up above
your head hopefully so that's the goal
for the SL 600 M pricings working at
$229 released likely in October ATX
micro ATX support and support for three
hundred sixty millimeter radiators I
think that mostly explains this case the
next case is back behind me over there
we have footage of that one as well
it's a k 500 p so it's currently a
prototype the stuff you see on it not
final if you have criticisms hopefully
they'll improve it because it's just a
prototype so tape I better be targeted
to 80 to 90 dollars for that case it's
got three RGB LED bands included 120
millimeters altering the front of the
case and then also digital large beyond
the power supply shroud two points of
user engagement here we want by we I
mean fully master has asked me to ask
you feedback on as a panel in here and
on the k-500 B so the things they
specifically want to know and leave a
comment let them know for the aluminum
on those on this case would you rather
have brushed rough aluminum or would you
rather have these sauce touch aluminum
they have now seconds watch the tape 500
P the digital RGB is on the power
why do you want that where do you think
it's got EU let them know so KY better
peace new tolling they have three new
chassis two lanes for main stream this
year and then finally there's age 500
9p9 amman just straight it's 500 it's a
hundred bucks we have some footage of
that one as well
it has two 200 millimeter RGB bands
stock and it comes stock with mesh but
if you want an acrylic panel similar to
the original aged 500 P you can replace
it with an acrylic panel so that's the
age 509 he targeted 100 bucks
looking at September for that one I'm
sorry it's not at this booth their
neighbor is awful so thank you for
watching as always subscribe for more go
to patreon.com/scishow sax it helps out
directly go to store it on cameras exits
not net to pick up Ahmad Matt I just
realized the neighbors know attack so
I'm not really helping that relationship
thanks for watching I'll see you all
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
