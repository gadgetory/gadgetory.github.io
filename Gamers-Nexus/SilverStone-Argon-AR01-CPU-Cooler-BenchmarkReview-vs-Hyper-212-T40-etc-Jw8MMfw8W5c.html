Nexus dotnet and today we are looking at
silverstone Zargon a r01 CPU cooler
which is priced firmly in the thirty
five dollar range right near the hyper
212 and respire t forty and both of
those we've reviewed previously check
the channel for those as always let's
hit on the hard specs before jumping
into opinions and thermal data you'll
find the full review linked below
complete with all the benchmark data and
images i'm about to discuss first of all
silverstone Zargon series of coolers
chips and three skews a r01 a r 0 2 and
a r 0 3 we tested the AR 0 1 argon
cooler and these coolers are each
purpose-built for different socket types
though they're all intercomparison
physical size of the cpu fluctuates with
the pin count which is signified by the
socket numbers so 1155 1150 2011 and so
on and generally it's advisable to seek
out a CPU cooler that fits perfectly
atop the integrated heat spreader on the
CPU or IHS if you buy a massive cooler
that's meant for server products or
x-class CPUs and mount it to a Haswell
chip then it'll still work it's just
going to be inefficient and price and
effective neither of those are desirable
the same is true for the reverse
mounting a respire t20 which has one of
these smallest cold plates I've ever
seen to a massive LGA 2011 chip is going
to run pretty warm so for the same
reason you don't want to do that by
seating the heat pipes the copper heat
pipes more directly atop the IHS we can
conduct heat more efficiently from the
IH IH s into the capillaries and this is
partly because first of all copper has
about two times the thermal conductivity
of aluminum so that's a big part of it
and then of course the heat pipes
themselves will be more effective at
their jobs like many modern heat sinks
the argon coolers use direct contact
cold blades with smooth mounting
surfaces so there aren't any cracks
between the heat pipes and aluminum base
plate as found in some cheaper coolers
and this helps with thermal dissipation
efficiency by maximizing the contact of
the IHS and minimizing the demand for a
thermal interface ie compound
fill the cracks the a r01 is recommended
for CPUs with a similar pin count to IV
bridges 1155 pins including as well as
LGA 1150 socket so if you're running
1150 oven 55 generally 11 5 X you want
the AR 0 1 if you're running 1366 or
2011 which are much larger you want AR 0
3 and then I believe the AR AR 0 2
cooler is a little bit smaller form
factor for those special instances where
you need it and the AR 0 1 itself is
built with three eight millimeter copper
heat pipes and a large copper heatsink
the aluminum heatsink has a fin design
that increases air turbulence to
prohibit intake air from escaping too
early in the dissipation process so the
the retention of that colder air is much
better with this cooler than others
you'll find positioning available for
two fans on the CPU cooler each mounted
with a rubber tab rather than plastic
sliders that break and our testing has
found that the air stream was fully
saturated by just the stock fan at least
in the instance of our bench so the
stock fan does use a high probe airing
and delivers roughly 55 CFM at 24
decibels making for a relatively low
overall noise threshold and moderate
power let's hit those benchmarks you'll
find our full test methodology in the
article linked below but the short of it
is that we run prime95 instances with l
FF T's on 4 threads to generate maximum
heat and load and the CPU is OC to 4.4
gigahertz with a V core of roughly 1.7 5
volts RAM is up around 2400 megahertz we
disable all automatic fan speed controls
for the purposes of these tests and I
ran the AR 0 1 through with both stock
and aftermarket controlled thermal
compounds so this helps to set all the
coolers on a similar baseline so we can
judge their actual design and also judge
if you need to buy your own compound
then I tested it again with the dual fan
configuration and and we'll talk about
those settings in a second so here's the
stock chart as shown in this chart the
AR 0 1 performs that nearly
on par with the NZXT crack and x-48 CLC
and easily beats out all other air
coolers on the bench including the hyper
212 plus and respired t40 which are
priced similarly the air coolers aren't
that surprising in terms of what it
beats but the CLC probably sees similar
performance on the silent setting anyway
due to the efficiency of our test setup
if you were to Ovie to 1.3 volts and run
a baton of 4.8 gigahertz clock or higher
you'd probably see a bigger gap
developing between liquid and air and I
would assume with the x40 retaining more
of its advantage there still are benches
purpose-built for real-world test
scenarios and this means intermediate
system builders are in mind you're not
and insane overclocked or if you're
using this type of setup so if you're
mirroring our target bench that a r01 is
easily the best buy at its price on our
entire bench suite and if you don't need
liquid for any particular reason
then this generally is advisable over
most liquid just for the cost benefit
the differences between the stock and
aftermarket compound tests are within
one Celsius and because the stock
compound is already 5 watts per meter
Kelvin there's really no reason to opt
for aftermarket cooling pastes rather
unless you go for more extreme
overclocking maybe something like
Diamond compound would be preferable for
that as for multi fan tests we found the
improvement was within margin of error
only 1c and this is likely due to the
airstream being fully saturated as is on
the bench as I discussed overall the
build quality of the air zero one is
superb the price point is excellent and
it has effectively dethroned the respire
T 40 which previously dethroned the
hyper 212 as our highest recommended air
cooler if you're trying to buy a cooler
in the $30 price range plus or minus 10
bucks the AR 0 1 is definitely what I'd
recommend that said you can normally
grab the respire t44 just under $20
lately which makes its value
significantly better if you need
budget-friendly parts really you can't
go wrong with either cooler though and
that's all for now I will see you all
next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
