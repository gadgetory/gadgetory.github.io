Coursera booth right now looking at two
of their new wireless products the k63
wireless keyboard and the dark core
mouse they also have a dark core S II
and these are sort of loosely
counterparts to what Logitech shipped
earlier with their wireless charging
mouse and mouse pad but they're a bit
different we'll talk about that in a
moment but before getting to that this
video is brought to you by Leon Lee and
their 550 X and 330 cases the 550 X is a
$180 mid tower case with tempered glass
on all panels it's got three RGB LED
fans positioned in the front each of
which has a metal frame housing and an
open interior design if you prefer a
cheaper option the 330 is $100 and comes
without fans and as what we recommended
most heavily in one of our recent case
reviews learn more at the link in the
description below starting with the K 63
keyboard the keyboard here this is $110
shipping January all these are shipping
January this month so this is a non ten
key keyboards ten keyless it has both
wireless and Bluetooth transmission
modes Wireless is probably how you'd use
it that's 2.4 gigahertz pretty standard
and there's a one millisecond
transmission latency we don't yet know
the click to response latency the input
latency as it were but should be getting
that shortly
transmissions one millisecond though
which is about as good as you can get
for Wireless other than that it's got
bluetooth and the Bluetooth mode is the
power saving Bluetooth the spec which
means that it's going to have a bit
slower response it's about seven
milliseconds give or take but then again
it's bluetooth and that's never going to
be as good the upside here courts are
didn't talk about this in their meeting
but one of the upsides we've found to
having two modes on a keyboard or Mouse
is that you can connect to a streaming
PC separately with one ie Bluetooth and
then to your main system with wireless
or wired if you prefer which is kind of
interesting because then you can get rid
of software solutions like synergy and
go instead with a hardware solution if
you prefer that the mouse is largely the
same spec for the wireless solution the
sensor on the mouse is a 33 67 picsArt
sensor
it's a Pixar sensor that of course there
has had input on so it's slightly
customized at least for the mouse the
dark core is the non Qi charging version
that's $80 and you can all of these you
can connect them by wire the mouse pad
goes with the Qi charging version so you
have the dark core S II at $10 more than
the mousepad at $80 additional for that
which has a single spot for charging so
this is where it gets a bit different
from Logitech solution the Logitech
solution we looked at previously uses a
magnetic resonance charging which more
or less covers the whole mat when we
took it apart you can see the copper
coil that wraps around the entire
surface of the mat and it charges
optimally in the center although it will
sort of charge over the whole thing
while and use the Corsair solution uses
instead what they call a qi spot which
let me be clear for the youtube
moderators out there that was Qi spot
okay don't de monetize us as that's on
the top right corner it's a seven watt
output and the cable connected to it the
the micro USB cable is two amps so it's
bit more than you get typically and
theoretically it should charge a bit
faster than the Logitech solution but it
doesn't charge while in use so that's
your trade-off there between the two
options on the market you place the
mouse specifically in the top right
corner it will charge a bit faster and
then you take it off when you're ready
to go chorister says that they preferred
this solution which they showed at
Computex by the way because you can also
charge other devices like your phone if
you have a Qi charging capable phone
there also shipping dongles this this
starts to get a little bit silly because
you're chaining multiple inefficient
technologies together but the idea is
nice you attach the dongle then you
attach that to whatever you want and you
drop that on top of the cheese spot and
charge the device that way I think that
covers the basics of everything there
might be a couple of other items of note
I guess battery life we go over the
mouse is rated for what they claim is 24
hours continuous with the lighting and
abled and the keyboard is rated for I
believe 15 hours continuous with the
lighting at 66% it can go up to a
hundred percent which is very bright and
kind of unnecessary but if you want that
it's 10 hour
at that point and then disabling that I
think it's 75 so that's continuous use
for all of those numbers not you know go
and take breaks use things like that
which is what logitech rates theirs for
so they all kind of rate their use
differently which means you can't just
compare them head-to-head without a
standardized third-party benchmark but I
think that covers it pretty sure that's
that's everything for course there's
wireless technologies if I've missed
anything will either do title cards over
here with info otherwise check the
