getting somewhere we are working on our
set table now so the set table has been
holding us up on everything it's been
holding up here's the problem it's all
one big pipeline and the set table is
what we need to start doing live streams
and the live streams are what we need to
start building production systems
because I want to stream the building of
the production systems but we need the
production systems to do more work so a
table is holding us up right now
everything before that this video is
brought to you by the Corsair strafe RGB
mark to mechanical gaming keyboard the
strafe mark 2 uses Cherry MX which is
available in MX red and MX Island and
uses the elevated key cap design that
has become part of course there's
keyboard identity elevated key caps make
the keyboard much easier to clean with a
blast of compressed air and limit dirt
build up the keyboard use a metal body
design of have received praise from us
in the past in old reviews for high
build quality learn more about the
Corsair strafe mark 2 at the link in the
description below so we're gonna build
that today we have our autonomous da AI
legs in that's this right here so we've
got I think this is they have two models
this is I think the business model which
has two motors in it so this was
provided by autonomous and I'm hoping
it's good because it's supposed to be a
raising and lowering desk and the point
of that for us is going to be to put
this thing over here the table we've
been working on on those legs and then
the table will be going kind of in the
corner over there and we're on the
shotgun mic right now so you have to
work with me on the volume of the audio
but the table will go over there and be
on raising lowering legs it's just it's
it's all done electronically now instead
of our oldest pet table which was a
little wobbly as many of you complained
back in the day and that was wildly
because it was actually a height
adjustable table we never used the
height adjustment because it was a huge
pain in the ass you do adjust four legs
it was an accurate and wobbled like
crazy so I'm hoping their solution works
because what we want is to be able to
and lower the table for different b-roll
shots of products and just because it'd
be a really useful feature for working
in general so we're gonna attach those
legs to this thing this is the bottom so
we've been working on staining
polyurethane sanding everything on the
top side which is currently on the
bottom now we're gonna attach the legs
here today and then in addition to
building the table we are also working
on finalizing some of the production
room initial layout and the test room is
now working so we'll show you some of
that in progress testing and we're
starting to build test benches here so
that'll be all the topics for today's
we've been vlogging if not some extra
stuff in there as well so the table legs
are requested from autonomous AI if you
want to visit their site we'll have a
link below it's the specific model were
using hopefully it's good so I can
recommend that you buy it we'll find out
towards the end of this video so that
the table legs were using it's the
version 2 of their smart desk version 3
of the smart desk has a touchscreen that
I believe allows you to quickly order
fast food from your table now I remember
when EverQuest - in the early 2000s
added slash pizza to the game and it
allowed you to fast order pizza from
within EverQuest and you based on the
responses to that action I there's
there's a limit to my laziness raising
and lowering the chair electronically
that's ok I think I think once I start
fast-food ordering from my furniture
there's a problem it's cool feature but
that's it's too much for me you're too
advanced autonomous we can't we can't
handle that much technology here so what
we are doing is gonna be working with
these two things and if you actually
look at the bottom of it
ok so if we pull that off you will see
the motor pretty big motor I don't
remember the exact weight capacity of
this one but it can support a bigger
table so we can use a 6 foot - table I
think it's 74 by 30 for our table
there's your motor there are two of
those one on each leg so that should be
sufficient for raising even really heavy
cases like a I don't know dark base Pro
900
something like that something that's big
and 50 pounds and has a lot of glass and
what are the other parts two legs
arrested this is all mounting hardware
we have zip ties and stuff I don't know
that's for cable management or something
else and then we've got the support bar
that goes under the table and should
also help stabilize it plus whatever
this is so I think it's time to start
building it and I recruit Andrew from
behind the camera well build it will
time lapse some of it maybe and get it
on the table and hopefully we have a
functional set table finally because
holding up everything right now okay
Andrew I need your help with this at
this point
hey everyone welcome to another hardware
news recap this is our new set table
alright everyone we are testing both the
table and my workers comp insurance all
in one go it's definitely moving slower
motor spotty getting a little hot but it
is working how's that feel I was just up
until the ceiling it's just a smash
that's magic
all right see it very nice alright not
synonymous you've impressed me thanks
for sending them over we'll talk about
this more in the morning probably but
for now this wasn't enough work for now
the table took like 2 weeks so this
table was that was kind of back and
forth on it a lot because we did a
really shiny gloss originally and it
looked pretty cool but it looks too
glossy like it was it was like a mirror
so then I sanded everything off all the
way up to 3500 grit
I haven't policy yet on a polish and
buff next but right now it's kind of
like a weathered workshop table like
it's got some of the richness of tone is
gone and some of the stain in the areas
where it was not level and there wasn't
enough polyurethane some of the stain
has been removed which we could go over
that and fix it but I kind of like it
because it looks like it's been used and
a little beat-up and it's going on a
workshop said ultimately so it's kind of
cool like that but I don't we're gonna
make another one anyway
autonomous sent two of these sets and
the second one will probably I don't
know if it'll be used for the live
stream side or just for like a
workstation or a test bench or what but
man that is awesome radio hang function
it's gonna be so nice I also will be
very useful for when we have to move
again in the future because you just
lower it to smash it down so yeah I was
really uncertain about this table I put
2 weeks of work into it I redid the
entire thing once so we had it done and
then sanded it all down and redid it
didn't like it and did it again a lot of
work sanding so really happy it turned
out pretty decent and looks good it
looks like looks like a set piece for a
workshop because a lot of you like the
industrial look of our set and this will
fit in perfectly with that I think the
next thing is just we'll do the next
table at some point maybe that one will
be Gloster I don't know but I got to
polish and buff this still and the table
should be done today that's cool yeah
man quick interruption to all the other
stuff we're doing we got some stuff in
the mail and this comes from a viewer I
think it's from total wind-up thank you
very much for sending this so this is on
loan to us from the viewer total wind-up
I think you've sent us some stuff in the
past we have some viewers or readers who
will occasionally send things rest
review that we didn't get in from the
manufacturers and this is a thread
Ripper 229 90 WX I think is the full
name of it so we're looking forward to
still working on this one patrick has
been working on some cpu testing stuff
that that is in preparation for this so
we're gonna start testing this pretty
soon the I will say the packaging got in
the discussion with some other reviewers
and PR in the industry on Facebook they
were really in love with this packaging
and I go say hi I disagree I think it's
a waste of of consumer money but either
way there's a CPU inside that's
definitely worth testing even if the box
is a bit superfluous and I mean just
it's just gonna end up in a landfill for
about 2 million years anyway so not a
fan of the box but don't care the CPU is
pretty cool we'll be testing that very
soon
so we're just gonna go through a couple
of the other things we got in this is
from silverstone so these are monitor
arms they sent us three of these I think
just called the arm 11 SC so this or arm
one arm one single LCD interactive arm
see how we're gonna mount these in the
production room probably we have two
cheap monitor arms or 1080p small panels
in the testing room those are in use
already for thermal benches and the it
helps us get more out of the space
because it actually being able to push
them aside is a huge advantage so these
are much heavier duty than the ones that
we got and they will support heavier
monitors that's a big thing for us so
we're gonna mount some of these in the
production room and then other than that
stuff we got a couple of other things
and I'll walk you around the place show
we got in but this is all done now so
the video set all the lights are there
not really where they're supposed to be
but when it's all done so we just filmed
our first video here it was the
corrosion video bridges liquid metal and
it's pretty much done
tables great we're really happy I guess
we built that earlier in this video
actually so the tables in and we moved
this light from back in this corner over
here to up on the table and then we're
gonna have to like put some stuff in
front of it to hide the legs a bit but
that gets it out of the shot so it won't
be quite as strong of a light but it's
still a good rim and then we have a hand
light up there that's stuck on the pole
it's never gonna come off so that's up
there and I think that's it for the
lighting the tables pretty damn cool
like we just we have presets now so this
is pretty sweet we have use cases for
this will perhaps show one of them in
the future and right now it's just
pre-programmed we set a couple of
profiles where I hit the button over
here we show b-roll shot of it at some
point so that's the autonomous part of
it that as in the company you hit the
button that's pre program that goes down
to a certain height so right now this is
at I think it's going to 25 inches 25.5
inches if I hit the other button it goes
up to 50 and then if I hit one it just
comes straight up to our a roll set
height it's just really cool so if
Andrew needs to adjust it for b-roll or
something just so we don't have to screw
around with reorienting the camera takes
forever on the dolly it's on we can just
raise it and then when I'm ready to go I
hit one and it goes to the to the Aral
height or you can manually adjust too so
really sweet table pretty happy with it
happy with how the wood turned out got
the mod matte on here so we're good to
go let's check out some of the other
stuff so here's a small thing we did and
one of the earliest moving vlogs we
Keegan put in a bunch of foam between
the window and the wall to dab someone
and always coming from the hallway
worked really well and we have a problem
with this door where the door book is
from what the
contractor we brought out told me is
slightly ajar not something we can fix
without some demolition and it's I mean
it's it's not worth it so so we had some
noise creeping in from the top corner
because it's not perfectly flush we put
in some foam and the foam lines it
completely door still closes properly
all that stuff but the foam really helps
out with noise just like it did in the
other corner so small stuff for noise at
this point as far as you guys are
concerned it's it should be completely
fine you're not gonna hear anything so
it's really more for us because we could
hear more than the mics and pickups
sometimes but we got some other stuff
done too for this room Patrick's been
pretty hard at work in here this is the
testing room we're still looking by the
way for I just noticed there's there's
still more echo in this room than all
the other ones we're still looking for
some wall art and stuff like that so if
you didn't see it in our news video we
posted a p.o box you can send stuff to
we're specifically looking for like old
computer hardware advertisements from a
long time ago like we have any hunter
megabyte hard drive ads or old old old
cpu ads like 20 30 plus years ago we'll
take him if you got old magazines so we
can frame them put them on the walls
because it's the walls are kind of
barren right now but anyway maybe we'll
pop up the peel walks or something like
that if you want to send something along
there's no guarantee it'll make it in a
video I don't know how much stuff we're
gonna get it might be just so much that
we can't put them all on videos or we
might not get much at all so if you have
anything that's like computer history
though and you definitely don't eat it
and you have no sentimental attachment
send it along and we'll probably put it
on the wall or something
it's alright Patrick's when I work on
this stuff we have two identical CBO
test benches right now the thing we are
doing is testing the video card so we're
doing our test suite on one card and
then we're gonna switch it for the other
one and do it again and if there's no
variants and the performance is the same
then the cards are functionally the same
we can run the tests in parallel on
Intel and AMD at the same time and Intel
will later get one of these benches as
well but the the concern is that not all
GPU silicon is great
so I've one clock slightly higher that
turns off the results not valid I really
hope they're closed because if they are
we can run to CPU tests at a time which
would be huge for us
save a lot of time so if they're not
equal then I don't know I guess we'll
switch cards and just use one but anyway
that's the CPU benches so tooth ho is
pretty sweet the monitor is we've had
this one a long time now I think AMD
sent this one over for free sync testing
or something a couple years ago but this
is an asus mg279q so it is a 144 Hertz
1440p monitor we're using this because
for cpu testing we're never going to 4k
at least not any time soon because 4k is
a GPU test 1440p we do though that's
still valuable so it's great for that
it's an IPS panel looks nice high
refresh is nice and in terms of display
is we now have two of them so h2 settle
on a second one Thank You Asus for that
so that we can have two identical
displays on the bench so two of the mg
2927 9q monitors are 2009 qs and really
looking forward to getting these and
used so that's those we have two other
ACS monitors that I bought used up there
not sure what we're going to use them
for you have their 1080p so maybe just
workstation monitors and then over here
behind me Patrick's been working on the
rising tech affion case that we saw at
copy tech so this is a mini ITX case
right here and it's a hot box it's not a
cool case looks interesting but we'll
have review on that hopefully sort of
soon once we figure out all the all the
testing stuff oh and he plugged in that
ACS keyboard that they sent along
previously as well which is actually
kind of an interesting keyboard I'll be
honest but I have not used it so I don't
know if it's any good but I think you're
gonna replace the plate up here if you
have a 3d printer there so the case test
has been busy in the case test bench
çb a test bench has been busy
the cooler testing I'm going to start
back up again soon and I tore these down
this was for the one year liquid metal
aging test and next up is going to be
air cooler so I've been wanting to do
this since December of 2017 we can
finally do a pretty big air cooler
roundup with a bit of a Gian twist to it
I won't reveal what that is yet but both
of these will be in use for that and
then I can just assign one monitor to
each bench so these are those cheaper
monitor arms I mentioned where I can
just set this one up to run on this
bench this one else around on that bench
and that will be very productive so
that's the plan there nothing's going on
here right now I need to clean off some
of that for case building I think is the
plan which we like this goes right under
light so it's good for building systems
parish flight testing is on hold
presently while we wait for Patrick
stone to have some availability to
advance it fantastic you've been waiting
for fantastic we do have that you can
see the wind tunnel back there really
it's it's a flow tunnel not a wind
tunnel
so Corsair one of their thermal
engineers it has been helping me
troubleshoot an issue I had with our
custom PCB for Fantastic and he was able
to figure out all the problems that I
had with it that had me stuck for the
last several months like five months now
so he figured it out he fixed it he just
put it in the mail that's on the way
back to us and we'll be able to finally
start doing fantastic but GPUs are gonna
slow us down now speaking of we can go
over and look at the GPU test setup -
for RTX still a mess by the way we need
to get like Paul from Paul's hardware to
come out here and help us figure out how
to make an organization blog like that's
a hundred thousand years wherein we
break down boxes and organize he's an
expert at it I don't know how he does it
I like the video to you by the way
that's not a knock on Paul they're good
so this room is starting to get
interesting these were just we just part
of these waiting for them to drain a bit
this is not going to permanently be on a
plate
don't move eventually so you part of
there's just just to make it a bit nicer
in here this one will probably move over
too
the video set in the background on the
shelf at some point I need to drill a
hole in the bottom for drainage and we
have other than other plants on the
table at you I saw earlier so yeah
that's just kind of nice nice to have
some some life in here and then for
non-life we have computers
so this is our GPU test bench first one
i've set up here first first nonpolar
bench ice out of here
there's no r-tx in here you're not
seeing anything special behind the
scenes I'm sorry it's just a 1080 but
I'm setting it up everyone knows we're
gonna be testing our TX soon so setting
up for brand new suite of games some of
the old ones are coming back and it's
nice because the GPU bench is next to
where I'm going to be sitting once I
built the production system so I can
turn start a test and then turn back and
do some work and for that we have I set
up an ultra-wide that I bought so
there's a Dell electrolyte I bought used
there's an old Dell 16 by 10 monitor I
finally put the ultra whites are
actually not that great for real estate
because you can fit three things but it
takes a lot of time to manually size
them so two monitors from I set up
finally and maybe a third for some other
stuff but yeah so that'll be my station
we need to do a live stream and build
all the computers soon haven't set a
date on that yet hoping to do a
multi-camera live stream but that's the
progress for this room one more room to
look at so the storage room filled in
pretty fast
we have for example three trays of rice
and processors down here and bunch of
trace of memory video cards are all
stood up for the most part room yachting
in five more of the yellow video card
stands up here up here I might add some
over here oh no we got a lot of video
cards CPUs are all in memories on the
other side that's all in so lots of
stuff and what we needed was a swap
space shelf so we just installed that
today Patrick and Andrew worked on that
and I mean here I've got like liquid
coolers air coolers motherboards
motherboards motherboards dead
motherboards cases cases everywhere to
be reviewed shelf and there's stuff on
that side too and then the new shop last
shelf was built today so it's just a six
foot wide one but I think the plan is
the bottom will be stuff that needs to
go so it's stuff that we're giving away
the local friends or something like they
were using it in our own systems because
we're gonna run out of space obviously
so stuff that needs to go we'll go here
having a special place for it will force
me to cycle stuff into it so that we can
then cycle stuff out and maybe we'll
just like leave it there and it might be
a system of like if you work here and
you see something there that you want
you can take it or something like that
otherwise we'll find someone else to
take it so that'll be getting rid of and
then I don't know what we're gonna put
on here yet but I'm positive we'll fill
it up pretty quickly so that's the
upgrade also there's a vacuum over there
but and GPUs are going to be really
occupying my time for the next couple
weeks so it's gonna be a busy busy few
weeks for us but thank you for watching
as always you can subscribe for more and
you should you can go to store documents
access net to pick up a shirt like this
one or our full gamers Nexus logo sure
to restocked a lot of them recently I
think we have a couple of women's shirts
coming in soon too for the graph logo
design as well so check out store die
gamers Nexus done that for that stuff
that would've been funny of the class
right now get a paycheck Comstock a MERS
