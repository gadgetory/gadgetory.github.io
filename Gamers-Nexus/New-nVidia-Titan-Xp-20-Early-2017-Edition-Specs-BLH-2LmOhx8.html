Nintendo for making fun of their DS
naming scheme previously because it
appears they're not the only ones who do
that if razor is at late 2016 blade
wasn't enough for you and Vidya is now
back with their third iteration of the
Titan X which is of course alongside
their multiple iterations of the shield
brand name so it's not new to Nvidia
either this new Titan X is actually
called Titan XP before that this
coverage is brought to you by the
Computex conference which runs from May
30th to June 3rd in Taipei Taiwan this
year Computex is the biggest event of
the year for PC hardware and technology
where we preview the newest prototypes
before they come to market
we highly recommend attending or
following this event online for industry
professionals and enthusiasts learn more
at the link in the description below so
very important here Titan XP the new one
not the not to be confused the other one
that came out a few months ago this one
has a lower KSP so that's important that
signifies a difference previously we
call the Titan X Pascal card Dighton XP
as did most other media because the
reason for that was because we had Titan
X Maxwell before so there was Titan X
and then Titan X launched and now
there's Titan XP so the differentiation
is getting a little difficult this will
make things of course suboptimal if
you're buying or selling secondhand
online because I I can almost guarantee
you at some point someone is going to
accidentally buy a Titan X Maxwell or a
Titan X Pascal 2016 Edition card when
what they mean to buy is something like
a Titan XP Pascal 2017 Edition card so
the new car let's go through the specs
and kind of get on track here the new
card is called Nvidia Titan X lowercase
P there's no GeForce GTX in there they
have distanced it from the gaming brand
in that way it is just NVIDIA Titan XP
no GTX and further it's got some similar
specs to the previous Titan X Pascal
from 2016 it's got 12 gigabytes of g5x
so the same gddr5 X setup as previously
except one important thing which is that
they are now running the faster micron
memory as found on the 1080 TI that
launched very recently so that is
operating at eleven point four gigabits
per second whereas previously the Titan
X was at ten gigabits per second as was
the GTX 1018 on TI the 1080 TI shipped
with memory that's 11 gigabits per
second and this is 1111 point for more
or less the same so that's been updated
there's also been an update to the
actual GPU the chip that is on the PCB
that peat that GPU for Titan X lower
case P is its housing 3840 CUDA cores as
opposed to the previous Titan X capital
P Pascal card which had 3584 so 3840 on
Titan X lower case P and 3584 on Titan X
capital P to do this assuming the
everything is the same which for the
architecture probably is the only reason
that wouldn't be is if they're pulling
something out of GP 100 territory and
doing some kind of focus on FP 64 or
something which I don't think is the
case assuming everything is the same
which is a fair assumption basically
you're looking at two extra SMS because
it's an extra 256 cores you pretty
easily divide that by 2 you've got 128
so 2 SM because each item is 128 CUDA
cores so that's an increase of about 7%
and core count and not always a linear
increase in performance that gives you
an idea as to the overhead versus the
original Titan X capital P and this may
end up being the biggest of the big
pascal chips and meaning that there will
probably not be another refresh after
this this is more or less than max that
Pascal can do now you look at something
like GP 100
I think that has 56 SMS but the SM
layout and the organization structure is
different with GP 100 does it's an
accelerator card so 1 GP 100 cares about
different things like double precision
it's got FP 64 allocation in there and
then 2 it's just a different SM and an
organizational structure so for GP 102
and the line that we're familiar with in
this space
this looks like just a Titan X with an
extra two SMS and the memory change it
operates at 1600 megahertz we're not
really clear on how high it can go under
the right thermal conditions yet because
we don't have one but 1600 megahertz is
the advertised rate other than that I
there's not much more I guess the price
well there's two more things that are
important price and Apple news I guess
so on the price it's $1,200 that's what
Titan x capital P was when it launched
presumably that will be reduced in price
and now you can get Titan next lower KSP
for 1200 - hush instead this is just to
kind of be clear not something we'd
recommend for basically all of our
audience if you are gaming and you want
the highest end GPU Vega notwithstanding
because it doesn't exist yet to purchase
if you want the highest end GPU still
1080 or 1080 Ti is what you should be
looking at this is not going to get you
a lot more performance especially we
look at the Titan X capital P benchmarks
we did last year versus the 1080 the
performance gain there are definitely
diminishing returns there so in terms of
your value you should not really be
considering this necessarily as a gaming
device but for professionals potentially
it's worth looking at primarily because
there's Apple support now so that means
hackintosh will start working with the
ten series cards that's kind of
interesting not really our coverage
spectrum but I'm sure some of you care
about that so hackintosh will be
compatible there's the driver update for
Apple devices presumably this might
indicate that the Titan X lowercase P
will be implemented in some of the
forthcoming Apple devices that would be
a safe assumption and that's really all
the info we have for you for now
so not sure if we're gonna have
benchmarks for this one it's not really
in our wheelhouse in terms of I mean
we're just replying not gonna recommend
it for gaming so why would they send us
one but we'll see if we do we'll
certainly do videos do hybrid builds all
that stuff otherwise stay tuned for the
other coverage thank you for watching as
