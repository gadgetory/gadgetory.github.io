we're going to be taking a look at EVGA
stake on a high-end GTX 10 80 TI PCB
this right here is the FTW three and so
a little bit of backstory to some of the
design decisions that EVGA made with
this card the first 10 series FTW cards
the 1070 FTW and the 1080 FTW got quite
a lot of negative coverage when a few
people had the vrm explode on them and
the first thing everybody sort of jumped
at and started to blame was vrm
temperatures because EVGA those cards
the vrm would sort of run between a
hundred and maybe a hundred twenty
degrees and you know most people don't
know that VR ends are basically built to
run at 125 that's why I do all my
temperature rent ratings at 125 mall
sets can withstand 125 degrees operating
temperature absolutely no problem you
know the data sheets often have ratings
that assume no active cooling whatsoever
so no heat sink on the MOSFETs at all
admittedly those ratings are much much
lower in terms than compared to ratings
where the temperature of the MOSFET is
actually something reasonable like say
125 degrees or 100 degrees centigrade
and so basically everybody panics over
the like everybody first blame the the
vrm temperatures that eventually like
EVGA have figured out what what it was
that was causing the issues
unfortunately I you know a lot of the
details are not for public like and
under NDA
however basically what happened EVGA got
components that were faulty from a
supplier and EVGA being in GPU
manufacturer not a component testing
facility went and use those components
assuming that they actually passed
the quality assurance that the
manufacturer should have done on them
and well some of the vrm has exploded
due to manufacturing defects that you
know EVGA had no way of ever finding
like realistically there's nothing EVGA
could have done to find out that this
specific component was causing the
issues because you know if they were
like if you think of think about it it's
like where does the testing for faulty
components stop do you do you stop at
like the complex things or the not so
complex things like that's the thing and
so EVGA really just got really unlucky
that they were sent components that had
a tendency to blow up and whoever ended
up with those who components was equally
unlucky as EVGA basically but because of
all those sort of the initial you know
negative coverage of FTW vrm
temperatures EVGA is really really
overcompensating on the vrm cooling here
I mean look at this thing this is a
copper contact play a copper contact
play a thermal pad for the vrm right
there so this is all the MOSFETs
imprinted and there you have your
drivers and doublers and printed as well
so we have the copper contact plate then
a heat pipe and then this massive
aluminum plate which if you see the the
teardown video up on the channel then
there's like on the other side of the
this plate there is a lot of surface
area so EVGA have gotten kind of insane
and they've also gone in like there's a
thermal pad for the inductors which
generally like those are one of the most
heat tolerant components out there they
really don't need cooling and then
there's a thermal title the capacitors
which does actually sort of make sense
because capacitors are generally the
most temperature sensitive component of
an entire vrm however most manufacturers
don't bother with putting thermal pads
on capacitors at all and then there's
another thermal pad back here for the
capacity for risk for these capacitor
banks and then you have this little
l-shaped thing which goes over oops
which goes over these components right
here we
our fan controllers which like I have no
idea why those are getting cold like I
could understand the capacitors and the
inductors but fan controllers really
high either way EVGA is going you know
absolutely insane with the cooling on
this card mostly because of all the past
contra past negative coverage of vrm
temperatures so this time around the
temperatures should be low very very low
actually so now let's actually take a
look at the PCB which is probably what
you all care came for before that this
content is brought to you by our patreon
backers you can go to
patreon.com/crashcourse alves out
directly which helps us with this
in-depth reporting because it takes
quite a bit of time and that direct
support is necessary you can also go to
store dot gamers nexus botnet if you
prefer to pick up one of our three new
shirt designs this is a really nice card
let's just start it off with that but
before we get into why I like it we're
going to go over all the minor little
all the all the various minor VRMs that
are necessary for a 1080 teait function
so starting off with this thing right
here that is a voltage regulator that
converts 3.3 volts into 1.8 volts for
the BIOS chips and some of the internal
PLL's of the of NVIDIA GPUs and there
are two BIOS chips here you do get dual
BIOS functionality on this card which i
think is a really nice feature to have
as if you're messing around with bios is
for whatever reason having dual BIOS
makes your life so much easier
because if you flash a BIOS and you know
you flash your BIOS you recent you try
to restart and you get a black screen
you just have to flick this switch right
here then you can recent try restart
again this time around it should boot up
unless you flashed both BIOS chips for
some inexplicable reason and then so now
you boot up you get into Windows you
flick the switch again and you flash the
bad BIOS chip and your card will work as
if nothing ever happened to it which is
why the dual BIOS feature is like you
find it on a lot of overclocker cards
and it's really really nice
to have in my opinion really for me this
is one of those features where I'd
actually choose this is one of those
features where I actually prioritize it
over a lot of other things like assuming
there's two cards with the same vrm and
everything else if one of them has a bio
storage I'm just taking the one with the
bottle switch I don't really care about
the rat about any more of the details so
that's a nice feature that the card has
then below that we find the 1.8 volts
for the gddr5 X this is a supporting
voltage for the gddr5 X chips they
basically needed to function it doesn't
really do anything for overclocking but
it is worth knowing that it's there so
yeah down here we find the well actually
it's on the back of the PCB but we do
see part of it this is the 1 volt
PE x or PLL voltage whichever you prefer
to call it and this power is the PLL's
and internal PLL's of the GPU core
without this the card will not function
on air cooling and water cooling
adjusting this voltage through physical
modifications to the card doesn't do
anything for overclocking on liquid
nitrogen you can gain extra stability
and better overclocks by tweaking this
voltage up so yeah now we finally get to
a vrm I'm kind of excited about this is
the vcore vrm the thing that gets all of
that cooling so a sock voltage for the
gtx 980ti is 1.06 volts and video limits
you to a maximum of 1.09 3 volts when
overclocking so you know that's not
really that great a voltage range and
Pascal cards do scale somewhat with
extra voltage not a ton but somewhat you
can pick up a few tens of megahertz by
going past and videos voltage cap using
physical modifications or there's a few
cards out there where you can do it
through software
the problem with actually exceeding the
1.0 93 voltage is your power consumption
just goes through the route like
absolutely shoots through the roof
and you only really pick up something
like you know fifty to maybe even a
hundred megahertz at best so not really
worth it on liquid nitrogen however
voltages as high as 1 point 6 and 1
point 6 volts vcore have been used for
benchmarking purposes because more
voltage generally means higher clocks
assuming that everything is working as
it should so now that's the week or VRM
and then up here we find the memory vrm
so that power that provides one point
three five volts all right memory
provides one point three five volts to
all of the gddr5 X chips around the GPU
core so then with those out of the way
let's take a closer look at the actual
make up of say the V Corps v RM first so
at first glance this V core vrm looks
like a one two three four five six seven
eight nine ten phase and it is in fact a
ten phase as we do have one two three
four five six seven eight nine ten
driver ICS as well as one two three four
five doublers because you cannot
actually buy a ten phase voltage
controller the voltage controller on
this card is located right on the other
side of the PCB right on in this spot
and it is a MCP eight one two seven four
this is an eight phase voltage
controller capable of going up to one
point two megahertz switching frequency
and we're here it is running in five
phase mode so you basically have five
PWM signals go into the doublers like so
and then they split the signal between
two drivers actually i've mists that one
goes like that
this one goes like this and so the so
the vrm basically is controlled in this
setup and the actual doublers and driver
is used on this card the well starting
with the doublers those are NCP
CP 8 1 1
62 and these are cool because they do
actually feature load balancing between
the two phases which is a sort of more
advanced doubling feature that some
other doublers like you can get some
doublers which literally just move the
signal between switch the PWM pulses
between the two phases which does mean
that the phases can get really out of
balance in terms of current and by that
I mean you could have one phase with
like 50 amps going through it and
another phase with say 10 amps going
through it and the actual doubler can't
do anything about it it's not within its
capabilities however the doubler EVGA is
using here the NCP eight one one sixty
two does include current balancing so it
will actually if one phase is
significantly
I have significantly higher load on it
than another phase it will actually skip
a signal for the phase that is pulling
more current so basically dropping the
current through that phase going through
that phase down very very quickly it's
not the best like it still doesn't be
like say the voltage regulation
achievable on a true a phase design with
a high end voltage controller but as far
as doubling schemes go this is the next
like this is the next best option so
yeah and the reason why you want actual
current balance between your phases is
basically gets you better life span for
the vrm you know the term thermals are
better spread out across the MOSFETs the
other benefit is it does improve voltage
regulation a little bit as and it also
puts less strain on your 12 volt rail so
your power supply will actually last
longer if you have a vrm that balances
the current through the phase is better
because one if basically when a phase
turns on your PSU see that is a massive
current spike coming on which is
filtered by this capacitor bank here and
here and these capacitors as well as
these chokes so it's not like that's not
suppressed your PSU actually will never
see a
a massive amount of noise that evita
that a gpus main vrm produces but it is
better if the vrm just produces less
noise to start with as that does put
less strain on the capacitors behind it
as well as the chokes so yeah that's
sort of the benefit of the NTP a1 162
now the drivers are here also important
because the NCP 8:1 158 driver is not
actually capable of hitting the turn on
and it will fall rise and fall times of
the maus dual n fats used inside the CRM
so EVGA here has opted for dual NFS so
you basically get two packages per phase
like that so you have one here and one
here and these are both alpha and omega
semiconductor e 69 30s and dual NFS
basically means that there is a high
side masa and a low side MOSFET built
into one chip as well as the diodes
necessary for them to run and the spec
on these is your high side masa in one
of these and your low side set in one of
these are seven million ohms high side
and one milli ohm low side at 5 volts
gate drive and the reason why I'm
spiking the 5 volt figure here is
because the NCP eight one eight one 108
one 158 the drivers here do not support
higher gate drive voltages and 5 volts
they run on 5 volts and they drive the
vrm with 5 volts so that does mean like
higher gate drive voltages get you
better perform a set performance lower
gate drive voltages put less strain on
the actual drivers and these sort of
balance the efficiency of the vrm
differently at lower loads having lower
gate drive voltage generally as benefit
will generally be beneficial for your
efficiency as you're not spending so
much power on just turning a phase on
where is that very very high loads when
you have a ton of current going through
the VRM you would prefer a
driving voltage because your main losses
at that point is the current going
through the VRM not the act of turning
it on and off so they're trading driver
efficiency for vrm performance is a
better idea but here with this vrm which
is incredibly overkill which we will get
to very soon EVGA has resulted four five
volts a drive which actually most
manufacturers just go straight for 5
volts gate drive on GPUs so yeah that's
that now interesting little issue with
the the other reason why the drivers
here are important the NCPA 1 158 is
these respects to rise and fall a MOSFET
a high side MOSFET in 16 nanoseconds and
11 nanoseconds for the full time the
issue with that is is that the e 69 30s
under perfect conditions can achieve
four nanoseconds fall
I mean rise and three nanoseconds fall
in three nano so yeah and basically that
means that the MOSFETs here are kind of
under driven so they can't actually
achieve those switching those speeds
however the end result for the actual
vrm efficiency here is not really like
it doesn't really impact in the AR m in
a negative way as you still end up with
a vr m that is capable of doing 1.09 3
volts at 125 degrees centigrade 300
kilohertz switching frequency on the
actual MOSFETs
so that would be 600 kilohertz on this
line right here that would be running at
600 kilohertz from the voltage
controller then you get 300 kilohertz on
the coming out of the doublers so
assuming 300 kilohertz switching
frequency 125 degrees operating
temperature and 101.9 3 volts output
voltage this erm can do out 250 amps
with only 22 watts of heat loss this is
better than basically every other 10
pti out there slightly better it's not a
huge difference but it is a small
improvement over other ten ATT eyes
except maybe some of the ones using the
international rex except say the strikes
and the extreme for the Auris extreme
card from gigabyte which both of those
using uh both of those use power stages
which do have a very high efficiency
that's the main reason why those things
exist so 250 ohms 22 watts that's a very
nice like you know rating here a
completely achievable with the
ridiculous overkill cooling system the
EVGA packs this card with and this is
actually higher than the average current
draw that a 1080 TI will draw its stock
and even even when overclocked you will
not be going much past this as Nvidia
does limit you to say 350 watts whole
card draw so you're not really going to
be going much past this figure now if
you were to remove all restrictions and
hard mod your voltage you might actually
be able to achieve save for uh and I
can't draw over the screw hole 400 amps
you know what I'm just going to put it
down here 400 amps current draw at which
point this vrm would produce 45 watts of
heat still completely sustainable on
this cooling system you'd still be able
to stay under the 125 degrees and in
fact 400 amps is doable on these MOSFETs
even at much much higher temperatures as
a 125 degrees you can also go up to 600
amps at which point this vrm would
produce 840 watts and this is going
beyond like liquid nitrogen power
consumption on a 1080 Ti no card will
ever pull this no 1080 GI will ever pull
this much current but if by some but if
you were to say cut this vrm off and
hook it up to something else that did
need 600 amps it can do it with 84 watts
of heat output at 125 degrees and this
is also the same amount of current and
roughly the same amount of heat as what
you would see on say the Asus 1080 TI
Strix and the ACE and the gigabytes
extreme card the Auris extreme
oh really this matches a lot of the like
the the top and GTX the other top-end
GTX 10 ATT is in terms of power
capabilities now if you absolutely want
to hit the maximum of this V RMS
capability 920 amps going past 920 amps
at 125 degrees centigrade will blow up
the most sets and if you are at 120 amps
it will produce 164 watts of heat so we
will be running very very hot and that's
mostly why this rating right here isn't
actually realistically achievable as you
will not be able to dissipate that much
heat and if the temperature goes up a
little bit or the current goes slightly
beyond that 920 amp figure there's a
very high probability that one of the
high side MOSFETs in this vrm will die
and you know when that happens the whole
vrm stops working basically so yeah the
vcore vrm here is really really nice I
have nothing to complain about it's good
for liquid nitrogen it's fine it's
totally overkill for any kind of normal
usage this card is going to be seeing
the memory vrm is the same law sets and
saying similar driver restrictions the
memory vrm will never really need to put
out more than 30 amps and at 30 amps
output it will be producing about 3 to 4
watts of heat so really not worth
worrying about most cards actually don't
most other 1080 tea eyes don't even
bother cooling the memory vrm at all
there's no thermal pads and no heatsink
on it EVGA has however opted yet again
to you know heat sink everything in that
we are and that's the 12-volt capacitors
there the chokes aren't heatsink 12-volt
capacitors don't get heat sinks the
MOSFET well 12 volt capacitors do get
heat sinks the MOSFET get the MOSFETs
get heat sinks and even the output
capacitor bank gets gets heat sinks so
yeah you know cooling
on absolutely everything maximum current
rating on the memory vrm would be about
92 amps and we are talking about the
same 125 degrees 300 kilohertz just
different voltage 92 amps and and 16
watts of heat so yeah that's where
you're looking at there yeah you know
it's a very nice grm it's a very nice
card it's kind of sad that you know
you'll never actually get to use the
full capabilities of the ridiculous
overkill VR and that EVGA ships it with
but it is you know it is the second
highest and 10a DTI that EVGA is going
to be making as we will probably be
seeing the 1080 TI king thing in the
kingpin Edition sometime soon
that thing is going to mean I'm like I
can't wait to get to you know see that
things and that's going to be amazing if
by any chance you do want to go and at
least try to fully utilize the vrm if
you want to lift the power limit on your
to eight pins these shunts right here if
you short them with liquid metal thermal
paste you will basically trick the GPU
into thinking it's pulling less power
than it actually is and then your power
limit essentially to end up being higher
if you try to short them out by Sol
during it's very likely that you will
run into an video safety restrictions
which will detect if the power
consumption by the caro-kann the power
consumption reported by the GPU is too
low the card will go into safety mode
and you will no longer be able to run at
full 3d clocks so that's why I recommend
using liquid metal now if you don't want
to go you know have liquid metal on
chunks the other option is that there
are these three capacitors around the
actual chip that monitors the currents
going through the card which is this
thing right here that's a Texas
Instruments current monitoring chip if
you put 12 for the reference 10a DTI
it's 10 Oh
resistors on - well if you put ten ohm
resistors in parallel with these
capacitors on a reference 10a DTI it
cuts your power consumption sumption
into 1/3 so yeah that that's the option
for those of you handy with a soldering
pen and who don't care about your
warranty I mean technically modding the
shunts would sort of fall into the
territory of modding you're like you
know voiding your warranty but the thing
about the liquid metal is it's very easy
to remove it's not going to stay there
if you don't want it to so yeah just
going to point that out I'm not going to
debate about doing it or not so that is
it for the card I think I've made a
plenty obvious I am impressed by what
EVGA has done here you know I would have
no like sure if you're considering
getting this card go right ahead it is
quite high in terms of MSRP it is at
around seven hundred and eighty dollars
however a lot of the other high-end 1080
T eyes are in sort of the same price
bracket and most of them don't have a
BIOS which which personally for mean
that makes this card worth it compared
to the other ones but uh if you don't
need the BIOS switch then yeah it's your
money do whatever that you want so thank
