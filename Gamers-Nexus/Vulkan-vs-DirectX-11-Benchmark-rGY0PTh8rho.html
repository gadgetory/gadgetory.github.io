this week with their Vulcan
announcements the API was fully ratified
so version 1.0 of the Vulcan API
specification has been finalized and AMD
first announced its beta drivers for the
Vulcan api compatible presently only
with the Talos principle which is a game
by Croteam and NVIDIA later about a
couple hours later actually came out and
said that they had their own drivers
available and they very explicitly
stated in the press release that their
drivers were not beta unlike some other
people and they were fully conformant
and all these other things they did a
bit of a subtle slam to Andy maybe not
so subtle and we reported on that on the
website and then later Nvidia came out
and said we had a misprint in our press
release our drivers actually our beta
but they are fully conformant so make of
that what you will but the point is that
both companies have beta drivers
available for the Talos principle and
for the Vulkan API initial integration
for the gaming world the Talos principle
has not fully optimized its Vulcan
integration the inclusion of the API is
presently in very early stages and the
Talos principle team has indicated that
even DirectX 9 performance used to
outrank DirectX 11 performance within
the game but later optimizations
resolved and switched over that
performance so DirectX 11 now as it
should outperforms dx9 the team expects
the same thing to happen with Vulcan
noting in its own FAQ that performance
is low currently due to the early state
of the build but they do expect a
switchover point at which time Volken
will overtake DirectX 11 for performance
test methodologies in the article linked
to the description below
we used AMD drivers 16 dot 15 dot 1009
bida 4 and Nvidia's 350 6.39 vulcan beta
drivers now these Nvidia drivers are
actually technically a bit older than
their most recent driver but they're the
only ones that initially supported
Vulcan we were not able to collect our
usual 1% low and 0.1% mobile metrics
because our logging software does not
pass through Vulcan currently and so we
were forced to use the games FPS logging
system and said fortunately though the
Talos principle actually has an
exceptionally well built benchmark and
does
poor low frame rates and averages and
all these other metrics that we can use
in a very useful way we ran the test
currently in some pretty limited
scenarios so we're only looking at the
390x and 980ti and very clearly I want
to say that this is not a 390x reverse
980ti benchmark first of all it's not a
linear comparison and secondly where we
are looking at DirectX 11 versus Vulcan
not the x12 and not 980 versus 390 it's
just Volk inverse dx11
on each of these cards individually and
then also we looked at this on only a 59
30 K which is a good CPU to make sure
we're GPU bad for the most part but one
of the things with these new api is is
that they should enable lower m cpus
like the i threes to better perform in a
way that removes some of the draw calls
geometric complexities from the cpu and
pushes it on to the GPU and that will
improve the performance of low-end CPUs
by moving their tasks to parallel
processors ie GPUs so that's not
something we tested just yet we want to
wait for Vulcan and the Croteam game to
update a bit more first and mature but
for now this is what we've got and let's
just look at the benchmarks right now at
1080p Ultra we observed a performance
disparity of fifty seven point eight
nine percent for the r9 390x
favoring d3d eleven seventy five point
five FPS for Vulcan and one hundred
thirteen point three fps averaged over
three passes for DirectX 11 and that
amounts to the averages with the low
performance at forty one point six FPS
versus eighty eight point one FPS the
nine eighty I had a performance delta of
forty four point four seven that favored
DirectX 11 and the nine eighty I at
1080p ultra ran 90.7 FPS average with a
fifty seven point seven fps low on
Vulcan and it had one twenty seven point
two FPS average versus 98.3 fps low on
d3 D 11 so again a favorable gain for D
3 D 11 over Vulcan moving on to 4k at
Ultra settings AMD's r9 390x shows a
performance disparity of forty seven
point eight percent between Vulcan and D
3 d eleven favoring microsoft's
established api d 3 d eleven or DirectX
11 the low performance is fairly tightly
times
the averages at 22.1 fps low and 29.9
FPS average versus 39.2 FPS low and
forty eight point seven FPS average
depending on which api you're looking at
Nvidia interestingly fronts a thirty one
point six seven percent performance
disparity between Vulcan and d3d eleven
favoring DirectX 11 and that's a
significant lead over AMD and FPS
Delta's at 4k sorry Kiryas to see
whether Nvidia can maintain its present
advantage in the deltas anyway between
Vulcan and d3d 11 and again not between
the nighty I of the 390x is just between
the eight P is as that's what we care
about so it'll be interesting to see if
they can continue that lead as the API
matures and as the crow team development
group continues advancing its own games
support of Vulcan so what does this mean
for gamers well right now there's no
real reason to use the Vulcan API with
the Talos principle as that is the only
game that supports it on Windows anyway
so with the Vulkan API currently you
have to opt into a beta with the Talos
principle it crashes a whole lot and it
doesn't really perform nearly as well as
DirectX 11 and we were seeing 50%
disparities in some cases so it's not
something I'd recommend for anyone other
than someone who's benchmarking or is an
enthusiast really curious to see what
Volcom looks like or maybe your
developer and you just kind of want to
get into a debug mode or something and
check it out from another team so those
are the only real reasons to run Vulcan
right now but as this thing matures it
could actually become a better option
than DirectX 11 we'll see how that goes
but in theory that's how it should work
it just really depends on the driver
teams at Nvidia AMD and the CRO team
development group at the making the
Talos principle so that's kind of what
we're waiting on right now Volken and
DirectX 12 do not currently exist in the
same game together so we can't do a dx12
versus vulcan test right now in a linear
fashion though in game DX 12 really
there's a couple there's the their new
fable game there's the upcoming Gears of
War games should be DirectX 12 sortie
out for consoles and will be coming to
PC eventually I suppose but the Vulcan
doesn't exist in either of those of
course ashes of singularity is another
big dx12 benchmarking
am also does not have Vulcans so until a
point at which they exist in the same
title we can't do a head-to-head but for
now it looks like DirectX 11 is a bit
advantaged over Vulcan in a tiles
principle and we're excited to benchmark
the two going forward as both drivers
and the game update so that is all for
