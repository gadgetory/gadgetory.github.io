that net and we've got a quick news
update front for you from the AMD front
so just yesterday we posted a video
about the Intel skylake CPUs the
remainder of the skylake family
following the 6700 K and 6600 K lineup
and today we're talking about Andy so
biostar posted a new specifications page
for their motherboards upcoming on the
FM 2 plus platform and that page
revealed a couple of specs and items in
the new and the apu lineup andy already
has had its Kaveri architecture out for
some time now debuting on the 7850 k8n
apu and some 8 8 AP use as well and that
platform has matured the architectures
matured so more recently there was the
god of very refresh and got a very was
Andy's internal name for the Kaveri
refresh so as far as we're concerned
it's Kaveri refresh and those were
shipped as the 7870 K and similar
basically add 22 the SKU for each of the
AP use and that's what you got with God
a very and that was a an update to the
frequency offered on each chip so we
reviewed the 7870 k recently and found
that at its initial $150 price point its
usefulness was kind of debatable
especially when you looked at cheap DGP
user plus a cheap cpu like an d zone 8
60 k kaveri apu with the IGP disabled or
intel's g 325 a pentium cpu the new
units that we're talking about today
would be the a-10 7890 k the athlon x4
880 K and the 876 90 K so again adding
xx to the skew of the existing refreshed
Kaveri and original Kaveri units
starting with the one that is most
interesting to me the athan X 480 K is a
refresh of the 870 K which never shipped
what was promised in 2015 at the
midpoint but we have not seen it on
market yet and that refreshed the 860 K
which is a pretty popular CPU for those
who don't need the IEP component
the APU and are looking to spend less
than $100 on a CPU prices are TBD for
the new AP use and the new CPU the 80k
but giving a frame of reference we can
look at the existing lineup
so these 78 70 K which is an a-10 APU
that the 70 90 K is refreshing was
priced at currently $140 but shipped at
150 originally and we've seen it as low
as 120 on Amazon during certain sales
the athlon x4 860 K because the 870 was
never made publicly available
they 860 K is a $75 CPU so we would
expect the 80k that hopefully still be
less than $100 but you have to expect a
slight hike over the $75 mark for the
860 and then the 76 70 K is priced at
$118 with the other 7600 series the 76
50 K priced at 108 dollars on Amazon or
new Agra wherever you want to look the
new units from AMD see a slight clock
rate increase which has been their
tradition lately with the are 300 series
and the Kaveri got a very lineup being
announced the 7890 KC's a 200 megahertz
increase over the Sony 870 K which it is
replacing and the 80 K also sees a 200
megahertz increase over the 860 K it's
only a hundred megahertz over the
unreleased it's 70 K as for these 76 9
TK apu that one's a bit more interesting
it is a 400 megahertz gain over the
existing 76 7d k APU which I believe is
clocked at 3.3 gigahertz so that is
becoming more reasonable and the product
offerings in general we'll see how they
fall when the prices are announced when
the benchmarks are released but from our
standpoint it is currently a very good
value to buy an on I GP APU like the 860
K or the g3 2 5 8 on the intel side and
then couple that with a cheap d GPU even
the 250 X is substantially better than
the APU iGPS and significantly better
than the Intel AGP is despite
improvement with the HD 530 this is
something we've
in depth in the past and we stand by it
now suggesting generally the DGP you
solution plus the cpu solution if you
want any kind of gaming at a reasonable
frame rate if you're just playing
something like dota 2 and you want to do
it in maybe an HT PC with very limited
space and a very low thermal head room
then the APU is make some sense but at
the current prices $140 for these 70 and
70 K it's still not a great Buy
it's something we would definitely
consider at the 120 ish dollar price
point for the 7870 K going forward
it looks like the AMD refresh will just
continue to increase the clock rate
slightly that's all I've done with gada
Barry thus far and the are 300 series
saw a thermal package improvement which
we've seen got very as well slightly and
also a move to a 50 megahertz pre
overclock on the are 300 series so AMD
is really up against the wall in terms
of its silicon and the potential offered
by that silicon there's not much more
room to go and they can't make the die
physically larger because they're up
against the fabrication process limit
which will not change until moving to a
smaller process node so that is all for
the AMD APU and new CPU news definitely
check the website for more information
you can get the full chart there as well
that we've probably flashed up a few
times at this point and if you like this
kind of content check the patreon link
in the post role video we're really
excited to have a lot of you backing us
now and we hope to continue rolling
forward in the fashion of getting more
user backers and building a community
for the website so as always gamers
