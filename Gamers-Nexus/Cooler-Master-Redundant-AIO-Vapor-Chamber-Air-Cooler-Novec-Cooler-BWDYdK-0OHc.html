looking at cooling probably no surprise
that coolermaster would have such a
product but we saw the cases already can
check that out if you want to see the H
100 Mini ITX case should be on the
channel around now what we have next is
a whole wall front back of cooling
products mostly liquid with some air
mixed in and then also there's going to
be a Novak cooling solution that should
go to market which is unlike most the
other Novak solutions we've seen in the
past still waiting for dere bauer to
actually make his before that this video
is brought to you by the gigabyte z3 90
ARS master motherboard which comes
equipped with one of the more powerful
z3 90 V RMS for heavier overclocks on
the new ninth gen Intel CPUs the ARS
master is also one of the few
motherboards with a real heatsink this
generation featuring a mix of high
surface area fins and looks oriented
hover blocks oh and it's also got
updated RTV illumination learn more at
the link below let's talk about the
master liquid ML 240 M mirage DIY this
is the one that's got the vortex in it
so that's not just like it for show thin
it should actually do that in reality
and the way it does the vortex or the
cyclone in the center is by switching
the impeller so from what I understand
it goes to a three-phase water pump and
the impeller and there's some on the
wall over here we might be able to film
the impeller has a shallower angle
between the impeller blades so the
blades end up a little closer together
and that creates the vortex spin that
you see in the in the pump and rest
combo so kind of cool the pedo you have
a cycle of the motherboard will impact
the cyclone a bit so depending on the
motherboard and the pitot am cycle each
one's gonna be a little bit different
the vortex may be more or less
exaggerated depending but that's part of
a an open-loop kit which seems to be
getting popular this show Corsair of
course launched there's clear mass has
been doing it for a little while this is
updated some of the cool things to point
out other than the obvious points of a
kit being that it includes everything is
there's a sort of cloudy or foggy hard
tubing so that's kind of nice got rid of
the soft tubing
and it gives you a unique look
considering people are kind of moving
away from the color pool cool and that
just going to everything up it still
lets you get some interesting looks in
it but pricing 250 to 300 dollars
probably not finally at
TBD on that likely a CES launch so
that'd be next year first quarter and
then the kit is a block a reservoir a
pump and a radiator with two fans I'll
come with the fittings and hard to mean
the amount of hard tubing and the count
of fittings that will come with it will
depend entirely on what coolermaster
decides it thinks makes sense for the
kit probably multiple excuse for
different CPU blocks so if you want like
maybe a TR or maybe an h EDT Intel might
have a separate SKU for that and the
dimensions of the impaler I'll mention
as well in the open-loop are bit larger
than the ones in the close loop so
impeller size does change based on the
loop and that's for I mean you've got
more space and the open loop to do a
bigger in power and get the cyclone
desired I think that covers that one for
the open loop kit the next one let's
talk about the the weird one on the hall
the master liquid dual mirage so this
one is largely a looks thing but it is
unique so we'll give it that it's got
two pumps in it the the design is
similar to the single pump Mirage so the
pumps aren't that different but it's
just two of them and this is I'll note a
prototype right now so not final you can
see like the PCB hanging out and soft
tubing and piano wire so it's a
prototype it's held together for the
show and it'll be cleaned up a bit
before launch they're looking at a CES
2020 launch for that one likely a two
hundred dollar price point and then the
cold plate might have an option that's
er for size as well if if you wanted it
that'd be a separate ski though it'll
depend on how popular the next TR 4 is
and there is going to be one aluminum
housing a RGB lights and it's it looks
focused I mean like you could make the
argument that two pumps will give you a
redundancy and the events of a failure
but realistically it is it is just
because it looks kind of different and
neat after that one we can talk about
maybe the master liquid vivid that's one
right next to me here not much to say so
it's got an LCD in it we've seen these
before they're not they're never really
particularly impressive but this one
does have a third probably a
thermocouple and it might be a
thermistor but it's got a thermal sensor
in it that's fed into the cold plate
which allows you to get a more at the
top level yhs reading of the CPU
temperature so that's kind
it'll read that out on top of the device
you can read PWM just from the tack and
that one Seamaster liquid vivid I don't
have a price on that one next one
so there's I'll mention this quickly on
air coin there's a - 12 X s II it's a
nickel-plated one it's the same fin
pitch it's the same fin density it's the
same heat pipe count it's the same heat
pipe type it's prolly centered and a
little higher RPI for RAM clearance but
otherwise it's I mean it's a 212 it just
looks different it's got nickel plating
so I might interest t12 fans the 3d BBC
next to it is much more interesting
though that one is a vapor chamber
design but it's a massive vapor chamber
so the vapor chamber goes down all the
way to the CPU and cuts across comes
back up it's where the heat pipes would
typically be except as a vapor chamber
instead and in theory this should
perform a bit better if you had a
like-for-like comparison that's kind of
hard to to really test but there's a few
reasons one vapor chamber and then - it
would in theory funnel the flow more
essentially maybe retain pressure of it
better from the fans but how that much
how that matters we'd have to see in
testing it is an interesting design
definitely 140 millimeter fan on that a
RGB it can have it's got two pens
actually and at 165 millimeters for the
height based on a rough show floor
measurement $130 target CES is a likely
launch date for that there's also a G
200 PG 400 feet these are really low
profile coolers one has lighting one
without
they'll both be $40 and the smaller ones
still 40 because it's got better
materials before heat pipe Spurs to heat
pipe design likely October for that and
then there's a rain stripper follow-up
that will be compatible with all the
sockets that's the ma 620 m probably
$100 August or September for that launch
similar to rate River just fits
everything finally the Novak cooling so
not gonna say too much about this it's
not final yet but nobody cooling we
showed with their Bauer solution last
year the phase change loop you showed in
the past system builds it's an
interesting thing to do but very
difficult to do at a retail scale and
coolermaster is going to be trying to do
that so Novak is a 3m
they're different boiling points for
Novak and the way it works is you have a
condenser on top typically of the case
and then you have the liquid inside you
submerge the components in the liquid
this is not new information but and
it'll boil off as it heats the Novak
fluid has a low boiling point the one
that cooler master is presently using is
a 40 degree Celsius boiling points I'm
told sometimes we've seen like 60 and it
boils it will go up evaporate go up to
the top of the case hit a condenser
condense back into liquid and drip back
down into the chassis that's how it
works it's not a novel idea but it would
be the first time we've seen it in a
retail product successfully if
Coolermaster can pull it off because a
few people have tried but it's never
quite done more than a show floor
presence so they're trying to do that
but that's it for cooler masters cooling
