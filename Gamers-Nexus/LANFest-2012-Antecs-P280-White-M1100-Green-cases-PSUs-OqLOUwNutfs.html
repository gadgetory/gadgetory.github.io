antec makes cases power supplies a
couple of liquid coolers and some other
stuff and i'm here with justin of antec
and he's going to tell us about a couple
of the cases they have here on these are
expansions of the p280 and the 1100 so
tell us what's going on your Justin
alright so we have two new versions of
the 1100 and the 28 here we have the
peach mating bite window and obviously
you can see we still have the double
hinge design big thing that we did was
try to incorporate what a lot of our
consumers wanted whatever with our
customers cars and you want a different
color you know fresh vibrant color we
hit the inside to the outside making me
believe me I really have a clear
plexiglass window as forces from our
performance one series so you can get
your breath build quality and you know
really really great sound damping
capabilities you also have filters on
the bottom okay and plenty of room
inside so you have to drive it all the
drive base you got 11 drive bays both
these meters just look these enclosures
and here we have this military green
color which is really nice mmm the
difference between the original and 100
and the m 1101 units is popping we see
that we've changed the one 200
millimeter talking to two 120mm intercom
facts this is so you can actually fit
our newest equitable system each full 20
it's gonna be coming out very soon oh
cool so it's a it's a dual radiator
that's true 240 millimeter eighties
there we go haha there we go alright so
here we have the p280 in white with the
with the sleek little window and the m
1100 on not too many cases out there
coming this military green so if you're
looking for something that is really
going to accommodate your battlefield or
modern warfare experience maybe i'll
take a look at this here m 1100 from
antec alright thanks Justin
and of course antec wouldn't be in sec
if we weren't looking at power supplies
so we've got a few models here let's
start with this one's the hcp 1200 this
is the highest wattage the antec offers
it is a hybrid modular power supply from
what I remember and it operates on a
trails so that's a lot of different ways
that power scare that power can be
outlet into your components and then we
have the high current gamer em series so
this is another hybrid modular series
but I really like about these got these
gets black wiring right here so it's
really hard to see it instead of chassis
so nice little touch there we haven't
booth wats Platinum's that's a mid-range
wattage power supply series it's 80 plus
platinum certified and then this guy
right here is a hike from pro platinum
1000 watt power supply so this is
probably the newest one they've offered
and as you can see down here it's got
full modularity and obviously they're
not afraid to show us the topology
design because the Atlantic it's very
high quality and I I'll see the stealth
wiring cable back there as well so you
need strong efficient reliable power
supplies antec is a brand that you can
check out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
