nexus net and today we're reviewing
zotac snoozy box en 760 mini gaming pc i
guess so this i almost said steam
machine and the reason for that is this
was originally intended to be a steam
machine along with the gigabyte brix
bricks pro and alien where's unit that
have all started shipping recently the
reason these are not branded as steam
machines and they are instead branded as
many gaming PC's is because valve has
pushed back their steam machine into
2015 while they finalize some controller
designs so what that means is that these
companies have all these resources tied
up in development they don't want this
hardware to go stale to become obsolete
they've got to ship these things now and
just brand them as a mini gaming pcs
then the end user that's us can very
easily install steamos on there if you
want to you can DIY steam machine if you
will let's run through the specs of this
box before getting into the benchmark
and thermal performance i have already
done a few short videos on this this one
we look at the actual review of the
product so the zbox en 760 is not even a
mini ITX system it's much it's smaller
than that it's seven by seven by two
inches a very small box that you can
actually mount via visa mount to the
back of a monitor or TV you can keep it
out of sight in that regard and its
target audience is gamers who would like
a living room pc or who would like a DB
our replacement that type of thing
basically it's an htpc with some gaming
prowess running through the specs both
units are identical other than two
capacities which i will talk about at
the end of this list the cpu is an intel
i5 4200 you cpu it is a dual-core cpu
and its native operating frequencies 1.6
gigahertz it is turbo-boosted to 2.6 a
gigahertz which is actually where it's
going to be resting most of the time for
gaming and is pretty okay for most games
as we'll find out in a minute the cpu is
a mobile unit and so is the GPU the GPU
is actually a gtx 860 em with two
gigabytes of dedicated gddr5 one memory
on a 128-bit bus and the reason I say
dedicated is just to make sure you know
it's not shared it is not shared with
the rest of the system you supply the
RAM for our networking the unit ships
with 802 11 AC wireless it uses an
antenna for that that is included so you
don't need an external card it has two
Ethernet port
has bluetooth 4.0 for USB 3.0 ports that
feel somewhat limiting as we'll talk
about in a minute one hdmi audio 1 3.5
millimeter audio and a card reader that
supports SD sdhc MMC SDXC anda and all
that good stuff and then for video out
we have DVI and HDMI so pretty standard
suite of things there the plus model has
to differences in that it includes RAM
and it includes a hard drive the
included RAM is a single 8 gigabyte
stick of ddr3 1600 megahertz memory and
the included hard drive is a one
terabyte 2.5 inch 5400 RPM drive I
strongly encourage you not to run on a
5400 RPM drive for two reasons one slow
to it'll be loud in any type of htpc
environment where you want absolute
silence so you can enjoy your
entertainment the DIY model which does
not include RAM or an HDD is priced at
five hundred forty dollars the plus
model which includes those two things is
priced at six hundred ninety dollars
that difference doing the math is one
hundred fifty dollars for one hundred
fifty dollars you can buy your own Ram
your own SSD or hard drive and it'll
outperform the plus model and you'll pay
the same so if you buy this if you're
considering at all before we even review
anything don't even look at the plus
model just look at the DIY model plus
it's more fun anyway so why not right so
those are the specs lots of talking in a
very short period of time moving into
how this actually performs because
that's ultimately all that matters now
we've got a small 7 by 7 by 2 enclosure
which means thermals are a concern and
then we've got an 86 TM which means that
gaming performance is potentially
concerned I tested this on four games
we're only going to run through two of
them here and then I will refer you to
the article links in the description
below so you can see the benchmarks and
all the test methodology if you are
interested in learning more about this
and if it fits your needs if it performs
like you want it to first we're going to
talk about grid Autosport I chose this
because it's a new game it's the type of
game i could see someone playing in the
living room with a controller or a
racing wheel and it's pretty well
optimized actually so grid Autosport on
the
860 em with high settings in the
benchmark performs at 65 FPS average
with a one-percent minimum low of 46 FPS
that means your one percent of the time
drop into just barely below 60 FPS not
bad this is actually very good
performance you could actually run this
game on a hybrid of high and maximum
settings which is what we're looking at
right now on maximum settings it runs at
35 FPS pretty unplayable on the 860 em
you can see that this outperforms the
250 x and is just below the 7850 which
is last generations mid-range budget
type card so not bad performance
considering it is a mobile GPU and it
will play grid on high or high / Ultra
settings pretty good performance they're
looking at titanfall titanfall is
relatively optimized considering what it
is and it was pretty bad at launch but
it's okay now titanfall on the 860 em on
high and on the highest settings
possible operates at 50 FPS average
that's pretty good you can drop your
settings a little bit too to right
around the high and medium high area and
you'll get 60 FPS constantly which is
perfect for a game like titanfall that's
what it's meant to be played at so again
for about 700 bucks after you include
the RAM and the hard drive you're
running these games at at a playable 60
FPS at almost max settings in these two
instances and that is noteworthy I know
700 is a lot of money you can build a
very good big system for that but you
have to keep in mind that the form
factor is what you're paying for here 7
by 7 by 2 again is very tiny you can't
build that in mini ITX because this does
not include a power supply in it it's
using an AC drop from the wall that
saves a lot of space yes you can cheat
sort of like that in mini ITX but it's
going to cost you a bit more if you want
something quality that's sort of where
your where your money's going and it's
not meant for desktop gaming anyway now
it also tested battlefield 4 metro and
watchdogs so i guess i lied i tested
five games all of those are linked in
the description below performance
bit lower on those obviously because
they are far more intensive check that
out if you want to play those games now
in terms of things that I was concerned
about thermals definitely is the number
one item so testing thermals i put the
GPU at a hundred percent load and it
operated at doing the math in my head 53
ish celsius you'll see the chart on the
screen here with the phone number it's
about 53 celsius after calculating for
ambient under load which is not bad
that's about what the dedicated gps i
have perform at when under a hundred
percent load so it's really it's doing
pretty well like cooling the unit and
that's because the only thing had even a
focus inside of this box when you take
it apart is a giant frickin aluminum
copper heatsink with a fan on top of the
CPU and the GPU so it's obviously doing
its job there idle was about
20-something celsius and that's for the
GPU looking at the cpu idol was still in
the 20s there's about 23 Celsius which
is pretty warm it's about 10 Celsius
higher than what we're used to with a
high-end air cooler on on a bigger
desktop but again this is small so
that's understandable and then load
operating under prime95 SL fft is one
hundred percent load which you will
never experience in gaming was in the
again doing math my head 45 celsius
range not too bad it is a bit warm it is
a bit toasty but what's really toasty is
the SSD I had a hyperx SSD in there
which should run pretty cool it runs
actually in the right around ambient at
about 22 Celsius one in a normal
environment in this it ran at 41 Celsius
before calculating for ambient two times
the temperature of what I'm used to
that's because it's sitting in between
the GPU cooler and above the RAM and and
an adiabatic wall on the other side it
will get pretty hot and it's getting two
times hotter than what we're used to but
you're still going to perform okay as
long as you're not really stressing out
that drive too much if you're doing
really I Oh intensive tasks then perhaps
it is a concern thermals overall not bad
actually I'm impressed at the GPU
thermals to be quite honest it performed
far better than I expected
and you'll have pretty decent longevity
based on these thermals as long as
things like the thermal pads thermal
paste don't don't wear out over time
which is something I can't really test
adequately due to the time involvement
there but everything looks good from the
teardown i did so i do feel pretty
confident in the thermals on this unit
in terms of things i did not like i did
not like the SSD temperature i did not
like the limited for USB 3 ports you
should probably get a hub if you're the
type of person who uses a lot of storage
USB storage because there's four ports
will be instantly saturated by keyboard
mouse controller and one storage or
network or other such device so a hub is
sort of necessary if you are like me in
that regard especially if you're trying
to connect an external capture card for
this so you can make a DIY DVR and get
rid of Time Warner Cable forever and
burn them and I'm getting off track here
hello Time Warner Cable please don't
shut off my internets I need it to
upload this video so that's the zbox
overall here's what I I think in terms
of the target audience if you're the
type of person who a travels to
conventions or travels for work a lot
and can plug this into a hotel TV and do
your work and editing they're talking
about myself and anyone like me this is
a great product for you because it's
going to be far more powerful than a
similarly priced laptop you're going to
get more space if you connected to the
hotel TV and it's small so why not if
you're a gamer and you want a very
discreet low profile htpc that you can
play games on in your living room or
hiding it somewhere behind your monitor
if you've got a special project it's
great for that purpose do keep thermals
and minds don't stuff it in a corner
somewhere where it will suffocate if you
are anyone who needs any amount of power
it might be worth investigating a DIY
mini-itx system build instead but do
keep in mind that you instantly expand
the size 3 to 4 X because you've got to
account for that power supply unless you
build with a motherboard that is capable
of using an AC drop and I'm not too
familiar with many of those off the top
of my head and they will inflate costs
that's sort of the gray area
if you it ultimately comes down to this
do you want something really tiny and if
not can you live with something that's
about three to four times the size but
potentially more powerful at the same
price if you need something tiny in
those scenarios I described this is your
thin get the UN 760 DIY model and throw
in some ram and an HDD or an SSD I make
recommendations in the article link
below I think it's good I was fairly
impressed with performance and thermals
it'll also make for a great steam
machine if you would like to do a DIY
steam machine build you basically throw
steamos on a USB key and then install it
from there and you're good to go just
keep those limitations in mind and that
is all for this review I will see you
all next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
