hardcore overclocking and today we're
gonna be taking a look at the Meg X 578
motherboard from MSI so this board is
gonna be going up against the crosshair
eight hero from Asus and the X 570 horas
Master from gigabyte so this is you know
this is a pretty high-end motherboard
like this falls into that category of
motherboards words like these are these
are all rather overkill for even like
your 3950 X that these are going to be
quite expensive though actually
significantly less like significantly
lower price points than what you
actually pay for like the flash chips
like the flagships 4 X 570 are insanely
expensive let's start off with some of
the noteworthy features around the board
and then we'll move on to the vrm and
like memory stuffs as well before that
this video is brought to you by the EVGA
gtx 1660 XC black video card EVGA gtx
1660 XC black uses a fat heatsink to
allow the card to run at lower noise
levels for longer capable of sinking
more heat before the fan kicks in and
also has a day 1 game ready drivers for
game launches the 1660 XC black is short
and compact for installations a small
form-factor pc build but if you need one
that isn't extra thick it's also
accompanied by a dual fan counterpart
with a thinner heatsink for standard
dual slot support learn more at the
links in the description below so
starting off with the rear i/o we've got
a clear CMOS here which i'm a huge fan
of because this does make it possible to
clear the bios for super convenient if
you're just overclocking your daily
system and you get get it into that
scenario where it doesn't want to
automatically recover though most
motherboards these days are pretty good
about recovering on their own anyway
below that we get BIOS flash back to
actually be able to update the bios of
the CPU I mean of the motherboard
without having a compatible CPU for the
motherboard because it does allow you to
just update the BIOS without even a CPU
installed you just need to power the
motherboard which I think for MSI boards
the requirement is that you have the 8
pin and the 24 pin plugged in and then
there's like a bunch of requirements for
the format of the USB stick and the name
of the the BIOS file on that USB stick
in which which USB port you plug it into
then you whack this button and it'll
update the BIOS for you so yeah pretty a
pretty neat feature to have
is actually like as far as I know every
X 570 motherboard that's coming out will
have this feature so yeah but still kind
of definitely nice to have the Wi-Fi
card is missing from the board that will
be present when when you buy it retail I
assume it's been removed for the purpose
of making this picture then you've got
one gig Intel and 2.5 giggle tech which
I think that's the order the ports are
in and they might be swapped around it
doesn't really matter that much you can
check on MSI as a website which ones
which right and then that sort of covers
everything in the rear i/o we of course
have the optional and very useful
extremely useful extra 8 pin so yeah you
don't need to plug this in if you have a
PSU that only has a single eye pin power
connector you don't need to worry about
the existence of this extra power
connector over here it doesn't do
anything like it first of all it's
literally connected in parallel with the
other one so the motherboard can't
distinguish between or like you can't
tell the difference between this one
being plugged in or that one and the
other thing is is yeah you don't need
this like you really don't need to this
because the thing is the first eight pin
can handle already up to 384 watts and
this is a problem if you're on the some
of the like intel h EDT platforms can
exceed that 39 to 50x unfortunately
still can't okay unless you're pushing
at 39 50 X on like liquid nitrogen you
are not gonna be exceeding that 384
watts power consumption figure so the
extra a pin is just completely useless
for any kind of water-cooled
overclocking for any rise in CPU you
that you can install within this
motherboard it doesn't do anything so
yeah it's it's just a thing that board
vendors do for no reason is add extra
power connectors because I guess it
makes the motherboard look more
impressive to people who don't know
anything about how power connectors work
which is that you know if the power
connector if you're not pulling more
power than the connector is rated more
you don't need another one so otherwise
you know the power connector II would be
rated lower so anyway moving on from the
very useful very useless HP extra 8 pin
we have the far more useful
postcode readout right here so you can
you can tell a lot from the postcode but
it also depends kind of on the platform
on some other boards on some platforms
the postcode is completely useless you
might as well just have the four le like
trouble before troubleshooting LEDs
right here which these will tell you if
you have like a memory error CPU error
VGA error or a boot media error and the
post code will tell you that too but
it'll generally give you more details
it's just that on some platforms there's
no extra details even through the post
code because it'll always end up on the
same like any memory issue ends up with
the same final memory post code right or
that kind of thing so yeah still
definitely not like the this is
definitely a feature I really like to
have on a lot of other words because
when it does work it can be super
helpful and massively simplify the
overclocking process now the only
complaint I have for this post code
right here is that it is located under
the PCIe slots it's not luckily it's not
like jammed somewhere right here where
if you put another PCIe card you're just
never gonna see it because it's gonna be
covered up but if you were running 2-way
GPUs I mean I that's not a very straight
look well
yeah about the backplate of a GPU would
start obscuring that and then depending
on how tall your other GPU is yeah you
might not be able to see that post code
the other thing worth noting here is
that you do only get four SATA ports I
have no idea why there's only four SATA
ports it kind of looks like msi just ran
out of space on this board but in that
case you know what they could have just
removed the OC dial taking the postcode
moving that moved that down here which
like i still don't like the postcode
being located anywhere unlike the lower
half of the motherboard because of the
whole GPUs are gonna cover it up but uh
like at least it's there right like at
least there's a postcode I will always a
pre having a postcode is better than not
having one even if it's in the wrong
place as long as you're not using too
many GPUs because if you do use enough
GPUs and it's covered up then you know
it might as well not be there because
you can't see it anyway but still this
thing right here my personal experience
with it is that it gives you overclock
so this is basically a bunch of
overclocking profiles for your CPU and
the thing about CPU
overclocking is that it's very simple
you raise the core voltage you raise the
core clock and you check that you're not
overheating or that you're not over see
no I'm not exceeding the maximum safe
core voltage that's all you have to do
to CPU overclock so I'd argue this like
if this worked well I'd argue it's still
not very helpful and the reality of it
is is that my experience with the OSI
dial is that the profiles on it
generally range from very low clock
speeds at extremely high voltage to even
higher voltages and higher clock speeds
so it is not like I would never advise
anybody to actually use this because the
way this is tuned is that it's set up so
that the profiles just work and to
achieve that they basically just tend to
just slam voltage into them so you know
that that's kind of the thing is just
yeah they're not good profiles
whatsoever this honestly like they
should have replaced that with SATA
ports SATA ports are more useful than
the OC dial anyway next to that we find
a reset button and a power button those
are of course extremely useful if you do
do have the motherboard on an open air
test bench and that pretty much covers
all of the the overclocking features on
this motherboard so we don't get like
dual BIOS smile switches or any kind of
like super like extreme overclocking
targeted functionality on this board but
we do get sort of the Barrett law like
the bare minimum for you know good
overclocking I would say a good
overclocking support for like test bench
usage so anyway moving on the VRM and in
the vrm department we have what would
like a year well actually it's not even
like a year ago if we go back a couple
months this would be an extremely
high-end vrm and it doesn't really
change the fact that it is still an
extremely high-end vrm it's just not
quite as extremely high-end as it used
to be because we've got a v core that is
12 phases BAM
and then we've got plus two so two more
phases on the SOC vrm over here and the
way this is controlled is with an
international rectifier ir35 2:01 which
is of course you know like the this chip
is everywhere because this is these
default high end voltage controller for
high end
the words for the last several years if
you have a high end motherboard it
probably has an ir35 2:01 if it doesn't
have an IR three five two zero one then
it has an ISL sixty nine one three eight
because those are literally the only two
options available for for CPU power for
a very long time now
well there are some other options
they're just not as high-end as these
two that I just listed off now the one
downside to the ir35 2:01 and it's only
really a downside now because there's an
option which has more phases is the fact
that it only goes up to eight phases so
here it's configured as a six plus two
and to achieve the twelve phases MSI is
using a whole bunch of doublers located
on the back of the board so on the back
of the board we have a bunch of these
chips and these are of course just a
bunch of international rectifier ir35
99s and these are doublers and
quadruples but they do not actively
current balance themselves so that
actually Falls entirely upon the voltage
controller on the motherboard so I've
been digging through some international
rectifier documentation recently and
it's come to my attention that
technically the ir35 2:01 because of how
accurate its current sensing system is
it can actually current balance even
through an IR 3599 so there's a lot of
other doublers out there which will
actually integrate current balancing
functionality because if you use a
doubler you basically run into with most
voltage controllers you would run into
the issue of the controller has eight
current sensing inputs and now you have
two phases on one current satan singh
input and it won't be able to
distinguish which phase is which but the
three five two zero one is so good that
it can still distinguish between the two
which phase is turning on and off
because the the current flowing through
each phase it's not DC like it's not a
fixed amount of current it goes up and
down so it can actually tell which
phases which and it can still current
balance to some extent even through
through the 3599 so yeah it's it's not
like so that that's a mistake that
there's in a bunch of my past videos so
yeah this is actually like a twelve
phase with with current balancing
because you can't curve
through the $35.99 s if your voltage
controller is good enough to support
that functionality which not all are
capable of doing so anyway the other
thing worth noticing about the doublers
is that they do add a little bit of
delight to your pwm signals because they
are an extra chip on your pwm line and
that does mean that you're gonna have
worse transient response then if you
just kind of through the doublers out
and kept the same motherboard design
overall but the thing is there's a lot
of things you can do to your motherboard
in terms of how it's designed to
optimize the the transient response that
don't necessarily include throwing out
the doublers so I personally my personal
view on the the doublers is at least
currently because I'm still doing some
like I'm still researching more into how
much impact the doublers actually have
on transient response in real-world
usage which I I currently have a few
tests that seem to indicate that quite
frankly under certain loading conditions
it doesn't matter what you do the vrm is
just not gonna have a chance
under other loading conditions that does
make a difference but yeah so
inconclusive test results so far and my
current outlook on it is is that the the
difference seems to be so marginal that
it doesn't really matter anyway so yeah
I see I see no issues with using like I
see no reason to consider a VRM inferior
just because it uses doublers compared
to a vrm that doesn't use doublers of
course there is the XD PE 1 3 2 g 5c
from Infineon that now supports all the
way up to 16 phases even then the
difference would be really marginal with
VRMs a lot of the time you get into a
situation where it's just like well
there's technically a way to do this
better but it's not going to give you
any return in terms of actual real world
benefits so yeah I really don't see a
problem with MSI using the higher $35.99
s though it is technically an inferior
control scheme to having you know an XD
PE 1 3 2 g 5c and it is an alternative
control scheme to just not using
doublers at all because there's upsides
and downsides to not using doublers at
all as well so yeah that's not like like
having a lower phase counter is what I
by that like if you had a six days with
no doublers there's upsides and
downsides to that as well so we're not
going to get into all of that anyway for
the actual power stages MSI is using
international rectifier ir35 55s which
are basically the standard high end of
power stage for the last several years
except for the fact that last year we
started seeing a whole bunch of smart
power stages which unfortunately just do
everything that the power our stages do
they just do it better they're more
efficient they have better current
monitoring they have better temperature
monitoring and they also integrate a
bunch of safety functionalities that the
how IR stages don't integrate whatsoever
nonetheless these are still extremely
powerful and efficient so even though
they have like you know the minor
downsides to these compared to smart
power stages are honestly like unless
you're a sir like the whole point of
smart power stages is that they're meant
for server applications because they're
you know efficiency is absolutely the
most important thing ever so having a
very accurate current monitoring system
built into your power stage is super is
a priority for desktop systems like this
yeah it's not really so the fact that
this has slightly inferior current
sensing is just irrelevant and having
the various safety features is also
irrelevant when you're vrm is this
freaking overkill right twelve phases of
60 amp hour stages this has a
theoretical maximum current throughput
of 720 amps
you're not gonna overload this any time
soon so for the VR I'm running at 1.20
for the VR I'm outputting 1.2 volts at
400 kilohertz switching frequency on the
actual phases so that would be a 100
kilohertz switching frequency at the
controller and then 5 volts drive the
efficiency of this vrm is as follows so
100 amps output which is where you'd be
looking at for like slightly above a
hundred amps is basically all of the
different eight core CPUs from the seven
nanometer a core to the 12 nanometer
eight cord to the 14 nanometer eight
core the 12 nanometer eight core is
actually by far the most power hungry a
core CPU only a m4 socket because it's
it's basically the 14 nanometer chip
just with more leakage and higher clock
speeds so
yeah anyway hundred amps output this vr1
will be producing about 11 watts of heat
it will not need a RM heatsink
whatsoever for that right like that's
non-issue for a vrm especially when it's
a 12 phase like it has so much surface
area just because of how many components
there are that you don't need a heat
sink for a hundred amps output
whatsoever now for 150 amps output which
is far more than any of the first gen or
second generation CPUs would pull safely
so you could actually get a 2700 X to
pull this current it's just that after a
few months of pulling that much current
your 2700 X would clock significantly
worse than when you first set up your
overclock so yeah this would degrade a
2700 X pretty quickly but the 12 Corizon
CPU the the new seven nanometer one that
one will be actually a capable of
hitting this kind of current draw Alden
safe voltages under extreme load so
we're talking like prime95 with you know
a maxed out overclock 150 amps output
would be actually what the CPU would
pull and then at that kind of current
output this VR will produce 15 watts of
heat oh yeah 15 watts of heat which
means you still don't need a heatsink
going up from 150 amps to 200 amps which
is where the 16 Corizon 7 rise in 3000
series chip will max out so the 39 50x
that one will max out around 200 amps so
again like maximum voltage that you can
run on like water cooling under a AVX
workload like say prime95 or a video
encoding or some really heavy CPU
workload you're gonna be looking at
maximum current draw sustained around
200 amps and you're gonna be pretty
and the vrm is gonna be producing about
19 watts of heat which again because
this is a 12 phase it should still be
right capable of dissipating this
without needing a heatsink though at
this point a heatsink might be advisable
as that is a that is a pretty
significant amount of heat and it also
depends on you like the air flow
situation now going up into the sort of
theoretical current outputs for this vrm
so you know 300 amps because it's 60 amp
hour stages right like who doesn't want
to know what would happen if you
actually made use of all the current
capability that msi offers on this
motherboard so if there were like which
on liquid nitrogen you can't actually
hit
300 to 400 amps current draw that is
possible but uh yeah on water cooling or
air cooling you're gonna be stuck at
most you're gonna be stuck under that
200 amp range where this vrm is
absolutely ridiculous overkill
so anyway 300 amps I'm gonna be looking
at about 30 watts of heat at this point
the heat VR I mean sink is pretty much a
necessity 400 amps output you're gonna
be looking at about 48 watts of heat and
you can technically design passive heat
sinks for well like all the way up to 95
watts of heat right there's passive CPU
coolers for 495 watt TDP CPUs the the
thing is is just like designing those
kinds of heat sinks tend to make them
very bulky and kind of ugly because you
actually need to prioritize surface area
and thermal efficiency over aesthetics
and so with the types of heat sinks that
most motherboards come with 48 watts of
heat you're actually would need a fan to
dissipate it you wouldn't be able to do
it passively with the if you follow like
typical motherboard heatsink design
these days but if you had a heatsink
that was actually designed to dissipate
like prioritised you know dealing with
48 will also heat passively it's doable
it would just kind of be the rather
bulky and pretty ugly 500 amps output
this vrm would be producing about 70
watts of heat that is still doable with
the passive heatsink it would just be
very very large at that point and the
preferred cooling method for that kind
of heat output would of course be a
water block but as I said earlier a
risin even a 16 quart 39 50 X you're
gonna be looking at less than 200 amps
of current draw so yeah this VR m4 for
like an air-cooled or water-cooled build
the daily system the RM is apt like V
curve erm is total overkill yeah you
know it's on like it's on par with the
other options that you get at this price
point honestly within a given price
range you're gonna end up with roughly
the same solution for the vrm and the
the feature set and the memory and
everything so yeah this is definitely
this is a solid motherboard it's just
that at this price point in the price
range where this motherboard is I'd say
all of the motherboards are pretty damn
solid so it's just like yeah you know
pick your own poison at that point
so SOC vrm two-phase more 35 50 55 power
of 60 amp power stages so not even worth
discussing how much heat this is going
to be putting out because the SOC vrm
never really needs to put out anything
more than 20 amps and quite frankly a
single 35:55 can deal with that all on
its own that's not an issue that's
actually within peak efficiency for a
single 35 55 yeah SOC vrm is just
totally overkill as well and now let's
move on to the memory of erm so the
memory of erm is this right here at
least the main one there's obviously
there's a ton of supporting voltages
like v TT DDR which is done with just a
linear regulator and there's well no
point listing them off there's also like
VPP which is normally done with a small
buck converter anyway so VDD R which is
the big one the most important one
that's just a single-phase but it is
actually like out of the single phase
memory V RMS this one's one of the far
more powerful ones because MSI is using
these like a recently picked up a bunch
of these MOSFETs which I'm a huge fan of
because they are they're evidently
they're cheap because they use them
everywhere even on like low-end
motherboards but these are actually
really good MOSFETs so you have four c0
29 ends from well not really good
MOSFETs but compared to what other cheap
MOSFETs are these are really good as far
as cheap MOSFETs go but for c0 29 ends
from on semiconductor for the high side
and then for c0 24 ends for the low side
which actually makes this one of the
more efficient single-phase memory VRMs
out there not that that really matters
ddr4 really doesn't pull that much power
the most important thing for ddr4
overclocking is what's going on between
the CPU socket and the memory slots so
all of this right here which MSI has
kindly highlighted for us with these
visual indicators of where the like
memory things here non memory things
there right that that's what that stripe
is indicating it's not actually
electrically much of anything because it
is just a break in the solder mask and
you can see that it ends like right
there so it's just a break in the solar
mount mask
unlike the audio ice audio section
isolation slaw it doesn't even go all
the way through the board so if we go on
the back of the board right and we
to the well if we look in the memory
section you can't see that stripe
anywhere here but you can see it right
here because the thing is here with the
audio isolation one you can actually
shine the light straight through that
stripe right there because it does
actually cut through every single one of
the the planes and the motherboard the
idea being that you basically isolate
the audio sections ground plane from the
ground plane of the rest of the
motherboard because obviously there's
all kinds of things sinking current into
the ground plane so you're gonna have
all currents flowing in all kinds of
directions on the ground plane of the of
the main motherboard and that would
potentially lead to interference issues
with the audio sections right if you had
like if you had like return current from
a PCIe slot flowing through your audio
section that that would kind of suck so
that's the idea behind having the
isolation slaw but the memory you don't
want to do that because you actually
want to solid ground plane in this area
now other interesting things that make
em si is doing with the memory section
here which the the visual indication
doesn't actually electrically achieve
anything it's just kind of like hey this
is where our memory stuff is but what
they are doing that's kind of
interesting is that MSI is going for
full ground fills over all of the memory
traces which seems to be like I I assume
they're trying to do some kind of memory
shielding with that and I say I assume
that they're trying to do that because
most motherboards don't bother with
anything like this most motherboards you
can see all of the memory traces even
motherboards that are really really good
at memory overclocking you can still see
all of the memory traces but here or at
least most of the memory traces but here
MSI has actually dedicated the bottom
the very bottom layer and the top layer
of the motherboard to basically just
ground like this is just a great big
round fill all over where all of your
memory traces run and then they have
another one down here we can kind of see
some of the power planes also being like
the there's a power plane down here
which I assume is VPP and then there's a
VDD our power plane that should be
running through here but I'm not sure we
can see it from the side of the
motherboard anyway so yeah but they are
doing the ground shields on the back of
the board they're also doing them on the
front of the board right you can just
well I mean you can't see any memory
traces so that's how you know that they
filled out the
the did a ground fill all over the
memory traces right here and you can
kind of see that the the part of the
ground fell over there we have a little
vdr I uh Island over here because
there's a power plane that goes like
that basically
and yeah so MSI has obviously put some
extra effort into the memory section of
this motherboard the topology that's
actually hiding under all of this
shielding is just a regular date well
MSI is daisy chain because the thing is
like not all daisy chains are equal okay
it also depends also how the bios
handles the the how the bios handles the
memory but uh yeah msi has been doing
daisy chains for ages and ages and ages
they are I say they're daisy chains are
really really good at this point it
gives you the best sort of the best of
both worlds where you can have a lot of
RAM or you can have a very high memory
frequency if you just use this dims law
and that dims law and also if you're
wondering like how much of a how much of
a downside is there to daisy chain when
you're full populating all of the memory
slots well on x4 70 MSI's daisy chain
motherboards would actually go from like
so unlike two sticks you would easily do
thirty six hundred megahertz on four
sticks you would generally top out
around 3200 which that I would mostly
say is down to the Rison ii like the
yeah rise in second gen memory
controller more so than the actual
memory topology because msi also uses
daisy chain on zi 390 and on zi 390 that
daisy chain is capable of hitting in
excess of 4,000 megahertz on for dim
memory configurations just depends on
the cpu quality and the the actual
specific motherboard but they do have a
few boards that with the daisy chain can
go over 4000 megahertz on four dims so
yeah like you know the this should not
restrict you until you're trying to
exceed 4,000 megahertz assuming that the
CPUs memory controller is good enough
all of the big aluminium polymer through
Hulk ball capacitors that we see around
this motherboard are made by a nipple
Nippon chemi-con which is as the name
implies a Japanese capacitor maker these
capacitors are all right
for five thousand hours at 105 degrees
which doesn't sound like a lot but that
rating also includes full voltage which
these are 6.3 volt capacitors on your V
core which week or you're not going to
be going over 2 volts so that means the
capacitors degrade slower also the
lifespan of the capacitor basically
doubles for every 5 10 degrees that you
reduce the temperature by so 5,000 hours
at 105 degrees is 9 is like 10,000 hours
at 95 degrees right so yeah like and
also it's worth noting that aluminum
polymers don't do catastrophic failures
they basically get slightly worse at
being capacitors over time so it's
really like this is fine okay this is
completely fine to use 5000 hours 105
degree rated capacitors there's real as
far as I'm concerned if you're like
especially if you're vrm is this
overkill and you have a vrm heatsink on
the motherboard right it comes with one
then yeah I don't see a reason to have
like a 10,000 or 12,000 hours rated
capacitor because the vrm is not going
to be getting that hot that you would
actually be concerned about the lifespan
of the capacitor in the first place
right that is it for the Meg X 578 it's
it's definitely a like hardware-wise
I really like the board it kind of gives
me Z 390 dark vibes with the trim that
they have going on but admittedly like
the this is again this is just missing
PC this is sold missing solder mask it
doesn't functionally achieve anything it
just kind of looks it just gives you the
390 dark vibes but it doesn't do the
same thing that like the gold trim on
yzi 390 dark actually achieves the this
board is competitive with everything
else the the main downside I can see
with this motherboard is the four SATA
ports like I really don't know why
there's only four of them here but other
than that there's really nothing else I
can complain about that at least like
that that I want to complain about this
is a really solid board and the only
question I have is just how does it
compare in terms of memory overclocking
to a lot of the other motherboards right
because like it's nice to know what
topology they have and we can clearly
see MSI was trying to do something with
the memory layout here that's new
on their past boards they wouldn't have
these ground like actually I don't think
they've done these ground fills over
their memory traces on any other boards
in the past so that's definitely new but
I can't eyeball
you know memory overclocking capability
from from just looking at the
motherboard so and yeah so that's it for
