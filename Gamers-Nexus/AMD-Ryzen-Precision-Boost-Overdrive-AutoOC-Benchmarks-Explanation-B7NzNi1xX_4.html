processors we've noticed a distinct
confusion among viewers when it comes to
the phrases precision boost to xfr
precision boost overdrive which is
different from precision boost and
precision boost to and Auto Oh see
there's a lot of confusion about what's
considered stock what PBO even does or
if it works at all or if it's been
oversold as a feature by Andy and how
thermals impact frequency of rise in
CPUs
today we're demystifying these names and
demonstrating the basic behaviors of
each solution as tested on two different
motherboards before that this video is
brought to you by us and the gamers
Nexus toolkit on store documents axis
net our brand new toolkit just launched
and contains 10 custom made drivers for
video card disassembly reap hasting and
tear downs the 8 core tools are made of
high-quality chromium vanadium alloy
steel that's built for long service life
and resistance to wear during use the
other two tools are carbon steel hex
heads that were custom ground down for
capacitor clearance on video cards all
the tools are easily mounted to a
pegboard
or stored in the GN made tool bag for
easy transport learn more at the link in
the description below
precision boost overdrive is a new
technology to the rise and family of
desktop processors having first been
introduced on the thread Ripper SKUs
previously and technically rise in 3000
already uses something called precision
boost to PBO with the overdrive in there
is explicitly different from precision
boost and precision boost to adding the
overdrive is an important change this is
where a lot of the confusion comes about
so precision boost is not a shorthand
for precision boost overdrive just to be
very clear there it's a different thing
precision boost is kind of like XFR andy
has this extended frequency range
boosting table for boosting a set number
of cores a little bit higher under
limited thread workload this is
something introduced on Rison 1000
series and act so far has more or less
been rolled into precision boost too at
this point and its entirety
so XFR was introduced a while ago and
precision boost takes into account three
numbers when deciding how the boosting
behavior should perform and it's looking
at how many cores should boost when
should they boost and under what
conditions and then how high can they
boost
so the numbers that are taken into
consideration are PBT TDC and EDC and
we'll define each of those there's also
temperature and the chips maximum boost
clock precision boost is enabled on a
stock CPU so precision boost not
precision boost overdrive to be really
clear here again precision boost is
considered stock precision boost
overdrive is not considered stock and
this is something that AMD states as
well so what PBO does not ever do is
boost the frequency beyond the
advertised CPU maximum frequency so if
the advertised frequency boost is four
point six which does not mean all core
by the way it means limited thread-like
one core scenarios then PBO isn't going
to get you to four point seven or
anything like that so that's another
point to demystify here will quote
directly from andy's review guide just
to firmly define what PPT TDC and EDC
are and then we'll go through some
additional explanations and a whole lot
of testing we've done to try and see if
these features even work properly
package power tracking is PBT the PBT
threshold is the allowed socket power
consumption permitted across the voltage
rails supplying the socket this is again
a quote from the Andy review guide
applications with high thread counts and
or heavy threads can encounter PBT
limits that can be alleviated with a
raised PBT limit defaults for socket AM
for is at least 142 watts on
motherboards rated for 105 watt TDP
processors default for socket am for is
at least 88 watts on motherboards that
rated for 65 watt TDP processors thermal
design current or TDC is next the
maximum at current in amps that can be
delivered by a specific motherboards
voltage regulator configuration in
thermally constrained scenarios is what
AMD defines as thermal design current
defaults for socket am for is at least
95 amps on motherboards rated for 105
watt TDP processors default for socket
am for is at least 60 amps on
motherboards rated for 65 watt TDP
processors electrical design current is
EDC this is the maximum current in amps
that can be delivered by a specific
motherboards voltage regulator
configuration and
peak or spike condition for a short
period of time
default is 140 amps on motherboards
rated for 105 watt TDP processors and 90
amps for motherboards rated for 65 watt
TDP processors knowing all of this
there's a few important things to cover
next first of all this is the
explanation of why TDP doesn't equal
power consumption so when you see 140
watts down EPS 12 volt rails to a 3900 X
and it not matching 105 watts
that's why TDP doesn't equal power
consumption necessary next up PBO only
affects these three power limits that's
what it does so the effect on CPU clock
speed is in direct auto OC is a
different feature by the way it's not
bundled into PBO that is a separate
thing entirely but it is contained
within the menu PBO will never boost
again the CPU past the advertised clocks
at best it will allow the CPU to
maintain its boost clocks for
potentially a longer period of time and
that's particularly going to be
noticeable or have the strongest effect
in scenarios where the CPU can already
boost so limited Core scenarios would be
the best way to demonstrate when PBO
comes into play if it does depending on
the motherboard you're working with
because one of the constraints is
thermal it gets a little tricky to test
and PBO will also have less effect on
CPUs that are already well cooled and
are not bumping against the thermal
limit so if you have a high-end cooling
solution on your CPU PBO will in theory
have less of an impact and this is
something we'll explore today as well
remember that in addition to these three
power limits precision boost is
constrained again by temperature and
maximum boost clocks of the CPU as
defined by the spec on the box these
limits are not affected by PBO those
last two sentences might sound
contradictory on the surface of it so we
need to further clarify and define a
couple of additional parts of PBO and
the PBO menu PBO will raise the amount
of power that is deliverable to the CPU
when it's too hot but it will not raise
the temperature that the CPU considers
to be too hot so those are two different
things
further platformer thermal throttling it
is the the temperature at which you
would encounter issues just like with
Intel you can boost t.j.maxx and some of
the BIOS options so platform thermal
throttle emmitt is not part of PB o that
has to be clarified as well PB o has
three options in it that are part of PB
o and then the PB o menu has additional
options which are not part of PB o and
this is all defined very clearly in
Andy's own documentation so that's
largely how we know what's part of PB o
and what technically isn't but it's
still a feature so the thermal throttle
limit is still a feature it's not a PB o
feature when we did our initial reviews
for the 3600 and 3900 X we had some
frequency over time plots and we can
just let those run now for a moment Andy
has been extremely reluctant to commit
to numbers from single core boosting and
all core boosting because precision
Boost uses what is called an
opportunistic algorithm to boost
frequency until it hits one of these
limits and E says the following of this
quote at the limit the processor will
draw back on boost and dither the
frequency until the situation changes
this dithering and analysis loop occurs
every one millisecond within infinity
fabrics command and control faculties
and they further say quote the processor
is designed to use thermal Headroom to
drive higher average frequencies and
thus more performance there's two ways
to look at this and on the it's it's
sort of the same line as GPU boost 4.0
so the optimistic way to look at this is
that AMD is out of the box automatically
pushing the CPU to more or less where it
can maximally stay stable and that's why
you see all core overclocking lose some
of its efficacy for this generation when
it was already not particularly
effective in 2000 series it is less
effective here and in 1000 series all
core overclocking was actually pretty
useful so that's one way to look at it
this is more efficient than manual
overclocking efficient being a key word
here you can get higher with manual
overclocking still in some instances and
not all but more efficient certainly in
terms of a power to performance output
it's also more sensitive than manual
overclocking and then the pessimistic
way to look at it is that it's another
variable out of control
of the user in some ways until you
disable the features and that makes it
difficult to do testing or benchmarking
which is not particularly a valid user
environment so we don't really factor
that in much and three views but it's
something that people need to be aware
of when they're doing comparisons of
their own products or processor they've
installed versus data they've seen
online and it is again sort of like
gpb's 4.0 on nvidia where the clock is
boosting contingent upon a few different
parameters primarily power and/or
current and voltage as you know creating
power volts times amps equals watts and
then temperature so those are the key
ones for NVIDIA GPU boost 4.0 and some
of those factors are starting to apply
to processors these days it's not like
where it used to be with Intel CPUs for
example where until you hit t.j.maxx
you're fine you're running at spec and
that's all there is to it so very
different in that regard we're careful
to use the same high quality NZXT X 62
liquid cooler for all of our testing
that's part of our standardized test
benches and we test with the fans in the
pumps at max speed to avoid throttling
this is all done on purpose to eliminate
a potential variable you don't obviously
want a CPU to throttle when you're
trying to compare them all head-to-head
and a like-for-like fair scenario so
that's what we use for our standard
testing we've added another one for some
of the tests today using a lower spec
and the cooler on a high spec a and the
processor we'll talk about that later
and if we weren't using this high-end
liquid cooler then performance would be
directly affected on rise in 3000 by
using a lower quality cooler that can't
keep the thermals at a lower temperature
so this isn't just under t.j.maxx now
it's it needs to be under it's it's done
in steps and increments where the
frequency will boost depending on how
high the temperature is again GPUs 4.0
as an example boosts about every 5
degrees Celsius so a few things here all
this first of all further reinforces our
opinions on cases and choosing ones that
have good thermals so you can go check
out our back catalogue of case reviews
now because it's definitely relevant
here another one is the performance that
our reviewer sees on a good cooler might
not match what you see in a thermally
constrained environment and
it's all just part of precision boost to
the feature because it's thermally
dependent again so precision abused to
overdrive emphasis on the overdrive is
what AMD is calling when these three
thresholds are bumped up the default
setting for PBO is Auto which the stock
configuration specifies is disabled so
Auto should mean off if everyone's
following spec further and these own
review guide states to disable PBO
for reviews again emphasis on the
overdrive overdrive is not spec that's
what we did for our review it's what
most people did for their reviews if not
all and it's just how we disable MCE for
intel the default numbers can be pulled
from the chip with overdrive disabled
for the the three limiting numbers or
the higher numbers can be pulled from
the motherboard with overdrive enabled
allowing you to bypass some of those
limitations setting overdrive to enabled
or setting overdrive to advanced and
specifying the motherboard as the source
did the same thing on the two boards we
tested for this content the godlike in
the x5 sony master but the two
motherboards set different values on the
gigabyte x5 so many master with the 3900
X P Bo limits were as follows PPT was
1200 watts TDC was 540 amps and EDC was
600 amps on the MSI godlike the limits
were set to 1000 watts for 90 amps and
630 amps but at the end of the day all
it really means is they're functionally
disabled at this point they're so high
that you're not going to hit those
limits with PBO disabled the limits were
PPT 142 watts TDC 95 amps and EDC 140
amps on both motherboards which is the
correct and the specification for 105
watt TDP processors the limits adjusted
downwards to spec when a 65 watt
processor was installed with PBO still
disabled it sounds like motherboard
manufacturers are free to set higher
numbers based on what they expect their
own boards and vrm to be capable of
although some of them other board makers
we spoke to are under the impression
that AMD is supposed to help provide
these numbers so that's another issue
entirely and it's a teething issue
because the limits change based on the
processor U is 105 watt vs. 65 watt for
example this means that the advantages
of PBO are dependent on things like the
motherboard model specifically the
processor model the specific process
sir not the skew but the individual unit
the cooling solution the temperature of
the room and the alignment of the
planets that brings us to a couple of
other things like Auto OC so the 200
megahertz offset that's been mentioned a
lot in conjunction with PB o is called
Auto OC it's a separate AMD feature it's
not technically part of P Bo but it is
part of the PB o menu in BIOS so and
these put it in the same menu it is not
however a part of pbl so it's a bit
confusing the way BIOS is laid out but
that's how that's how the spec
explicitly defines it PB Oh sounds good
it is good in a lot of ways this allows
users to circumvent some of the tachi
GPU ask clock behaviors that are
starting to emerge on CPUs these days
and that's great especially for users
who have the vrm and cooling solutions
they need to handle those higher speeds
to bypass potential power and and other
limits that we've gone over and so on
paper it sounds like a great way to get
rid of the vastly diminishing returns
from all court over clocks over the past
generation of AMD processors and give
overclockers access to a little
performance via a different overclocking
option and the intense PBO and auto OC
to be used in conjunction with each
other with Auto OC more useful in theory
for single core boosting and PBO mostly
benefiting the heavier core workloads
where you're saturating more of them and
challenging that power limit but the
theta is in our testing none of this
helps at least not much and certainly
not for us further note that entering
the number 200 does not mean it will
actually offset by 200 it's more of a
you can offset within this limit and in
that regard again we look back at GPU
clocks where you set an offset it
doesn't mean it's going to actually
offset by that number because the base
will change so the base from which you
are offsetting is variable and the
actual offset is not necessarily equal
it's the 200 number you might enter into
auto Oh see we have a table from AMD
that helps illustrate the intended use
and these reviewer guide says that the
offset only apply
to the max boost clock but a chart later
on clarifies that this is the max boost
clock for any number of course the risin
nine 3900 X has a max listed boost clock
of 4.6 gigahertz it may or may not ever
hit this clock speed depending on the
CPU itself and the usage and probably
not on more than one core with Auto OC
this theoretical limit is raised to 4
point 8 gigahertz but there's still no
guarantee the chip will ever hit that
from AMD quote this feature will not
guarantee the higher boost clock on any
number of course the frequency cores
booster ation will still depend on the
firmware manage the limits even though
those limits are higher than OEM when
PBO has been enabled by this direction
enabling PBO and the offset make it more
likely that the 3900 acts will maybe hit
4.8 gigahertz on one core once in a
while
in Cinebench single threaded benchmarks
and sometimes in extremely heavy all
core loads the CPU will run a little
faster than it would with stock PBT TDC
or EDC limits although the all core load
is barely affected by the 200 megahertz
auto OC offset in our testing and
spoiler alert there we'll get to that
once we had a handle on what PBO and
auto OC are supposed to do we started
testing we began with an r5 3600 on the
gigabyte horas master used for a verizon
3000 reviews and the msi godlike
reasoning that the most power hungry
sample chip we had with the lowest stock
clocks would benefit the most from
removing current limitations this is the
CPU that took more than one point 4
volts as a reminder to complete our
tests at 4.3 gigahertz all core when the
3900 X could manage the same at 1.35
it's also the model of CPU that Andy
showed gaining the most points in single
threaded performance with PBO and auto
OC we have charts of that from their own
reviewers guide as well note that we're
talking stock numbers with PBO as the
a/b test here so all core o'seas are not
part of this just a reference point a
messiah has another menu in addition to
the generic and the PPO submenu with
some basic preset PPO profiles in it
we verified that all these profiles do
is set PPO to Advanced Mode and max all
the settings except Auto C which again
is technically a separate feature so
what at MSI I was paying attention to
Phoebe Oh enough to create these
profiles so we can assume that they've
tailored the motherboard PBT TDC and EDC
limits to fit their boards in the
interest of not making this piece 10
hours lon will summarize the tests we
ran and discuss all the results together
we tested the r5 3600 and r9 3900 X in
the gigabyte X 570 or as master and MSI
x5 so many god-like motherboards and we
ran them with PBO disabled we also
tested PPO enabled to auto PPO maxed
with a plus 200 megahertz auto OSI
offset including max in thermal throttle
limits and PPO scalar menu options we
also tried them minimized
we found that manually maxing the PPO
variables and allowing the motherboard
to set them accomplished functionally
the same thing so for quote max tests we
used the motherboard values we ran a mix
of Cinebench r15 R xx and 1080p game
tests we didn't run all tests on all
configurations because it would have
been a waste of time the tests and the
charts are the tests that we ran we also
ran to further passes on the 3900 acts
in the godlike board with the CLC fan
and pump speeds manually slowed we
tested with PP o on and off to see
whether overdrive is more helpful when
the CPU is warmer by again slowing down
the CPU fan speed on the CLC to a point
where it was running close to 85 90
degrees somewhere in that range on the X
570 master with the r5 3600 on PBO
disabled Cinebench are 20 scored 37:59
multi-threaded 484 single threaded
simply setting PB o 2 enabled scored 37
48 and 485 and setting PB o to
motherboard limits functionally the same
as max maxing the throttle temperature
in PB o scalar and applying the auto OC
200 megahertz offset scored 37 65 and
496 that's a 0.2% improvement over stock
for the multi-threaded score absolutely
within range of variants and a 2.5
percent improvement in single core
performance AMD showed a 21-point
increase for one threaded performance in
this test we showed a 12 points increase
in hours and we can't tell you the
percent difference for AMD's numbers
because they omitted a vertical axis on
their marketing charts attempting to
render them as useless as possible
cinema
charge one a single-threaded on the r5
3600 is and these absolute best case
scenario for PBO and auto SE and it
barely does anything in their own
testing if their stock single core score
somehow exactly matched ours and it
should be very close and these 21 points
would be a 4.3 percent increase on the
godlike board we saw a 3.5 percent
increase from PPO disabled to PBO max
with auto OC we also ran Cinebench r15
so let's take a look at the r9 3100 X
for that benchmark the lowest single
threaded score we saw was with PPO and
auto C on the horse board and this is
where our next big hurdle started to
become visible precision boost is so
reactive that the variance between test
results from one day to the next can be
larger than the difference between OC
and stock or stock and PB o for a more
logical comparison the godlike improves
to 2.5 percent moving from PPO off to
PPO maxed with 200 megahertz auto OC but
then zero single threaded improvement we
didn't bother running more synthetics
than sentiments for this content piece
because PB o is supposed to be primarily
beneficial to gaming and because runs
run variants with precision boost alone
was starting to drive us insane also
this is the one AMD used anyway to
demonstrate it we demonstrated why
precision boost was driving us crazy in
our live stream it's it's not a bad
thing ultimately and we'll talk about
that at the end but from a testing
standpoint it's difficult I will work on
another content piece separately to
really drive at home to basically every
couple degrees change in CPU temperature
will affect frequency and a measurable
way for results and so the order of the
tests completed it will impact results
the pause between the tests will impact
it the room temperature and more we
control all these things as best we can
especially room temperature but it's
still a tough fight these things are
sensitive this is partly a good thing
from the standpoint of improving the
CPUs performance but again difficult for
tiny testing differences and he doesn't
guarantee auto OC will actually increase
the clocks and PPOs effect is
inconsistent at best stick around for
the end of this piece where we dig into
precision boost behavior at sub-zero
temperatures for some explanation of why
for game testing we felt things out
first by testing with civilization 6 a
consistent benchmark that should benefit
from frequency increases across a
limited number of threads on the 3900
acts turned time completions were almost
exactly the same regardless of the
cooler or if PBO or otto OC was enabled
all the 3900 acts results were gathered
on the gigabyte board the test with the
CLC and PB o disabled may have been
marginally better with the air cooler
but a 1.2 percent reduction in turn time
isn't concrete results for the 3600 on
the MSI board with PB o and Auto AC on
and off were identical and the results
on the gigabyte board were so close to
each other that they may as well have
been we have a more limited set of
results for total war Warhammer twos
battle benchmark just the 3900 acts on
that messy board with an air cooler and
a liquid cooler for once the results
somehow lined up in a sane and
reasonable fashion with the to PBO and
auto OSI enabled tests at the top and
the two stock tests at the bottom with
the best results from the CLC and the
worst result from an air cooler there's
a 2.6 percent improvement between the
worst results and the best results
Patrick who wrote most of the script -
noted that he hopes everyone can
appreciate the amount of time and effort
he put into testing a feature that
nobody understands and that barely does
anything and the nobody understand part
is definitely true based on our live
stream where most people think PB o is
the same as precision boost and this is
not the fault of the viewers it's the
fault of AMD for choosing these names
the campaign benchmark also showed some
scaling on each of the board and cooler
combinations the improvement from PB o
off to PB o Otto OC on with the 3900 X
and a CLC on the MSI board was a
whopping 2.4 percent and 1.5 percent on
air
despite being a lightly threaded
workload it doesn't seem that the total
war benefits are massive from the 200
megahertz offset but then again nothing
else has been either it's pretty small
if measurable in some of the instances
it's it's not the 3600 scaled 1.6% with
PB o and Otto of C enabled on the
gigabyte board we would normally avoid
such a patchy mix of hardware and tests
but we've been trying to cast as wide a
net as possible to find any situation in
which PB o and Ottawa C provide a
genuine advantage Shadow the Tomb Raider
showed no significant change based on PB
o or Auto OC on them a cyborg with a
3900 X air cooler or not even we're on
the gigabyte board with the 3600 it's
hard to get results of this unchanging
when we actually want them
again the GTA results for the 3900 acts
were almost the same all of them
regardless of contact result with an air
cooler in PBO and Ottawa sea enabled was
very slightly worse than the other three
presumably because of minor temperature
fluctuations from repeated loads in
rapid succession or from a reasonable
plus or minus one degree Celsius change
in room temperature as the testing
environment fluctuated but it's still a
difference of barely more than one FPS
from the top result which was achieved
with PBO and auto OC disabled pr5 3600
on the gigabyte board also scored two
results within margin of error the worst
result for the 3900 X and F 1 2018 was
with the air cooler and PBO and auto OSI
enabled the best result was with a CLC
and PPO turned off our initial theory
that PBO would help get around thermal
constraints has not panned out
Illustrated here the difference is still
a minuscule 1.1 percent gain between the
worst and best results however so the
it's kind of a wash it's it's hard to
tell when the difference is real versus
not with a 3600 on the gigabyte board
there's also less than a 1% increase
between the two scores
our final gaming benchmark was hitman 2
the X 12 the best results achieved
through the 3900 acts was with PPO and
auto OC under a CLC close with liquid
cooler and the worst result was with an
air cooler and PPO disabled the gap is
still so incredibly small it's even
smaller with the 3600 on the gigabyte
board we failed to find a single game
we're enabling PPO and Auto OC made a
significant difference and PB o plus
Auto C is intended to improve gaming
performance and these marketing video
says that will cut to the clip itself
which allows potentially the CPU to run
at a higher clock speed for a longer
period of time and more clocks be for
longer means more performance especially
in games they just love extra clock
speed so the clip literally says more
clock speed for longer means more
performance especially in games they
just love that extra clock speed we
could test more combinations of boards
and chips but it just isn't happening
without completely changing the
definition of PB o the power delivery
capabilities of the board's we tested is
high the rise in master software reports
that the 3900 acts in 3600 both fall
well below the motherboard defined PBO
limit
and motherboard manufacturers could
triple PPO limits tomorrow if they're
even the ones who control those numbers
they seem some of them are confused on
if that's true and it still wouldn't
make a difference based on what we've
seen for the final charts we'd like to
show some of the differences in power
and frequency behavior with PPO on and
off we did a lot of logging here but we
picked two runs as representative from
the 3900 X and the godlike board one
with P Bo disabled completely I don't
know with PB o and Abel then set to the
motherboard limits with a 200 megahertz
Auto Oh see we started hardware info
logging to put a current clamp around
the CPU EPS 12 volt connectors and ran a
Cinebench R 20 Ron first multi-threaded
then single threaded in the same log
file as you can see on the screen for
these results we scored a 514 and 70 78
for one thread and multi thread and PPO
off we had 520 and 70 to 35 with PBO and
auto OC on so you can see the clocks but
we've scored better with this chip and
board with PBO disabled and there's
still only a 1.2 percent improvement one
thread and 2.2 percent improvement
multi-threaded but if any pass of any
test it's going to show a difference in
frequency this is it we're showing the
peek core clock here because that's the
boost clock which PBO and auto se are
supposed to explicitly benefit and
because the average core clocks are even
closer to identical during the
multi-threaded load at the beginning PBO
and auto SE maintains a 50 megahertz
average but during the single threaded
test any difference is imperceptible
although the higher result with PBO and
auto asean indicates there must be some
delta averaging the peak frequencies
during the single threaded runs comes
out to roughly 45 14.4 megahertz with p
vo off and 45 19 point 5 mega hertz with
PB o and HUD host Heon v core as
reported by hardware info had a more
obvious delta during the multi-threaded
test holding a 1.2 for volt average for
PB o off and 1.3 volt average for PB o
and auto OC the single threaded test
again shows barely any difference and in
fact taking an average has PBO disabled
ahead of the other results at one point
were seven versus one point four six but
that difference is negligible and is
noise our preferred method for logging
powers with the current clamp with PB o
disabled we log the eleven point six
amps multi-threaded three point three
single threaded
or 130 9.2 watts and 39.6 watts and with
PBO and auto c-max we log between 13.9
amps and 14.2 apps I'm holding threaded
and 3.4 M single threaded or 170 point 4
and 40 point 8 watts the multi threaded
amperage actually spikes to 14 point 8
at the beginning but dropped as low as
thirteen point nine during the fairly
brief run which was corroborated by
hardware info power numbers by this
point in testing we had seen so much
variance in clocks and scores that we
knew precision boost was affecting our
results we have liquid nitrogen on hand
so it was easy for us to just dump some
of it onto the 3900 X and see what it
would do under absolutely ideal
conditions stock or with PBO will expand
on this more in a separate piece but for
now we can say that Cinebench r15
running with TDI at about 62 degrees
Celsius scored 31 63 points and that
score scaled all the way up to 34 27
points followed by a blue screen at
minus 56 degrees Celsius for the score
and then blue screen at about minus 70
or so depending and similar more stable
scores were achieved that minus 30 C for
the record these were just some rough
tests to see if PB would continue
scaling clocks with temperature down to
sub-zero and it did that's just
precision boost not overdrive nothing
else was changed no overclocking was
done overdrive was not enabled we just
made it colder and ran it stock we were
maintaining up to nearly 4.4 gigahertz
all core and Cinebench completely stock
PPO disabled higher than the highest all
core overclock we could achieve with a
280 CLC and all without voiding the
warranty precision boost overdrive voids
your CPU warranty not that they can
check that but dumping Ellen 2 onto it
and leaving it stock technically doesn't
void the warranty
in fact enabling PBO and 200 Hertz auto
se you locked us wait maximum 4.2
gigahertz all core and 4.25 with auto OC
disabled this could be down to gigabyte
at this point but we did test time aside
for the other benchmarks he saw earlier
so we still need to replicate this
behavior on the other boards it's
bizarre either way we're never seeing
the 200 megahertz boost from auto se
especially in light of the LNT results
we've gathered so far it seems like PBO
is largely pointless the limits that
it's raising aren't the
limits that we're encountering the limit
that's far far more important is
temperature to the extent that for the
CPU for once
buying a closed-off case which is an
actually good airflow case will be the
difference in clock speeds and not to
give away the whole future content piece
but as we showed in the stream if you
run at say 78 degrees Celsius which is
not unreasonable on a 3900 X you're
looking at maybe 40 50 megahertz average
and 72 you're looking at forty
seventy-five megahertz average you come
all the way down to something like 55
degrees Celsius and now you're adding
200 megahertz to the average core clock
with PBO disabled just running precision
boost to which are different things
again
so if PBO doesn't seem to do a whole lot
here if anything and yeah this even at
the Wraiths spire that isn't rated for
3900 X temperatures that we forcefully
ran we use the worst cooler than and
then it comes with just to force a bad
environment PBO didn't make a
significant difference so we'll work on
nailing down which settings are
restricting the clocks to 4.2 on that
gigabyte board but even with the msi
board we're just we're not really seeing
anything and we can't make wide sweeping
statement saying that pv is broken or
anything like that because maybe it's
working as intended or maybe some of the
board's it works on but not on others we
haven't looked at as rock for example
haven't looked at Asus yet but for these
two boards which do represent a large
part of the market it appears to do
nothing and our understanding is that
this behavior should largely stem to the
other boards too because AMD provides
the bulk of this code so regardless of
the verdict we still haven't discovered
a single scenario in which PBO makes a
significant impact to performance we
also have to include the caveat that we
don't think rising 3,000 processors are
bad unfortunately some of the people who
watch this will not have seen our other
videos or because people have really
short memory when it comes to being
enraged on the internet will have
forgotten them and will think that
because we're saying PBO isn't really
worth playing around with and doesn't
seem to do much that that somehow
translates into us saying
the Rison processors are bad so the mark
there was some marketing here that was
not good and the feature doesn't seem to
do what we expect or what we've been led
to believe it does but the processor is
on the whole are still good we're still
recommending buying the 3600 but
unfortunate we have to include these
notes because of how people just kind of
read comments these days and not
actually watch the content but anyway
precision boost is is from a reviewer
standpoint obviously it's a finicky pain
that's P P and not P vo and that's
because it's harder to control for just
like GPUs are hard to control for so for
a reviewer standpoint everyone needs to
be very careful about things like the
environment temperature and we control
it hard I mean we were our AC bill is
gonna be insane this month because we
were running at the same rough 21 22
degrees Celsius setting for all of the
tests but even that with that control
you're still looking at potential for
differences depending on what order you
ran the test and then how long the CP
has been under load so that's something
reviewers need to pay attention to from
a consumer standpoint it's probably a
good thing because you're effectively
maxing out with a CPU can deal without
any effort and so from a consumer
standpoint always unfortunately except
for enthusiasts removing the ability to
overclock by way of providing all the
performance out of box it's kind of hard
to argue against that unless you're an
enthusiast so anyway what we can say
definitively is that precision boost and
precision boost overdrive and auto or C
are horribly named features they are
very poorly explained even by a in these
official videos and they barely do
anything in terms of naming other than
served to confuse the discussion so we
in the stream that was the best example
because every 15 20 minutes I had to
correct people who were saying he's
using P Bo right now no we were just
using precision boost they're different
it's not the same so that's again that's
not the consumers fault it's Andy's
fault for naming them confusingly so
anyway that's our deep dive on precision
boost Patrick spent several days on this
and there's a lot more we could do yet
but but we got to call it here so
there's more we can do with different
boards going to older boards things like
that seeing where it works that'll wrap
it for now so now you know what
precision boost is supposed to do and
what it does or doesn't do subscribe for
