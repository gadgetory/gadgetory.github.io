architecture post back in 2014 and since
then things have changed a lot once and
force is kind of out of the game right
now
and two SSDs in the sort of 400
gigabytes plus range have finally become
affordable at least a lot more than they
used to be they are now available for
under $200 which back then was unheard
of so things changed a lot today is a
lighter weight content piece on a Black
Friday and Cyber Monday SSD sales we've
seen that would be suitable for gaming
and enthusiasts builds before getting to
that this content is brought to you by
AMD Tsar x4 70 video card which we found
to be the best price to performance
ratio in the sub $200 market though
lately there's been a couple of rx for
ATS available for under 200 as well so
keep an eye out for those link in the
description below if you're curious
about a couple deals so we're about to
ramp back into SSD reviews it's been a
little while since we've done them but
they've always been very in-depth on the
gaming side we test a lot of different
Io workloads with different game
applications in mind in ramping into
that content I've got a couple of the
top choice SSDs we have right now for
sales based on current Black Friday
Cyber Monday offerings they are actually
pretty big in some cases a couple things
to remember with SSD purchases it's a
lot more than just speed so that's the
number everyone kind of gravitates
toward because it's an easy number it
looks large and impressive and it's kind
of like with cars and horsepower
whatever there's a lot more to it than
that
with SSDs more than speed you should
care about things like endurance with
endurance it becomes a matter of total
terabytes written over the span of its
life this is a metric that finally after
years of kind of a lack of standards and
specifications for SSDs manufacturers
are starting to list this total
terabytes written metric for their SSDs
that gives you a loose idea of what it's
capable of over an X year lifespan only
three years or five years depending on
whatever their warranty is so endurance
is important that hinge is partly but
not entirely on the NAND type that would
be mlc SLC TLC is not really SLC anymore
but LLC in TLC and v9 for the most part
and we define those you can see an
animation probably now that we made
previously defining what those are if
you're curious to learn what that means
but also things like garbage collection
we're leveling and right amplification
factor all impact and SSDs endurance and
lifespan you want the right
amplification factor to be as close to
or below one as is reasonable to reduce
the wear on the mandibular we've talked
about all this before but anyway those
things aside all the links for the
suggestions in this best sales guide are
in the description below you can check
those out if you want to find them for
purchase the first one today is we're
starting in ascending order so first one
is the cheapest drive it's a $50 Plextor
m7v which we just used in our ultra
budget gaming PC Guide Plex stores m7v
128 gigabyte SSD VC is our go-to
recommendation for budget oriented
system builds the m7v is one of the most
competitive drives at its price point
for $50.00 it's 128 gigabytes and the
most immediate competition you'll see is
Kingston UV 400 also a pretty decent
Drive nine dollars cheaper but a bit
slower in terms of advertised speeds the
m7v is capable using Iometer of about
ninety eight thousand the IEEE ops 4k
for read and about the same for write
and this is the metric if you're not
familiar with our previous SSD testing
methodology looking at 4k performance
it's also important to look at things
like 16 K but generally 4 K is one of
the most intensive workloads in terms of
i/o requests that you see with a game
and they're always defined as generally
random since 4k random is what you'll
see
sequential is the number that you look
for if you're the type of user who does
a lot of large file transactions for
example in our setups for the media
production environment we'll do a lot of
movement of multi gigabyte files from
one drive to another things like that or
even just write in large files to disk
when you're dealing with a scenario like
that if you're not bottleneck somewhere
else in the system
sequential is what you care about if
you're more interested in gaming and
windows kind of application performance
than 4k is where you should be looking
for the most part though obviously
they're both a bit
depending on what you do so the plaque
store drive is what we'd recommend at
the lowest end and is fairly affordable
the next drive the HyperX savage is one
that we reviewed previously and reviewed
in 2015 I believe we have some of the
metrics here on the screen where you can
see the performance back then in 2015 of
the savage drive versus things like the
HyperX predator which is a PCIe enabled
device it uses an m2 on an AIC and we've
also got things like some of the samsung
drives on that chart you can kind of
compare them for basic metrics but the
savage right now finally has dropped to
a sub $100 price and this is something
that in the original review I remarked
that at its 120-130 dollar launch price
it really it was good in terms of
performance endurance all the test
results were good but the price was kind
of borderline not competitive now nearer
$100 it is a more competitive device and
the thing here to note is that in terms
of cost per gigabyte the savage is a bit
more expensive than some of these other
devices we're talking about especially
once you get up into the crucial MX 300
for example but it uses MLC which will
aid in a few things but mostly endurance
and again that also depends on how the
controller interacts with the data and
data entropy and things like that but
it's got an LC that's a big difference
and it is at more speed oriented than
some of the other devices we'll be
talking about
so the savage drive is the one I'd
recommend if you're looking for
something like 240 gigabytes for
basically an OS your most important
applications like web browsers that tend
to need the speed and office
applications that if you run them
production applications like premier
that's what I'd use this average for
your games would pretty much go on to
another Drive normally a hard drive or a
large SSD if you can afford it so that's
where I'd look for someone who's more
interested in the speed and endurance
factor and doesn't care as much about
capacity if you care more about capacity
which is another completely valid use
case scenario then you do speed the next
drive to look at would be the crucial MX
300 this is a 525 gigabyte Drive it's
currently available for $110 on I think
both Amma's
and Newegg I have at least one of the
links below if you're interested in it I
am Not sure that sale will last all the
way through Cyber Monday but it's there
now so 525 gigabytes at $110 is probably
the best price to two gigabyte ratio
that we have on this list but it is a
bit slower and it's also using TLC
that's not a bad thing necessarily it
just means that generally you should
expect a bit different performance and
MLC with TLC you store three bits of
data per cell with MLC you get two bits
of data per cells so there's more data
per cell with TLC but the voltage checks
are also going to be more granular and
that becomes a problem as the device
ages and loses its electrical charge and
so forth and again that's all discussed
in our what is an and video on the
channel but the MX 300 is a good drive
at it's 500 plus gigabyte capacity
especially if you're again we're
concerned about storage than speed the
next drive to look at is pretty
comparable to the mi 300 but the main
difference is that it comes with
watchdogs 2 for free obviously coming
out this week and that is the Samsung
850 Evo been around for a little while
there's a 500 gigabyte option right now
for $130 includes the watchdog's game if
you don't want watchdogs I'd probably
take this off the list because that is
the major advantage here to this Drive
still not a bad Drive but the
competitors do tend to beat it out a
little bit in price performance and
price to the capacity without the
watchdogs to bundle in there so that
gets a quick aside mention the Samsung
850 Evo 500 gigabyte Drive operates at
an advertised 540 or 520 megabytes per
second readwrite sequential and then if
you care more about 4k then you're
looking at something like 98 thousand
and 90,000 readwrite I ops using Iometer
testing the MX 300 by way of comparison
operates at about 90 mm I ops 4k read
and about 83,000 4k right with
sequential in the range of 530 and 510
read/write respectively
moving down the list Intel's 600 P is
the next major drive to look at Intel
makes some of the most interesting
drives to follow in the industry and
that's because
at the very start of this with the
x-series SSDs from Intel which were SLC
they were sort of the pioneers of modern
SSDs and for that reason alone it's
worth following them because nvme
another modern technology is largely
being driven by Intel devices you see
there nvme SSDs that are in PCIe slots
like the 750 series those are probably
among the fast will definitely among the
fastest SSDs on the market they're not
included here because they're expensive
and then on the other sort of cheaper
end of the same spectrum the 600 P 512
gigabytes right now $150 Drive it peels
off PCIe lanes it's basically it's an
nvme drive and it operates upwards of
100 28,000 the IEEE ops 4k read that's
the fastest we've seen here so far and
the same for right so 128 K read/write
performance now sequential is a bit more
interesting with these nvm u drives both
the ones we have listed here today which
we've got the Plextor drive and the
intel drive with sequential you're
looking at a really high read in this
case it's almost 1.8 gigabytes per
second read 1775 megabytes per second or
so at a bit lower write closer to 500
550 megabytes per second but almost all
data that the average user is consuming
on a PC is going to be read data it's
only in specific cases like again with
your developer or production worker then
you're looking more at writes and if you
care about writes you know who you are
already on one thing with the 600 P it
is an m2 Drive and it doesn't come with
an add-in card at least not the one
we've chosen at this price the next
drive is another nvme drive this one is
the Plextor
M HP II which will soon be reviewing
I've already got them in-house and
they've been on the task bench but that
drive currently $220 for the m8 PE 512
gigabytes and again this is a trade off
where if you remember about a hundred
dollars ago we had the crucial drive
similar capacity but half the price the
reason for that obviously is because
we're working with nvme here it's much
faster and the plaque store Drive
specifically is looking at fairly
competitive rates with the Intel 600 P
it
120k is 4k read about 130 k 4k right the
sequential speeds are some around 1600
megabytes per second read and some
around 500 megabytes per second right so
marginally slower on the reads for the I
ops 4k read I ops and barge ly faster in
the writes for 4k I ops and a bit slower
in both metrics for sequential however
the Plextor ma PE is an add-in card so
this goes into a PCIe slot rather than
an m dot 2 slot on the board so if you
don't have an m dot 2 slot where you
don't want to use it for some reason
something like this would make sense now
Plextor does have an on adding card
version so if you prefer that it's out
there as well but that will operate on
nvm II it goes in a PCIe slot and
finally just kind of to top off the high
end or high end of price here anyway not
actually performance these Sam's on 850
Evo is available now in two terabyte
capacities pretty Tamm large and it's
$585 that it sits in terms of price for
SSDs at one terabyte and higher it's not
bad when you look at them relatively
kind of within a vacuum obviously that's
very expensive because you could buy two
terabyte hard drive for less than
probably 60 65 dollars and it would be
decent so that one's a bit of a harder
pill to swallow if you are in one of the
specific use cases where it would save
you money in terms of production time to
have a 2 terabyte SSD it's tremendously
faster than a hard drive obviously it's
got no moving components either it's
going to be quieter things like that all
true for all these drives so if you can
afford that $600 two terabytes I suppose
it's the best deal out there for this
type of capacity on an SSD or at least
one of the best few deals out there
there are a couple competitor drives
that are close but you're probably
looking at the cheaper drives for the
most part the 240 256 even 500 gigabytes
in the case of the crucial and other
Samsung 850 era drive but I want to
throw the tube Tarot in there for fun
because it's pretty impressive
considering last year maybe 18 months
this price for a 400 500 gigabyte drive
was also really not that bad so thank
you for watching as always patreon link
in the post roll video we've got a
couple more pieces coming out soon I
have an update or in a sort of extended
version of my conversation with build
Zoid where we talk about the EVGA VRMs I
know I said I'm done with that but we
already filmed it and only included a
few minutes in the video originally so
that will be going up the next few days
make sure you subscribe for that and for
more coverage and as always I'll see you
all next time
you
