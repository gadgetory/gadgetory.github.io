Computex 2018 we're looking at be 450
motherboards we've already talked about
these a bit previously we talked about
the cancellation of Z 490 in our news
video so that's gone but B 450 is here
to stay and coming out probably end of
July or something like that
yeah end of July is about the TBD
timeline for that one before that this
video is brought to you by thermal
Grizzlies high-end therole paste and
liquid metal Thermal Grizzlies cryo knot
is an affordable high quality thermal
compound that doesn't face some of the
aging limitations of other pastes on the
market bio not has a thermal
conductivity of 12.5 watts per meter
Kelvin focuses on endurance is easy to
spread and isn't electrically conductive
making it safe to use on GPU dies
thermal grizzly also makes conductor not
liquid metal but previews to drop 20
degrees off some temperatures than our
deal it and test by a tube at the link
in the description below so these boards
they've got a couple of them that we
need to go over that one's been around
but B 4/5 you have gaming K for a pro 4
HD V which is this one right here micro
ATX there's another micro ATX up here B
450 I'm Pro 4 and then also down here
the B 450 gaming ITX board with AC
Wireless so in terms of the layout here
not much has changed before 50 isn't
really all that new or confusing or
anything it's pretty straightforward
chipset if you know the B 300 series
chipset from AMD same basic idea just
refreshed for the Rison plus lineup and
risin to the changes are primarily on
the motherboard side for BIOS memory
support memory tuning all that stuff
stuff that is unseen physically on these
boards but the vendors are still
launching new boards the gaming k4 will
start there this is a pretty
straightforward design so k4 is a six
plus three phase I don't know the exact
unfortunately MOSFETs on it because they
haven't told us but we do know that it's
an inner cell voltage controller so is
al for the voltage controller unclear on
MOSFET selection unclear a lot of the
other SMD is actually two for PCIe
assignment there's a by 16 slot in the
top by eight in the bottom you can see
it's physically wired for 16 verses 8
and then a couple of the smaller slots
in between other than that that's really
it for this board so be 450k for
so I guess in addition to those one PCIe
m2 and the other SATA and that's it
that's the whole board they do I will
say have a heatsink that has actual fins
diced out of it it's not the fin density
we'd like to see but I guess it's okay
it's better than a lot of their
competitors so that's a start the next
sport so the B 450 Pro there's a pro 4
and then the pro 4 micro ATX p450 Pro
the ATX board down to by bottom right is
a six plus three phase again unclear on
the MOSFETs and also inner-selves ulties
controller so is I'll once again PCIe by
16 for the top by it for the bottom one
PCIe
m21 SATA and end of July price TBD on
that one I will say the pro force used
previously for the previous B series B
350 was one of the better be 350 boards
there are a lot of garbage ones and the
pro 4 was actually ok it was acceptable
a lot of them had really really bad be
RMS and bad thermal solutions if you can
call them that so next one B 450 M pro 4
we might as well move there next that's
the micro ATX version same idea it's
just smaller pretty straightforward for
that and then the B 450 MHz V right here
behind me there's another micro ATX
board and this one is set up as a 1 2 3
4 or 4 plus 3 or something like that
possibly we're not clear it could be I
don't know I don't know what the
components are on there but it looks
like a 4 plus 3 so that's the HDV board
and this one unsure on MOSFETs once
again is elbows controller once against
they bought a bucket of those and use
them on everything PCIe by 16 is the
only slot on the board for this one for
PCIe by 16 it is wired electrically four
by sixteen one PCIe m2 and then DVD for
the price end of July for the release
date I think that pretty much cut oh
there's one more I TX board it's be 450
board at an ITX form factor pretty
straightforward
I'm counting one two three counting
eight chokes on it don't know the BRM
setup for it is L once again for the
controller we'd have to pull the
heatsink off to look at the MOSFETs and
see exactly what those are but that's
the ass Rock line up for coffee - 2018
