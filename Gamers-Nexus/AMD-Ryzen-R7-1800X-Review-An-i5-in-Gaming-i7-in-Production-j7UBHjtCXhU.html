velocities capable of entering low-earth
orbit as we ramped into today's launch
we had four days with all hands on deck
to benchmark the and the risin are seven
1800 X that were reviewing today
socketed in aces high-end X 370
crosshair motherboard our risin are 7
1700 review opposed tomorrow with the
1700 x review posting the day after that
today we're looking at the 1800 X and
blender premiere thermals and gaming
workloads and before getting to risin
this coverage is brought to you by a
thermal takes new contacts island 12 CPU
cooler the contact silent 12 fully
supports the am for socket type and aims
to be available around the 30 dollar
mark thermal takes contact 12 uses a
hydraulic bearing for longer and quieter
operation and would do well on an AR 7
1700 s learn more at the link
description below speaking of links in
the description this review is massive
it's a new architecture so check the
link in the description below for the
full review its nearing 10,000 words has
a bit more depth than we have here
because of time constraints to check the
article for the full rise in
architecture and benchmark but we can go
into most of it here the core specs are
on the screen now the r5 1600 X and 1500
act interestingly it will offer sub $300
parts with 6 cores and the 12 threads in
quarter 2 with our three parts do in the
second half today we're looking only at
the r7 1800 X for some brief details and
major changes to the rise in the
architecture center around the ccac's
and at replacement of bulldozer modules
rise in CC X moves to implementing a
single FPU per core rather than one per
two integer units on bulldozer and it
also uses a single sim D and private l2
cache per core Andy has moved to wider
instruction level parallelism but still
uses narrower floating-point units and
Andy is running 512 K of l2 cache for
core at 1.5 millimeters squared per core
this 512 K cache is eight way
associative so Andy doesn't need probes
to interfere with low latency caches
during snoops
the SRAM is less dense than Intel's but
is still 60 SRAM for tagging data with
eight T at four state l3 cache totaled 8
megabytes at 16 millimeters squared of
the total die area which by the way is
44 millimeter square
l-3 is also 16 way associative and
shares pol with all cores the l3 cache
can be shut down if only l1 and l2 are
in use which helps with automated power
savings each CCX is a fork or a thread
module means that we won't be seen
dual-core CPUs out of the currently
known Zen architecture and these l1 and
l2 bandwidths are up about two times
over previous architectures with l3 up
about fivefold the victim cache is
shared across the ccac's and operates at
the frequency of the fastest core which
means that it also reduces frequency
alongside the fastest chord to further
provide power savings for each integer
units there are 4 Al use in to AG use or
address generation units with a 2 K op
cache present and Angie's got a new
micro app cache that is also something
we'll be talking on the article and
these Q have gotten significantly larger
versus bulldozer though the company does
still have major architectural
differences from Intel one example would
be am these AV X units the company is
running to 128 bit wide units instead of
the 256-bit wide units in skylake and is
using two 256 bit load port this design
takes less space over all contributing
to andis smaller area per core than
comparable Intel chips but does it mean
that we should expect different vector
performance andy is also running one
fewer aju than its direct competition
which should help the company clock
higher and will also lower power
consumption this is potentially at the
cost of performance and workloads that
can saturate 3ag use with two loads and
to store for clock but Andy thinks that
it's worth the trade-off as for an
answer to Intel's fiber and the has one
they're sticking with linear voltage
regulators to reduce complexity heat and
retain conversion efficiency and given
how Intel's fiber was received that
might be a good choice if you're curious
about the m4 chipset differences we
already have that content on the channel
search for and port chipset differences
or hit the link in the description below
to the full review let's talk about
memory for now in the leaks leading up
to aizen's launch there were plenty of
toasts by users and other sites that
talked about potential memory
limitations on Rison this was true to
some extent though maybe not as
exaggerated
as some folks may have made it the
official memory support for Eisen right
now is 2667 megahertz that's what was
largely suggested for benchmarking we
were able to clock up to 29 33 megahertz
on the kit provided and used that for
our tests and we're not able to sustain
higher clock rates than 29 33 for a few
reasons one of them we have a high next
I Corsair kit it officially is rated for
3,000 megahertz but to get any kind of
higher frequency you would need to do a
few things one custom reference clock
and V dim tuning and to ideally step
through memory training and then three
note that there is a distinct lack of
memory sub timings in Rison and that's
more of an ante Amanda motherboard
things that would be less on ASIS and
more on Andy this makes it a little
difficult to get the higher clock rates
that some of the kids might sell at and
at the time we were working on this
review which is of course prior to
launch the only officially validated kit
of memory is the Corsair 3,000 megahertz
of engines LTX kits that we had access
to which again we clock to 29 33
megahertz and after the theory there was
time to get to the benchmark as always
the full testing methodology and all the
platforms used it's defined in the
article in the description below we have
to obviously change motherboard memory
depending on architecture stuff like
that it's all defined down there and
we're going to start with the risin
thermals versus clock over time and then
we'll be moving on to Adobe Premiere
Blender and gaming workloads this first
chart shows two things primarily we're
looking at CPU Junction temperature in
blue and average frequency of the cores
in red
ideally the redline is perfectly flat
when under heavy load indicating a more
stable core clock the blue line should
never exceed 75 C as that is technically
AMD's maximum junction temperature for
the 1800 X or t.j.maxx we were able to
intentionally trip a thermal shutdown by
heating the CPU beyond 75 C and
validated that yes t.j.maxx is in fact
between 75 and 80 Celsius gauging
thermal performance on AMD isn't exactly
easy and the diode reporting has some
inconsistencies at times that manifest
form of massive reported temperature
drop in reality we're able to use
thermal probes mounted to the package to
gain some additional insight as to the
accuracy of the measurements and then we
can make appropriate adjustments to our
testing methodology if we zoom into the
chart you'll see that the clock rate
becomes less stable and starts to
fluctuate in increments of 25 to 75
megahertz at once temperature approaches
73 to 75 Celsius this is and these
internal sensors working with the clocks
to keep temperatures under control down
clocking and rapid intervals and up
clocking again to keep thermals below 75
C and by the way this is with an NZXT
crack and X 62 at max fan speeds so it's
running pretty hot this is an 1800 X
anyone putting this chip under 100%
workloads for long up times like blender
rendering and things like that should
seriously consider better cooling than
the nock to a unit that Andy provided
most reviewers and that's why we
switched thanks to the m3 support on the
crosshair to an X 62 now we also log
voltages versus applications power draw
things like that for comparative power
draw charts link in the description
below but we can go over the basics now
with 185 at watts total system power
consumption again that's total system
power consumption we see the rise in r7
1800 X operating at a steady boost
frequency of 3.7 gigahertz when all
cores are engaged this number only ever
increases to excess power range of four
point one if a single thread workload is
underway which is pretty uncommon for
most of our audience but we do have some
tests to show it the voltage it to
sustain blender at this clock rates and
100% load ranges from 1.2 to 1 V 2 4 3
Cinebench 1t pushes us up to 4 point 1
gigahertz at times but fluctuates
between three point seven and four point
one this workload generates a voltage of
about one point three nine five to one
point four six 1v core with total system
power consumption at 92 watts
finally pov-ray 1t runs a 94 watt system
power draw with 4.1 gigahertz fixed for
the frequency fully an acts of our range
for the entire bench and a core voltage
of about one point four one seven volts
let's open up with rising strong points
our video production workload is a
real-world test pulling from files and
exports
from our EVGA icx review so this is a
real render for our youtube channel
color correction transforms and other
calculations like warp stabilization may
be included in the render check the
article below for specific render
settings configured to its stock clocks
the r7 1800 X completes the path in
sixty 7.4 minutes with the sixty nine
hundred K completing the video render in
sixty eight point five minutes if you
prefer percentages that's a change of
one to two percent and rendering terms
you'd be saving about one minutes for
every hour of encoding ignoring all
context that's not impressive but
context is what matters the context here
is that the 1800 X is a five hundred
dollar CPU with high end motherboard
support - like me crosshair available
for two hundred fifty five dollars Intel
i7 sixty nine hundred K is a thousand
dollars and high-end motherboards cost
three hundred plus
quad channel memory of course is lost
with Verizon but it's also not the most
beneficial item in this type of test
that said anyone running production
renders knows it's the GPU that counts
for most rendering tasks despite some
specific use cases where a high-end CPU
can be beneficial for premiere we'd
never use the CPU as a primary render
workhorse CUDA and OpenCL acceleration
we're supported are significantly faster
and this is where Andy's argument starts
to fall apart this chart puts our render
numbers into perspective relying instead
on the GTX 980 FTW and CUDA for the
rendering process the result is expected
our render times dropped from 60 minutes
to 20 minutes or thereabouts rendering
on the CPU takes three times as long and
using a rising CPU and GPU is not any
faster really much slower than using a
sixty nine hundred K and the same GPU to
render and the deserves praise for
accomplishing comparable render speeds
to intel's double costed cpu the sixty
nine hundred k but we also have to frame
that praise within reality and the
reality is that for this type of
workload you're probably using cuda
anyway so the argument is a bit weaker
when considering that option moving on
to blender GN uses a custom-built
blender benchmark for its cpu rendering
performance analysis the benchmark mixes
for rendering motion blur multi bounce
rate racing and various
transparencies and mattes the Andy it
Rison r7 1800 X completes the frame
render ingest under twenty eight point
seven three minutes with the i7 69 100k
completing the render in twenty nine
point five minutes this puts and these
five hundred dollar eighteen hundred X
about on par with you one thousand
dollars fifty nine hundred K in the
blender rendered tasks at least when
both are in stock configuration the r7
1800 X is therefore about one to one
point one percent faster normally this
would be unsurprising or uninteresting
but the price makes and these are seven
platform a worthy consideration over
clocks we see the sixty nine hundred K
at four point four gigahertz reduces
render time into twenty five point three
five minutes while the rise in chip
overclocked is at twenty seven point
eight minutes so Intel now pulls ahead
and the falls behind on overclocking but
still half the price Intel also
overclocked so definitely higher in
memory if you were to actually try which
we didn't do too much with that and
that's potentially useful in some
specific tasks as for other devices the
three hundred forty dollar seventy seven
hundred K a stock hyper threading on
completes the same render in forty two
to four minutes with the overclocked
variants finishing and thirty eight
minutes we're curious to see how the
rise in our seven seventeen hundred
holds up to the seventy seven hundred K
in this task for reference the 83-70
completes in ninety point two two
minutes so either way Andy's doing a lot
better than previously rise and holds a
lead here even if it does come down to a
difference of about one point one
percent but now it's time to move on to
gaming workloads so if you want to see
the rest of the synthetics and other
test that includes fire strike Cinebench
and time spy and pov-ray benchmarks you
can find all that in the link in the
description below and the full review
article moving onto the battlefield one
the sixty nine hundred k and seventy
seven hundred k overclock so some loss
and lows are bumping against the wall
around one forty-one to one forty two
FPS average we're still seeing the high
IPC and clock rates of a 70 to 100 k
planting the chip about equal to an i7
sixty nine hundred k this remains true
for the 6700 k5 five seventy six hundred
K and the i7 4790k by five sixty six
hundred K begins to drag behind a visit
137 FPS average and that CPU is
eventually trailed by the r7 to 1800 X
overclocked to three point nine
gigahertz which lands somewhere around
135 FPS average one percent lows hover
around 109 with 0.1% at nine
before for the overclock subversion of
the CPU and considering the low
percentile performance of neighboring
chips
that's good performance overall however
considering the price and age of those
nearby chips the 1800 X doesn't look so
great in this particular benchmark
ultimately the $500 r7 1800 X is
effectively equivalent to an i5 4690k in
this battlefield one benchmark the i5
4690k came out a few years ago and once
retailed for $240 trade off the bound as
usual with the r7 being veteran
production the one thing is clear the
1800 X is not impressive in the
battlefield 1 department and is matched
evenly by 2014 Intel architectures you
may have noticed a black bar across the
data let's remove that now disabling SMT
or simultaneous multi-threading on the
r7 1800 X results in performance that
boosts us to 135 FPS average from the
132 FPS average of the stock clock r7
1800 X because the gamers Nexus also
measures frame times we benefit from the
knowledge that disabling SMT further
increases 1% low and 0.1% low metrics by
upwards of 30 fps in some cases around
30% better 1% low values with SMT off
you'd be better off disabling SMT than
overclocking in some cases so if you do
both you'll get even more of a
performance jump and by the way Andy is
not alone on that previously in much
older architectures when we tested years
ago Intel hyper-threading did add a bit
of overhead to the point where in some
games and applications disabling a hyper
threading might have gotten you 1 to 2%
FPS increase so not as big with
differences and Eocene here with this
SMT toggling but also Andy is not alone
the overhead from multi-threading
simultaneous or hyper threading however
you want to call it is real and it's
something we've seen in the past it just
so happens that Intel doesn't really see
that effect anymore
total war was only just added to our
charts in time for the 2600 K reviews so
all the i7 CTS haven't been fully
subsumed by the warhammer bench just yet
we're hammer also gets finicky about the
stability of some overclocks so as
you'll see in the frame time metrics for
the 6900 K they can jump up and down a
bit to the point where it's not always
the most usable metric with this
particular game where hammer appreciates
clock speed - great
extent we see the trade-off between
cores and frequency when ricochet in
between the 7700 km 5900 K processors by
770 700k pulls ahead in every regard
when pitted against these 6900 k thanks
to its 4.5 and 5.1 gigahertz clocks and
lands around 186 27 FPS average and
let's stock as for the rise in r7 1800 X
the new at Zen arc CPU land between the
70 350 K stock and the 5.0 gigahertz
overclocked variant total war shows a
clear frequency focus further emboldened
by the 1800 X's at 5 fps or about 4%
increase from a 200 megahertz overclock
partly for this reason among other
architectural advantages Intel again
holds the lead even with processors of
significantly lower cost we still
wouldn't recommend that you go out and
buy an IV 73 to PK not for $180 anyway
but the 1800 X performs just slightly
better than the over price but still
cheaper I 3k skew CPU let's move that
blackout bar total Warhammer now shows
the biggest change in performance when
disabling SMP the AMD r7 1800 X moves
from 127 to 132 FPS average depending on
the test and speed to 153 FPS average
with SMP off the table Anandi's most
advertised property is increasing
performance in the best case or in the
worst case resulting in basically no
performance difference SMT seems to
hamstring frame latency to some extent
and creates enough overhead to burden us
in total
Warhammer let's look at watchdogs to
next at 1080p high we're seeing the
sixty nine hundred K top charts around
119 FPS where we're beginning to
encounter a GPU bottleneck on the 1080
FTW the low percentile performance it's
at 94 FPS 1% 77 fps 0.1% comparatively
the half-price r7 1800 X is operating
around 284 FPS average with 1% lows
hanging around 62 fps and 50 FPS 0.1% in
terms of raw frame rate that is a
performance delta of approximately 35
fps and averages between the two
comparatively the 7700 K stock operates
at around 113 FPS average with the 6700
K skylake CP around 110 average even the
devil's canyon 4790k circus 2nd quarter
2014 is outperforming the r7 18
hundred x please not 100 FPS average
disabling hyper-threading on the 7700 K
plants was about equal to the r7 1800 XS
empty enabled so eight core 16 threads
further demonstrating and architectural
advantage for Intel right now in gaming
workloads outside of the raw core and
thread count of the AMD CPU overclock in
the 1800 X pushes to 87 FPS average with
marginal improvements in the lows the
maximum sustainable overclock with our
chip and motherboard seems to be about
3.9 gigahertz resulting in an increase
of 3.2 percent from stock so we're at
3.7 gigahertz on all cores stock or 3.9
with EOC and ultimately for watchdogs to
the 1800 X performs mostly equally to an
Intel i5 7600 K CPU for $240 disabling
SMT reveals that performance is largely
the same in watchdogs - not as profound
as in total warhammer netting an output
of 85 FPS average versus the original
84.3 FPS average so that's um he doesn't
really help Andy here but it's not
hurting either
and by the way watchdogs too will
utilize all the threads to some extent
not the only thing that matters in this
case clock rate still matters but this
illustrates quite clearly that just
having more cores doesn't when all
arguments by default and that's
something we've experienced time and
again let's CPU architectures that
venture into a high core count territory
for time reasons you can find the ashes
of a singularity Metro last light in GTA
in the article in the description below
if you want those benchmarks we move on
to a little bit of 1440p now when we
presented some of our early findings to
AMD they suggested that we benchmark the
CPU by creating the GPU bottleneck with
1440p resolution still it's a little
misleading to the overall capabilities
of the CPUs that such a benchmark means
that future GPU upgrades could be
bottlenecks by the CPU which wouldn't be
known if we were incorrectly passing the
CPU by imposing GPU bottlenecks
regardless we ran a few anyways despite
only having four days to test the CPU
here's a look at watchdogs 2 at 1440p
high the AMD r7 1800 actually when take
in Andy's suggestion of burdening the
GPU is still performing at a frame rate
deficit to the cheaper 7700 K now of
course the next argument might be that
the visible difference between 86 and 77
FPS average is not profound and that be
a fine argument it unfortunately
doesn't make sense to spend more money
and get less that's just bad value
besides when considering the CPU and
platform tend to last the longest in the
system upgrade pathways are going to be
better on the platform which has the
highest baseline performance frame times
that suffer a bit with the 1800 X file
in 248 Giovanna jean-louis 60 fps 1% low
versus the 7700 K at 68 0.1% in 74 1 %
this isn't something where we're seeing
stuttering he'd have to fall a lot lower
for that so mark that very clearly not
stuttering but it does indicate that
Andy has other potential weaknesses that
could emerge under the right conditions
or later on the next argument might be
that mixed workloads users like content
creators would benefit from production
advantages afforded by Rison that's a
much stronger argument but still has
caveats encounters will point you back
to the premier benchmarks for that
discussion
moving on to battlefield one at 1440p
we're definitely developing the AGV
bottleneck and beginning to invalidate
the wants of 120 + 144 Hertz users the
1800 X using the GPU as a crutch is now
more or less on par with these seventy
seven hundred and sixty nine hundred
ksed use and we're still seeing a
decreased frame latency versus Intel but
just like with loss talk - that's not
producing any noticeable stuttering to
the end user
it's just measurable in this particular
title benchmarking incorrectly does make
the numbers look better for the 1,800 X
but the 7700 I perform zit is cheaper
and really we have to defer to the r7
1700 at $330 to see how andis future
looks with gaming titles we'll be
testing that hopefully tomorrow at this
point you might be feeling a little
disillusioned that when considering and
these previous tech demos keep in mind
that most of the charts leaked and the
and the official benchmarks shown were
based on Cinebench or were gaming
workloads that were inflated in one way
or another by doing a few different
things in benchmarking the Sniper Elite
demo and the frequently looked at the
skybox when reloading and often kept a
larger percentage of the skybox
macrosse1 than the other side by side
Intel processor a skybox has no geometry
which is what loads the CT with draw
calls and so it will inflate the frame
rate by nature of tasking with a
chaotically conducted methodology as for
the battlefield 1 benchmarks that were
demonstrated at the Sonoma event and the
conducted be is using other
chaotic methods wherein and II would
zoom more frequently or at different
intervals than the side-by-side Intel
CPU making it mostly impossible to
actually compare the two heads ahead so
you're left with a number that basically
says these are more or less equal and
most importantly of all these demos were
run at a 4k resolution that creates a
GPU bottleneck meaning we're no longer
observing true cv performance there's an
argument to be made that low-end
performance doesn't matter if you're
stuck on the GPU but that argument
doesn't always hold you don't buy a
worse performing product for more money
especially when GPU upgrades in the
future will eventually even out those
limitations as bottlenecks external to
the CPU vanish as for blender
benchmarking although Andy was looking
at deltas and so it doesn't matter too
much Andy did demonstrated splendored
benchmarks using different settings to
what we would recommend and it's blender
testing and the execute surrenders using
just 150 samples per pixel or what we
consider to be preview quality and runs
unoptimized well somewhat at 32 by 32
tile sizes not awful but we'd recommend
16 by 16
they also render at 800 by 800
resolution in our benchmark render using
400 samples for pixel for release
candidate quality 16 by 16 tiles and a
4k resolution this means that our
benchmarks are not comparable to an B's
but they are comparable against the
other CPUs we've tested as for Cinebench
Andy ran those tests with the 6900 Kay
platform using memory and dual channel
rather than its full quad channel
capabilities that's not to say that
these results would drastically change
but it's also not representative of how
anyone would use an X 99 platform
Cinebench isn't everything that neither
is core count as software developers
move to support more threads if they do
perhaps Andy would look better for now
it is clearly not a good buy the 1800 X
that is in the gaming market there is an
argument to be made for the 1800 X and
its value in production workloads again
premier and blender it looks pretty good
compared to the $1000 Intel chip half
the price it performs at least equally
if not slightly better other than when
you overclocked Intel so there it looks
good but again you have to consider are
these workloads that are production
focused something you can push to a much
faster GPU even if it's a 1070 or
something like that because at that
point
a lot of reasons by either the $1,000 or
the and the $500 chip there are uses for
the software acceleration but if you're
one of those people who needs that you
can hopefully figure out how the
performance looks on your own the r7
1700 may prove a better value for gaming
we'll have those benchmarks shortly for
now though the 1800 axis of
disappointment and is not a processor we
would recommend for gamers at its price
point even mixed workload users should
consider when and where software
acceleration is better than GPU
acceleration if ever
wellyes overall the 1800 X is an
impressive competitor to the 6900 k and
it's significantly cheaper so we'd
recommend the 1800 X over the 69 hundred
K if you are in one of those use case
environments where it makes sense to
have such a thing for now we're going to
suggest waiting for the r7 17100 of you
if you're a gamer and hopefully buying
in the lower end market because if that
might have a better chance at competing
with Intel considering the giant price
to performance disparity between the
lower end chips and the higher end chips
