Dyson go figure
they actually bother and then we also
raped off some tape from the floor so
that's the progress so far to be working
on building tables shelves why aren't
even end something that is well pretty
soon before that this video is brought
to you by Dollar Shave club's daily
essentials starter set this full
grooming kit ships at five dollars and
includes a trial sized versions of the
companies that popular shave butter body
wash and wipes and also includes a solid
high quality razor and a full set of
cartridges go to dollarshaveclub.com
slash gamers nexus to get the daily
essentials starter kit for just five
dollars and with free shipping or click
the link below alright guys so what
we're gonna do is unload six really
heavy shelves you can watch the two
sweatiest nerds in existence be sweating
all day thanks he is a these are going
to be for our storage for all the stuff
that we have obviously
scraping
what is it this is the shelf
it's done
we need to go buy six more boxes of
these so that we can have more elevated
shelf space off the ground it's crazy
how expensive it is to make one shelf
that's two feet high but yeah all that
work just - it's nice see Patrick gets
it
there's a lot more sense if they would
actually sell the shelves that are on
the picture instead of just these box
yeah that's weird
I promise the issues that their fancy
box of peripherals we didn't ask for it
would be the first thing that came into
the office we never made a video about
it because we don't review peripherals
but they sent it so there it is Ross
we're gonna use these on one of the
workstations they sent this stuff over a
little while ago and the places we don't
review peripherals anymore so these
never got coverage they've been sitting
in the box came in and set the mouth so
we'll put that on all the workstations
already Strix Blair ROG Strix fusion
headset in the mouth I don't know if
they're any good I'm not sure but Asus
was basically like hey you guys ever
cover that stuff we sent that you didn't
ask for and that you don't cover I said
no and I said you can actually use that
stuff on workstation genuinely use it
for real not just like do some unboxing
video and that will be that's it so
there you go Asus covered it is covered
in sawdust the sawdust I don't think
comes with the retail version
see we got I'm guessing this is cat5e so
it can only do like a gigabit baby and
we're gonna put cat 6 which it properly
terminated and dudette can do up to 10
megabits but one of these gotta work out
as we have to figure out how are we
gonna change these little jacks or not
if we don't change the jacks it won't be
able to go to 10 gigabit but we'll see
- happens so Patrick stone is from a
conduit north cackalacky engineering
school if you don't get a tetanus shot
this is a great good shot
all right so stop muttering what are we
done so the idea here is that we're in
pretty good shape because we already
have wire run which means when we pull
the new wire through we can just attach
it to the old wire and then you don't
have to worry about figuring out how to
get the wire down in the conduit
otherwise you use like wire gel which
allows it to reduce the friction because
getting wire through conduit that
already has wire and it is nasty
yeah if you're not pulling through yeah
so we're we're doing a cat6 install
basically we're doing in there bunch of
these outlets lower down on the walls
with ethernet amendment for some work at
5 or 10 5e we want 10 gigabit internally
for the NASS for 10 gigabits which we've
had for the rendering stations so
there's all of your wired 10 gigabit to
space is a plan that's about 4000 feet
of cat 6 which hopefully that's not but
we'll see
what are you just cutting it or
something I'm just gonna put the ceiling
yeah that sounds good we have someone
else it'll be there right okay so it's
gonna be mark and what it does is like
it allows you to bring in equipment on
one side and then equipment on the other
side doing them together without having
to worry about short-circuiting anything
because these two guys on this side park
together and then these two guys on this
side are together electrically so
they're just bridged underneath and then
whenever you're ready to like allow this
piece of equipment to talk to this piece
of equipment they're these little metal
brackets that go on between the two and
that's how you sort of jumper them
together and it's old telephone
technology from like the I mean two 90s
eighties it may even go back way past
that but this is what I was trained on
when I was first doing telecom and
network engineering so old stuff I'm
taking it off nobody wants him anymore
Eve we're gonna thank ya just yank it
off the wall that's at t1 communications
line so you would you would bring it in
through usually bonded sets of telephone
wire like this stuff over here and then
you'd have a t1 channel and then there
would be a card in here and that card
would work as the modem to make that t1
channel accessible for your network
inside the office but T ones were
placing 1.544 megabits per second
blazing fast
and again nobody uses these anymore
because they're too slow
all right so keaghlan just finished
building this this this is my wife's you
said we were originally thinking about
putting this table back here and then
having we're gonna get like a pretty
fancy like husky workbench tour with 18
other side of Jordans in it it's really
thing you put that in front of me in
this back there and now I think we've
drawn the other way because this is a
deeper service so it's 30 inches as
opposed to 24 on that one and I think
it'll add some nice depth to that a shot
and I also think that we it'll it'll
look cool to just see all the drawers
back there so that's kind of idea right
now this is the new table for in the
very least the livestreams if not also
made by another one for the a roll set
because I do really like this table so
far 200 bucks for the table 60 for the
drawer so 270 for the after tax and
everything something like that really
not bad better than what we have now the
difference is what we have now is
expensive because if I stand at myself
and all that stuff but also it is height
adjustable and we never use that feature
and that's why wobbles so this one
gentleman doing that would make the
other one just I could do that on the
other table and take my hands off and if
I will have one or two seconds this
one's way better so I have to actually
try to move it so here that's that's a
good start like the like the table I
think won't fly on the moving it like
another maybe foot or two out this way
to just add a lot of depth for the shop
we could I guess we wanted to
and always oriented at an angle and do
like a corner shot into the other 79
there something I don't know we'll
figure it out
sorry that's a first piece of furniture
that's done other than the shells have
been underway for a bit now too so we
can check that out as we as we move
along and redress so here's the benefit
of making our own product that we also
use normally I buy those glue
anti-static mats back before we made our
own mod mats and those are like a
hundred dollars each so we have a box of
five oh eight hundred dollars worth of
our own products VG on mod pads and what
we're gonna do is introduce the first DM
onto the set table over there and that's
the one we'll be using for a while
typically the way this works is I put a
mat on the table and we use it until it
becomes so filled with they're all paste
blood and water from water cooling that
it just starts looking like it's it's
it's gonna be something you can use to
clone me so we'll use this one until
that happens over there and then we've
also got two of the early samples of our
blue glasses here that we're just gonna
use for the actual like kitchenware
because we made some samples of these
that we ended up not selling and that's
the best way for me to reuse them sorry
Pete is down here in the kitchen so
let's introduce the first mod Mac to the
studio these I actually like doing this
because like I said we don't replace
them too often because they hold up
forever
and like spend a lot of abuse which we
put them through every single day so I
like introducing a new one because it's
an opportunity opportunity for me to see
sort of really stress test to see how
long his last and real user environment
like ours are super abused and
introduced all kinds of chemicals like
for example our recent recent exhibition
with the mob Matt was to film b-roll of
the new beer cups on it so now our main
mod man I'm gonna keep using this one
because it's got so much history to it
at this point the main mod matt has beer
stains in the middle from the photo
shoot of the glasses
smells like it too it's got blood all on
the bottom from what i standed an IHS
down laughed it and it's gone through
heat torture it's gone through soldering
torture it has exactly a knife cuts on
it come from when we were testing their
ability there you ever don't have the
heat to go luck and you need to get in
some things then you can take out the
hinge instead and then have access to
and this is what we're thinking is case
storage this is the storage room that
wasn't apparent by the existence of a
lot of storage so cases on the bottom
this shelf is going to be a clone of
this shelf and basically a talking with
Keegan about this where a couple options
the original plan was these against the
wall and then probably about 28 inches
of walking space here and then the other
shelf here that would be these and then
immediately on the other side of that
there will be another shelf so the
downside is that
if we had another shelf on this side of
it we wouldn't be able to access the
back half of the storage other than
light coming through here and yeah pull
stuff out and then pull the other thing
out and then you just start forgetting
what's back there which will happen to
some extent here but I think we'll just
put like though I'll try and make a
system off like all this stuff goes into
the least the darkest corners before
it's gotten rid of so a new plan instead
of that is we'll have a bit more walking
in space maybe like 30 32 34 inches
something like that via shelves and
they'll be accessible from both sides
and we're gonna have a third shop where
I'm standing and we'll push them back
like a giass notice they're all I want
everything and then probably like Intel
boards on one side and AMD boards on the
other side so we just you know which
side it's on when you're picking for a
build and with your fourth library yeah
motherboard library exactly
I don't think we need more case storage
on these or probably gonna just make
more space for like coolers and boards
stuff like that and then I think instead
of the old kind of six-foot shelf here
one single six-foot will do that
probably here that's the shop that's
against the old wood wall right now at
home base so that would go here and then
the table in the back against that wall
I think that'll cover it and then
there'll be some smaller table just like
probably right here for networking
equipment so all right least whatever we
don't bolt up to the board will be
honest I'm like small just like it's
basically school size desk so that's the
current thought of what we're going to
do in this room and I think I don't know
the weird thing for this is normally
when we build a shop that's because we
already have all the stuff and we just
need somewhere to put it so now we're
gonna build a shop and have all the
stuff and then all the shops still won't
be fall so first time ever GN will have
more store
stuff yes that will last for one month
yeah all the manufacturers will will see
that clip of what Keaton just said and
start sending those things that I don't
want like a difference so this is just a
wall chair and so like one of the things
I was reading on was just trying to
figure out what's interesting a cat six
ball Jack I've got five ball Jack and
the answer is not much there are some
that claim to give a better signal by
lining these jacks up and the fashions
of these things are pointing backward so
you have equal amounts of wire coming
out the way this works whichever the
reason the 568a or 568b is or TI a EIA
standards it like that the blue pair or
the orange / green pair would be
stretched out longer than the brown and
the orange green on the side and
supposedly just that little like extra
centimeter can lose you signal and so
the difference in the six and the five
on the wall jack is apparently the way
the wires are arranged and then on the
actual rj45 plug they are up down up
down up down again so the signal is not
crossing over and that crosstalk yeah so
we're getting near the end of day one
it's been all day here we had full team
actors so Patrick stone still working on
the cat six wiring he's basically I
don't think we explained it fully before
but we have cat five and Kappa B in the
walls right now and
10-gigabit internally for access to the
server so this is all getting rewired in
the walls these outlets up at the ground
or near the ground are going to be cat6
now so that will be nice
and this is the closest thing I have to
a video set right now okay
it's got got some cardboard recycling on
it that we can use to protect the table
from the pizza grease and the Cheerwine
spills and stuff like that so yeah I
guess I'll show you through Oh basically
I need to buy or get or ask for a
sponsor for a table for that spot over
there hoping to get one of those uplift
or Autodesk whatever they're not not a
desiccant software company something
that raises and lowers over here that'll
be nice how to paint this wall put up
the tool board I don't know what to put
on this wall if anything so
this is gonna have like one of those
nice husky sort of tool cabinets back
here
for the set mostly and I don't know what
will go above it so we'll figure that
out later but if you have any ideas let
us know by the time you see those we
probably yeah so I guess more obscene if
you gotta say we did all right this room
has had a good amount of progress
overall progress for the first day has
been pretty crazy actually so like I
said stone work on the cat sick stuff I
was working with Keegan on moving these
tables in and out of the storage and
into this space Andrew and Patrick
worked on building shelves with robocat
in the moment and we did all kinds of
stuff in between like just vacuuming
everything cleaning up and making sure
the space was over already and we've
been - so yeah we cleaned everything out
we went through all these tables these
are used check the screws and all that
stuff bought some extra out some of
these receptacles around the wall right
now for new wiring for cat6 and then the
nature of needing so many tables is that
it's really expensive to get tables like
really expensive so it's gonna be a bit
mismatched fortunately there's same
length and width and just different tops
but every tables have mod night on it
and every table gonna have computers and
test benches on it so by the time it's
all filled the difference is between
this and that table or not really that
prevalent and we're not filming in here
that often anyway so I really like these
aesthetically little wobbly these are
these ones are pretty heavy-duty
computer tables they don't believe I
hope
it's fine kinda gotta find places to
save money so we can invest in the
things that make more sense to invest
it's here so yeah two of these here if
this table push against that wall I
gotta be left with about six feet here I
need to fill at the table then we're
gonna put these uglier ones all the way
down this wall and at the end probably
like a small shelf for TV like active
bench components just so we don't have
to keep running in and out of different
rooms
let's get them then I'm gonna get a cart
like a trolley so we can move benches
from here to the livestream area when
we're ready to you live shoes put on a
cart wheel it out there and it'll be
ready to go so pretty good progress for
this room as well it's still a lot of
stuff to do but let's also get a Shelley
all right to this room we have this is
the room where I don't know if the video
of the clip from Louis will make it into
the final cut but originally I was gonna
buy two six foot long shelves bring it
for this spot for this buster for total
and that would have been like $1,500
ship and we're not buying just six four
foot long ones instead which is the same
amount of space it's just like 360
dollars so I say it's a lot of money use
that to buy other things we need in here
like the cobalt set table in there for
the live stream but the refrigerator
bought other stuff that drawers stuff
like that so yeah we're gonna have three
of these back here and then three more
here still need to build one probably be
a little closer together and we're gonna
have more shelves or a table in here or
something like that or show yeah more
shelves and we've got wiring going in
now still waiting on the router to come
in from the ISP but that's that's what
it's looking like this room this room
had a lot of progress the shelf builds
were faster than any time ever before
and I think that is because we brought
two mallets
normally Andrew and I in the past when
we built these I guess the first time
you built these shells it's always gonna
take a couple hours because you realize
how much they fall apart but you guys
knocked all these out
what like I think you gotta have three
done inside of an hour or something like
that so and that's just because it's
like using proper tools and knowing all
their faults made a quick alright last
room to look at is the one that has had
zero progress so that's true
there's our shopping list we had earlier
hahaha and this one has had zero
progress so basically I just I needed to
buy a lot more tables
I need more tables for that room the
other side in tables for this room have
three from the existing office review
but here's the thing for perspective we
have like one two three four two
sometimes five table we work on in the
office for test benches and more
realistically it's like three on a daily
basis so we're more than doubling were
like tripling or quadrupling that count
and that means that I can run air cooler
test benches fans house benches our
sweat test benches have them all there
all the time ready to go so when we got
something in we've got to knock it out
inside of a couple days and get a review
up so it'll really enable more technical
content this room I'll tell you more
about it after we start filling it in
but yeah more tables for gear and we'll
talk about that more later alright so
that's it for day one we might split
this into multiple videos just in case
we do thank you for watching and
subscribe for more go to
patreon.com/scishow and axis self does
help us out directly go to stored on
cameras axis dotnet let's pick up one of
these tear down shirts or one of the GN
mod mats have you featured in this video
and hopefully day two goes equally well
subscribe to catch that i'll see you all
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
