about four hundred to four hundred $30
which lands it between the 9900 k price
at around 550 on a good day and the 8700
k is $370 price point we got ours on a
bit of a high side of the curve but you
can get them as low as 400 on new egg
for example these days and we were
looking to test the new eight core eight
thread cpu versus the not that old 8700
K and the hyper threaded 9900 K of a
similar spec until made a big move away
from four core eight thread CPUs and the
incumbent pricing structure with the
9700 K acting as the first case qi7 in a
while anyway to lack hyper threading
before that this video is brought to you
by us and the Jian store one of the best
ways to support us and get something in
return is to grab an item from the Jian
store like one of our blue beer glasses
with a gold halo featuring the popular
tear down logo or one of our critically
acclaimed mod mats with wiring diagrams
and a GPU tear down grid we also have a
brand new black and blue mousepad that
many of you requested now available on
the store we keep selling out of things
thanks to you all thought we've been
working hard to get it back in stock go
to store cameras next to sunette to grab
something today
the 9700 K is a weird one because if you
look at it first instinct is kind of
wait a minute they just turn off
hyper-threading so what's the deal
because that's what happened it's it's
okay to have product segmentation we've
talked about that in the past these
types of architectures can cost billions
of dollars to make if you look at
something like and videos newest
architectures for example and in order
to get any return on that ever you do
have to segment it so we can understand
and respect that to a certain degree now
what's harder for people to really
understand and accept is do you just
flip the toggle to turn off hyper
threading or what's going on because
you've got a ninety nine hundred K for
150 bucks more and it's more or less the
same product as the 9700 K just there's
some numbers changes nothing major it's
still the same silicon ultimately and
then really the big difference is
there's no hyper threading so you end up
without SMT and so that gives you an
eight core a thread part whereas
basically every previous i7 was four
cores eight threads so in terms of pure
thread count you end up about the same
core count obviously goes up but the
doesn't really necessarily mean anything
depending on what kind of workload you
have and price goes up which makes it
feel kind of funny to buy a 9700 k if
you used to bind the previous i sevens
where it's more than the $340 range and
i mean it just it was the best other
than h EDT so the stack has completely
shifted now now you have functionally a
low-end h EDT cpu in the desktop market
the 9900 k and you have the 9700 k
dropping a core feature of the i sevens
but instead adding more physical cores
so i guess the question then is is it a
lateral move or worse is it a downgrade
from the 8700 k where you had six cores
12 threads so you have more threads and
that is one that a test and blender
would be great to illustrate something
we have these results they because in
blender you can really start looking at
thread impact to performance we're
having more cores doesn't necessarily
mean everything sometimes just having
threads even if it's just sort of pseudo
threads throughout some tea that helps a
lot so that's something we're looking at
today with you 9700 k versus the 8700 k
then of course we also have overclock
numbers in there as well we only pushed
ours to five point one gigahertz we did
have trouble with this particular cpu so
our 9900 k did pretty well once we had
it deleted liquid metal and under a big
water loop it was doing something like
five point three gigahertz i actually we
hit five point four briefly so that one
did pretty well for us the 9700 k we
were hoping it would supersede the
performance of the 9900 k because having
fewer things in AO having fewer threads
means you're dealing with less heat in a
concentrated area so it should
theoretically overclock better problem
is that you're still relying on silicon
bending at the end of the day so you
don't want the silicon lottery well
something you can do about it so other
than go crazier we can deal with this
one and put it under chilled water and
that it would do pretty okay but let's
go through the benchmarks for games
through bent blender and then we also
have some thermal testing on here as
well comparing versus the u 99er k both
stock and d lidded to give you an idea
of what kind of cooler you might need to
deal
the CPU f 1 2018 produces extremely high
frame rates something not commonly found
in other titles this game becomes CPU
bound rapidly as our RT X xx atti
allows all of these CPUs to fully
stretch their legs as best illustrated
by these 79-80 x ii at 4.6 gigahertz
hitting 307 FPS average it's a bit high
the point is that the bottleneck in here
is elevated enough to really look at
performance differences with CPUs to a
point where it may become sort of almost
useless at this type of framerate but
we're still gonna look at it the i7 9700
cane stock ends up at 272 FPS average
putting it functionally tied with the
9600 K at 5.2 gigahertz but ahead of the
stock 9600 K by about 6.2 percent the
stock 9900 K operates at less
meaningfully ahead of the stock 9700 K
with limited gains of about 3.3 percent
overclocking the night 700 K pushes it
to roughly stock 99 hundred K
performance levels compared to the 8700
K the stock i7 9700 K ends off at about
10% ahead an average frame rate although
overclocking gets the 8700 KS and
nearing equivalence when at 5.0
gigahertz for anyone moving off of
something like an i7 2670 9 TK and will
highlight those CPUs for you you're
looking at noteworthy performance
improvements even when considering at
2600 K overclocked heavily Rison remains
confined to the lower half or so of the
charge as a result of the lower
frequency and this game does seem
primarily bound by Amdahl's law here's a
frame time chart for f1 2018 at 1080p
showing the 9700 K 5.1 gigahertz CPU
8700 K 5.0 gigahertz stock CPU and r7
2700 at 4.2 gigahertz functionally at
2700 X or close enough to it as a
reminder of frame time plots show
individual frames over time providing
the truest representation of how long it
took to render each frame we're looking
at frame to frame intervals on the y
axis labeled in milliseconds time to
render with frame number on the x axis
lower is better but more consistent is
better than strictly lower the 9700 K
manages to be both lowest and most
consistent may
the most fluid courier of frames in this
test average frame to frame interval is
about 4 milliseconds for the 9700 K with
the 8700 K at about 4 point 2
milliseconds the 2700 at 4.2 gigahertz
competes reasonably and average is about
five point three to five point seven
millisecond frame times all three tests
encounter spikes upwards of 16 to 20
milliseconds but none of them are
jarring to a point of ruining the
experience they are noticeable though
and most humans tend to notice about an
8 to 12 millisecond delta frame to frame
as for 1440p results the top end results
are truncated by the GPU limitations
imposed by a higher resolution maxing
out the ceiling at 240 FPS average the
9700 K ends up ranked alongside the 9900
K and Center 90 DXE that's because we're
now hitting a bottleneck with the RT X
20 atti
resultant of resolution increased to
1440p if you're playing at high
resolutions and commonly GPU bound this
chart illustrates the performance
fall-off from becoming limited by
another component lower end devices end
up performing about the same as their
slower than the GPU and so not limited
assassin's creed origins at 1080 p
medium stands is our next benchmark
assassin's creed uniquely makes use of
both additional threads and additional
frequency whereas most games lean
entirely on frequency this is made
obvious by our 79 80 XC at 4.6 gigahertz
our performance cpu is like the 9700 K
at 5.1 gigahertz a significant frequency
Delta but also a significant core Delta
and you can kind of do the math there
the 9700 case stock CPU ends up at 127
FPS average marginally better than the
87 heart K at 5 gigahertz there's about
a 12% to uplift over the stock 8700 K a
noteworthy gain and this comes down to
stock frequency increases in the 9700 K
for reference the Intel i7 2670
gigahertz does about 76 FPS average and
the am the r7 2700 at 4.2 gigahertz does
about 104 FPS average right around where
the 7700 K is so that marks most tears
of the chart for you far cry 5 positions
the i7 9700 K at 149 FPS average right
behind the 9600 K at 5.2 gigahertz
note that far cry has also had routine
issues with frame times and I
five CPUs something we are actively
researching now that we have our 9700 K
in hand that said what we can learn is
that the game benefits from higher
frequencies in a direct fashion it's
just that it also benefits from having
eight threat the 9700 k ends up running
at 159 FPS average when clocked to 5.1
gigahertz putting it between the two
ninety-nine hundred K SKUs on our chart
the 8700 KS stock CBN's have a 141 FPS
average which plants it below the 9700 K
but not by a meaningful amount
no one can reasonably detect the average
frame time difference of 0.4
milliseconds between these two devices
and consistency is about the same for
each so that's good
the 2700 at four points u gigahertz ends
up at around 111 FPS average which is
within error margins of the 2600 at the
same frequency these two AMD results
illustrate a frequency and IBC
limitation not a thread limitation
plotted instead as frame times we can
look at the 9700 K 87 hard K and 9900 K
stock performance the 9700 K ends up
fairly consistent with a few spikes 20
milliseconds and 16 milliseconds
throughout testing it's not bad overall
and we'd have to run a lot more passes
here to determine how much those spikes
are within the usual error margins the
87 arcade stock CPUs end up similar to
the 9700 K in average frame time but
ultimately fall behind in the total
frame throughput the 8700 K runs slower
on average if comparable with the 9900 K
significantly more consistent almost to
a points of creating sort of a heart
rate interval it's very consistent at
the beginning there we've also applauded
the 2700 at four points u gigahertz for
reference giving a test comparable to
the 2700 X the 2700 at 4.8 gigahertz
falls behind in both frame time and
total frame through hood it's still over
60 FPS which would be around the 16
point six seven millisecond line on the
y axis and it is overall consistent in
frame delivery much like the 9900 K and
8700 K it's just a little bit slower but
still consistent unsurprisingly we see
mostly the same ranking order at 1440p
we're truncated at the top end by the
GPU which puts a cap on maximum
performance in this instance the
100 K 9700 K and 9900 K are all rough
equals the 2700 still ends up at around
111 FPS average when overclocked which
is what you'd expect because we're
capped by the CPU for the 2700 not by
the GPU which is what we see at the top
end of the chart civilization 6 provides
an important look at turn time
performance rather than framerate
performance instead testing Grand
Campaign a I turn completion times as an
example with 5 AI players that each take
10 seconds to process a turn if you've
never played this type of game before
you would be waiting 50 seconds before
you are allowed to make your next play
which can be frustrating or get old as
the turn time is dragged on for our
chart the 9700 K at five point one
gigahertz ends up within margin of error
of the 9900 KF five point two gigahertz
we were unable to produce meaningfully
different results between these two and
test variance puts them as functionally
equivalent that's good for the 9700 K
although Civilization 6 has never been
particularly thread intensive to begin
with this is best illustrated by looking
at these stock r5 2600 versus the stock
r7 2700 where you see the 2600
outperforming the 2700 by slim margin
that's because of the higher stock
frequencies and shows that the extra
threads there really don't help in
Civilization 6 illustrating what type of
game Civilization six is the stock 9700
K ends up at eleven point seven seconds
return with a stock 9900 K again tied
with the 9700 K the 8700 K at five
gigahertz ends up at eleven point eight
seconds also functionally the same
although the stock 80-some 100k ends up
outside of error at twelve point five
seconds per turn
blender gives us a look at rendering
performance for a tile based production
3d rendering workload this is very
different from how something like
premiere would handle encoding so we'd
advise definitely not trying to
extrapolate this performance to video
production applications for blender the
9700 K at 5.1 gigahertz ends up
completing the GN monkeyhead render in
25 minutes or the GM logo render in 28
minutes this place is it around where
the stock 2700 is but was significantly
higher power consumption at sixteen
point five amps or about 198 watts
sometimes 195 depending on
when you check the test overclock in the
2700 to 4.2 gigahertz similar to wear a
2700 X would land puts it at 23 minutes
for the monkey heads and 27 minutes for
the logo this is where Rison starts to
pull ahead and is also where the 9900
case shows its performance advantage
over the 9700 K because of that threat
difference the same is true for the 8700
K which leverages its extra threads on
the six core 12 thread approach to lead
the 9700 K in each test with stock and
overclock this illustrates that it's not
all just about physical cores eight
cores is beaten by 6 cores 12 threads on
the same processor family it's still an
entire family so architecture is not
really a big factor here thermals on the
intel i7 9700 k are on the screen now
for auto settings keep in mind that we
heavily rely upon the motherboard used
as the temperature is most directly
impacted by Auto voltages we're using
the ACS at Maximus 11 hero for this one
with MC e disabled for the Maximus 11
hero
there's Auto settings put the 9700 K at
27 degrees Celsius over ambient when
loaded to 100% with a blender workload
and as a reminder that's over ambient if
you're new here that's not the direct
temperature reading keep in mind that
this is with MC e disabled so it's
following the boost duration
specification set by Intel and sticking
to a power consumption of 90 watts
liquid temperature is at around 6
degrees over ambient during this test
pass and for power consumption it starts
out at about nine point five amps and
then drops to seven point five amps
which would put you at 90 watts go into
about five gigahertz and 1.35 volts 5
point one gigahertz on the 9700 K we
measure an average all core load of 54
degrees over ambient with power
consumption at about 188 watts and
liquid thermals at about 10 degrees over
ambience this place is the 9700 K is
noticeably cooler than our 9900 K sample
once soldered which measured at 64
degrees over ambient and that's with the
solder the thermal Delta isn't for any
reason other than the 9900 K drawing
significantly more power in this test
the two results are not directly
comparable other than two salient Lee
9700 k's lack of hyper threading does
make it easier to keep cool especially
under heavier overclocks by drawing less
power
this isn't too like for like comparison
given that power draw is different for
each test but that's not really what
we're comparing the 8086 K is also not
directly comparable and that it's dye is
a completely different size and so it's
dissipative properties are different
than the 9700 K and 9900 K that said
it's still accurate just with regard to
comparing how your temperatures might
vary from product to product or for
purposes of selecting a new cooler or
upgrading an existing one thermally the
9700 K isn't that hard to cool under
Otto conditions and it can be kept
reasonably cool with our X 62 to ADC LC
even under overclocked conditions
although this is a somewhat conservative
overclock it does become a challenge to
overclock beyond 5.1 gigahertz and 1.35
to one point four volts with this cooler
as we're entering the 90s for some of
the individual core temperatures not all
of them but as long as a couple are in
the 90s in approaching t.j.maxx
those will hold back our maximum
overclock which comes back to our 99 80
XE content where we show the core to
core Delta so for those instances you
would need to upgrade the cooler but
some of this is also a silicon binning
instance as well because you might be
able to drive a lower voltage than we
needed for ours that's all the data then
not really a huge move from the 87 or K
in some areas its lateral in some areas
like blender it's a bit down actually
because of the reduction threads despite
other improvements and overall just
feels like kind of a wash it's not a
huge change and like most CPU releases
if you had the most current previous
generation from the same company find
out a whole lot of point an upgrade and
that remains true today the real
question is is there a point at what
point is there a reason to upgrade so we
have data for a 2600 K in there probably
a good time to upgrade from that one
it's still doing really well it's
holding on 4.7 gigahertz overclock
you're doing alright but it's definitely
getting him haul of the tooth so if
you're on something like that then your
considerations are something like in the
same price category roughly really it's
an 8700 K or a 9700 K with a 8700 K
being potentially cheaper in some non-us
regions especially and with the and let
us know what your regional pricing is
but depending where you look we've seen
the 87 okay on our
a bit cheaper and that's true in the
u.s. too it's just that for 30 bucks
cheaper buying something older you feel
kind of bad like should I just spend the
extra thirty dollars and get the new one
but if the performance is roughly the
same it's not like a GPU where driver
supports really a concern over time it's
just I mean the performance is what it
is it's not really gonna change all that
much
things like Spector and meltdown
notwithstanding so should you buy the
9700 K well the 1900 K is kind of out of
this conversation because it's just so
much more expensive the 8700 K is a bit
advantaged in blender but that's about
it
so for an extra couple bucks if you
really care about there's that reduction
of frame times then yes the 97 hard K is
better if you want something like just
blender per once you're not on a recent
in tolerating the CPU and you're
building a new computer for the first
time in a few years and you're looking
for 3d rendering and application
performance and something like blender
then consider strongly rising as a much
cheaper alternative for something like a
2700 and then overclock it in 15 minutes
or less and you functionally have a 2700
X that outperforms most but not all of
the new Intel CPUs for a price reduction
in that application and something like
blender and rendering not necessarily
true for encoding in premiere where
Intel and quick sync do have a bit of an
advantage there that AMD does not
presently have and that's discussion for
another time
but overall the 97 hard K is hard to
come to a firm conclusion on because
it's just such a weird part it doesn't
really feel great to buy something where
you know they just turned off hyper
threading and previously it was on but
also there are more physical cores so
kind of about a net zero for thread
count increase which is boring and the
frequency goes up a couple hundred
megahertz which is boring so hard to say
but not exciting enough to run out and
buy if you're building a computer anyway
don't feel bad about it it's just that
yeah the price creeps up a bit so you've
got alternatives if you don't like that
