session with overpower a new arena pvp
game set in a medieval fantasy universe
with undeniable sources of influence
from unreal tournament team fortress 2
and of course MOBAs but what game isn't
somehow influenced by those these days
the game is currently in an early state
and not anywhere near completion but the
rudimentary gameplay mechanics are in
place and indicative of the overall feel
of the final product or what it's
supposed to be anyway over power centers
around the tried-and-true arena combat
often found in multiplayer shooters and
the FPS games but relies upon medieval
fantasy themes instead of modern
military so instead of going for a
proper modern FPS the overpower team has
gone for wizards Rangers warriors
assassins and those types of classes
that you might find in an MMO or RPG and
each uses various player selected
abilities in the standard smattering of
gameplay modes including team deathmatch
deathmatch and a capture the flag
equivalent called critter capture which
we talked about in a previous video
about overpower for the limited demo
that we played or really it's a beta
alpha sort of thing all abilities and
classes were fully unlocked and
switchable between deaths so the
experience is pretty simple and boils
down to the usual spawn killed I
structure with the potential for
objective captures scattered in between
if it's critter capture for example it's
within the kill portion of that flow
where the game really shows itself three
core abilities accompanied based attacks
one of which is unchangeable and
specific to the class the other two are
selectable during the spawn screen
there's not much in the way of ability
combos but there are complementary
abilities playing as the mage for
instance we found that damage shields
are a good complement to closer combat
tactics as they forced engagement from
melee classes and created a unique
damage for damage trade during conflict
the assailants in this instance would
have to keep in account their own health
as they wail upon the mage who's of
course a bit weaker in that sort of
hand-to-hand scenario and the mage could
then use another ability so
got the damage shield on and then they
use another ability and trigger a stasis
to regain health and push back the
attackers causing additional damage
things like that so this is interesting
because my first thought upon reading
the stasis ability which basically
immobilizes the mage but regens their
health and power was that'd be useless
I've never liked stasis abilities in any
game as it often just sort of defers the
inevitable we're gonna die no matter
what just now you're sitting there
waiting for them to kill you while they
patiently wait outside of your stasis
bubble but I like the power and damage
that accompany this and that's because I
generally prefer power and damage and
will always forego temporary defenses in
favor of destruction and an over power I
quickly learned from my opponents that
stasis is as offensive as it is
defensive and that offensive ability
compliments with good counterparts like
a damaged shield you could cause serious
setback two attackers you've got you on
the brink of death and that's a fun
mechanic and one which instantly turns
the tide of combat and i think is
indicative of what the team is going for
with our power all the classes work like
this in one respect ur and other Rangers
are another good example they deal
damage from far as you would expect from
a ranger and construct near fatal blows
from across the map by using just a
click to hold and power up the attack
it's like any other game where you click
and hold to do additional damage I found
that I was often able to deliver at
least one fully charged attack before my
target spotted me but that was normally
not enough to kill them so by hiding up
in the rafters somewhere or across the
map I'd used the the first attack that
caused a lot of damage and then I used a
homing arrow ability as a follow-up and
this works exceedingly well as the
target would normally take cover from
the first shot that I landed but then
the homing arrow would sort of figure
out the rest of the dirty work for me
and finish them off all the classes felt
reasonably playable they're all fairly
balanced right now it did at times feel
as if there were some imbalances but
it's a pretty early build of the game of
developers assure me that they're
working on all sorts of bug fixes and
balance updates in the immediate future
and I did at times feel especially a
distinct advantage
playing as the assassin mostly because
the stealth mechanic allows a quick duck
and duck out style of combat that close
distance rapidly but the better players
were able to thwart my subterfuge so it
really i found depended on the map the
most the assassin on i don't know what
the mat was recalled but one of the
tighter arena maps where it's basically
just a field that's got some maze like
structures and end bridges and things
like that in those maps I was able to do
a lot of damage as the assassin I kind
of struggled as the maid and that all
just was because of the ability to kind
of run around pillars and hide and
things like that so that is pretty cool
because it means the game is a little
bit mutable based on the environment but
it does definitely have some work to go
until final final launch but that's
known as it is a beta or alpha or
whatever it is right now or power plays
fluidly it's sort of like tf2 in terms
of spawn times and constant action and
it has serious potential in the market
of casual arena gaming we've liked the
chivalry series as a comparable example
but have it times found it to be a bit
cumbersome with its learning curve for
newer players or players who just aren't
as serious about the kind of play style
overpower is perhaps a more familiar
style of play for both MMO and FPS
players alike and takes a less than
serious approach to its overall
direction we think this makes an
excellent fusion of casual play and
mechanical depth if the team can sort
their balance and bugs and kind of tidy
things up for the final release of the
game which will also include updated
graphics we're told our power is
absolutely worth a look the game hasn't
finished right now but is playable
through Kickstarter and early access and
as always we're not huge fans of the
early access model and strongly caution
pre purchases and that applies here too
if you're uncertain about the game just
wait until it's finalized and check out
our final review content once it's live
otherwise do some research see if you
want to look into it further if you like

I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
