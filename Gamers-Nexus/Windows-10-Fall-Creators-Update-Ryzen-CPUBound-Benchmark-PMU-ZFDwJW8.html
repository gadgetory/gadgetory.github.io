about the Windows 10 fall creators
update providing huge performance gains
on various system configurations we're
here to ruin that for you we isolated
variables to target just one component
the CPU and focused solely on the r7
1,700 to see if the reported uplift on
rising platforms was due to GPU or CPU
bound testing as always you can't just
take this data and scream that the FCU
caused huge gains or no gains or the
opposite you've got to take the whole
picture into account and with many GPU
bound tests out there we figured we'd
run a CPU bound test to try and pinpoint
performance uplift and look at the other
side of the spectrum before getting to
that this video is brought to you by
synergy the software that lets you share
a keyboard and mouse between multiple
systems if you have limited desk space
and multiple computers to command
synergy removes the need for a separate
peripherals or a KVM and works as over
the network software use our link below
to get 50% off the home or provision
with SSL we're aware that some users and
other outlets are reporting performance
uplift with FCU or fall creators update
but we have to highlight that a lot of
these benchmarks were conducted with
Vega 56 and that has two factors playing
towards the performance uplift one of
them is that it seems like Vega may have
had some specific optimizations and the
other one is that just GPUs in general
seem to have improved with FCU we're
focusing on the CPU side to see if
there's any uplift there but on the GPU
side we've received multiple reports
from our trusted user base in the
patreon discord that for example g-sync
and free sync stability in terms of
frame times have both improved and both
of those are GPU specific items we've
also heard reports that Vega
specifically has seen improvement
haven't looked into its competing 1070
yet but it definitely it's become a bit
clearer that there is GPU uplift with up
with FCU to some extent and some of that
is on frame time stability and some of
it's just overall in general uplift but
what isn't fully clear is how much of
that uplift comes down to the CPU so
we're all a ting for the CPU here and
we're using a 1080i FTW three to do that
as usual our testing can only represent
our testing of course so rather than
jump to the charts and then scream about
the results being end-all be-all keep in
mind that we're only testing the 1700
and the 1080 TI FTW 3 we can't yet speak
for results of Vega cards or Intel CPUs
Vega uplift again could be either from
specific optimizations or just GPU
performance uplift in general in the
drivers testing is conducted in an a/b
fashion so we have some older data it's
not that old it's from the same
proceeding creators update build that
we're using the test here versus FCU
when I say older I mean like tested a
week ago as opposed to yesterday we have
some of that we have some a B tests
where we ran CU vs f CU in the last 24
hours from filming this and that
provides a pretty good look at the
performance uplift if there is any we're
focusing only on 1080p today eliminated
the usual 1440p testing because it just
wasn't necessary as a side note we have
been working with shadow of war for the
past few days trying to get GP
benchmarks up for it and we looked at it
for CPUs shadow of war has some of the
most variable performance we've seen to
date haven't fully pinpointed why that
is just yet but basically the you could
run a set of four tests and see an
average of maybe for example 20 FPS at
an unspecified setting and with an
unspecified GPU but you might see 30 FPS
and one test and then 20 in the next set
of 4 tests and then you're back up to 33
and the next set of 4 tests so it's kind
of all over the place in performance
with the built-in benchmark and we don't
really trust it yet so we've eliminated
it from this CPU comparison before today
and we're focusing on the normal CPU
suite instead starting with ashes of the
singularity at 1080p we measured the CU
1703 dot 608 build the previous one at
42 FPS average with 1% lows @ 31.6 and
0.1% lows at 30 fps the FCU if all
creators update tests planted the r7
1700 stock cpu at 40 point 3 FPS average
with lows of 32 point three one percent
twenty nine point eight zero point one
percent this is within standard
deviation which we measured at 0.5 FPS
for average and also 1% or 1.5 FPS for
zero
1% lows we were not able to discern an
appreciable performance change between
Cu and FC u and ashes of the singularity
with data plotting the difference as
within error and test variance here's a
frame time plot between the two just to
show the differences in ashes of the
singularity at 1080p high as you can see
they are fairly consistent what you're
really looking for is more consistency
and ideally a number lower on the scale
rather than higher for frame times total
war Warhammer at 1080p is next for this
test our original r7 1,700 CPU plotted
an average FPS of 128 with all those at
sixty at five point seven and sixty the
FCU test had us at 127 point 6 FPS
average with a sixty five point three
one percent and fifty nine point five
zero point one percent low enabling game
mode in FCU plotted one twenty eight
point four FPS average sixty seven and
sixty one point six for the lows and
these results are all within standard
deviation of each other which we've
plotted as one point nine FPS average in
this particular game one point three for
the one percent values and two point
three FPS for the 0.1% values where we
start losing some test resolution again
we can't determine statistically
significant changes in performance from
these numbers total war Warhammer was
around more than ten times for each of
these that was the title we spent the
most effort on as it was the first one
we tried after the update one outlier
result was tossed from each test batch
but overall the results basically point
that there's no real change here
watchdogs to plotted to see you are 717
hundred tests at eighty seven point
seven FPS average when retested
yesterday so this is a different batch
of tests than our CPU review batch with
a one percent low at sixty seven point
three and zero point one percent lows at
fifty four the FCU test had us at eighty
eight FPS average and game mode also had
us at eighty eight FPS average standard
deviation and this one is about zero
point nine FPS average with lows
deviating by about one point two and one
point five FPS respectively project cars
to at 1080p is next and thoughts our
seventeen hundred stock CPU from the
creators update previous version of
Windows at seventy eight point five FPS
average with lows at sixty two point
five and fifty eight
point-five FCU i had us at 79.5 with
loaves at sixty two point eight and
fifty six point eight standard deviation
is about zero point six FPS average
0.71% lows and two point six FPS 0.1%
lows civilization six turn time
completion is measured in seconds not
FPS average FPS actually increases in
civilization with worse CPUs for the AI
benchmark because more time is spent
with the screen unmoving and Static
whereas faster CPUs process turns faster
and so the screen experiences more
dynamism and therefore a lower frame
rate the turn time completion for the r7
1700 with creators update was twenty
point nine five seconds with FCU at
twenty-one point zero two seconds that's
within error and variance and we're
within 0.7 seconds of each other GTA 5
is last at 1080p we're at 95 FPS average
for the original test with creators
update sixty six point three four one
percent and sixty three four 0.1% FCU
plots us at ninety six point three FPS
sixty six point three FPS one percent
lows and 61.7 0.1 percent lows again
this is with an error the frame time
plot doesn't show much difference
between the two runs once again and
demonstrates that frame time consistency
is largely unchanged in our our seven
seventeen hundred cpu-bound testing now
again before people start just jumping
to the charts and posting well I guess
they probably already done that but
hopefully when you encounter people who
just skip to the charts and ignore the
entire thing at the beginning talking
about to what extent our test is
applicable what this tells you is not
that you can't or won't see performance
uploads with fall creators update
certainly people have it's that with our
test configuration and our seven
seventeen hundred stock on an ACS
crosshair hero six motherboard with
thirty two hundred megahertz CL sixteen
memory and most importantly with a 1080
TI FTW three we're not really seeing a
change in these games there might be
other games where we could see a change
but more likely we would see a change
with Vega or just with a lower and GPU
like a 1070 relative to the 1080 TI it
would be lower and so that would be the
the next thing to look at would be
basically GPU testing not just CPU
testing but on the CPU side when left
unconstrained by the GPU and with an
NVIDIA GPU which is another important
factor to consider
there is really no performance change
from one to the other
it is possible once again just to
reiterate that you would see a
performance change if we stuck a Vega
GPU in there for one of two reasons one
may be because of an AMD driver thing
that plays better with FCU and - just
because Vega is probably going to be
more GPU bound in some scenarios than
others than a 1080 TI for example so
yeah with this configuration we're not
seeing a change maybe with others we'll
look into it we do know however with
relative certainty that there is
improvement in FCU for frame time
consistency for users with g-sync and
freesync from what we've seen and heard
it looks like those two technologies
have tightened up their consistency with
frame times with FCU so in the very
least that's changed but if you're
strictly looking at a cpu scenario for
our test it doesn't look like there's a
change if you find a game where there is
one let us know but that's all for now
