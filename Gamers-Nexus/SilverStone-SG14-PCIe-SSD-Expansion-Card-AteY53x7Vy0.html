suite at CES 2017 this video I'll
probably go up after the show we've had
a ton of coverage this year we're
talking about a few of the things they
have cases of course pretty plain and
obvious what they are but Silverstone
always brings an entire table of extra
stuff that we don't really cover at all
so I'm gonna try and go through some of
that at this time before we get into
that this coverage is brought to you by
cyber power and there's cyber excel
gaming PC which has an invertible
motherboard tray layout and some other
cool features hit the link below for
more information on that so starting off
with I'm gonna start with something
different because I'm tired of talking
about the same components all week this
is just a thermal pad kit for SSDs and
it's now on the table so the thermal
pads for SSDs we found to be a pretty
big issue and some drives depending on
how they're built the Plextor m8p II as
an example has its own sort of heatsink
built into it and that was done as a
response to high temperatures on the
stick sized SSDs and those temperatures
can reach in some of our testing 70 to
90 C if you cram it into like an SF F
box and that's a problem that throttle
is just like with a GP or a CPU you're
now throttling your data throughput on
the drive so to solve that the there are
a few options on the market coming out
this year or end of last year one was
the MSI motherboard that we just showed
for the z2 70 series that's got sort of
a heat shield to protect the drives from
the GPU heat but it also has a thermal
pad so it's it's a weird heat shield and
heatsink I'm not sure how well it works
yeah we'll test it but this is just a
simple thermal pad they are I believe
1.5 millimeters and yes 1.5 millimeters
for watts per meter Kelvin which is a
bit better than some of the EVGA thermal
pads we tested for that whole vrm issue
so a bit better than that you need to
connect it to something really to be of
much value of course because if you're
just sinking the heat into the pad it
doesn't go anywhere but that's a good
start and then this is just an adapter
so it's just an expansion card it has
it's a by 4 expansion card now of course
the question is well if you connect to m
dot 2 SSDs in it which you could do
what's the the throughput limitation
you're gonna how you assigning the lanes
the bottom one gets all four lanes and
the top one or well the bottom one gets
the PCIe and the top one gives to say
that so top is SATA 6 gigabits per
second or SATA 3 bottom is the PCIe
interface and that is for up to 110
millimeters for the MDOT to sort of gum
stick style as as these goes into your
motherboard other accessories before
getting to the case as coolers this is
just a fan grill the only reason I'm
mentioning this is because we've been
talking about RGB non-stop since last
year and everyone's doing it and it's
not special anymore this is a fan grill
so the lighting here on the front is we
probably some b-roll shots but you'll
see it's actually the snowflake Styles
grill lighting up and that can plug into
your standard RGB fan controllers so if
you have for example one of these 4 pin
layout like the hue plus has I think
maybe the SP fans have it I'm not sure
then you plug into there it should sync
with that or in theory plug with plug
into some of the motherboards that have
the RGB LED capacity
I like the Auris and mystic lighting and
all that stuff so that's a little
different worth mentioning probably be a
couple bucks ten dollars less something
like that this is probably less than
twenty or thirty bucks no hard price not
any of this yet that general pads are
wherever they went probably a couple
bucks as well this is an NT o 8 1 1 5 XP
I believe is the name of the cooler so
the only reason I'm mentioning this it
is a small form-factor cooler it's one
of those 27 millimeters or smaller type
coolers it goes into a box something
like this maybe for an Intel nook or one
of those unit it's very tiny box
obviously that's ok
but it's been done they are the things
that I'm happy about is just having the
Intel connectors because dealing with a
backplate all the time when you don't
have to is dumb and it adds cost and it
adds configuration time and the Intel
clips if it's not a heavy heatsink
they're fine so that makes me happy to
see a very simple thing getting to the
case is this is the PMO one we've talked
about it a few times before it's been in
a few of our case roundups is in our
Computex coverage
in the summer of last year it's changed
a bit so some of the changes include on
the top panel that is now support for
140 millimeter radiator so that's new
and then inside it's well I guess
outside there's tempered glass like
everyone else so a tempered glass four
screws around the side you've seen it
before it's tinted if you like the PMO
one and you like tempered glass I guess
there's a solution for you now $150 is
the jumps up to 150 for that and the
side panel which will have b-roll has a
painting on it and that's an extra ten
bucks on top so you get tempered glass
with no painting or you get both and
it's 160 those are the main changes here
there's toggles for controlling the LEDs
and all that stuff I think these are
what's hooked up right now these little
fan grill cover things so PMO one mostly
the same case other than the major
difference with the 140 and then the
colors this is the SG 14 it's part of
the Sugo series which I have just been
informed being super go so we finally
have an understanding of what that means
so that the SG 14 has currently in its
very prototype form acrylic tinted
windows on three sides so one two three
like that front panels off in the
production model probably part
polycarbonate like most other panels
that are not tempered glass and it's got
a bow to it which is kind of unique it's
a mini ITX box it can support a full ATX
power supply there's a smaller power
supply in there SFF or something like
that as effects and then the video card
just 10.5 maybe 11 inch support
depending on the final model we've got a
toggle button up here that's kind of hot
wired right now for switching the LEDs
the LEDs are a big question mark for
silverstone so if you have a strong
opinion the question for you is would
you rather buy it for a cheaper price
without LEDs or get the LEDs at a higher
price leave a comment below and let them
though but that's the SV 14 basically a
small form-factor box looks pretty easy
to build in just because you pull the
side panels off and you have full access
to everything in the case and cooling is
handled entirely by a 140 millimeter fan
on the bottom that's part of the air
penetrator series we've seen them before
and I think in the Raven case actually
was probably the last time we looked at
it so those are pretty good historically
pushes all the fan up at the air up and
then you exhaust at the top as expected
I think that about covers it there's
plenty of other stuff here but I think
that covers the basics if you want more
information as always link in the
description below a channel like the
postal video thanks for watching
subscribe for more i'll see you all next
time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
