of builds ID we have bypassed some of
the limitations on Vega 56 242 percent
over power from 50 that will give us
something like at least 340 watts but
we're going for 400 watts nearly 380
Watts on this thing I think we're going
to need better cooling at this point and
so enters the next edition of the GN
hybrid mod before that this coverage is
brought to you by cable mod already
well-known for their work in custom
sleeved power supply cables cable mod is
now venturing into liquid cooler tubes
leaving with their new AIO sleeving kits
compatible with Corsair and NZXT as of
now check the link in the description
below for more information
ok let's get this thing started so you
saw the new power target 242 percent
offset we're going to turn this into a
liquid cooled mod now that it's 3:20 in
the morning that seems an appropriate
time to be doing this so the plan is put
a big cooler on this thing the biggest I
have right now is the thermal take
whatever it's called flow the 360
millimeter
cooler so we're going to put one of
these on there and I'll probably replace
the fans with some some really really
high performing fans so either the
Noctua stuff or the corsair maglevs
and we are also going to need this which
is a plate we made previously for the
Vega front erudition cooler and this
basically we just drilled the holes
where the mounting holes are for for
Vega and it's all the same with this one
so all we have to do theoretically is
attach these things together so I'm just
going to figure out where I want the
tubes oriented first this time unlike
last time okay alright that secures our
plate now we need the screws which I
forgot to get okay
I forget which packs we use last time
I don't feel like checking so it's going
to kind of guess and check here I think
we probably is these seen us there's a
hole in the bed okay
all right that looks promising so how
did we do this again that we go through
the top yes then I taped off the
backside yes that's all correct okay
it's coming back to me okay so I think
we did this last time did we do that
yeah we did that right screws to the top
I'm just testing to see if it's going to
work for the knocks I don't really
remember what we did for the Vega
Frontier edition mod all right this
seems that right okay all right so
here's what we're doing we are going to
be offsetting the power on this card 240
percent I don't think it will actually
do 240 percent offset but I mean it's
just it's basically going to max us out
and before we were hitting a limit
either current limit or a power limit we
were bumping into 300 watts can go
higher and so I was told by builds I'd
we should be able to as long as we keep
the vrm to 100 C which we can definitely
do and I'll put thermocouples on there
to be sure we should be able to do at
least three hundred sixty watts through
this thing and I'm going to push for
more and then hopefully that gives us
more Headroom to get and just get more
performance out of it so right now I'm
just testing the mountain we're way off
and once we're way heavier on one side
than the other so we're going to fix
that
see if amounts correctly it's been a
little while since we did this mod at a
month now and if it looks like I
remember we can forge ahead and put
therole paste on it all right so we're
clearing the chokes at the top we're
clearing everything making contact with
the entire GP die and the HBM so let's
take it all back off and put thrown
paste on it
okay so while I'm doing this let me walk
you through what the goal is we could
not modify the fun on you bastard we
cannot modify the BIOS for this alright
you know what that's fine and that's
because of an AMD security and
validation feature it's just it's just
not going to let us so we could flash
BIOS but we couldn't even rename it what
much less do anything useful with it
AMD says this is to comply with a
Microsoft secure boot protocol as we're
currently aware that's not actually a
necessary step but we've asked them to
clarify and unfortunately walking BIOS
like that means that you can't get the
full power out of the card that it has I
mean this vrm can handle it the GPU can
handle it
handle more power that is that it's
doing and AMD is artificially locked
Vega 56 we think so that it won't
outperform its own Vega 64 they lose
crazy money if that happened so that's
what we that's a little conspiracy
theory and this mod if we can get the
overclock higher although scaling is a
bit bad with Vega once you're approached
higher power this mod will hopefully
help us determine if we can outperform
they got 64 with Vega 56 just going to
put a lot everywhere because whatever is
unnecessary will squish out and having
too little in this case is going to be
bad all right that should more than
cover it I mean that'll come out a bit
that's fine it's not conductive we are
installing a power-play tables mod it's
a registry edit because we couldn't get
the BIOS edits to work thanks Andy and I
believe it was done by helm on
overclocking forums and build Zoid the
builds are I'd helped out helm
set the foundation did frontier addition
and then we're kind of applying that
knowledge to this card this is hard to
do with two hands okay so now we just
need all these to be about the same
height so we don't crack with I I should
check what we did last time I don't
remember went to one point two one okay
seven point two on alright shut up yes
that is correct
let's see that's good I think yeah
almost good good okay so bottom line
okay alright and we can call that and
then I'll thermal test it and see how it
does but we're making we're done we
making contact and we're at the same
offset of last time and last time it
cooled insanely well so I think we're
good yes that is for sure
contact and it's for sure good amount of
mounting pressure astute viewers might
notice that there is a connector missing
here that connector goes to the LEDs on
the Radeon logo I didn't like the led so
it's gone it's been removed now it does
not affect performance it's an LED power
header okay
are we contacting anything here that we
need to mask off no we've got probe
points back here
this is HBM to probe points right there
we knit that with a DMM later and on v
cores up here somewhere I've got it
highlighted by builds ID so we can do
all the probe lines and check things
live while working on this which means
I'm going to leave the backplate
probably want to do that anyway next
step anything too cool in the back all
we have on the back of the voltage
controller so we just need to cool the
vrm and keep it under a 100 C which
should be feasible and I'm going to do
that mostly with direct airflow fans
because these are exposed copper anyway
so you care direct airflow fans should
pretty much take care of us but let's
just go ahead and do it the
old-fashioned way
just to be sure okay thermal adhesive
just trying to use some that haven't
been used before there's part of our HBM
to be our m1 face single phase see these
are the same height yeah I remember
correct these are definitely the same
height so we do one for each pair and
then we're just going to blow around
whatever doesn't get coverage there'll
be one or two that don't get covered but
those are the ones we hooked up
thermocouples to last time and they just
fine they were we're not complaining
number one two three four five six seven
eight nine ten okay alright cool time so
that's what we got
I can't touch this at this point it
needs to dry some of those are better
contacted than others but I'll look
through it make sure they're all good
and dried evenly on the surface of the
FETs before we get testing but it needs
to dry for a little bit first probably
overnight there are two sets the tune
ours is one one one sigh at two sets two
sets that are not hit by these little
heat sinks honestly they're not really
needed anyway it's just kind of a
formality because we're pushing the
power limits so much higher I went ahead
with it and includes the heat sinks the
two that aren't covered are going to get
plenty of airflow how you like 2,400 rpm
times two of airflow on them they'll be
fine so
we'll have thermocouples and vines'
probe as necessary make sure everything
is happy other than that I think we're
pretty much ready to test so that's the
hybrid model for vegam 56 this one will
be a little bit more exciting than
normally because we've also mounted the
power play tables so we'll be able to
see how much further we can push it we
also have an extra size up radiator
normally we use a 120 this is a 360
which will definitely help as well we're
not really concerned about noise or
power here I just I'm curious how far
Vega 56 can go because if we bypass the
Andy limitations which we've kind of
done indirectly with the registry mod
then I want to see if it's a Vega 64
that's what I'm after because I don't
think the extras to use if you look back
in time they don't really do all that
much at least compared to core clock so
we can push this core clock even another
well allowing to make predictions but we
push the core clock higher it'll be only
good things except for power consumption
this is not going to be an efficient mod
it's not something you should do you
would waste a lot of power you're not
going to gain a ton out of it but it'll
be fun so sorry that's why we're doing
it but as always you can help us out
