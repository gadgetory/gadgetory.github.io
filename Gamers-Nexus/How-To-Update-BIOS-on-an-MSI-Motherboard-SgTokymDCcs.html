update BIOS for an MSI motherboard
particularly the new Z 270 gaming probe
Carbon reasons you'd want to do this
include expanded memory support this
fixes memory frequency support so it
supports the higher end frequencies and
if you have a z170 board and you want to
support KB Lake chipsets you would use
the same approach first go to the
manufacturers website for this we pull
up support for Z 270 GamePro Carbon then
sort by BIOS and then download the
latest bios version that you want and
then save it to a USB key once you've
got a saved on key you can restart and
enter BIOS Wireless rebooting this
content is brought to you by a
thermaltake and a new core p1 tgd
chassis which is a mini ITX wall
mountable case so we're in bio it with
BIOS you only need one option really and
that's em flash make sure you have your
USB connected it will ask you if you
want to enter flash mode say yes it's
going to reboot and enter a mode where
you can either save your BIOS
configuration in case he wipes
everything you needs restored or you can
flash a new BIOS on there flashing BIOS
means that you are rewriting the
firmware with a new set of instructions
basically so in doing this there is an
inherent risk that you could damage
something make sure that there is no
system power loss do not power down the
system what it's trying to flash you may
enter an unrecoverable state so we're
going to go into my BIOS folder you can
see we have our USB key the BIOS folder
let's go there and there's the BIOS hit
enter on it are you sure you want to use
this file make absolutely certain that
it is the correct BIOS for the correct
motherboard do not use one for a
different board because you will destroy
your motherboard so this is flashing
it's got a progress bar thankfully and
once it's done you will be good to go
you restart the new BIOS is there you
might want to enter BIOS just to make
sure everything is how you like it so
that is all for this video very easy
article below contains a step by step
instruction set and some common links we
did this previously for a tooth it was
very light so we're doing it for MSI and
we'll do it for gigabyte BIOS are and
others and
your future if you have any questions
post them below thanks for watching and
subscribe for more I'll see you all next
time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
