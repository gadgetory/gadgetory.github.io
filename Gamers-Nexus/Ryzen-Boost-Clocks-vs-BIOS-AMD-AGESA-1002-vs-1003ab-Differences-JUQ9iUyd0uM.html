basically we're looking at the Ajitha
updates for AMD BIOS and weather on our
gigabyte x5 sony master motherboard it
mattered to go from f5c to an 11 which
was the bios that initially shipped on
the boards we tested with f5 see spend
some discussion online if you missed it
where some reviewers are seeing
something we already knew about but it
wasn't affecting us really where they're
seeing lower frequencies than advertised
buddhist and we need to talk about that
briefly too but the end result depends c
feet of cpu and board to board and
fortunately for us we were basically
unaffected but we're gonna go through
the test date anyway between the two
different biases because you all keep
hammering my inbox and comment sections
about it and i am exhausted and actually
ready to die at this point but we're
gonna do it anyway before that this
video is brought to you by us and the
gamers nexus toolkit on store documents
axis net our brand new toolkit just
launched and contains ten custom eight
drivers for video card disassembly reap
hasting and tear downs the eight core
tools are made of high-quality chromium
vanadium alloy steel that's built for
long service life and resistance to wear
during use the other two tools are
carbon steel hex heads that were custom
ground down for capacitor clearance on
video cards all the tools are easily
mounted to a pegboard or stored in the
GN made tool bag for easy transport
learn more at the link in the
description below alright so how is
keeping stuff I gave the whole team off
today I was also supposed to have off I
don't mean to sound like I'm complaining
but I do want just think of a time when
you worked 168 hours in a week think of
a time when you worked like a hundred
and twenty to thirty of those and
remember the feeling at the end of it
where you you actually aren't sure if
you're going to live anymore so that's
where we are but you just want to set
that stage so the point is for the
charts today I'm not doing anything
fancy I'm gonna put a PNG on the screen
and I'm gonna say the numbers and then
that will be the video so to catch
everyone hop basically there isn't an
issue on some CPUs and some other boards
especially where the and when I say some
CPUs I don't mean 3600 versus 3900 X I
mean literally CPU to CPU there's
variants within the same skew so
the issue is that it's not always
boosting to the advertised boost clock
under the single-threaded workloads and
all court workloads totally unaffected
for us anyway can't speak I guess for
all of the samples but from what we've
seen all core a hundred percent
unaffected the results for all core 100%
unaffected results for a single core
theoretically can vary a bit and we'll
go through some of that today
but it depends and so what we worst
frequency data in our initial reviews a
lot of people I guess I didn't blow it
up and make a big story out of it so I
guess no one really noticed but we were
seeing on average about 25 megahertz
below advertised in some of the tasks
but for the most part it was okay okay
enough that it would be within variance
for the most part and that's what we're
gonna look at today so what we did very
briefly here to explain it is X 570
master for the motherboard it's by
gigabyte I am extremely happy that we
chose to test quite this time because
from what we've heard about some of the
other motherboards gigabyte has been the
most Hanuman II with the speck which is
good because redoing everything would
suck so fortunately we're not too
affected but basically there's a few
different versions of BIOS there's n 11
that's what the what I am the officially
validated with the CPUs and then there's
fc5 I think it's called which is what
came out just before release there was
an F F F 5 C I think there was an f5 d
and then now there's an f5 e those are
gigabytes bios's MSI has had some BIOS
changes as well but at the end of the
day what it really comes down to aside
from some memory tweaks that aren't
really relevant here its overclocking
stuff aside from those what it comes
down to is AMD's binary code that they
give to the motherboard makers and it's
called Jessa and AG ESA there's version
1002 was on the or one zero zero two was
on the N 11 press initial bios we did
not use that BIOS for the motherboards
and then there was one zero zero three a
one zero zero 3a is what we used it's on
fc5 f5 see sorry and that includes the
some of the fixes for clock boosting so
we had those and we were we were well we
were supposed to have those and I'll
talk about that a bit more to you and
then there's
another version one zero zero three a B
a Jessa and that includes the initial
patch and then a follow-up patch so
those are the Adisa versions that's what
dictates the boosting behavior and for
the most part it depends on the CPU
literally CPU two CPU where you'll see
some that just don't do 4600 for 3900
xmi 345 785 or 4550 we can't get a clear
answer from Andy on if that's normal
which is incredibly frustrating but I
had to call with AMD before we went live
with our before we wrote the review and
said hey we're seeing we're seeing this
clock behavior 45 75 is kind of the max
single thread we see and we're seeing a
single or multi core at whatever it was
don't remember at this top my head but
we were seeing multi-core told them that
number I said what is the all core
frequency and they were like well we
don't we don't have that I was like yes
you do there's an all core frequency you
might not call it that anymore but it
still exists so the way it works it's
it's like partly thermal dependent power
dependent and if you don't have the
thermal limitation which we don't in
test environment you don't have really a
power limitation there is going to be an
all core and the only reason it might be
dictated differently at that point would
be silicon quality which is a different
discussion entirely anyway we found that
all core in the single core numbers
ourselves
thank you very much Andy and those are
in the reviews for the 3600 3900 X so we
did find those we published them you're
good to go on that anyway I guess I
think we can just talk about the numbers
here let's I don't know let's just go
through the numbers I'll put some p.m.
G's on the screen and then we'll if I
think of anything else we'll go over it
and I'm going to go outside before I
don't have a chance anymore so I
Cinebench the first has to help
demonstrate the differences and if they
emerge a Cinebench we have to do
real-world testing as well of course but
this helps establish expectations with
the r5 3,600 CPU the results aren't just
close they're identical this chart only
looks at the maximum at single core
clock per polling interval remember that
the fastest core will change from one to
the next so we take the maximum value
out of all the cores and plot that as it
is a single threaded workload the
maximum frequency is 40 200 megahertz
all tests technically it's measuring
4,200 point four but basically 4200 BC
LK or base clock is 100 before anyone
asks about that the r5 3600 official
spec as a reminder is 4,200 megahertz
our r5 3600 results are 100% unaffected
by this BIOS there is ZERO difference
and the results will not change we test
it on f5 see but an 11 would also have
been fine here
f5 see also has one zero zero three a a
Jessa and 11 has 1 0 0 2 and the 1 0 0 3
a B can be found on the f5 II version
with patches of more of the same 4 1 0 0
3 a except for some of the other
affected units not even SKUs for the
ro933 seeing more of a difference than
the 3600 but still not much of one
the single-threaded difference in
Cinebench is between 0 megahertz and
seventy-five megahertz max and not
frequently the average delta calculated
across the entire run is forty nine
point six megahertz as for if this
impact results the answer is that it
depends but mostly no remember that not
many of the tests we run these days even
games will entirely load one threat and
we don't do one thread Cinebench numbers
either so that doesn't matter here
also even most games will push out at
least two core workloads these days and
so these are unaffected in our testing
we can look at some real data for
validation we'll skip the 3600 since
we've already validated it as good data
as a no point in redoing all that work
and so that remains entirely 100%
unaffected there is zero impact on the
3600 review which is great because we
said it's a good processor so that's
good I'm glad that I don't have to
change that opinion although it would
only go up in theory based on what
people have been complaining about so
there is no magical 10% performance
increase to our 3,600 review for those
of you who wanted there to be one I'm
sorry but just be happy with the fact
that the 3600 is that they have good CPU
and we were very confident in making a
strong recommendation for it in our
video so you don't need to stuff this
magical plus 10% number into our charts
and mislead people because I've seen a
lot of that on reddit and it's
incredibly frustrating just like the CPU
already does well you don't have to make
things up there
is an issue with boosting for some
processors but it's not for all of them
so don't just assume every review is
going to have a magical plus 10% number
here all right so I think we need to
talk about some other stuff
be right with v-ray the 3900 X stock CPU
produces the same 0.75 minute results as
in our original test that's with an 11 F
5 e and F 5 C we use f5 c for testing
which has a G so 1 0 3 a B and a sorry
and f5 es10 3 a B and 11 is what AMD's
hunt on the board but we updated to the
FC version for better support elsewhere
there's no difference in this test this
is an all core test so everything else
that's all core which is all of the
production tasks we did basically I
think I think yes there might be one I'm
not pretty sure - all of them are
unaffected they're for all core still
get another one that is frequency and
not a frequency dependent notice thread
heavy GTA 5 1080p GTA as a reminder is
more single-threaded than every other
game in our benchmark for the most part
so differences would emerge here for
this one
our original review data published a 109
point nine FPS average for the are a 939
hundred x the an 11 pre-release review
bios with a GC a 1000 to hit 112 and our
data range here run to run is 112 point
four to one hundred thirteen point three
average this is tested across five test
passes standard deviation is roughly 0.4
FPS for deviation on the average the
maximum difference is a two point seven
percent improvement not IV 10%
improvement that people online have been
speculating that is again not to say it
won't happen on some reviews but it does
not affect our review here there's a
maximum improvement of 2.7 percent and
that's with the run to run variation
which would drag that down depending on
which number you calculate against so
this is important to go back and note of
course the improvement is noteworthy and
happy to point it out briefly but this
does not change the review quick aside
here to a lot of people are now confused
us what boost even means what int says
4.6 gigahertz boost they don't mean all
core it has never meant that that's not
what Intel mean to either
that's not the problem this is an
entirely different thing all core is
always going to be a lower number to
maintain stability and the boost spec
listed on the website has never been for
the last several generations the all
core boost especially for risin so
that's a different issue also my audio
my recorders about to die but we're just
gonna switch to the on camera audio I'm
not doing this today all the
recommendations in the review for the
3900 X remain the same the 3600 remains
strongly recommended for us the 3900 X
remains recommended in the applications
we recommended it for I'm not redoing
the review here you can go watch that if
you want to know what those were and and
then I guess that's that's up to GTA so
far so review itself unaffected data
affected maximally about 2.7 percent in
GTA 5 and 0 percent in v-ray and every
other all court workload look at the
last two a tomb raider plot in a
difference of 1.6 FPS average of max
which is more or less error margin it is
a repeatable result there so we'll
mention it as repeatable which means
that it is probably a real difference
the end improvements is maybe 1% one
point one percent which is within
reasonable error for most testing but
ours is a bit tighter than that so that
is outside of our error margins just
barely this does not change anything in
the review once again but it does update
the numbers which are marginally higher
total war 2 is battle benchmark plotted
a 162 FPS average originally and is now
at 150 9.2 FPS average that's a 1.7
percent maximum improvement but this
game has a much wider run to run
variants than others note that these
0.1% lows for instance range by 9 fps
here which is within the wider error
margins for 0.1% lows in this game the
average FPS difference is outside of
error margin so it is a real difference
we have an allowance of plus or minus
0.8 FPS average in this one so 1.7
percent max here anyway the point is I
suppose that there can be a bit of an
improvement but not always and there's
not much of one in our testing that's
not to say again some reviews really way
more effective so an attack we saw the
whatever initial data they put up and it
looks like they'll have a much bigger
difference than we did but that depends
on the CPU and on the BIOS and we use
the different motherboard and we
obviously have a difference
you so just to kind of close this out
I've been knocking the the comment
frenzy through this a bit because I am
annoyed to be frank about the you need
to retest everything it's ten percent
better that's not true with our testing
so you can stop those comments now it's
it's we got it but it's not true here so
the end result then is some reviewers
will see a bigger difference then we did
but we're not going to see a big
difference in our data which means our
reviews are more or less unaffected if
you want to be optimistic you can maybe
average the differences here and call it
a maximum average improvement of two
percent in games that are more thread
limited so that would be the optimistic
look at it but that doesn't really
change a whole lot you're talking
single-digit FPS changes here and to go
over this again like I was saying some
outlets will see a bigger difference
like an attack as mentioned but I do
want to be very clear here that for
those people who are more effective for
the reviewers who are more effective
than we were I'm obviously very happy
we're not that affected because we've
done enough for now but for those who
are more affected please don't go like
brigade their channels or their review
websites because this is not a fault the
reviewers this is an AMD crammed a bunch
of products down everyone's throat and
gave him 6days launched the product on a
Sunday so even getting contact from AMD
was difficult and also a holiday weekend
in the US so get in contact with AMD and
the motherboard manufacturers was
difficult so this is not a fault of the
reviewers for those who do see a bigger
difference
don't go brigade them it is purely a
matter of the BIOS revisions the GC code
changes and the individual SKUs of CPUs
and gigabyte via an outlet had released
some information on their own internal
testing we're on the same BIOS with the
same skew so thirty six hundred I think
it well so same skew thirty six hundred
same BIOS they were seeing different
single core frequencies one to the next
and so how are you what are you supposed
to do about that like how do you
after that so anyway that's the story
our results you can look at with
confidence that they are fine and if you
would like to be optimistic on the
gaming stuff add 2% our 3700 X review
I'm not going to go back and change that
will be published as is because again
the difference isn't big enough and it's
it's not worth redoing days of work at
this point because we are totally
knackered
so this is you know this is this is a
different discussion entirely on how to
treat your media partners and your
motherboard partners but anyway and all
of the story is our day that all core
fine and then limited core workloads
maximum two percent improvement except
for that one was it GTA maybe 2.7
percent
wherever that was 2.7 percent in GTA 5
but the max average was 2% so I think
I've said everything I need to say and I
would like to go outside now because I
haven't done that in a while
so thank you for watching I will see you
all next time you can get a strata here
his exes dotnet pick my shirt a mod mat
or a toolkit if you'd like to support us
directly and and you can also go to
patreon.com/scishow and axis I'll see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
