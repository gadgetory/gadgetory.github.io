off with Intel who in a recent earnings
call announced that the new kb lake
architecture has begun shipment to OEMs
and other business customers kb lake is
intel's new 14 nanometer processor and
will utilize a 200 series chipset the kb
lake architecture isn't yet moving to
retailers but will be entering volume
production in the second half of 2016
right around when AMD Zen is scheduled
for arrival in other earnings news md
just posted its second-quarter 2016
results marking a strong recovery for
the company's position AMD's 2016 second
quarter earnings posted a revenue of 1.0
to seven billion a growth year-over-year
from there 2015 second quarter of nine
hundred and forty-two million versus
last quarter AMD's operating loss has
improved from 68 million to an eight
million loss which looks like pennies in
face of the company's recent earnings
AMD's recovery is largely attributable
to the 150 million dollar merger of
their assembly test mark and pack a TMP
group with nan tong fujitsu my for
electronics and reduce losses are
resultant of layoffs and other operating
expense cuts Andy now must capitalize on
its time with Polaris and Zen to
continue their further improvement other
industry news includes gr.3 steady price
decline something which a non-tech
recently dove into at gamers nexus we
predicted some years ago that the ddr3
to ddr4 crossover to occur around 2016
and that seems to be about right prices
are now at a new low with a gigabyte
ddr3 kits available for less than thirty
dollars if you're still trying to keep
that ddr3 system alive and you want to
buy some new Ram now is a pretty good
time to do it it's also not a bad time
to build a new Devil's Canyon pc as
parts are relatively cheap and can be
found cheaper than skylake but it
depends on what you're trying to cobble
together the tight necks was announced
this week no not that the new Pascal tie
connects what we're calling the Titan XP
host a GP 102 GPU with 3584 cuda cores a
start climb from the 2560 cuda cores of
the GTX 1080 the GP 102 chip will likely
host 28 sm
across 6g pcs and it's known to run 12
gigabytes of G 5x within 480 gigabyte a
second memory bandwidth for more depth
on the Titan X check out our launch
video or article linked below we've been
liquid cooling most of the new GPUs
lately and it looks like manufacturers
are starting to catch up though their
version of liquid cooling is a little
more official fantex is one of those
who've pony dup their GTX 1080 full
coverage water block this block is made
for inclusion with open loop liquid
cooling systems and is not an all-in-one
cooler the ph GB 1080 X is made of
nickel plated copper and use it an
acrylic surface to showcase the coolant
channels LEDs can be inserted at your
discretion and are positionable and up
to three locations on the block the
block supports LEDs up to one millimeter
in diameter that block will be priced at
a hundred and thirty dollars and that's
it for this week's Hardware recap for
