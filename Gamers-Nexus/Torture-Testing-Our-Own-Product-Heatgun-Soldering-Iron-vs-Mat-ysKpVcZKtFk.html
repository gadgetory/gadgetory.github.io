intro for the James Bond reference in
the fake blood that's YouTube now we're
gonna talk about the mod Matt and its
thermal tolerance this is something a
lot of you have asked about I have not
tested it yet so I'm gonna be testing it
more or less live except not on camera
while you guys are watching and we're
gonna see what I can stand up to a lot
of people have asked how it would hold
up against soldering and how it would
hold up against a heat gun like for
hardline tube bending and stuff like
that so we have a digital heat gun here
that I just picked up and TR industrial
I can set the output bought it myself
and we're also gonna use it for water
coin stuff later hopefully so we can set
the output on that we've got a soldering
iron test both of them against the mat
and see how it does currently the only
thermal numbers I have from the factory
is they basically said conservatively
keep it below 60 degrees Celsius which I
that shouldn't be a problem we're gonna
see if we go over that though because
that's where it should get interesting
we've right now we've not recommended
using the mod mat as a soldering surface
it's not a soldering mat it's made of
rubber and ink for the most part so
those things both melt it's just a
question of at what temperature do they
mouth and also we want to know how well
it holds up to a heat gun which is more
relevant to our a lot of our audience
either way if you're not familiar with
the mod mat you go to stored I cameras
nexus net and backorder it it's more or
less an order at this point because
we're getting them in this weekend at
the time of filming this video so
they'll be shipping out basically
immediately and then factory and
shipping time to get to you it's an
anti-static building surface so great
for PC modding we've done a lot of water
cooling on it with leakage and it's held
up very well to that so fairly water
resistant now we just need to see how
heat-resistant it is and if we can make
some things melt or catch on fire today
I think let's start out with let's start
setting up the surface so my plan here
I'm gonna stick some thermocouples on it
we're gonna treat this like a normal
benchmark and should be reasonably
scientific but not too crazy with it
what we're gonna do is stick a thermo
on the surface somewhere and then we're
gonna stick one on the underside of the
mat and then I have a blue mat the old
blue mat if anyone remembers that under
here it's these blue ones by the way we
bought these for business use and
they're $100 each any we're gonna use
this to protect the table underneath the
mod mat that may be up for melting today
and I'm just gonna stick one of these
down with some captain tape which is
basically a thermal tape so we have one
k-type thermocouple on the top and one
on the bottom k types are plus or minus
two point two degrees we've calibrated
these but it's typically plus plus my
point two point two degrees tolerance
now that said just to clarify something
here a lot of people here at two point
two they think wow that's a lot it's
actually not because it's perfectly
inaccurate so if it's two point two
degrees off it is always two point two
degrees off in the same direction so
let's say we have a known true
temperature of a hundred degrees Celsius
hitting this thing and let's say that
this has an an in accuracy of one degree
negative so it reads ninety nine when we
go up to 200 it'll read 199 we go up to
300 I mean it can't these can't really
tolerate too much heat but basically
it's always one degree negative offset
so it's perfectly inaccurate which means
calibration just requires that you know
what the accuracy is and then you adjust
for that manually and spreadsheets or
whatever I'm gonna put one basically on
the opposite side of this one so you
plug in the K types to the thermocouple
reader figure out the temperature of the
material in between by doing that so
somewhat scientific approach to this and
then this one will have an ambient
temperature probe and a manual
thermometer which is also a K type setup
but I can take this thermometer and the
planets touch it to the end of the
soldering iron so that we can figure out
what's the temperature of the soldering
iron versus what's the temperature of
the mat of ambient and all that stuff
okay so we're all set up to go not sure
how well the captain tape will hold up
to actual hot air blowing on it normally
it's just kind of conductive heated see
with from components we'll try it out
and this is somewhat controllable so
we're gonna try and set it to I don't
know roughly 60 degrees Celsius for a
starting temperature then we'll go up
rapidly from there just because 60 is
what the factories told me is good I
would like it to be higher than that
obviously so we'll see how well it does
so we're going to be this is basically
anyone remember the thousand degree
knife that wasn't actually a thousand
degrees this can go up to I think
actually a thousand degrees Fahrenheit
it doesn't exactly count so may be the
thumbnail we can do that wasn't degree
heat gun versus Matt take some that cuz
that's I can't can't bring myself to do
that so we're going for 160 is what
we're gonna set for Fahrenheit because
this doesn't do well I mean might be
solved if I don't know how to do that so
got a not pointed out myself while
you're reading it which is about sixty
degrees Celsius and let's just it'll
take a minute to kind of heat up but
that's the end of this I think it is and
sky not too hot yet so it is if you look
at the right thermocouple leader in the
bottom left of the screen it says sixty
two point two and that's the thermometer
I'm holding my hand so we're pushing 60
C out of the end the mod Matt is still
at about 53 which will give it a bit
more time to heat up but there it's
definitely pretty resistant to heat it's
it's a really high under rubber like
it's an industrial material we chose
that's why the
at such high quality but it'll take a
little bit longer let's see if it gets
to 60 eventually you're not melting or
anything yet
I want to bring it up in speed all right
so that's that's enough I think we're 60
let's print it up to 200 degrees
Fahrenheit which is roughly and mind you
something solid is named 93 92 93 96 and
we're gonna test two things one is when
does the rubber melt and when does the
paint know which I'll do this test
separately don't have to point the gun
at something painted separately for that
also for anyone worried about how this
tapes affecting it we're hitting the
surrounding area as well so the
thermocouples really just tell us what
the temperature is nearby and all the
tapes doing is block until the air sure
but clearly it's still heating up to 60
plus and then we've got the underside
thermocouple to validate for us what is
that 50 we got a doll for about 10
degrees at the bottom is 50 it's pretty
safe to assume obviously the entire way
through for this vertical slice it's
going to be 50 degrees plus and 60 on
the surface because if they're on a
couple breathing on the surface all
right so we've had them at over 60 for
several minutes now and we've gotten it
up to a peak of about 70 so let's kind
of inspect if any damage has been done
the general area where's your tape
residue that's to be expected
no damage let's see if I can dig any
rubber out no no that's fine cool okay
well that's a good start
all right so we're set to 115 degrees
Celsius right now let's see if there's
any difference and down to that
on there all right so that's two minutes
that's two minutes at 100 degrees
Celsius for the top and round are
roughly 80 for the bottom it's pretty
pretty uncomfortably hot any damage so
man that is super resilient I mean the
neighboring paint isn't that uh isn't
that much there isn't as warm but let's
um let's look at the underside as well
you definitely see where we that's a
piece of tape and dried up all the
stickiness and the tape all the moisture
and the tape is dry underside still
really warm so really happy with that so
far the mat thus far hasn't had any
issues with 80 to 82 degrees Celsius for
the mat temperature as measured after a
few minutes of the heat gun
we're only spot checking a few things
here and we haven't tested an access of
ten minutes or anything like that but to
be fair you shouldn't really even point
in a heat gun directly at the mat at a
painted area without anything in between
them for that lawn anyway so also quick
note here the temperature of the mat is
different than what's coming out of the
heat gun so when we say 80 to 82 degrees
mat temperature that's different from
the air temperature the air temperature
as it's hitting the mat is over a
hundred degrees but the mat temperature
itself obviously is a bit different
because it's a different surface there's
thermal resistance to take note of and
and conductivity and then also the air
coming directly out of the heat gun is
quite a bit warmer than the air hitting
the mat as well as because it's further
away you leave some of that as you get
closer to the mat so we need to do is
see how the paint holds up maybe let's
let's blast one of these pin outs over
here so these are our power pin outs
like if you wanted to see where the 12
volt lines are so you could maybe do a
resistance check for 12 volt versus a
shunt resistor or something so if these
start bleeding color obviously it'll be
really obvious to us we're gonna check
those next okay so what we've done here
this time we change the meth
but there's still a thermocouple on the
underside and it's taped exactly
opposite of this metal thermometer just
in case the metal thermometer is more
sensitive on the the very tip which is
not directly touching the mat in case
it's more sensitive here and it's
detecting the hot air temperature rather
than the mat temperature we've stuck
another thermocouple to the mat on the
top and this is reading at the the point
of the thermocouple so we should get a
more accurate reading and then the
underside is gonna be our best bet of
what the true mat temperature is because
it's not being hit by the air so that's
the number we want to pay the most
attention to that for this one I think
just cuz that'll give us a
conservatively low thermal tolerance
number which I would rather rate it
conservatively low and be pleasantly
surprised so when we care most about
I've just switched so that's this top
number here twenty seven point six
currently and then the bottom one is
going to be the thermometer so that's
the thermometer that's the underside
let's see how it does and then this this
thermocouple is over here on t2
currently twenty eight point five for
that
in case you're wondering this number up
here normally is our ambient readout
except it's going to be influenced by
the heat it's behind the thermocouple
readers so that's not really the most
useful number other than roughly room
ambient before the heat starts getting
to it the air hitting the mat right now
137 degrees that's the air temperature
hitting it 75 for the under side 124 for
the top thermocouple again getting
influenced by air especially liftoff at
this point so we can't believe we can't
disregard this number this point it's no
longer touching the mat completely it's
now getting under draft from the air so
that number is no longer good for us
unless I read tape it down let's just
disconnect that for use confusing
okay air temperature currently 148
degrees 140 145 is our range for air
temperature Celsius underside is 88 for
sure so the mat for sure is at least 88
degrees plus or minus 2 which is
actually we'll see if there's any damage
at this point it smells kind of like a
match so it definitely smells I mean
yeah there you go there's some there's
some paint damage right there I was very
very very hot what's her surface
temperature right now surface
temperature is like a hundred degrees
holy crap so reading 86 on the surface
right now this is by the way after
turning it off and letting it sit
obviously for a good thirty seconds so
it cooled down a lot this time it's
straight down touching the mat so known
temperature in the 80s so in the 80s
Celsius for the mat we're getting paint
damage which I have to say is it's
pretty damn good it's not even that bad
it's not like it melt it didn't
delaminate but it is coming off so yeah
not the not so bad really I'm pretty
happy with that result if you're
pointing a heat gun straight down for
like several minutes there's like five
total but it was two at that temperature
but five or so total
at a heavily painted area than at about
90 degrees service temperature maybe 150
degrees air temperature Celsius for all
these underside temperature 80 we're
getting some paint damage and it still
looks pretty damn good considering the
what it just went through oh yeah I'm
pretty happy at that result
cool so yeah the mat looks great
there's no no melting or anything like
that down here certainly certainly warm
still but there's no visible damage on
the underside no visible damage to the
rubber on the topside obviously some
paint damage so that's just one more
time go over the numbers here we're
roughly ninety degrees Celsius service
temperature I'm being conservatively low
there so that's a rough temperature
based on a measurement like 20 seconds
after the gun was turned off 20-30
seconds and then the underside was in
the 80s and then the air temperature was
about 150 degrees Celsius so this was at
143 degrees air temperature 88 degrees
mat temperature we have some paint
damage here which is to be expected as
it's ultimately ink which is comprised
largely of things like water but the
matte rubber material looks perfectly
fine we're not seeing meaningful
material damage overall we're really
happy with this result there aren't a
lot of people who would be blasting the
mat again from 2 inches away with the
heat gun dead-on on a painted part at
nearly 150 degrees Celsius for the air
temperature as it hits the mat that's a
bit excessive it looks like it's pretty
good for this for soldering again yeah
if you're gonna make contact with the
surface it's not a soldering mat that
would cost us a lot more money to make
and still print on and if you want
printed graphics on it it's going to be
kind of hard to pull off with a
soldering mat anyway because ink melts
or at least evaporates or dries up or
something so let's see how we do with a
higher temperature we saw the 380
degrees Fahrenheit last time I want to
do this a little more ad-hoc just take
spot measurements
with the third metal thermometer 440
Fahrenheit it's a gun is set to 226
Celsius right now and let's pick a spot
that I can easily replicate that hasn't
been messed with already so we're gonna
point right here at this blower fan in
the design the GM logo design is that
about the same two inch distance or so
we're at 170 something degrees and
climbing air temperature so 180 we're at
181 180 degrees Celsius somewhere in
that range and surface is whether it's
let's see what the surfaces right now
leave it alone for a second we're doing
just fine and that was at 440 degrees
Fahrenheit coming out of the heat gun
which is again 226 degrees Celsius let's
bring it up to 500 Fahrenheit which is
260 actually it's a little higher than
that 520 degrees not okay it's been
about two and a half minutes one thing
to note here when the mat is coming up
like this it's either partly because air
is getting through the pores of the mat
and underneath it causing liftoff or
because the rubber is expanding as it's
heating up and currently we are reading
we're still climbing to study state in
the 70s currently obviously it's cooling
down while we're doing this okay let's
check the underside if possible it's
like probably it's it's about eighty
degrees down there
alright that's about two and a half
minutes again none of the ink is coming
off and the rubber seems fine oh is it
steaming or is that the gun it's
steaming for sure is
yeah the Matt is there's steam coming
off the mat right now it's definitely
super hot I mean it's it's steaming so
it's gonna be up there it's roughly 80
currently and that's after being off for
a while
all right soldering iron test we're
gonna do turn it on we'll test the
temperature of the tip of the soldering
iron and then apply it for a known
period of time to the surface we'll
start with an unpainted area and then go
to painted there's some oh got a
breaker or what that was a short see if
it does it again I guess
site wiring fault let's see if that's
what lights up and that is cool
I think the soldering iron I want to use
might have a short or something because
when I turn it on it trips the huh let's
just let's show that one time so when I
turn this Saturday night on you're gonna
see it'll flip our protective circuit in
the APC power strip so protection
working keep an eye on this and one two
three pretty cool so I found another one
it is not controllable in any way but
it's it's ancient it's been around
forever so we're gonna see what tetra
this gets up to you right now we're
eating 121 degrees 124 degrees 26 28
still climbing that the thermometer is
catching up with it right now so we're
at 148 149 on 50 this is gonna be really
hot I don't think I have a way to
control it see how it does on an
unpainted surface first service is at a
lot of degrees Celsius current
temperature very high C and 6870 175 178
181 oh my god 188 yeah that's causing
some burning so this is what you can
expect if you get a soldering iron up to
say I don't know I don't know exactly
what temperature that's started you can
expect damage like this is still too hot
to the touch
yes I should not touch it presently this
is an iron that's 200 degrees and
obviously that's going to cause all
kinds of problems because we're melting
robbery it's 200 degrees I don't really
know what else you would expect but if
you were to lay it down maybe for like
three seconds it'd be okay leave maybe a
bit of a scorch but it's it's when you
do anything longer than that so
basically if you're trying to find a
surface yeah you can stab it with the
iron like if you're just working you
kind of slip and go like that
sure they'll cause a bit of a scorch but
it's not gonna like burn through the
rubber instantly that'll take a while
it's just we still don't recommend it as
a perfect service for solder and you
could solder on top of it it's just you
know if you stab it especially for long
periods of time at 200 degrees Celsius
expect a bit of damage that said the
mats holding up really well despite not
being built for this purpose of
soldering the mat will still protect the
underlying surface but it will get a
scorch whenever you make a contact point
with a really really hot iron so we
don't recommend using the mat as a
soldering mat specifically if you want
it to be perfect for multi hundreds of
degrees irons and remain without any
damage basically if you want to be a
pristine surface with the ink unharmed
then soldering is going to be a bit of a
problem for ink obviously we're not
afraid to say that it's not a soldering
mat however we're interested in making
one of the future so keep that in mind
if you do want a specific soldering at
grade mat this is just more of a
building service that said it holds up
really well overall so although we don't
advertise the mat as a soldering mat you
can use it during soldering you
certainly could if not stabbing it for
long periods of time or wiping the iron
on the mat intentionally to clean it off
or something service temperature seems
best kept below 80 degrees Celsius our
official spec for safety of the mat is
still 60 degrees Celsius but we've
tested up to and Beyond 80 degrees here
today and have observed minimal damage
at those temperatures especially if
you're talking heat gun versus soldering
iron and if you still really want a
soldering mat again and this isn't good
enough although it's quite good if you
are okay with it taking a couple scorch
marks when you're at 200 degrees it's
still holding up pretty well it's just
not meant for it but anyway if you're
still really want of soldering that
we're looking into them and if you have
specific ideas tweet them at us or
something like that we'll see what we
can do the takeaway is that if you're
using a soldering iron that's multiple
hundreds of degrees Celsius it's gonna
be a little bit hot for a rubber and ink
so we're not a soldering mat I'm
perfectly okay saying if you're gonna be
using this thing for soldering and
you're gonna be laying down the
soldering iron on the mat it's not the
best fit because we're not trying to be
everything for everyone we're trying to
do one thing really well which is be an
awesome mod Matt and I static build
surface with some diagrams on it but
from the perspective of water cooling
enthusiasts it works pretty damn well
but there's the ink hasn't run off and
the rubber hasn't melted so there might
be some discoloration if you're at 300
degrees Celsius with the air temperature
the temperature of the mat is obviously
different it takes a while to heat up
thermal resistance as a factor
but the end of the day you're not going
to be pointing a heat gun two inches
away from the mat for like 10 minutes at
really high temperatures like that so
I'm really happy with how it held up
because our spec previously was to keep
the mat below 60 degrees Celsius and and
so that's kind of what our rough
guideline was it can handle a bit more
than that and in terms of air
temperature can handle quite a lot as
long as you're not pointed at it for you
know a really long period of time
basically for long enough for the mat to
start heating up to say 90 degrees so
held up really well if you're still
interested in it and you want it well we
can say now that a heat gun shouldn't be
a problem excellent fit for water
cooling enthusiasts for PC building and
also for soldering if you're using
either lower temperatures or you don't
actually like stab the surface and hold
it there for several seconds like I was
doing and you can socket the soldering
iron somewhere then it'd be fine for
that too
it'll just eventually yeah you'll cause
some damage if you sit there and hold it
on it for several seconds at multiple
hundreds of degrees like two hundred
c-plus but that's me expected I mean
it's not an impervious material so lots
of fun though thanks for watching if you
