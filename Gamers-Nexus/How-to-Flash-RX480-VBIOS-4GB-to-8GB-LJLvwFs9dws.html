to flash an RX 484 gigabyte card into an
8 gigabyte card few things here so first
of all this will not work on all cards
it is at your own risk you may damage or
brick your card by doing this but if you
want to play around then this is the way
that you would go at the procedure so
there are two models the RX 44 gigabytes
and 8 gigabytes the press samples had a
toggleable v bios where we could switch
between 4 &amp;amp; 8 even though the card
physically has 8 it appears that a lot
of the early retail samples also have
this and so you can do the same sort of
modified flashing procedure that we do
to get it all functional you can see in
gpu-z we've got a 4 gigabyte card and
you need a utility called ati flash need
version 2 7 for all the link in the
description below for where to download
that once you extract it the tool we
want is ATI win flash exe when you open
it it will always to do it as a launch
it as administrator when you launch it
as administrator and open it you'll get
this dialog and this allows us to load
images or save an existing image so I
would always recommend saving your
existing image no matter what I have a
folder called roms I'm going to save it
there so we've got an 8 gigabyte one I'm
going to save this as 4 gigabyte retail
card this will take a moment it'll save
give it some time let it do its thing
okay so ROM saved the file and now if
you want to load an image you click load
image and you're going to need obviously
an 8 gigabyte image to make this work so
if you already have an 8 gigabyte card
if you have two cards for crossfire or
something or what you just have an extra
one you can use this program to save the
8 gigabyte ROM from your other card you
swap the cards physically and then you
load and program the ROM into the 4
gigabyte card if you do not have that
luxury and you're working off things on
the internet you can download an 8
gigabyte rom from places online
I believe techpowerup has one of theirs
posted we may build the BIOS repository
in the future but download one from them
that will click it
so you can see here we've got 8 gigabyte
rom in there
click program and that will flash the V
bios at this point if you have
physically multiple chips you really
really should check that before you
flash but if you have the multiple the
the 8 chips for vram then this will work
and you'll unlock effectively an 8
gigabyte card so here's the the warnings
warning number one if you do this even
with a card that has eight chips for V
RAM for memory it could break it might
not work it might be slow so you if if
you go through this procedure and it's a
success you want to restart and then
test in games validate make sure the
memory speed is maybe not the frequency
it should be and if all looks good then
you were successful the other risk is if
you have a four gigabyte card and maybe
this is in the future from when we film
the video and there are actually cards
with lower density or capacity the RAM
modules it will still look like eight
chips on the PCB but they might just be
a lower density if that's the case if
that's where the manufacturing goes in
the future there's a risk of causing
some damage but it really just depends
on how the V BIOS is programmed and how
how you load it onto the card so those
are the disclaimers kind of you want a
decent idea of what you're doing before
you do this but that is the process of
flashing v bios on the AMD radeon RX 480
and if you want to go back we can go
backwards as well and I would advise
restarting before doing that but yeah so
reboot the system to take effect yes we
understand that if I want to go back at
reboot click load image go to roms grab
the 4 gigabyte ROM and that would put us
back to where we were in the event that
flashing to 8 gigabytes breaks the card
or slows it down we can just throw back
to the 4 gigabyte model and that's it so
I believe doing this will will void your
warranty I'm not 100% positive that's
normally the case that depends on your
manufacturer you buy from and aiv
partners and things like that and if
they have multi BIOS but totally at your
own risk so good luck play around let us
know how it works out for you and as
always subscribe for more
like this hit the page round like the
postal video helps out directly and I'll
see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
