hardware news recap for the week this
week includes the word cryogenic so
Intel working on a cryogenic way for
over more future-looking technology but
really cool to talk about ddr5
investments being made by SK Hynix we've
been talking about these for a while now
but it's getting more serious as time
goes on ice lake rumors for a June
launch and low-end touring options could
be coming later this year not that
surprising but one of them does include
a GTX 16:50 continuing and video set
naming scheme and then finally GN we
have a trip to Taiwan and China coming
up but this is not Computex this time so
we'll be leaving within a couple days
here when this video goes live or might
be gone by the time the video goes live
so andrew and i will be in asia working
on factory tours and we'll talk about
that as well
before that this video is brought to you
by iFixit and the manta driver kit the
iFixit manta driver kit is built out as
a generalized tool for repairs of all
types with a focus on game console
repairs by including those strange
proprietary bits phone repair bits
laptop repair bits and more the Betts a
driver kit includes tri Wayne bits
spanners positive Drive game bits torch
Security bits and everything else for
general tech repair click the link below
to learn more
dodge ahau judge or moral woman to Ty
Bay hood don't go con wanton so this
weekend we are flying to Taiwan and
China really looking at some factories
they're doing some factory tours with
several of the companies that you all
know and like or maybe dislike their
products should be pretty fun we do this
typically around Computex this time
we're going a bit earlier and I know I
can say for fact we're visiting a few
board partners we are visiting EVGA and
Taiwan for example we'll be seeing them
and hopefully kingpin so you might have
them on camera will see and should have
some really fun projects with him as
well and then we'll be visiting
factories for I don't know which ones I
can name and can't but for sure I can
say we will be visiting factories for at
least one to two board partners and I am
pretty sure we're gonna have videos we
can publish on them so you'll be able to
see some stuff about modern videos from
us on how video cards how other boards
are made hopefully and we have some old
stuff but things have changed a bit on
the lines of the last few years so we
show that and then some videos on some
case cooling maybe power component
manufacturing as well so definitely if
you're not subscribed to make sure you
are check back regularly over the next
two weeks or so we'll be there and
publishing content and hopefully we'll
see how well I mean YouTube and
firewalls and China might be a bit of a
challenge but we'll see so yeah check
back and I think other than that you
will probably want to see the KP content
so kingpin I'm not a hundred percent
sure what we're doing yet but I do have
an idea and some of it might involve
like custom mods from him or custom
equipment from him to make mods in a
sort of automatic fashion so we'll see I
was instructed to bring the most
expensive processor I have and hopefully
he will not destroy it I think should be
a lot of fun so make sure you check back
and then also very quick just mention
for those of you who saw the stream with
Joe step on Z when he joined me on
stream a couple of people made up the
captain overclock character which was
supposed to be a combination of I
suppose my sullivan of joe and we have
some fanart
i think two people may be submitted fan
art of captain overclock and we'll just
put those on screen so thank you for
sending those in we we got a good good
laugh out of them and they're extremely
talented pieces of art so thank you for
sending those in and we did get in touch
with people and offer some free merch
one of you turned it down but if you do
want it let me know in the future so
first real news item here other than the
trip to taipei and and china is the
cryogenic wafer prober which is intel's
new tool for quantum chips and actually
maybe we can for the editors here maybe
we can get a shot of our own waferpro
where we actually have one it's not a
cryogenic one but we have a wafer per
over that that we picked up from one of
the fabs when it was retired so i can
show you what one of those looks like
for the sort of older method of probing
wafers this one that was different this
is built in collaboration between Intel
boof blue first I think and a four a
four I'm not sure how to pronounce the
name but it is built in collaboration
with these companies it's a big step
forward for mainstream
quantum chip production and it allows
for testing of qubits before they're
manufactured this is similar to how
regular silicon transistors are tested
and validated before going into further
production steps and obviously into the
chip itself so currently quantum chips
are tested at at very low temperatures
and they're tested at these low
temperatures for potentially several
months to validate that it works and
after the manufacturing process the is
when the testing occurs for quantum
chips as opposed to regular silicon
being assessed sort of within the
manufacturing within the fabrication
process in a matter of hours or less
depending on the complexity of the
design so hours or less versus months
for quantum chips and this is supposed
to resolve some of that issue of time
and the new cryogenic wafer prober it
looks like low-level manufacturing level
testing will be much quicker with
correction of errors in production as
opposed to after production and it's a
bigger step towards pushing quantum
computing closer to volume production
there's a quote here from dr. Jim Clark
director of quantum hardware at Intel
who said quote so far the past year
Intel has worked with blue freeze and
afford to combine our expertise and
build a fast electrical characterization
tool that can operate in the quantum
regime we hope that by designing this
tool the industry can use it to
accelerate the progress of quantum
computing the cryogenic wafer prober
will reside at Intel's Oregon campus
which as we've reported is getting major
up fits we've talked about this last few
weeks now so Oregon campus will have it
to allow scientists more accurately test
the qubits on the 300 millimeter wafers
down to temperatures of only a few
Kelvin so according to early testing and
quote the tool has a novel ability to
collect high volume cryogenic data and
create a statistical correlation of the
increase in turn-on voltage between room
temperature and cryogenic temperature
with this tool Intel will be able to
speed a feed back into the silicon spin
qubit fabrication line and accelerate
quantum computing research and
development and quantum computing of
course still a very new field not one
that we know very much about but one
that is very interesting to follow so
in towns got a newsroom post if you want
some more information quotes on that but
not a ton of really technical details
just yet
next one SK Hynix fab investments and
the first ddr5 chip we've talked about
this one before
despite DRAM prices being on the decline
as we reported last week this is good
news for our section of the industry SK
Hynix remains optimistic that at some
point business will once again be
booming and so what SK Hynix is doing
right now is investing or preparing to
invest 107 billion dollars in for
fabrication plants across South Korea
additionally 49 million dollars will be
set aside for upgrading existing
facilities just some pocket change from
SK Hynix the company plans to spread its
financial outlay over the next 10 years
and this is as it expects growth for
DRAM to increase with thanks to AI and
deep learning applications in other SK
Hynix news the company recently DS held
its first ddr5 chip we've talked about
these in the past the ddr 5 6400 chip is
a 16 gigabit part and it is supposed to
operate at 6400 mega transfers per
second with a voltage of at one point
one volts pretty good reduction over the
previous ddr4 modules the memory is
produced using SK Hynix is second
generation 10 nanometer class of
fabrication process and according to the
company a hynix chip designer dong-hyun
Kim said that SK Hynix has to implement
a new delay it locked loop or a DLL that
uses a phase rotator and an injection
locked oscillator as well as a modified
forward feedback equalization or FF II
circuit and apparently in plain English
these additions are supposed to ensure
reliability of operation at the higher
frequencies and offset clock related
issues associated with those high
frequencies so we'll hopefully at some
point we'll get a chance to speak with
some of the engineers about what these
words mean in the sequence that they are
in because frankly this is not stuff
we're very familiar with that at a super
low level so we're hoping to talk to
some of them at some point but for now
DDR 5 is still on the horizon the spec
has been ratified for a while now and
it's just a matter of
in a platform and then getting chips and
modules to mass production separately in
terms of DRAM pricing typically you see
this cycle in the DRAM market and this
is just going off-script a bit here but
typically you see a cycle where as
investment into fabrication plants and
technology Rises the price of DRAM will
also in a latent fashion also rise so be
a bit delayed but it will rise as well
and the traditional reasoning for that
is because the companies are not
investing as much of their money into
supply so there's not as much oversupply
like we have right now which is kind of
bad thing for them anyway and so instead
investing money into technology and that
in result drives down the supply
available as demand remains at least the
same if not rising and so you end up
with the prices going back up so prices
are on a decline right now but if all
the companies start focusing their
investment into technology and thus
drive down their supply the cost per
gigabyte as an average will go up and
that is a historical trend that has been
true for for at least a decade so so
that is probably what's gonna happen
here all the companies start invest and
there's only three big DRAM suppliers so
if they all do this at the same time
then that's what will happen the price
they'll go up if one of them decides to
break rank and produce oversupply and
undercut the rest of them then obviously
that's good for us and that's kind of
how the market should work but doesn't
always next up rumors ice lake in june
intel's next architecture or next
processors according to leaked to lenovo
documents intel's most frequently kerr
of documents that appeared on the / r /
synced pad subreddit apparently it's a
thing it must be a fun place intel's
wall delayed 10 nanometer ice lake could
appear as early as June of this year
which is really not all that surprising
but it would be a bit ahead of the intel
holiday 2019 projection from earlier if
it happens so this is still sort of a
rumor but it's also leaked documents
from Lenovo M&amp;amp;O goes down this several
times in Thailand Nvidia over the past
two or three years now and they've
typically been accurate so of the
documents
it indicates that lenovo will be
refreshing its x1 yoga line with ice
lake core i5 and i7 parts and these new
models will allegedly arrive in june of
2019 meanwhile in August of 2019 lenovo
is planning a refresh for its x1 carbon
line and this should also again use ice
lake processors and as with all the
leaks and rumors usual prescribed
amounts of salt but this one you could
probably probably prescribe a little bit
less low and Taurean options could be
coming later this year and we have I
guess will bundle one other news item in
here that's kind of brief let's start
with with the one that I just saw before
starting the video there's a gtx 1650
rumored to come out and i think that
comes from a tweet from an industry
analyst of sorts so there's a 1650
that's rumored and we'll put his tweet
up on the screen it's supposed to have 4
gigabytes of memory has supposed to be
below the rumored 1616 on t Ice Cube and
we have yet to see a 2 gigabyte model of
the touring GPUs so we'll see if that
that sort of memory capacity dies off
with time but following the release of
the Elan awaited and rumored 1660 Ti
digit times is now reporting that Nvidia
is planning to further flesh out its
during low end and digit time says quote
NVIDIA is set to release two more medium
and low end graphics cards in the second
quarter of 2019 as part of its efforts
to enhance its presence in the GPU
market and dampen competition according
to the article and we'll have a link to
them in the show notes below the 1660
should be a march 15 release in theory
the 1650 would be April 30th and the
minimum price tags will be 230 $180
respectively and then specifically here
and and sort of interesting the report
states that Nvidia wishes to keep AMD's
market share under 25% and preferably
under 20% if possible according to the
digitized reporting now presumably and
video would also like to keep AMD's
market share close to 0% so none of this
is really that surprising but supposedly
the new Torian options are
tended to put pressure specifically on
an these mid-range low-end cards and
also Vegas 64 from the top with some of
the more recent launches like the the
2070 2060 things like that so and he's
gonna have pressure now from the 570 up
to Vega 64 at this point and then Radeon
7 might be doing the opposite applying
some pressure to RTX 2080 and we'll be
talking about that part more in the
future
next up del del NT 20 legacy of good
plan del has never been that great at
making these types of names del is proud
to announce its ability to recycle 2
billion pounds of e ways so del is ahead
of its target originally a plan to
recycle 2 billion pounds of e-waste by
2020 so as the del newsroom
announcements and PR statements imply it
looks like del is working with some
companies to convert diesel engine
exhaust into printing ink sort of an
interesting investment there and this is
from the vice president of engineering
with client Solutions Group at Dell and
the head of Dell TDC or Taiwan
development Design Center as I call it
now so della is also allegedly the first
and maybe the only vendor actual like
vendor of parts to recycle gold from
motherboards and reuse it Dell also
continues to collect the recycled
electronic materials and adapt them to
its product lines and the company is
aiming to see 100 million recycled
materials by 2019 by April actually so
some good news I guess on the
reusability front and sustainability of
computer hardware and electronics next
one spaceborne that computer is still
operational
after 530 days being stranded in space
the pair of HPE Linux based servers
collectively known as the space born
computer were sent up to the
international space station in August of
2017 now after more than 530 days up in
space and three months after the planned
October 2018 return the computers are
still operational the servers which are
capable of super computer processing
power were part of an experiment to see
how durable they would be in space quote
without specialist treatment HPE senior
content
architect Adrian Kaz Bergen told BBC
that they could return in June of 2019
and that they have mostly functioned
without issue according to a Kaz Bergen
though there have been some issues with
the redundancy power supply and the
solid state drives however they are
corrected by the autonomous management
software and were part of the experiment
HPE is currently working with NASA in
preparation for the plans of 2030 Mars
flight as well as working with Elon
Musk's space X which also just recently
got green lights from NASA to do some
more launches and then the final news
item is one that you've likely seen by
the time you're seeing our video but
might as well throw our hat in the ring
USB if' announces its new USB 3.2
terrible standard and let's just kind of
do the same thing as I'm sure all the
other news reports are doing go back
through history a little bit USB 3.0
meant USB 3.0 originally and it later
was rebranded to be USB 3.1 gen2 on so
the dot o was dropped there is
technically no more USB 3.0 it doesn't
exist it became 3.1 Gen 1 no change to
the spec and and then there were say USB
3.1 gen2 is a bit faster speed and kind
of a significant enough way that it
might have deserved a different version
number or something and then now there's
a USB 3.2 so it's not the 3.1 gen2
that's already a thing and it's off 3.1
gen 3 its 3.2 and here's the good part
USB 3.0 which became USB 3.1 gen2 on is
now becoming USB 3.0 gen 1 and then USB
3.2 sorry
3.1 gen2 excuse me that was an egregious
error 3.1 gen2 is now being rebranded as
USB 3.2 Jen
- of course that's what you do and then
the last one is USB 3.2 Gen 2 by 2 or 2
X 2 if you prefer which is apparently I
guess because USB 3.2 has double the
throughput of USB 3.1 gen2 which is now
USB 3.0 Gen 2 I think that's right yes
yes yeah 3.1
becomes 3.2 10t yes so then 2x2 is the
doubling of throughput of that and so
Eric Hamilton wrote writes our news
recaps here and sometimes has some some
pretty funny quips in here and this one
was just simply to avoid confusing
consumers parentheses too late the USP I
have suggested the use of marketing
terms such as super speed USB
parentheses USB 3.0 on SuperSpeed 10
gigabit per second USB 3 2010 2 and
SuperSpeed 20 gigabits per second USB
3.2 Gen 2 by 2 and to kind of echo some
of the concerns from our peers in the
industry one of the main ones is as a
consumer just an average consumer not
most of you average consumer who is
trying to get a faster not USB to device
and get up to speed now is going to be
sorting through content how-to guides or
explanations of what's three point over
is three point one and all of that
information is now wrong so because the
USB if' has rebranded everything
everything we've ever written in any
anything anyone else has ever written
using the old names 3.0 3.1 and so forth
that's all now incorrect and obsolete
because the names have changed which is
just completely insane so I am positive
us pif has received the memo ah
and Linus - give him a shout-out also
talked about this and tech tech linked
and I'm sure they received the memo I'm
also sure that's not a change and if it
does it'll probably be worse so anyway
that's it for this week we look forward
to reporting on USB 3.3 gen 1 through 3
which will be 3.0 3.1 gen 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 point
2 gen 1 &amp;amp; 2 in the next week's episode
and check back when we're in China we
will have in Taiwan we'll have a lot of
cool content there subscribe for more go
