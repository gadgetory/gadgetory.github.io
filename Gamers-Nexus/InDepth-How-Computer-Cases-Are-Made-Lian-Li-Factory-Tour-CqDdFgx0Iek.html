hundreds of thousands of dollars to
design and develop but the machinery
used to make those cases cost millions
of dollars and a recent tour of Lian
Lee's case manufacturing facility in
Taiwan we got to see firsthand the
advanced and largely autonomous
hydraulic presses laser cutters
automatic shaping machines and other
equipment used to make a case some of
these tools apply hundreds of thousands
of pounds of force to case paneling
upwards of 1 million Newtons and others
will use high-voltage equipment to spot
weld pieces to aluminum paneling today
we're taking a walk through from the
start to finish process of how a case is
made before that this video is brought
to you by thermal Grizzly's high-end
thermal paste and liquid metal thermal
Grizzly's cryo knot is an affordable
high quality thermal compound that
doesn't face some of the aging
limitations of other pastes on the
market cryo knot has a thermal
conductivity of 12.5 watts per meter
Kelvin focuses on endurance is easy to
spread and isn't electrically conductive
making it safe to use on GPU dies
thermal grizzly also makes conductor not
liquid metal which we've used to drop 20
degrees off some temperatures than our
dee-lighted test
bio tube at the link in the description
below the first steps of case
manufacturing at the leonie facility is
to design the product once this process
is done that CAD files go to the factory
across the street which Lian Leone's to
be turned into a case in a simplified
canonical view of the manufacturing
process the first step is again design
then raw materials and preparation of
raw materials followed by either a laser
cutter for basic shapes or a press for
tooled punchouts
then after that there's washing grinding
flattening welding and anodizing for
aluminum paneling let's start with step
1 the laser cutters and hydraulic
presses Lian Lee uses a laser cutter for
defining wide sweeping designs and
shapes in thicker aluminum paneling
examples might be rounded borders of
maybe a 2 millimeter thick piece of
aluminum cutting out panels from raw
sheet metal or even cutting the Boroff
an aluminum borders that Lee only makes
and these are also made on this very
laser cutter in Taiwan Lee Ann Lee is a
desk PC as another example is largely
made on this laser cutter the laser
cutter is attached to a liquid nitrogen
tank that's the size of a conversion van
he's primarily to boost the cutting
power of the laser for dense metals the
byproduct is some cooling of equipment
for continuous use but it's mostly a
means for boosting the power each of
these machines cost right around 1
million dollars USD but there's an
ongoing maintenance cost for refilling
the nitrogen tank Lian Lee uses
approximately two full tanks of this
size per month requiring routine charges
alternatively and directly across from
the laser cutter case manufacturing can
also use hydraulic presses for
functionally stamping out the shapes and
the panels these presses are configured
to punch holes in the case and in
several locations simultaneously making
them significantly faster than a laser
cutter for complex designs an example of
a design more suitable to a hydraulic
press than the laser would be a mesh
ventilated side panel mesh ventilation
requires dozens of small holes with a
laser cutter you'd have one laser
cutting a full circle for each mesh hole
which would then exclude the unwanted
metal for each individual hole it takes
forever to do and manufacturing costs
would skyrocket as a result although
fundamentally is similar in concept a
hydraulic press makes the most sense
here these particular units cost
approximately 1 million USD each and Lee
Anne Lee uses several of them to keep
the factory operating efficiently just
behind these machines is a large washing
machine for cases case panels and other
metal components like drive sleds need
to be individually washed before
progressing in production this is
because the previous machines all use
lubricants mostly oils to keep the
presses running that lubricant can get
onto the paneling which would eventually
be made a permanent blemish if allowed
to continue without a wash this giant
washing machine uses a conveyor belt and
a pressure washer on the far end of the
conveyor belt
a worker straps componentry like drive
sleds down to the belts for washing as
it progresses through the washer the
parts get pressure washed by internal
hosing with a waterfall forming
underneath to filter and recycle the
water where possible this reduces waste
of the water and also reduces cost at
the other end of the line the pieces are
spat out into a container and then move
to the appropriate assembly area the
next machine is the grinder which is a
simple but interesting two-step process
for finish
pieces several grindstones are
positioned along this machine and are
used for ridding of sharp imperfections
on the panel edges this smooths down the
panel to perfection a panel is fed in by
workers grinded down by the stones and
then fed out the other end
the workers then begin step 2 where they
restart the process but use a non woven
cotton spool to create hair line brushes
in the aluminum the result is that ever
noticeable brushed aluminum faceplate
water is used for lubricating this
machine and is recycled to reduce waste
and cost the machine goes through tens
of tons of water per hour and does so at
a relatively high pressure as seen here
by the skull and crossbones next a panel
can be taken to the automatic welding
machine to arc weld the panel clips onto
cases these are an iconic Lian Li design
and our socketable balls that clip into
the chassis frame in this example Lian
Li is manufacturing the N case n one
side panels where each panel takes
upwards of 30 seconds to outfit with
just the mounting joints so no wonder
the n1 is expensive when considering
that the machine time carries
significant cost
every second is spent on making
something like an n1 panel it's time
that could be spent making a more mass
volume case and so that time must be
paid for somewhere for this machine a
small joint is first secured to the
panel via impact where a Lian Li
exclusive pin solution ensures security
once impact hammered into place the
panel is ready to get zapped by the
welder it's a satisfying pop and a burst
of light but the end result is a secure
mounting joint for side panels the
machine works autonomously but has
personnel oversight each weld runs off
of 300,000 volts but we're told that it
doesn't need much current to secure
these pins to a flat side panel and so
as relatively low amperage once the
panel exits the welder the technician
manually grinds down the edges of each
ball joint to achieve smoothness finally
concluding it with a double check versus
a reference panel to ensure consistent
production runs and quality as for why
Lian Li goes to such overkill to
manufacture just a side panel mounting
joint we're told that the companies spec
for connection cycles is 3000 meaning
that you should be able to remove or
socket this panel three thousand times
prior to possible failure of a jaw
in other words if he restock you the
side panel twice a day for four years
you might eventually encounter a weld
joint failure after this the same
technician can take the panel to another
hydraulic press this one is capable of
exerting 1.1 million newtons of force
and is used for these same punching
process as described earlier but it
might be useful if a panel needs a
second pass some panel designs require
multiple passes to ensure structural
integrity of the metal during
manufacturing the folding machine is
also used in nearby deployed for exactly
what its name indicates stamped or
laser-cut metal sheets are set near by
the folding machine and then can be fed
into the machine to bend case paneling
suspect this is useful for unibody
designs or for more traditional designs
where something just needs to be bent
for the last part of this Factory a
customized world's only thread boring
solution exists near the exit and
entrance this final machine drills
threaded and unthreaded holes into metal
panels the machine can drill up to an
impressive 60 holes at once but the
drill bits have to be kept lubricated
and cooled somehow rather than spraying
solvent all over the bits as used in
most machines the Lian Li custom-made
solution brilliantly allows the bits to
drill into the panel pass through it and
enter an oil tank for cooling and
cleaning on each press this allows for
an efficient solution that doesn't
require more moving parts and enables a
total customization of the panels made
on this machinery next we venture across
the street to visit Lian these other
factories the second Factory is back in
the main office and it's shared with
designers engineers and executives this
Factory is only and used 5 to 10 days
per month but Lian Li is hoping to ramp
up production soon to put the factory
into heavier use the first machine in
the factory is a flattener almost like a
giant rolling pin and workers use this
to feed sheets in to flatten obviously
in the demonstration they gave us a
sheet of raw aluminium was used but the
machine typically works with punched out
materials to counter the chance of
multiple locations of applied force
warping the metal the flattener has a
limitation of 3 millimeter sheets but
this is plenty thick for the aluminum
that Lian Lee uses for their case design
once flattened the sheet is ready for
anodizing and is near the end of the
process
however this Factory also has several
additional machines that we get to see
before the flatteners ever used one of
these is another line of hydraulic
presses which we're punching out drive
sleds during our visit to the factory
the presses have motion sensors for
safety and will stop instantly if they
detect what might be hand movement
nearby but will otherwise operate
largely autonomously from raw sheet
metal to produce small components that
get used in cases like again drive sleds
or PCIe slot covers unused raw materials
can be recycled to reduce cost and waste
land Lee has eight of these automatic
shaping machines as they call them and
an additional 11 s nc110 presses with
SMT 2 to 20 presses on the other side
the SMC presses jointly process 350 case
components per hour with 10 days worth
of processing per month and each press
can apply 200 tons of pressure some
apply 250 tons of pressure and they all
work in two rounds or more of pressing
this line wasn't operational during our
visit but they typically work
autonomously press a sheet and then use
suction cups to automatically move the
metal to the next machine for another
round of pressing multiple rounds are
used to increase the distribution of
applied forces such that warps of the
metal are less likely to occur but if
they do the flattening machine can be
used to fix that each of these machines
has a tool you've likely heard us talk
about case tooling before and this is
where the cost really comes into play
for cases tools are made often as one
offs or very limited runs using a CNC
one tool that we saw in particular was
for the a 75 case and costs upwards of
12,000 dollars to make that particular
tool that we were shown this isn't even
useful for the entire case only for one
specific panel typical tooling cost is
two thousand to ten thousand dollars per
tool and each case needs multiple of
them an individual case can cost
hundreds of thousands of dollars in the
past other companies have showed us
cases that had tooling costs exceeding
six hundred thousand dollars USD or even
more in some cases raw material cost is
only a few hundred dollars for these but
the CNC time is expensive every minute
on the CNC especially for multiple
revisions this time that could be used
making a sellable product rather than
something to make more products later
leonie's engineers
spend about a month of revisions on the
tools which of course also has the cost
and that's not counting the initial
design period tools are mounted to the
underside of the hydraulic press
machines and are used to stamp panels
out and despite being made of steel
these tools can still be fragile the
tools have to be grounded and static
charges has to be removed prior to use
as a static charge can suck up the
panel's and break the tools
after all this Lindley sends the panels
upstairs for anodizing
assembly and shipping at which point
consumers can buy the finished product
and that's how the cases are made in
Lian Leah's factory this is all done in
Taiwan but additional facilities are
being made in China and of course we've
toured previous facilities like NZXT s
in shenzhen and the inland Factory in
Tao yen subscribe for more as always and
remember to go to stored at Karen's
Nexus dotnet to backorder one of our
anti-static mod mats actually not used
in the grounding process of making case
components we just ordered another round
