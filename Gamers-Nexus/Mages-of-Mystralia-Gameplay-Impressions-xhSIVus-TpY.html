where I saw one of the coolest games
I've seen in quite a while and that was
mages of mist rally uh it's a bit out in
terms of release date but pretty darn
cool and worth looking at this game as a
unique art style but it is definitely
very heavily inspired by Wind Waker in
terms of mechanics it takes a little bit
of the wizard major element where you
mix and match different elements of the
world fire ice water what-have-you and
create spells but it's not like magicka
where it's just total chaos there's
actually somewhat of an intellectual
object to this spell creation as well
and we'll get to that in a moment
all of this PAX East 2016 coverage is
brought to you by a cyber powerpc who
were awarded PC magazine's readers
choice award for best gaming desktop so
that stated majors of mr. alia has some
pretty cool mechanics that I want to
open with and the main one is the
creation of spells spells consists of a
few different components one is the
element that would be the element of the
world as I said fire ice water things
like that and then the next one is
behavior and these are controlled by
runes so there's different behaviors
that a spell can have and as an example
those might be movement so you maybe
create an orb of fire for instance and
then you apply something to that Borba
fire like moving forward very simple
right so you've just created a fireball
that's what you've done but here's the
cool part these are used not just for
combat but also for puzzle solving
within the game and that is where some
of the legends of Zelda influence comes
in for the borealis team making the game
as an example there were torches that
you could lighten Zelda these were
pretty key but basic puzzles to solve in
mages of Australia they still have torch
puzzles almost as a a callback to Zelda
an homage but the way they light here is
a bit more unique say there's a torch to
open a gate you can't get to the torch
physically there's a some kind of object
blocking your physical path and you've
got to get a spell over there to light
the torch if it's not a straight shot
one thing that's pretty cool that can be
done is within the spell
system the spellbook effectively you can
apply runes where the fireball will go
straight and then take a left turn or a
right turn go around a corner go around
the object
maybe it's more complex and it has to
turn back and go straight again but that
can be done with the runes within the
game so there are 30 different behaviors
that can be applied to the spells and
then a couple of core elements the
behaviors offer things other than
movements you can do all kinds of area
of effect impact type stuffs send things
flying homing runes are another one
there are awed ments as well so instead
of adding just a behavior like moving or
homing you can modify an existing one
and that would be where instead of
moving forward you might append an
argument to tell it to move faster or in
an arc or randomize its movement for
example if you wanted to create a
lightning spell that arced from one
enemy to the other you might do some
kind of random movement to just create a
massive chaotic area of effect type of
spell in terms of story story is pretty
critical here so the major element is
explained that's the core heart of the
game and they actually designed this
spell crafting system before even
starting with the story so they worked
on it they created a system and then
they said what type of games do we want
to make to match this to and that's when
the borealis team borealis games
contacted Ed Greenwood whom some of you
may know for his work on Forgotten
Realms certainly a very well known book
series and D&amp;amp;D series
so Forgotten Realms was created by Ed
Greenwood he has agreed to write the
story from Australia and as I understand
it he's even gone a bit above and beyond
and has written the basis of sequels for
them if this game happens to succeed but
that's of course looking very far in the
future so ed Greenwood is on board for
the story he is writing the backstory
for the characters for the world he's
writing something quests so the dialogue
all this stuff and within the game the
story I we didn't learn a whole lot
about but one thing I do know is there's
the sort of standard fare of towns and
villages you can visit and this was
pretty important to me they don't have
just normal quest givers so these hubs
don't function like something where
someone's got an exclamation
point above their head you feel
compelled to gather that quest and
complete it even if you don't want to
that doesn't exist here instead the NPC
is just kind of talk casually with you
and if they happen to have a quote
unquote quest we'll call it just for
ease they might drop a very obvious hint
for example man I really wish I didn't
leave my pitchfork in those woods over
there and so that's a pretty obvious you
know hey you can go grab this guy's
pitchfork and read it back to him maybe
he'll give you something but the idea
that borealis had was to offer some sort
of side quest without sort of making the
player feel as if they have to
completely sideline their gameplay and
deviate from what they actually were
doing originally before getting
interrupted with a side quest that may
actually be useless in the scheme of
things so that's a pretty good design
approach to a game I think I I'm not a
big fan of these quest hubs and these
things that MMOs have gone a bit crazy
with these days so I do like hearing
that the art style has a really nice
sort of pastel finish to it it's not
very strong it's not cartoony and
cel-shaded and it's it's generally
unoffensive we'll put it that way
on mass but I certainly did like it
myself so arts looking good the city and
design looks good the story is sort of
the one thing where I feel confident
that it will actually come through
pretty well almost no matter what
because that Greenwood of course he can
write bad things anyone can but it just
it sounds like they're in good shape
right now
so mages in Australia they're looking at
about 15 hours of gameplay they do
internal speedruns by the developers the
fastest anyone's completed is 5 hours in
those side quests no dawdling about and
this is after one year of developments
they have one more year left of
development no release dates because
they're an indie game they don't really
want to give a date and then get crushed
by you know Dragon Age or something like
that so games expected to launch in
about a year quite a ways out look into
borealis games they are the developers
at Greenwood if you're interested in his
writing and then mages in Australia is
the game of course as this game
here's some level of completion or beta
or whatever
we will post content on it so before I
need pre-purchasing things like that do
check archons out and see if you think
you'd actually like it but I want to
bring everyone's attention to this one
because I do think it actually looks
pretty darn fun so that is mages of
Australia thank you for watching pay
channels commercial video you want to
