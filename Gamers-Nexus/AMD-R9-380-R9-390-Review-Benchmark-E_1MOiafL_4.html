dotnet and today we're talking about I
am these new 300 series the r9 380 and
r9 390 specifically are the cards we got
for review and we got these sapphire
versions of the cards they are called
nitro so this is sapphires new gaming
line of our 9 300 series r7 300 series
cards the review is already on the
website so we saw that great the article
and benchmarks and thorough benchmarks
and power benchmarks are all there and
we're gonna recap them here for the easy
buddy and so the r9 390 and r9 380 are
the same as the r9 290 and 280 with a
few very small but according to Andy
very noteworthy differences and those
would include a 50 megahertz clock rate
boost so you're boosting the core clock
by about 50 megahertz and that also
includes some power control and a couple
of other changes so just to recap where
we are in terms of specifications the
lineup
what's a refresh what's not here's a
chart of the specs of the new cards we
didn't get an r9 390x are seven three
sixty or r7 370 but I did get the r9 390
and r9 380 and if you look at the specs
here you'll see that they have the same
stream processor account that's
effectively the core count the clock
rates boosted about 50 megahertz to a
thousand megahertz for the r9 390 and
boosted into the 970 range for the r9
380 another 40 to 50 megahertz boost and
you'll see that the pixel rates and
textile rate are bolstered as well and
yet that's because these are calculated
dependent upon the core clock so for the
textile rate for instance your giggle
texels per second rating that is
calculated as a function of the core
clock multiplied by the TM use so you
multiply your texture map units by the
core clock and that gives you your
texels per second output which is shown
here as slightly higher than the
previous series in terms of price
strategy Andy is still trying to come in
a bit cheaper than their competitor and
the r9 380 is about a $200 card that's
the MSRP for reference the r9 280 the
previous model which was superseded by
the 285 the r9 280 is about a hundred
and seventy one hundred fifty depending
on rebates right now and the 285 is
about two hundred dollars 280x is a
little bit more than that the r9 390 the
new card is a $330 card MSRP that's
about a hundred dollars more than a post
rebate r9 290 do you know at the post
rebate there you get about 250 270
before rebates so still cheaper than the
new r9 390 but that's to be expected
with a new device you expect some
performance gain so you would also
expect to pay more money for it and the
r7 three sixty and r7 370 which I don't
have will be priced at 110 and 150
respectively those would be replacing
the 260 and 270 and in terms of what the
300 series is meant to do AMD bragged in
a call to the press that the r9 300
series is meant for gamers specifically
those who want to play at 14 40 and 14
so it's targeting that higher resolution
market which is something Nvidia is
begun doing also the company further
emphasized the importance of their 50
megahertz abuse to the clock and noted
that they spent the last years or months
at least working on power efficiency
changes and clock rate changes so this
50 megahertz performance boost in theory
is a little bit more than just
overclocking 50 megahertz but we'll test
that in the performance benchmarks
momentarily now normally in a video this
is where I update I wrote on the new GPU
architecture but in the case of the 300
series we're stalling the island's GPU
architecture so it's sort of just
refresh as rebadge --is as they're
called with some slight changes that are
improvements over the previous
iterations so just to recap everyone
bring everyone up to speed on what's
been going on the last few years the HD
7970 if you remember that card was based
on Tahiti it was a very powerful card
for its time the Tahiti card was
rebadged as an are 9 to 80 they are
effectively identical not perfectly
identical but pretty close and then the
r9 285 was
refresh of the 280 it's similar to the
280 but it uses an offshoot of the
architecture called Tonga Tonga has some
featured changes from the 280 and the
7970 it introduces about 3 years of
extra features from AMD so it's not a
huge architectural overhaul by any means
but VCE and some other things like that
have been changed into 285 the 285 also
brought with it things like UV SR which
has not yet been introduced to the 200
series it was supposed to be but hasn't
been yet so 285 has VSR and the 280 does
not that's where we stand with those the
300 series still Islands still the same
as the 200 in terms of architecture but
introduces again a few small changes so
along with some other things there's a
new framerate tuning protocol in the
software and the catalyst drivers you
can say I want to cap my framerate at 80
fps if it ever is gonna exceed 80 fps
then cap it and that allow is basically
the GPU to throttle and Limited's power
consumption this isn't something
practically that will get a lot of use
unfortunately because the time is when
it will exceed the limiter framerate for
most people you probably want to cap it
at like 120 if you're on a faster
monitor the times that exceeds that are
gonna be in cutscenes or things like
that they will be very limited and the
power consumption saved is is basically
non-consequential compared to just a GPU
architecture overhaul the Sapphire cards
we looked at are part of the new nitro
line made by sapphire and this nitro
branding initiative is sapphires
approach to making the 300 series cards
an emphatic statement for where they
believe Andy currently rests in the
markets so sapphire and AMD both take a
similar narrative their narrative is
that the 300 cards are for gamers who
don't care about extra features they
don't care about things like maybe CUDA
acceleration in Photoshop where you
would benefit from CUDA cores and they
don't the buyers of these cards would
not necessarily care about the lower TDP
they're ok with a 275 watt card and
something that runs a little bit hotter
so that's sort of the
is that AMD thinks their devices are
perfectly fine for the raw framerate
output that they provide for the price
they are listed at and that's not
necessarily right or wrong but that's
that's how it's presented to us as
journalists so I wanted to convey that
to you all through AMD rather than
editorializing it and that's where the
the market positioning is performance is
really what matters most at the top
level and we drill down into wattage and
and heat and unfortunately the
performance of these 300 series cards is
very disappointing we'll get the drivers
momentarily and a completely different
issue but the performance gain is about
three to six percent if you already have
a 200 series card you can see in these
charts there's really not much reason to
upgrade especially for the price premium
because obviously you've got to pay
whatever you paid originally at a
minimum and then the extra cost for the
new series so if you have a 280 there's
no reason to buy 380 if you have a 290
there's no reason to buy 390 and so
forth and r9 290 is 90 80 70 at a
minimum cheaper than the r9 390 right
now that might change as fine demand
changes but it's cheaper and it performs
pretty much the same as the 390 so if
you must buy one of these cards if you
have to buy an AMD device and you're
looking at this price range I would say
go buy the 290 or 280 or 200 series
equivalent to the 300 device you're
looking at because the price is just
substantially better the performance is
similar and it might even put you into
another price class up if you can bump
down to the 200 series and as sort of
disappointing as the performance is for
the 300 series the drivers are much more
disappointing we actually could not use
the newest drivers andy has a new driver
set called 15.15 we could only use these
for the 300 series cards they did not
work with the 200 series cards that
should be noted we can install them they
just didn't work at all and we had
driver installation issues with 300 so I
had to completely wipe all the existing
drivers I had to sort of nuke the driver
install base and then make sure I
installed only the 15.15 are only the
15.5 whatever the previous beta is for
the 200 series so
just don't cleanly over right which is
okay because we can work around that
what's not okay is the flickering that I
discovered on the r9 390 primarily I
think I saw it on 380 as well but
definitely on the 390 we saw a lot of
black flickering and this happened on
two types of monitors I have not
monitors g-sync and monitors without
g-sync so basically all monitors and the
flickering was basically just two times
per minute at a minimum for a minimum of
five seconds each times for ten seconds
per minute and our testing we would see
flickering and it would be several
seconds at a time
screen would turn black he'd come back
turned black come back and sometimes
that was associated with a framerate
drop sometimes it was not and when it
was not that's where you can't just rely
on the raw FPS numbers in the chart
because the FPS looks fine but in
reality is actually unplayable on the
390 in most games that we tested and on
the test top because of this black
flickering that totally interrupts tree
game experience and this is an extension
of a problem Andy's had lately where
there drivers just are really sorely
lacking and if Andy were to spend a year
or two years working on anything right
now I would much rather they fix their
drivers than refresh cards I know it
doesn't really work that way you have
software teams of hardware team but in
terms of division of resources the
drivers sorely need updating the last
major release was in December that was
the last stable launch that was last
with all certified launch and then we've
had beta drivers thankfully for GTA 5
came out almost immediately basically
immediately day one or day zero and the
witcher 3 had drivers come out shortly
after the witcher launched it was
following a sort of quote-unquote
controversy about game works and AMD had
drivers that needed to be updated so
it's been quite a while and that's the
major focal point for AMD at this point
going forward is driver fixes so that
they work more consistently on multiple
hardware configurations without this
flickering and things like that going on
because no matter how well these cards
perform if the drivers aren't working
with them if they're not cooperating it
really doesn't matter what the frame
rate is because you just can't play when
your screens turning black
that stated the 290 the 290x the 280 and
the 285 that we tested are all perfectly
fine we did not see this flickering
issue with the 290 X with a 280 the 280x
and they play fine the frame rates
slightly lower a couple percent but it's
very easy to overclock those cards by 50
megahertz and get a similar performance
gain not exactly the same because you
have some thermal gains as well but
pretty close effectively identical what
you're looking at now is a thermal chart
sapphire's thermals are very impressive
as much as I am these frame rate
performance is somewhat disappointing
for gains over the 200 series the
thermal performance of sapphires coolers
is good they've done a good job with
these coolers sapphires coolers keep the
known hot and e-chips at around 45
Celsius delta T over ambient beaten only
by these tricks 960 which is a much
cooler GPU consumes fewer watts so of
course it's going to be cooler and the
liquid cooled hybrid which is liquid
cooled and by the way we reviewed that
the article is on the website and the
video will be up shortly now for the
power chart the max system power low
this is peak system load of the r9 390
and r9 380 places the cards in the 260
and 340 ish watt range for system power
consumption this is total power
consumption when the GPU is under 100%
load from loopy and firestrike
benchmarks in terms of the verdict
unfortunately I just can't recommend the
300 series right now because the 200
series is so close in performance it's
cheaper currently at least and it
doesn't have the driver issues that we
saw in the 300 series I'm sure there's
will be resolved eventually but until
that point I can't recommend them and
feel confident in that recommendation
the 390 and 380 if they come down in
price if they're similar to the 200
cities in price sure they're fine buys
there's certainly an argument to be made
for raw performance output certainly an
argument to be made against levy lower
TDP of the Nvidia cards and favoring the
framerate output of AMD that's really up
to you to decide you need to look at
your system build list and say you know
am I looking for a low thermal system am
i building in a small form-factor box do
I need to keep the thermals down things
like that if you don't care about those
things
the AMD series is okay to look at but
then your next concern is drivers so
until the drivers are resolved in a
fashion that is more compatible
installation wise more compatible
flickering wise it's not a
recommendation I can push but the cards
are still a consideration in the future
as Andy iterates its drivers and of
course the fury cards will be coming out
shortly I think we're having a little
bit trouble securing those but I'm
working on it if I have to I'll buy one
myself
and we'll get a fury review online
hopefully that new feejee architecture
will be the overhaul that AMD needs to
get back into the game firmly and do
some head-to-head battling with Nvidia
the top range these battle at the
mid-range and the low end but they don't
have anything really fighting the 980ti
right now and that is a pretty serious
price point to get involved with because
then you get a halo effect so that is
AMD as it stands now the 300 series
