GPU technology conference as put on by
Nvidia and today Nvidia just unveiled in
official capacity their Titan X video
card this is a one-thousand-dollar video
card that is intended for single GPU
gaming solutions at high resolutions and
the card was originally teased at GDC
2015 which was about a week or two ago
and here we have the full specifications
the price we have benchmarks forthcoming
as soon as this event ends and it's it's
pretty interesting for a high-end
flagship card especially a Titan one and
we'll go over that momentarily so while
I'm talking here I'll splice in some
b-roll from the show floor just you can
check it out but the the main items with
the Titan X going over all the hard
specs are that it's got 3072 cuda cores
that's about a thousand more than the
GTX 980 which had 2048 on the GM to a4
chip and the Titan X is using a GM 200
ships so this is the new iteration of a
maxwell chip it is still using maxwell
it's also operating at 192 Gigot axles
per second for the texture filter rate
which is a technology I described on the
YouTube channel previously you can
search the channel for texture filter
rate for that information and it's got a
330 6.5 gigabyte per second memory
bandwidth so this memory bandwidth is
actually the same or very close to the
780 Ti which was released a generation
ago and it's much higher than the GTX
980 the reason for this in large part is
because nvidia has largely changed their
architecture between Kepler and Maxwell
Maxwell's cuda cores are about forty
percent more efficient in terms of power
per watt or performance per watt I
should say than Kepler so Maxwell forty
percent more efficient than Kepler
that's very important to note because
when comparing things like coup de coeur
counts it's not a linear comparison
between the two architectures with that
noted there are more ROPS and TM use on
the GTX Titan X than previously on the
980 it's got 12 gigabytes of video
memory and this is a
single bank effectively of twelve
gigabytes some video cards will
advertise 12 or 16 gig of ram but it's
actually two banks of six or two banks
of eight and either of those cases and
that's because those video cards have
two GPUs on a single card so it's a to
GPU single card solution in those
instances in the case of the Titan X it
is a single GPU single card solution
using the GM 200 chip and it's got all
12 gigabytes of memory reserved for that
single chip the main benefit of having
so much memory and such a large memory
interface which is 384 bits in this
instance with that 300 plus gigabyte per
second memory bandwidth is high
resolutions and pushing more pixels so
when you push more pixels what you what
I'm really talking about is running at a
4k resolution or multiple monitors at a
similarly high resolution and the Titan
acts is advertised by Nvidia as being a
high-end solution for 4k gaming that can
actually play games with a single GPU at
40 FPS or better in some instances and
I'll go over those benchmarks
momentarily you can see them on the
screen now earlier I said that the Titan
X is a little interesting and the reason
for this is because the Titan line has
traditionally been targeted at
researchers and scientists and people
doing simulations it's not quite the
same market as a quadro card for the the
Titans II for instance but the Titans II
was pushed as a high-end very expensive
research solution and it's fully double
precision enabled the Titan X which is
the new one don't get the mixed up is
not fully double precision enabled it is
actually 1 30 seconds the throughput of
a single precision for DP on the Titan X
and it's got seven teraflops of single
precision performance so the Titan X is
not being pushed as a research card it
is being pushed at a gaming and media
production card people who do media
production like we do accept that a
higher quality not in a hotel room on
YouTube will benefit from something like
a tight next because it is a semi
affordable at a thousand dollars
solution that's got a lot of processing
power
cuda cores 422 enabled applications like
adobe premiere the technology of the
titan x is effectively the same as what
premiered on the gtx 980 and previous
maxwell chips so it's supporting mfa
which is Nvidia's multiframe sampled
anti-aliasing alternative to MSAA it's a
bit more efficient and produces
effectively the same visual result it's
got vxg I or voxel global illumination
as they call it support for their time
warp technology for virtual reality and
all that stuff nothing has changed on
this front so you can check our GTX 980
review for that technology if you're
unfamiliar with any of it the Titan X is
marketed as being an overclocking
solution as well the TDP of the base
Titan X is 250 watts it runs at about a
thousand megahertz base clock so a bit
lower base clock than the GTX 980
thousand seventy five megahertz boost
clock much lower boost clock from the
GTX 980 and it's at 250 watts that's a
hundred percent of the the power target
percentage if you increase it by ten
percent which you can do in Maxwell
overclocking I've got a video on that
also on the channel increase by ten
percent now your your max TDP is about
275 wats so that does give some room for
play if you're an overclocker and video
reports that internally they were able
to push about 1.4 gigahertz for the
clock they didn't specify boost or base
that is almost definitely the boost
clock that's just how these over clocks
are measured especially when they're
that high so it is a capable card for
overclocking in theory but ultimately
the question here is whether this card
is meant for you and we are reviewing
this card it was shipped we're getting
it after gtc unfortunately so I don't
have the benchmarks today other sites do
go check them out see if you're you're
interested in it but here's the thing
regardless of the benchmarks the GTX
Titan X is one thousand dollars it's a
single GPU solution that performs very
well for things like 4k according to the
internal benchmarks I've read so far but
if you're on 1080 or 1440 there's no
reason you should buy this video card
maybe if you're planning to upgrade in
the future but if you're planning it up
in the future then our general
philosophy on the website is that you
should make all the purchases at once
and just save it up because we don't
know how technology will change in the
next year or two the Titan X is an
impressive technological feat it's got a
lot of cores packed into the same space
it has a nice looking finish with the
aluminum chassis and all matte black
paint I do I am partial to the previous
color of the 780 Ti in the 980 but the
Titan X is a nice mix up but for gaming
that's a bit much there are very few
instances where you will need a card
like this to play games and even in 4k
not many games are optimized for 4k yet
and I don't just mean performance I mean
visually because if you look at the user
interface and games when you when you
run them in 4k it's sort of like forcing
it the interface will have very tiny
font and very tiny you I because the
developers and this is on the developer
side more than on the technology
hardware side the developers just
haven't built for you because not enough
people are playing for K that will
change in the future probably going
forward but it's something to know it's
it's worth noting just like with SLI
when that was new it was worth noting
that you'd be disabling one card fifty
percent of the time or more because
developers had an optimized for it so
same instance here with 4k except it's
visual at the end of the day if you're a
media production professional it is
definitely worth looking into the Titan
acts if you're a gamer on the enthusiast
side sure look into it if you're a gamer
who is just playing games and not
necessarily overclocking and you don't
consider yourself an enthusiast you
don't need the newest thing probably buy
something more affordable unless you've
just got so much money burning a hole
through your pocket that you you need to
get rid of a thousand dollars that's not
to say it's a bad card it's just to say
that for gaming intentions at lower than
4k resolution there's not much
justification for a thousand dollar
purchase right now especially with the
980 doing as well as does and with even
AMD's 290x performing pretty well with
high resolution gaming at a much more
affordable price so that's sort of the
roundup of all the information check out
some benchmarks online check ours when
they're up next week we'll have some
pretty unique benchmarks that others
probably won't be producing immediately
so do stay tuned for all of that
and then you can find out if it's a good
card for your needs still cool
technology it will have more technology
and other cool stuff for you coming out
gtc 2015 here this week stay tuned to
the channel for more and i will see you
all next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
