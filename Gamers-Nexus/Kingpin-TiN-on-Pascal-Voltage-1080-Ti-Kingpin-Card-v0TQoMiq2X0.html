by Vince and ten or Illya as his real
name is and Vince you may know as
kingpin so we're going to talk about the
new 1080i Kingdom card we've got a
teardown that will be on the channel
separately but we get some more
lower-level stuff here before that this
video is brought to you by course
there's a new vengeance RGB LED Ram
which ships with custom screens ICS for
better overclocking performance and
stability start with the Vengeance RGB
LED kit at the link in the description
below let's just start off with I'm
gonna let you guys guide the
introductory topic here so for the
kingpin card 1080i we're talking about
your lead time for this was what a
couple months I guess and so what kind
of stuff do you start with because
you're not starting from zeros what do
you start with what do you know you're
trying to do well well reg you made a
couple other jizz chemical cars such as
like 980ti made a kingpin and we try to
take the throne throne parts of those
designs and try to improve them and
leverage the same idea for 1080p I think
we were looking at PCB earlier the most
immediate thing I saw was the gold
plating what can you tell me about that
is there any functional values of that
well it's it's obviously pretty
aesthetic I mean it looks great and it's
themed with our upcoming motherboard as
well but actually this can help to
dissipate heat from the PCB because it's
connected to all the internal layers on
the card so it's just an additional way
we can try to get the PCB to run cooler
right what kind of impact is he from
that thermal impact well we expect the
impact maybe like 50 or so it's what
you'll need to do a little bit more
testing on this because this is no real
example but actually like will also
improve the load on the heatsink itself
like there are some difference is a
thermal type arrangement so we just
trying to get maybe like 5c from their
prior 5c from somewhere else and then
this is also first to Kierkegaard which
use IGF cooler a new one which we
debuted on you can eighty FTW serious
so we taking all the pieces together and
try to get the best performance as
possible because with the Pascal
generation actually the thermal see
they're very important to if you want to
keep the maximum frequency then you even
five degrees of the temperature
difference could help get you maybe 20
or 30 mega values of your overclocking
skills yeah there are water cooling it's
a little every every five sixty makes a
big difference right while speaking of
cooling types on the more exotic side we
were talking about one of your engineers
earlier and it's baseplate I guess
inseparable it's like cut in half yep so
it's the point of that for an LM two pot
or something or well it's modular
obviously because you want to keep it on
the vrm to keep it cool while you're
running high-voltage high-current
on Ellen to but you don't want this this
base plate around the memory it just
gets in the way of the pot so we wanted
it modular in fact all KPS are like that
starting with 780ti
the base plate is modular right and then
the in terms of other cooling solutions
for the heat pipes I saw they're kind of
stacked alright so you've got like these
stacked copper heat pipes in here
there's sixteen pipes total I thank you
what what kind of impact you see from
that from stacking them which I mean
does that just give you better coverage
on the cold plate to get more heat pipes
into a smaller area or I think it mostly
about better heat distribution yeah to
take like the you have the GPU area
which is not not very big so if you have
the you like to heat pipes going like a
wide area then they're half of them will
not even touch the GPU or will have no
contact so which I jumped you might to
get that thermal and from GPU as quickly
as possible and dissipating with the big
50 because that's like what is important
not to you need to focus on the small
area and take a lot of heat from that
quick as possible right and then on
looking at the normal thin layer the
think I see the copper plating I guess
right on the thins is that just an
aesthetic thing that kleiner well 980ti
actually has a copper cooler and so will
this the whole cooler may not be copper
but GPU portion for sure will be okay
yeah that's why they come to so maybe
you can fit it right I feel the way yeah
yeah some I gotta have to it icx stop
does that I'm just having the ITX
sensors help you guys when you're just
kind of doing overclocking or yeah we
can monitor like all the critical areas
like pushes vrm you don't have enough
air flow and the vrm to get hydrogen
like you to like an array systems like
to where the library with the line then
vrn can get really hot so if you can
moisture that and we can actually sensor
like on the vrm side like on this point
that point and also a memory DRAM and we
can monitor and make sure that the vrm
stays cool because actually with the
higher temperature on the RM side you
also will be efficient so it will become
more more fun by itself it's practical
and without active cooling on the PWM
especially in previous generations it
can get very hot
even at with ln2 on the GPU what's your
tolerance does the pwm have for heat
like what's kind of your threshold for
when you start really dropping
performance gdc+ yeah we're designed to
have it rated as 85 c but all the
components rated 105 or 125 so actually
there is some safe margin and we also
have the thermal protection which keeps
in and around 95 c
red and thus extend to an 200 percent so
the voltage side we were I kind of I
heard you mention earlier some
misconceptions about voltage I guess
with Pascal and NVIDIA what is the
extent of the voltage limitations kind
of with a stock card versus what are you
doing with the kingpin okay well you
know you can see here here's a basically
like a stock type card and it's got all
the voltage modifications on it already
for bdmv memory be ma'am the GPU and v
PL v PLL but
this card has them all built in already
the thing with Pascal is the GPU can
really take such high voltage because of
such a small area on the die where the
heat needs to dissipate this process
just just runs a lot high - runs a lot
hotter at the much higher frequencies
compared to previous generations so
there was more scaling on the high end
you hear people talk about it maybe in
video locked it or I think it's just the
GPUs they just can't take that kind of
curve
check it's like the depends on the
design because when they media changes
we design them they can you cannot
expect the same like scaling on
frequency and voltage it still depends
on their like what's the actual
transistor can take how much voltage
without actually like physical damage
frame and that's all why comes into play
and then you have this like curve of the
voltage frequency which depends on each
GPU separately right how about the power
design of the card so we took it apart
so I was all I are powered on and can
talk me through some of that well we use
the IR so we can have fully digital
control for all the voltages like in
including the memory and including the
PLL voltage which is like really helpful
for extreme overclocking but also it may
have a little bit extra life in tuning
knobs for water cooling table because
like sometimes they won't like little
bit higher than card can provide so they
still can adjust in fine tune the
voltage and actually sometimes there's
only is overclock over voltage too much
maybe you want to have just running
cards on 2g for example and then you can
reduce the voltage to get lower thermal
so to have that adjustability and
without just using the software tools
then we use the digital component and
controllers for everything and we
already use this on the previous
generation like 980ti so we kind of
already know and we have already
software tools for that so why not just
reuse the same thing it makes it great
now what we have for see some canals
over here et but I guess yeah we still
support the unibody even
you cannot really buy it now but we
actually support people some of the
overclockers we already have the you but
the wallets all want you to keep the
same in the backward company Riveter but
you also have the USB interface which is
right down near the power connector
which is for our upcoming software
control and you can connect to the
motherboard and sell all the same
controls basically but without buying
any extra hardware so you will just
really table and I've all read out every
year so yes that's the probability can
read the GPU voltage memory voltage
below voltage and also 3.3 and 1202 make
sure that everything is fine and we also
have the status LED on besides 5 LEDs we
show the you that everything is ok
because if you have one of those videos
then ok you can see all the deuce
voltages up so when you guys are when
you're designing the next content card
what sort of takes up the goals of your
time like what takes most of your brain
energy to figure out well it's like
taking all the pieces together probably
and combining them so they can work all
community work and interact together
like for example if you design the
cooler seperti of the PCB then it would
be work you have some key component
clearances and all that and also like
the thermal need to mesh like you need
to make sure that your aim is cooled if
you school memories fine so all that
need to be coming to play together and
also like from the software we have the
software team to design all the
supporting tools like otherwise how you
wouldn't just walk with your triangles
adjust the frequency
sometimes we experiment with like new
memory layout but just one week yeah it
depends on the schedule like if you have
some time to play with your crazy ideas
then we'll do it in that lab and then
decide if we go to go to do that in good
production product or not memory layout
like moving it on the TCD physically or
just like traces try to trace length
signal quality this types of things try
none of those things which is a long
time ago it was to switch to the mini
DisplayPort connector so you can you
if somebody use the water blog they can
keep their very clean profile for the
card single slot so that's what the
result and then rely people like this
and we liked it so we keep carried over
from previous PP card it was so far
everybody liked it yeah we didn't want
to do two and a half plus it's too big
yeah I like to run multi-gpu so well I
think yeah if you run for away them this
was possible you and possible it is a
lot of two and a half plus any way in
the market a lot yeah that's going on
Duke is unit so let's suppose out here
with some final notes anything really
important here that you want to point
out people like in terms of something
you think is particularly high design
quality or well you know we put
everything we really put everything into
this card you know I see a lot of gamers
and you know dayley kind of guys always
say hey you know what's the point of
this card like why buy it right founders
cards just good enough blah blah blah
but actually we we designed this card
for somebody who wants to push push the
you know the generation of GPU to the
limit and and like I said this car can
do everything that these fully modded
cards can and if you don't have the
electronics expertise then you can just
plug it and go right right just with a
few dips and a bio splash so that's
really the main point of this card well
I guess it's the same idea with there
like some people like to zoom the cars
and they have like put the extra super
charge for servicing or and some other
people they will just have nice version
nice car so that you go by and Ferraris
like same idea like even maybe the
performance of the supercharged car is
little bit better like but like not
everybody want to spend that much amount
of time and resources to make that car
to run like that right these are just to
get one from the already already from
the book right
since the kingpin 1080i model will have
more information in the description as
always including the teardown and some
extra information in the article itself
and then hopefully have some follow-up
coverage later on down the road thank
you guys for joining me
no problem Julia we'll see you all next
