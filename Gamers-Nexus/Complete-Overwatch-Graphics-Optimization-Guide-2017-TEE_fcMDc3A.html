have included overwatch but we have
loaded means to benchmark the game in a
standardized environment due to its
multiplayer nature this sparked interest
internally and GM's Patrick Laden set
forth to study over watches performance
during real matches versus humans bot
matches and the practice range our
testing then expanded as we furthered
research ultimately turning into a
complete test of the graphic settings in
the game and so we bring to you our
complete overwatch graphics optimization
guide for 2017 before getting to that
this coverage is brought to you by EVGA
and their EVGA gtx 1080 TI FTW 3 which
should be available very shortly at this
point within a few weeks click the link
in the description below for more
information this is a revisit to our
highly acclaimed graphics optimization
series we ran in 2015
starting with GTA 5 and The Witcher
those guys are some of our highest
performing content to date on the
website and so it seems about time to
try and revisit that we're starting off
with overwatch but have just established
a new patreon goal to make this an
ongoing effort for future it launches
with games and for today's look the big
thing here is that overwatch is a
competitive FPS as you all know that
means it has different needs than
something like GTA so for this guide we
will be looking at testing individual
graphics settings to see which of them
has the biggest impact on performance
and then tuning those settings jointly
so looking at multiple of them tuning
them together and producing somewhat
optimized settings for our hardware
we're testing on this also provides a
way to hopefully offset the graphics so
they don't look terrible because if you
ran the game just at the lowest settings
which of course includes the best
framerate maybe that's all you care
about the game really doesn't look that
great but there are ways to get it to
retain some of the visual quality and
still have your high frame rate too for
this testing we're using our
standardized case testing bench with
three different GPUs the GD X 1080
gaming X to establish a baseline the
1052 gigabyte card and the our X 480
gaming ax 8 gigabyte card our KS test
bench is defined in the article links in
the description below along with all the
other methodology if you want to know
what
you memory and all that we're in it and
it normally is the 1080 gaming X so we
started there to establish the best
possible scenario some matches were
conducted against real players at all
epic settings on the Oasis map and that
yielded an in-game framerate of roughly
180 FPS average on the GTX 1080 the
other two cards with 1050 and 40 gaming
X provided a wide range of frame rates
that establish our thesis of tackling a
potential GP bottleneck in overwatch by
looking at optimizing for something like
again the 1050 the 1050 runs at about 60
FPS average with lows in the 40s before
80 was about 99 with lows in the 60s and
80s and again this is just a really
quick ad hoc test to establish a premise
and that's not bad but we can definitely
improve it so any improvements we see
here will scale to other resolutions as
well which is beneficial for high end
GPU users with higher res displays so
all we've done so far is established
that there's room for improvement in the
GPU category with this test bench that's
good because that's what we're testing
for and trying to optimize for today is
a lower-end GPU or a GPU constraint for
example when you're looking at higher
resolution and trying to tank some
settings in favor of the high res like
1440 for full testing methodology as
always check the link in the description
below for Patrick's write-up he talks
about how we tested all this stuff and
if you need to know exactly how we
tested it's all there as for the
settings in the game we have some
definitions of the graphics settings for
overwatch and they're actually straight
from Blizzard so they're not speculation
they're correct we noticed that a lot of
the guides including our own beta guide
from years and years ago had either
outdated information on the settings or
incorrect information on the settings so
this should settle a lot of that because
it's from the devs that will be in the
article as well because it frankly isn't
the focus of the video content would
take a long time to read through all of
it
that's not really a chart of all thing
so we're going to move on straight to
the research and analysis and synthetic
testing then get into BOTS matches
versus human matches and see if human
matches are more intensive and if so how
do we deal with that in benchmarking
starting with initial research and
synthetic testing that we use the
practice range to define an initial test
procedure and outline our X
patience for each of the settings then
formed at botton human matches as stated
to sort things out further using the GTX
1050 and starting at maximum settings we
turn to each setting down in the
practice map and the chart on the screen
now shows the results for all of that
tuning this establishes our baseline for
what we should focus on the most during
the more intensive at competitive
matches and further testing where we're
fine-tuning the settings other than just
toggling them and these numbers
highlight that dynamic reflections
shadows and local fog detail are all
worthy of attention which we'll
highlight in the charts we're happy to
see that texture and model detail don't
seem to impact framerate as heavily as
some other options as they're the ones
that have the most visible impact on the
game from a graphics quality perspective
as a user texture quality is most
dependent on a VM as always it given
that the higher quality textures of high
resolutions will require more video card
memory but we never really saw a VM
request size exceed two gigabytes on the
gtx 950 at 1080p of course higher
resolution will change this just quickly
noting here's a frame time chart showing
the biggest change dynamic reflections
and that's with it toggled at vs
everything that maxed so you can get a
better idea of what's happening in the
1% and lo percent metrics we saw about a
43% improvement from baseline by
toggling dynamic reflections off and
about a 14% improvement over baseline
with shadow toggling which you can see
if we switch back to our FPS chart we
had originally on the screen and about
the same for fog disabling ambient
occlusion gave us about 8% performs back
and we're also seeing a theoretical
maximum throughput of 207 FPS average
with the 1050 OC card and with the bench
used this means that we're bumping into
constraints at that point at a hardware
level as the GTX 980 is capable of
achieving a higher framerate so we're
not at any kind of engine constraint
we've got some screenshots here to show
the highest graphics quality then medium
then lowest in the practice range these
are embedded in the article if you'd
like more time to look them over and
study for differences without YouTube's
compression but it gives you a
foundation of what the difference looks
like just from the presets time to get
to the real tests the ones that weren't
done on the practice range we're
obviously no one ever
this game anyway so for the real test we
fought BOTS with the same team and
character composition same exact
character models same characters per
team so that's important and then we
also use the same bot difficulty which I
believe Patrick had set to medium and
the same map which was named Bonnie for
all tests the objective was set to
attack and we played offense for every
single round because we're playing
against bots so it's easier to control
how the round progresses and attacked
and that means we can just control the
task easier because we can define when
things progress or end or whatever for
human player matches same thing same map
same objectives all that stuff the only
difference is humans and obviously they
have full control over which characters
they choose so that impacts FPS
potentially but that's what our FPS
benchmarks set out to determine let's
first determine if human matches are
significantly more demanding than bot
matches of an equal player account these
recordings happened over about a five to
six minute period and were averaged over
the duration which is really the only
way to validate a potential test method
as there's so much variation between
matches that a short test pass does not
contain all the information required to
make a sufficient analysis this chart
shows some of these slight differences
between boughten human matches on NIM
body and a Hollywood but nothing
significant
we saw a two FPS swing from bot two
human matches on embody and could easily
account for that and what is experienced
in each match that would be the usual
variation between what players are doing
in the game considering those changes
match to match these numbers are
actually remarkably close and they
illustrate that we can safely test using
foe bot matches without concern of
misrepresenting real gameplay they are
effectively identical and bot matches of
course are much easier to control for in
testing so that is the preferable mode
of test this also gives us more control
over the testings and again medium BOTS
can be easily controlled in a fashion
that doesn't conflict with our ability
to perform specific actions in the game
for example not dying and these results
being effectively equal established our
baseline for validating a new test
method going forward here's the next
chart we're now playing full bot matches
on ambani with otherwise epic set
and 1080p on the GTX 1050 OC from MSI
then were manually tuning individual
settings as mentioned above dynamic
reflections at shadows and local fog
were the top candidates for optimization
we also chose to test effect detail
lighting and refraction since we felt
that these were options that didn't have
a real chance to affect things in the
practice range and could potentially
contribute to 1% and 0.1% load dips in
game the trend scene and the practice
range continued in game although the
actual frame rates changed drastically
as you might expect the maximum
improvement again resulted from
disabling dynamic reflections but the
0.1% low value remained at 45 FPS
turning down effects detail lighting and
refractions produced frame rates
indistinguishable from the maximum
settings even in the 1% in 0.1 percent
global categories this confirmed our
choice of three top candidates for
optimization and so getting rid of
dynamic reflections now in our bat match
for real-world representation we see
that this frees up 30% increase Headroom
in average FPS for shadows we see a 17%
Headroom improvement while setting
everything to low post a maximum
possible change of 210 percent and that
is from the highest settings let's
narrow things down here's a chart
focusing on three settings offset from
epic all on low and then one setting
with reflections shadows and fog sets a
medium and a final config with them
disabled these are the three most
impactful to framerate so this begins
our final optimization attempt on the
1050 simply turning these settings down
to medium keeps frame rates well above
60fps on average with about a 50%
improvement jointly disabling them
completely gave 117 FPS average or 95
percent improvement jointly but again
they're disabled completely and that's
not great or about 69 to 70 FPS lower
than turning every single setting to
minimum we've got a frame time plot that
demonstrates the low values better as
well where we can see that the
improvement from completely toggling
these settings is noteworthy over the
medium configuration but we find the
frame times with medium to be accessible
given the visual trade-off shadows can
have an impact as well on competitive
ability and as one setting we'd prefer
not to completely disable here's a look
at the same configuration that
the RX 480 the RX 4 ad often bumped up
against the 300 fps cap under these
configurations and that means the 267
FPS average that you can see on the
chart is something that would be higher
without said cap at maximum settings the
0.1% low was still above 60 fps
perfectly playable however the three
relevant settings disabled yielded a
0.1% low rise to nearly 120 fps
good news for owners of 120 Hertz
displays with a strict zero-tolerance
policy scaling here shows medium
settings at boosting from our 99 FPS
baseline by 44% comparable to the GTX
1050 scaling as you might expect we see
an 81 percent improvement by disabling
reflections and shadows completely and
that sums it up so for people who have
lower end GPUs that are causing a
bottleneck in the system for overwatch
meaning your GPU is the constraint
because it is not powerful enough to
keep up with the CPU which in this game
is completely reasonable CP is not that
high demand the order of settings to
experiment would be this you should
change dynamic reflections first and
then shadow detail and then local fog
detail at this point you should be able
to push those other settings to higher
values without a huge performance hit
while clawing back some of your FPS from
the more drastic changes in the
categories listed here ambient occlusion
is another option for anyone who is
truly desperate but we saw maximally
something like an 8 percent difference
there so that is something we try to
leave on though if you really need
something else you could play with
ambient occlusion as well other settings
don't significantly affect the GPU and
decrease quality with no real
appreciable benefit in terms of
framerate throughput and turning them
off completely in terms of things like
shadows is unnecessary and undesirable
because shadows can actually provide
some competitive advantage depending on
how well you play and that type of thing
so as always thanks for watching you can
find the full guide link in the article
below and subscribe for more patreon.com
slash gamers and access to help us
produce these things specifically
because they do require a lot of effort
for game specific guides
and they aren't always quite as
interesting as Hardware benchmarks for
our audience so just as a side note
using his own guide Patrick was able to
get his FPS above 70 with his aging r9
285 XFX GPU so not bad at all definitely
beneficial hopefully this helps you let
us know I'll see you all next time
