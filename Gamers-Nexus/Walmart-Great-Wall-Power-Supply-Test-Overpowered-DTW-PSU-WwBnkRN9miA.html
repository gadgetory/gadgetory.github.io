supply blows up let's build the wall to
prevent these power supplies from being
sold well take a Mongol horde to make
this great wall crumble
looks like jion wants to shift to a new
studio and so blow up their old one that
the efficiency will be under 80% and
ripple above 120 these are the types of
comments that surfaced when we posted
teasers of our power supply testing for
the great wall power supply used in the
wall Mart system and to be fair
everything about it does look like a
cheap power supply but great wall
actually is a supplier and makes PS use
for Corsair for instance as discussed in
our Walmart case review it's uncommon to
find great wall power supplies unbranded
in the western market and this one
didn't even have the maximum 12-volt
capabilities listed so the unit did
attract criticism from the community
what we're here to do is test whether or
not it's deserving of all of that
criticism using our new power supply
testing setup to benchmark efficiency
ripple and over current protections
before that this video is brought to you
by the gigabyte Z 390 ARS master
motherboard which comes equipped with
one of the more powerful Z 390 V RMS for
heavier overclocks on the new 9th gen
intel cpus the ARS master is also one of
the few motherboards with a really
heatsink this generation featuring a mix
of high surface area fins and looks
oriented hover blocks oh and it's also
got updated RGV illumination learn more
at the link below starting with the very
basics first
just like in liquid coolers there are
typically only a couple of suppliers
that actually make the core of the
product before the big brands that you
know do something a bit custom with them
so liquid coolers are a great example
because Corsair NZXT EVGA plenty of
other people they all ultimately kind of
sell sort of the same product in that
the base of it is likely a Sutekh and
there are some exceptions to that of
course your side that are new but
typically it's someone like haze attack
or is ASA TAC and they might have the
same Gen 5 pompe Gen 6 pump they have
slightly different tube lengths they
have different fans that are really
important they have different fan
profiles but the pump itself the
radiator and the tube material it's all
gonna be the same the end of the day
there is a supplier behind things and
great wall is one of those is something
mentioned in our Walmart case review
where we were talking about suppliers
like Jones Beaufort the case market just
to give a list of a couple of the more
popular power supplies that Great Wall
does make Great Wall has made things
like the corsair CX 500 the TX 850
they've done the rio toro enigma 850 OC
z ZX 1000 and some of these are a bit
better than others the CX series not
really the best the enigmas from rio
toro ocz is most mostly dead at this
point but then there are other ones like
the Corsair SF 600 which actually has
really good voltage ripple and the CX
450 is a cheaper power supply it's been
made by both great wall and channel
while technology the cs5 50 M green
label power supply that's great wall
great wall makes a lot of these and to
course has credit of course they do
things to improve them as well as they
might aid in some of the engineering but
the platform buy a great wall is the
heart of the product in those instances
and although this one is is not
rebranded it is still a great wall
product and that list kind of shows that
you may have even used one in the past
before we get into the testing today
power supply testings new for us so
we're still learning we are still
advancing our methods there's a lot we
know we can improve already there's a
lot we've already improved after this
video goes live but we have enough data
here to do some basics and the basics
will be efficiency testing at different
loads using a load generator that's the
sun/moon 8800 we have a Sun Moon 220 for
measuring that load and then we also
have a couple of other tools like a no
scope for measuring ripple and we are
using a new setup that's not in for this
test today for fans speed and noise
testing for power slice that's a really
difficult problem to tackle and we've
solved it pretty well but it won't be
showing up here today because we're
building some of the setup for that and
instead of going through all of the
details of our new power supply testing
methodology here what we're gonna do is
finish the fan and noise test inside of
PSU reviews and then make one video or
article talking about how all the
testing methodology will work but today
the basics of what you need to know is
that we're using an SM 220 SM 8800 and
OU scope and
we'll have some more information the
article linked in the description below
you want to check out some information
on the loads that we used on this great
wall power supply and on this EVGA power
supply just as a baseline branded
competitor made by HEC for this one
we're plotting the Great Wall 500 watt
nd + power supply in the Walmart PC
versus an EVGA 500 watt 80 + model from
about 2014 EVGA a power supply is made
by HEC while great wall as the supplier
of its own unit we'll start with the
great wall power supply first version
1.4 - of the ATX desktop PSU design
guide will move toward standardizing a 2
percent load number but most power
supplies still fail two percent
efficiency testing as the guidelines are
relatively new at 2 percent load great
wall operates at 55 point two percent
efficiency with an input of 18 watts and
an output of about 10 watts loading the
three point three and five volt rails to
zero point three amps and five BSB to
one point five this isn't a high end
power supply so as load tapers in either
direction efficiency Falls hard we can
give it a pass at two percent load as
this is still a new enough specification
that it's not being applied yet to these
types of power supplies but it's
something to consider going forward at
10 percent load the great wall unit is
at seventy seven point seven percent
efficiency which isn't great but 80-plus
doesn't require any ten percent
efficiency up until the titanium ratings
the recent titanium radians that were
added it's twenty percent that starts to
matter where the great wall power supply
is at eighty three point one percent
efficiency that clears the requirement
for an eighty plus white label which is
eighty percent efficiency as the floor
30 percent load has us at eighty four
point six percent efficiency while forty
percent load has us at eighty five
percent efficiency this is the peak of
the curve as 50 percent stays roughly
the same with eighty four point nine
percent efficiency eighty plus
certification requires eighty percent
efficiency at 50 percent load which this
clears it misses 80 plus bronze but it's
close enough to error margins that we
can give it a pass if it clears it 100
percent load validation plus we test
maybe slightly differently than plug
load would anyway at sixty percent we
dipped to eighty four point four percent
efficiency than eighty three point four
percent at seventy percent eighty two
percent at 80 percent and eventually hit
eighty point three percent efficiency at
100 percent load despite there being no
like report for validating this power
supply at the time of writing and
despite its lack of any official 80-plus
certification and branding which does
cost money it looks like this unit is at
least 80 plus white efficient or the
base label and is bordering on bronze
efficiency although the plugs load group
will test differently than we do let's
look at the EVGA power supply next this
one is 56% efficient at two percent load
76 percent efficient at 10 percent load
and is exactly tied with the great wall
power supply at 20 percent load or 80
3.1 percent efficiency with the
efficiency trailing off after that the
EVGA power supply hits 84 percent
efficiency at 50 percent load before
dipping towards 80 percent at 100
percent load we also included overload
measurements where the great wall power
supply does 77.7% efficiency when loaded
to 615 Watts output or 792 Watts input
which is really pretty damn good all
things considered we'll talk over CT and
current figures in a minute the EVGA
power supply at the same 615 watt load
with the same current distribution so 75
point 4 percent efficiency at 123
percent load again not bad both of these
power supplies can sustain more than
they advertised which is always a great
thing to see this wasn't measured on the
great wall unit after a 40 minute load
period to allow the power supply to
reach steady state temperatures
internally but for the EVGA unit it did
eventually reach a shutdown point and we
would have had to step down the current
on the 12 volt rail in order to sustain
operation put these percentage numbers
into perspective here's the input versus
output power applauded for just the
great wall power supply this chart
really helps visualize the efficiency
curve with real numbers this is power in
versus DC out on the power supply DC out
would be what your PC receives and
likely requests while the input is what
is required in the AC to DC conversion
process in terms of percentages this
power supply is its most efficient at
40% to 50% load and trails off toward
the end of testing 2% load is the least
efficient of all but because we're
talking percentages versus absolutes in
the previous chart was this one that
isn't necessarily obvious on this kind
of chart the previous chart would be
better for that but this one helps to
visualize the actual power input and
output numbers in watts
voltage ripple is one of the most
important metrics for determining the
quality of power delivered to a system a
PSU can be efficient while still having
bad ripple characteristics which would
in
system instability or reduce
overclocking Headroom we are using a
regal 10:54 scope connected to the SMA
8800 via BNC for this testing veteran
VPP for ripple we've measured average
voltage ripple on the 12 volt rails at
about 39 millivolts under 20 percent
load 43 millivolts under 50 percent load
and 59 millivolts under 100% load before
peaking at 89 millivolts under 120% load
I expect calls for under 120 millivolts
of rip hole for example with the
absolute best $500 power supplies
nearing 10 to 15 millivolts of ripple
just for example with 43 millivolts at
50 percent and 59 millivolts at 100% the
great wall power supply is simply fine
it isn't amazing it isn't offensive
making for acceptable overall ripple on
a dirt cheap power supply on the 12 volt
line the other rails are less important
the worst of which is 5 vs B towards the
back end of testing 12 volt ripple is
better than one might anticipate of
going solely based on the amount of
comments calling for the explosion of
this power supply again it's not a great
part but it's not going to cause
instability issues as a result of ripple
at least on this kind of system that it
was installed with and in future power
spot reviews this is really just a
preview of what we're working on we'll
be including some charts of the actual
voltage ripple measurements so you can
see how clean the signal is and then we
might be looking at transient response
and things like that
along with fan and noise testing in the
future so last one here OCP even though
we said in our Walmart case review that
great wall is a pretty common supplier
most of the concerns we're still talking
about the power supply quote blowing up
or catching on fire as a result of over
drawing current we tested OCP on this
unit great wall says that this power
supply should be able to take at least
40 amps on the 12 volt rail so we set
the 3.3 and 5 volt rails at 3.4 amps
PSB to 1.5 then push the 12 volt rail
until it hit 40 amps the power supply
ran inefficiently of course but it
didn't shut down or overheat this was
for a minimum of 30 to 40 minutes to
reach steady state and we switched our
SM 8800 into amps mode and increased the
current until we hit a breaking point
for the great while 500 watt unit that
breaking point was approximately 56 amps
demanding 672 Watts down three 12-volt
cables alone
or if 707 watts total against all of our
settings VRMs fell to 111 point nine
five volts efficiency was seventy seven
point seven percent and ripple was about
92 millivolts on the ETF's header and in
the 80s for EPS and 12-volt headers but
overall it did survive and that's 123
percent load so really it's I mean it's
not supposed to run that high anyway the
power supply ended up tripping OCP and
safely shutting itself down when pushed
this hard at 50 amps or 123 percent
total power a continued operation and
did not trip any protection so it was
not at any major risk of catastrophic
failure because it was capable of
handling it once we went over 50 amps
that's when it started just tripping OCP
almost immediately concluding this one
the Great Wall 500 watt power supply
which is it's got a name of GW 6000 in
the model and it does technically say 80
plus on it although there's no sticker
it's just part of the model name so
that's what we're working with here and
it's actually okay it's inoffensive it
is not an exciting power supply it is
not a high quality power supply but it's
not a really tremendously low quality
power supply either it's just fine the
voltage ripple is acceptable especially
for a 500 watt ultra budget power supply
and we've spoken with some sources in
the industry and these are incredibly
cheap because Walmart could have put a
branded power supply in their system
like a lot of the system builders do for
example Iowa power typically uses the
sort of branded power supplies that you
were all familiar with they could have
done that or they could have had more
margin and they chose more margin and
this one it's it's probably I mean it's
it's probably better than some of the
other low end power supplies on the
market that are branded by companies
that you all know because it's just it's
fine
so not really the most exciting it
didn't blow up if that's what you were
waiting for I'm sorry it did not do that
but it also didn't post the best ripple
numbers in the world didn't post the
best efficiency numbers in the world
it's simply okay so Walmart for their
part or their their supplier om as part
their system builders part the power
supply is not
Marvel the rest of the computer the part
selection like the motherboard for
example really weird USB type-c
selection the case is terrible but the
power supply is actually okay so this is
the one part of that build unless you
count silicon like the CPU this is the
one part of that bill that's actually
somewhat redeeming so we would still
absolutely not recommend buying one of
the over powered pcs especially because
if you look at our case review maybe we
can put one of those charts on the
screen the Delta for the internal
component temperature by removing the
front panel of that case that glass
panel it's it's was it 40 degrees it's
over 30 degrees whatever it was it's a
huge Delta and that case is just
suffocating everything in it so that's
bad and then the price was really bad
and they did drop it a little bit after
all the videos and coverage but it's
still just not a good deal services is
not good in the experience we've had
other youtubers have posted content like
Kyle bit wit and Linus tech tips and
they've had issues with cables being
disconnected on arrival
so still wouldn't recommend it but
strictly speaking of power supplies it's
actually okay now you could complain
that the cables aren't pretty
you could complain the box isn't pretty
the cables you have a better point
because these are visible inside the
case if you're paying over $2000 for the
high-end system and you've got this kind
of mess inside the case yeah you deserve
a better power supply for that kind of
money absolutely if only for the looks
but functionally it's acceptable so
that's it for this one thank you for
watching
power supply stuffs gonna get really
interesting coming up so make sure you
subscribe to catch more of that you can
go to store documents access net to pick
up one of our mod mats or shirts and
patreon.com slash gamers Nexus tops out
directly where we'll also be posting
some extra behind-the-scenes stuff on
power supply testing as we further
iterate it be posted one maybe two or
three weeks ago already so and then one
final note we do have a lot of cool
things we're doing with this type of
testing that didn't make it into this
video because it just wasn't ready yet
but working on it so definitely check
back soon because we should have some oh
scope shots will have fan
speed versus power response will have
noise testing thermal testing all that
stuff so thank you for watching I'll see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
