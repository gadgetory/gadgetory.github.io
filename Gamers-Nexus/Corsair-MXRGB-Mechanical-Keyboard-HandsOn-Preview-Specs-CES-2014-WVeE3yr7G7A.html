nexus donna and we are in the Corsair
suite here at CES 2014 we are looking at
a new keyboard here today it is a
Corsair MX RGB working name there will
be a full name coming out soon we will
let you know what that is i'm joined by
jason christian and he's going to tell
us about this new keyboard so for
starters obviously we've got all this
crazy lighting going on so let's start
with the obvious what can you tell me
about that okay I mean from when we
first launched the k70 in a single color
LED people have always asked us you know
when are you guys going to come out with
a RGB mechanical switch so in a
partnership with cherry we were able to
work with them and get an exclusive on a
Corsair MX RGB cherry switch and that's
what's going to be featured in this
keyboard so every single key on the
keyboard will be able to be programmed
for 16.8 million colors pulsing and
brightness control so the the
customizability is going to be pretty
much endless anything you can think of
that you'd want to do you're going to be
able to do this with this backlighting
awesome and in terms of switches what
are we looking at so right out of the
gate we're going to have the cherry MX
RGB blues Browns and reds okay and so
there's a lot of logic going on here yes
what do we have controlling everything
so what we have controlling is we've
we've worked with Panasonic to develop a
display controller and this controller
is just pretty much straight from Japan
that's really bit never used in a in a
consumer application it's usually in
commercial for billboards LED signs so
we've taken that technology of course
we've had to made it smaller and we're
be able to put that in the keyboard to
make sure that we can display the cherry
switches to the fullest capability are
there any other special features we've
seen some reactive lighting stuff with
other keyboards you guys doing any of
that so I mean there's the we're going
to release a brand new software package
with this keyboard and what it's going
to do is allow the user it's gonna be
very intuitive and very high-level
customizability but then if people
really want to dig in and customize it
like you mentioned the one of the
features is going to be the reactive
typing ripple you're going to be able to
set the ripple to
be different speeds different colors
different intensities and you'll be able
to select the the motion of the ripple
if it goes up down if it comes in if it
comes out so it's just in the software
is going to be totally open architecture
as well so you'll be able to do with
that two ways it's going to be Lua
scripting language being used so you can
integrate scripts if your friend creates
a script you create a script you can
share it and then also it's totally open
if for whatever reason you don't want to
use the corsair software and you want to
build your own you know the hardcore
enthusiast guy on the forums he may have
his own idea we're going to leave it
totally open for the people to do that
just that added level of customizability
again awesome and finally do we have any
information on expected release date
targets tentative right now as will be
mid-2014 okay MSRP no information yet
yet undecided so there you have it check
out the full article in the description
below and we will see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
