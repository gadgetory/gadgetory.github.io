EVGA at 1080 hybrid that's this right
here so this actually uses an FTW board
this particular model it is a 1080 FTW
hybrid and it's got some interesting
characteristics for that reason one we
really want to see the PC because it's
obviously not a reference design this
for the record would be a reference
design this is the Corsair Seahawk that
we already took apart and so the point
specifically of this endeavor is to swap
the heatsink on this unit with the one
on this unit and vice versa rerun the
thermal test because we're getting some
performance results that I really didn't
expect going into this specifically from
the hybrid so before getting to this the
content is brought to you by ibuypower
and the new elements in gaming pc which
uses an s3 40 that's been modified to
have a large tempered glass side window
LEDs for underglow and the fans and is
available now so the EVGA hybrid
previously when we looked at the 980 i
hybrid versus the 980 TI seahawk or
hydrographics if if you prefer from
coarser we've looked at them this card
for the 980 TI generation way
outperformed the Seahawk but coarser and
MSI have made some changes in this
generation so this is their cooler this
time if we hold up hold sort of a laser
against this thing you can actually
you'll see that the surface is perfectly
flat these days and that is conducive to
GPU cooling because a GPU doesn't have
the same curvature that an IHS has for
CPUs talked about this a million times
but it's flat now and that's good for
GPU so that certainly has improved
performance a bit it reduces the
reliance on Tim to make that contact
between the GPU and a curvature found in
the cold plate of the previous models
that's helped but still the EVGA card
does seem like it should be performing
better than it is and that leads me to
believe that there's there's a few
variables here we'll talk about them in
the review I don't think we'll be able
to get this lower than the Seahawk what
we're gonna try so that's gonna be
mostly by dismantling it and swapping
the coolers so this thing is technically
if we wanted to just change the coolers
it would be much easier than what I'm
about to do but
I want to take the whole thing apart
because we want to see the PCB anyway
just cuz that's kind of interesting to
look at and understand what's going on
under the hood that's weird okay so just
before we get any further into this you
may have noticed we've already swapped
out the fan here this is the Corsair
cooler and I've put the EVGA fan on it
that was part of some troubleshooting
and testing we were doing earlier which
you'll see in the review and then we've
done the same for the EVGA cooler so
that's got the corsair fan on it don't
be confused
we have swapped the fans these are not
the ones that they come with a couple
things here these are just kind of
protective rubber dampers or cushions
we've got some thermal pads here that
have moved around a bit and these are
these adhering to these are sticking to
the backside of the GPU plainly so
there's a GPU backside of it so that
handles that we can clearly see vram
modules to put this on now that we're
under the card so VRAM VRAM VRAM
capacitors probably MOSFETs inductors
right there so that's the card from the
backside another thermal pad up here
so something fell in a little piece of
plastic that was hanging off let's see
what that is oh there it is that's like
a knot of some kind I don't know what
that that was just loose in there I
don't know what that was hold him I
believe it actually went there was to
one of these sitting on the probably one
of these two sitting on the inside but
let's finish removing the faceplate now
one thing just a note these are ATR six
so we could remove those but uh I don't
know that there's really a reason to do
so at this point I think right now we
are secured by probably a fan cable yes
okay so here's the interesting thing
with this card there's a couple things
very interesting about it and this is
why we are doing this endeavor to begin
with because it does seem pretty well
engineered from from the face of things
so obviously this is not very exciting
this is a cable for LEDs it's an RGB LED
plate so you got RGB LEDs in here which
are there but underneath it we've got a
fan that's actually not a blower fan
it's not well it's not the radial fan
it's actually an axial fan and the
blades are inverted from what you might
expect so that's pretty interesting
there's a heat sink underneath it used
to cool the MOSFET components and then
over here we've got some extra copper
from what would normally be expected I
actually wasn't aware of this this
changes my hypothesis about what's going
on with this which I haven't shared yet
just to be clear well we'll share that
in the review I'm not sure the
hypothesis as to why the cooling
difference is what it is so this is
covering the vram that is new I have not
seen that on any cards this generation
or last generation other than things
like the fury X which we're very that
one was very unique and its
implementation and the gigabyte water
force card
pretty unique implementation for the
1080 series but we don't have one of
those in so that's pretty cool we'll
look at that more in a moment let's get
the cooler off and see if it's it should
be 100% identical to the one we've used
for our own hybrid mods a few times now
with the copper protrusion on the bottom
of it and it is an ASA tech cooler just
like the Corsair one is an AZ tech
cooler but coarser is using at age 55
built for CPUs but they've modified at
this generation so the bottom is flat
which is good as I discussed
so both Ace attack cooled but in theory
this one is the one with the protruded
copper plate which we'll find out in a
moment for the cold blade alright very
interesting so as stated there's your
VRAM thermal pads and that obviously
covers the vram modules looks like we've
got a thermal paste on one side of that
that's on the table now that's nice I
don't have any things you grab me
alright together
good coverage here you can see that
basically the throne pace is
considerably less thick in the center so
that's what we want to see that was not
necessarily the case on the Seahawk when
I took that one apart that one did not
have as much either pressure or just
contact with the silicon but obviously
worked quite well because it was in the
18 ish degrees range Delta when we did
the thermal tests and here so here's the
bit I'm interested in see that compound
to contact there we look here very
plainly these were meant to be connected
to one another so if it's not obvious it
would look as if the vram is sinking
into the thermal pads into this copper
plate copper plates making contact
through Tim a very good contact actually
with the bottom of the cold plate and
that would theoretically heat up the
cold plate at least in the parameter and
depending on on what the micro fins look
like inside that transfer should be in
done in such a way that the vram is
dissipating some of its heat through the
pump and that is the unique aspect of
this that we have not seen in previous
generations well it's actually pretty
exciting discovery okay so here's what
we've got that I've explained that I've
explained in a few different videos
these communicate with one another to
the GPU of the GPU quite clearly is AGP
104 - 400 chip it is a 1080 that is what
alternators are and it's an a1 Rev the
next bit this secures the tubes that's
all it does or the hoses and really
nothing else this is the face plate a
face plate has a little shroud here
around the fan to help it focus its air
so it's pulling air out that's the
interesting bit this is inverted as I
said pulling air out away from the
MOSFETs I'll have to take that off
suppose and actually look at the MOSFETs
which I'd really prefer not to do but
but we're going to memory it's the same
micron gddr5 X as we've seen before
we've got eight gigabit chips modules so
a total of eight gigabytes because there
are eight modules and then we've got
capacitors like crazy ton of inductors
or chokes if you prefer that terminology
and the MOSFETs are under here and we've
got a couple phases it looks like
potentially from memory backside I don't
particularly see anything special other
than this IC here but we'll talk about
that separately in another video so
let's take the fan part of this apart
that's very easy looks like aluminum
here black painted aluminum we've got a
thermal pad here big one and that
contacts with the MOSFETs and then the
sink itself is just aluminum finned heat
sink the cables
that's the cable going into the PWM on
the board that powers both the fan and
the pump so that's that covers our power
I'm not gonna take the fan off in the
real point the MOSFETs are there are a
lot what do we have here four phases but
we wrote an article a while ago that
covers that and then in the review I'll
discuss it more directly once I have a
chance to look at it off camera but just
looking at it obviously very
simplistically there's 12 and doctors
here we've got a couple more littered
across the board for the memory the vram
phases so that's the PCB the basics the
cooling I've pretty thoroughly described
but we will have a complete detailed
video with the review I've got to figure
out if we wanted to do thermal analysis
separately or not by the time this goes
up it'll all be within hours of
publication so be sure
to subscribe if you haven't so that you
can see those videos as they go live it
will be a very interesting duel between
the Corsair unit and the EVGA unit
especially in when I say Corsair I mean
Corsair and msi the Seahawk X or the
Corsair hydrographic same thing so I'm
going to put this on here and we're not
gonna bother doing a separate video for
it just gonna do it see how it works and
then we'll we'll have our answer as to
why the performance is the way it is but
yeah as always subscribe patron like a
postal video to help us out directly
thank you for watching and we'll see you
all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
