benchmark on gtx 1070 so we just got our
second 1070 in the shop this is an MSI
gaming X and we've already got the
founders edition aka reference 1070 so
we're putting these in sli today for a
benchmark and before getting to that
this coverage is brought to you by enter
max and I knew it look max a giant
open-loop liquid cooling solution so the
SLI setup here this is not an ideal
setup and that's for a few reasons one
these cards are not identical you
normally want identical cards just kind
of ideally to keep things simple but
that's not what we have that's not what
we can get because this is still a brand
new card and right now a mix of two is
the best I've got so we're going to do
that anyway because it still works it
works just fine really as a user the
downside is that you're generally going
to be kind of locked to your slowest
device that would be the founders
Edition card in this case so we'll lose
some of the overclocking pre overclock
benefit of the MSI version but we're
going to go ahead and use them anyway so
I'm just going to put this in the top
slot it is the best card after all and
if we decide to do any overclocking
later it's just going to be easier if I
have that there especially if we remove
the founder's Edition one so we've got
that in there it's good enough let's go
ahead and connect this one to the lower
slot and now for SLI the game has
changed so as you've probably seen in
our review of the 1070 the 1080 it's not
the same anymore as it used to be where
you can just use one cable between these
feet at the top now there needs to be a
high bandwidth bridge for Pascal which
we don't have a high bandwidth bridge
but we've got these LED bridges they're
called and by Nvidia spec an LED bridge
is just as good for our purposes the
only place a high bandwidth bridge does
better is in 5k and surrounded you're
not testing today so we're going to go
ahead and use the LED bridge again
effectively the same as the high
bandwidth bridge for our purposes this
is a high bandwidth bridge higher clock
rate and we've we've encountered a
problem already so here's the here's the
issue because the reference card has a
shorter PCB and because I have no
flexible bridge that's
that's obviously not going to work I
don't know if we can we're not going to
be able to force that to work so that's
no good
unless we start hacking apart the bridge
or something like that that's no good so
want we got a couple options here one of
them is and I will explain this I'm not
going to do it but I'll explain it just
so you all know we've got these two
ribbon cables these are not high
bandwidth even though one is branded as
ro G it's not special it's just like
this one branded by Nvidia so what one
thing that people have asked is can you
just do this do two ribbon bridges equal
one high bandwidth bridge or LED bridge
and the answer is no so these are
actually regardless of the fact that
there are two they are operating on a
400 megahertz clock it's they oscillate
at 400 megahertz and these bridges are
650 mega Hertz that's a good deal
different and having two doesn't make up
that you get some gain but you don't get
it all back and we'll show that in a
future benchmark so I really don't want
to do this this isn't going to be a
representative of the best-case scenario
and I don't know that we have the ideal
situation for this but one thing we can
do I think I have one somewhere here we
go so I've got these riser cables some
people are probably laughing at this
already but we have these from sis for
use in small form-factor pcs and riser
cables are jet all they do is sort of
elevate the PCIe slot and they're used
very regularly in small form-factor pcs
that the ax system integrator is build
and that's normally just show off the
faceplate of the card but we're going to
use it for a more practical reason we're
going to connect this here I I'm sure
some of you will cringe at this but it
will work connect that there is nothing
conductive on the bono this is all
plastic and ribbon so I'm not worried
about that we can contact the board I
connect this card
to it and now our video card is taller
it's a bit floppy but it's taller so
let's go ahead and give us I think this
we have to figure out which one of these
will well line up I think this one will
work this is actually a four-way bridge
for Maxwell but it's still high
bandwidth and as long as we line up the
parts here with two headers then it'll
it'll work well for Pascal so let's see
if this will line up that looks
promising okay so that's actually uh
it's actually lined up I'm going to be
let me needlessly neurotic here and get
it
so the MSI logos face up and so that the
extra header at the top is bleeding over
the north of the top card just because I
want it out of the way in case we're
doing something over here so they're
connected this is reasonably stable fans
like me spinning crazy fast so it's not
going to spin loose or anything like
that I am I'm happy with that for
testing I would not say this is
representative of what a user would do
because I don't don't think first of all
we can't get a screw in there unless we
like an inch long screw secondly that's
not going to work in a case but it will
work for testing and so here's the thing
we're using a ribbon a riser cable now
PCIe riser cables we've tested this have
about a 1% measurable but imperceptible
impact on framerate performance so what
does that mean here well when I say 1%
I'm talking about I tested out on
Maxwell card and it was a single card
this is Pascal first of all Pascal has
new sli rules and it's also 2 devices so
I'm not a hundred percent sure how big
the impact will be but I would expect
still somewhere around the 1 percent
area we can still get really good and
accurate results from this configuration
just know that they might be slightly
improved if we were to do it with cards
that are the same height what you want
to do anyway but in order to test the
impact of this cable I would need
two devices of the same height anyway
and I would need the high bandwidth
bridges but we have some friends at
other organized organizations who are
helping us test that so let's go ahead
and throw this on the bench we've got it
set up more or less I'll do the power
once that's connected we'll run some
benchmarks and come back with the
results alright so we've got the results
in ran all of the tests for 1070 SLI
versus 1070 standard including a 1080
and a bunch of other cards let's go
through doom ashes of singularity
Mirror's Edge catalyst the division and
gta5 I ran a lot more tests than our
present here I had help from some of our
technicians with these so check the
article links in the description below
for all of the games tested but let's
just start with a couple of the heavy
hitters here talk about power and then
we'll see what the results look like so
on the screen now is the test bench
we're using as I just said more
information in the article below for
testing methodology and results we use
two different gtx 1070 s for this test
because that's all we have available in
these early days the card one as you saw
it was the msi 1070 gaming X the other
was a reference card
we ran the SLI configuration at the
reference clock for these tests giving
us a clock versus clock comparison for a
single 1070 versus two and we also
tested the 1080 at its founders Edition
clocks in all the tests the only
instance where we tested the prio seed
msi 1070 standalone meaning one of them
at the pre OC value was in Mirror's Edge
catalyst because brand-new and we're
transitioning to the AIB partner cards
for our benchmarks let's get into it
with doom first doom does not have good
SLI scaling at this time SLI is not
officially supported in any respectable
regard and currently forces AFR to to
achieve it function without any real
gains at 4k doom is intensive on all
devices the 1080 Fe operates at 50 1.7
ish FPS average and that holds an
imperceptible but measurable lead over
the 1070 SLI configuration at 49 FPS
average that's a 5.3 percent gap that's
outside of our sort of exam I expected
1% difference from the riser but still
very small
a single gtx 1070 performs slower than
dual SL the sli GTX 1070 s by 15.3 8% so
it's really not good scaling and would
be poor value laughable value for owners
of 1070 sli but 4k is also intensive at
1440p sli shows in a more exaggerated
fashion its 1% low and 0.1% low frame
time performance which is less
consistent than single cards the SLI
configuration over a single card making
it completely pointless for doom at this
time its software and NVIDIA are
supposed to be adding a better SLI
support in the near future and volcán
but it's not here yet 1080p is just as
bad with a 3.4% delta between averages
with the single 1070 versus dual 10 70's
and doom is just like some other recent
games we've tested including Just Cause
3 Assassin's Creed syndicate and some
others where SLI just doesn't offer any
value at this time ashes of singularity
doesn't improve the narrative using the
DirectX 12 API the SLI GTX 10 70s fall
to the bottom of all charts and ashes of
singularity showing dismal frame times
like 42 point 5 4 milliseconds average
at 1080 high and DX 12 against other
Nvidia devices even the all the single
cards this is a major downturn and is a
result of SLI it would actually better
to disable a slide for ashes of
singularity and dx12 leaving the second
card to rot in the case doing nothing
the x11 performance is it more
reasonable though and frame times are
closer to a single 1070 which pushes
20.4 6 millisecond frame times averaged
vs. 23.0 2 milliseconds for SLI scaling
is around 5% for 1080p high so that's
really not good and definitely not worth
it you're gaining 5% for an extra 380 to
$450 investment but at least it's better
than the dx12 dip which was terrible
this is just one game though so you
really can't take much away from this
other than the fact that sli 1070 s
don't work well in ashes of singularity
for DX 12 and that's a very specific use
case it does not mean that they're bad
in all DX 12 games or in all games just
ashes of seeing
with dx12 let's move on to the division
the division shows an improvement over
the last few tests for K post scaling of
twenty nine point two seven percent over
a single 1070 F II card and the SLI ten
70s we're on eight point seven six
percent faster than a single GTX 1080
the one percent and 0.1 percent lows are
worse though and represent poor frame
consistency as tends to happen with SLI
1440p shows better performance for the
dual GPU setup the ten 70's in sli push
one hundred eighteen point three FPS and
hold a substantial thirty-two point
seven six percent lead over the ten
eighty as the ten eighty now the ten
seventy one percent and 0.1 percent lows
it might not be as high as they should
be but are still superior to single GPU
configurations so we're still good shape
overall against a single gtx 1070 the
SLI configuration holds a fifty point
three seven percent lead an average FPS
1080p scales about thirty eight point
three percent over a single 1070 with
the average FPS at one fifty seven in
its best-case scenario 50 percent
scaling really isn't bad for the ten 70s
and begins to show some real value but
let's see how they do in Mirror's Edge
catalyst and GTA 5 this game just came
out you can view our separate GPU
benchmark video on the title to learn
more about the results overall and
pitfalls and things like that general
intensiveness of the settings note that
we did run the GTX 970 gaming X for this
test rather than the founders edition so
we're comparing against a pre
overclocked single GPU here not the
founders Edition at 1080p hyper the gtx
1070 sli tops the bench with 105 point
six seven FPS average and retains fairly
strong 1% and 0.1% lows despite being
imperceptibly lower than the gtx 1080
the SLI configuration scales twenty
three point six eight percent over a
single gtx 1070 which is eighty three
point three FPS putting it within three
FPS of the single gtx 1080 or about a
delta of 3.5% 4k high shows a gap of
four fps between the 1080 and 1070 sli
and a gap of seventeen f
s between the 1070 and 1070 SLI the 1080
and 1070 SLI are separated by seven
point five five percent but the one
percent and 0.1 percent low metrics are
much higher on the single 1080 showing a
twenty two point three percent Delta for
one percent lows and about the same for
0.1 percent lows this is a fairly
constant trend for SLI and crossfire and
versus a single 1017 on SLI we're seeing
Delta values of thirty six point five
six percent for the average FPS with the
1% in 0.1 percent Lowe is marginally
improving note again that this single
gtx 1070 here is the gaming x so the gap
is shrunken versus a reference 1070 with
a lower clock rate at 1440p we see a
delta of 8.4 percent with the 10 70s and
sli versus the 1070 single card but
remember that the settings have changed
from high at 4k to ultra on 1440p which
shifts some of the load in the pipeline
to be more intensive after rasterization
because there's so much more
post-processing going on the 0.1% lows
are a fair bit reduced for SLI versus
the non sli set up posting forty eight
point six seven FPS zero point one
percent low vs. 63 FPS 0.1% lows 1080p
ultra was pretty uninteresting you can
see those results briefly on screen now
but check the article for more detail on
that GTA 5 at 4k it shows 55.8% scaling
versus a single gtx 1070 in the average
FPS department so that's finally a major
improvement 1% in 0.1 percent lows are
also improved in that land above 30fps
this makes 4k at very high ultra sort of
mixed settings completely playable on
sli gtx 1070 s whereas a single 1070
sees enough dips in performance in 1%
and 0.1% lows to necessitate a very
slight settings reduction versus a gtx
1080 the sli 1070 s at 4k show an
improvement of 34 point oh seven percent
so even against the $700 F II version
the 1080 we're getting a 34 percent
performance
gain with effectively reference clocks
on SLI 10 70s that's pretty reasonable
value anyway we hit a CPU bottleneck at
1080p with the GTX 1080 and SLI 10 70s
and effectively the the 1 GTX 970 all
landing at around the same 120 to 125
FPS limits so you can't really use these
results because of that bottleneck so
this is just a cross-section of our test
we also did black ops 3 shadow of mordor
and Metro last light and all those are
in the article below
very quickly black ops 3 did show some
pretty insane scaling in a good way in
some of the tests including at least 50%
gains and in some cases more than that
so it really just depends on the game
you're testing how good the gains are
others like the division or rather
Mirror's Edge catalyst Doom results are
kind of mixed in some cases or just
terrible depending on the km so it all
depends but let's talk quickly about the
power and then get into the conclusion
here just to quickly make a note of
power draw you obviously do consume more
power by going with an SLI setup versus
a single GPU setup that's an immediate
drawback but can be overlooked by some
users so it's really up to you whether
or not you fall into that group where
it's something you can overlook that's
light n 70's post a full system draw of
over 300 watts when drawing the when
running the graphics test to 3dmark
benchmark and you can see the 1070
single card and 1080 single card power
draw metrics also in this chart with the
1080 doing a bit better in terms of
power draw overall but it's weaker in
some gaming so just depends on what
you're after so that pretty much
concludes our testing of our next
Franken build which is this really crazy
riser card and it's not that crazy but I
guess a better word would be precarious
or haphazard or a lot of money waiting
to be in a trashcan if it goes if the
bridge becomes loose but we tested it it
went pretty well
I wouldn't recommend building it this
way but let's talk about if it's worth
doing at all in terms of just SLI 1070
there is a single 1070 first of all SLI
and crossfire have always been a hard
sell that's because of there's a lot of
complexity so the risk is obviously a
game comes out it's not optimized by the
developer or by the drive
is to run SLI or crossfire in such an
instance you basically end up with one
functional card and then a brick that
does nothing you disable crossfire SLI
through the control panel for your GPU
vendor turns it off doesn't do anything
so obviously as a consumer that feels
pretty bad because you've got in this
case 380 to $450 depending on the price
the card doing nothing and your build
and that could have been put towards
something like a single 1080 of course
and you'd actually be spending less
money so that's the risk with SLI now
the gain is when there are gains they're
pretty good and they can put you in
theory beyond what a single 1080 can do
which we've tested and you've seen in
some instances so that's the that's the
risk with SLI lower frame rates and poor
frame times are also an issue where
you'll see these 1% in 0.1 percent low
metrics dipping below a single 10 70
even though the average is higher and
depending on how they dip if it's a
really hard hit it introduces something
called micro stutter or really just this
sort of really nasty judder when you're
playing and that's not something you
want that's actually worse even though
you've got a higher average it plays
worse with the micro stutter so it makes
sense again to disable a slice that's
one of the other issues here AFR
introduces some of these just general
complexities having multiple devices
introduced to some of these and a lot of
games now are also moving to
interdependent frames which means that
the frames depend on one another when
they're being rendered so that's either
temporal anti-aliasing or temporal
effects or post processing all the stuff
that happens at the end of the GPU
pipeline after geometry and
rasterization that's all at the end and
when they're interdependent it's worse
for SLI that's why Nvidia is moving away
from bass lab at least in terms of 3-way
4-way SLI if not all Isolite altogether
in the future but for now they've moved
away from three-way and four-way SLI and
they require an enthusiast key to unlock
it and that's why it's because of both
these frames now the way they're being
rendered because the new API is DirectX
12 in bulk and it changes the way games
address multiple GPUs still there are
some benefits
so in black ops 3 we saw huge gains
where if you even had a 200 Hertz
monitor which is absurd you could
actually fulfill that full 200 Hertz
with 200 frames per second and you'd
actually be saturating it depending on
your graphic settings of course 1080p
you'd be fine
1440p I think we're at 180 FPS which is
tremendous so a lot of frames for a game
like black ops 3 so it there are
benefits and black ops 3 is one of those
games that's actually very almost
surprisingly well optimized for all
vendors so there's there's good things
we saw 50% scaling and beyond in games
like GTA 5 sometimes in the division
that's useful for 144 Hertz gaming or
just to make 4k playable because GTA 5
very high in ultra settings 4k is not
really perfectly playable on even at
1080 and the 10 70s in SLI step past
that and make it now pretty playable
more than 70 FPS in some instances so
that's good too
and then 210 70s can Kotwal will cost
more than 1 1080 so that's one thing to
note here 110 80 you buy cheap one 600
bucks buy middle-of-the-road one 650
bucks
let's just let's put these up sort of
the low-end let's say you buy these for
$400 each that's $800 so spending 200 to
150 more for this setup so you want to
get 200 150 more performance out of it
and that doesn't always happen even at
its best though we're still we're seeing
deltas of around 30% versus a single
1080 so that's decent but whether that's
worth it is up to you and it depends on
a game too so it can cancel out
depending on if you're playing a lot of
different types of games where 1070 just
doesn't even work in some instances like
doom then you kind of lose out multi-gpu
it's still a hassle it's still a big bet
to make you sort of have to look at our
data on a game by game basis decide for
yourself if you like it or not and
hopefully the data is not for you to
make that decision now I don't normally
personally give an opinion on what I
would do with if I were in your
situation trying to buy cards but I
normally do with SLI and crossfire and
that's because it's kind of a weird
genre of buying devices that is hard to
figure out on your own so here's what I
would do I would not buy 210 70s
personally and I've said this I think in
every SLI or crossfire test we've done I
would still buy a single card that's
because I play a lot of different types
of games when I do play games and I
don't want to deal with the issue of it
just not working which is what happens
with something like doom or some of the
other games we've tested so Ash is a
singularity is another good example so I
would still be buying a single card
maybe a 1080 if I were spending that
much money or waiting and seeing what
else comes out of course the four ATS
are coming out they're talking big about
Crossfire's will try and validate that
see if the claims are reasonable and if
they are and if crossfire does better
than SLI well maybe that'd be a
reasonable option but otherwise I'd be
looking at a 1080 rather than 210 70s
save some money you get good performance
sure in some games you're 30% slower but
it's still so good that's kind of who
cares so that's how I look at it but as
always all the informations on the
