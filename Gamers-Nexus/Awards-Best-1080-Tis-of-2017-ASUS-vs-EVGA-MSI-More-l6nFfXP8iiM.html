at some motherboards and soon coolers
we're now looking at the best GTX 1080p
eyes of the year because this is such an
expensive purchase and we looked at
quite a few of them we thought we'd
round it all up in one video contrary to
popular belief the bottle of cooler does
actually matter for video cards will be
going through thermal and noise data for
the 1080p eyes we've tested including
MOSFET vram and GPU temperatures always
normalize performance at 40 DBA and the
PCB and vrm quality as always with these
guides you can find links to all the
products discussed in the description
below
along with their original reviews before
we get into that this content is brought
to you by the thermal take flow RGB
closed-loop liquid cooler which is a
three hundred sixty millimeter radiator
plus three 120 fans that are RGB
illuminated if then we'll take it ring
fans at that this is a 4.5 done a stack
pump which is one of the faster pumps
you can learn more at the link in the
description below
with video cards if you're just looking
at gaming benchmarks it's pretty easy to
basically see all the 1080 is or 1070 S
or 5 ATS and come to a conclusion of
they're all the same but the thing is
once you look beyond the gaming
performance and the clock performance
basically you get into territory of how
granular do you want to be on thermals
and on noise how much do you care about
noise normalized performance vrm quality
things like that so we've got a roundup
for you of all the cards we've tested at
least the ones that deserve to be
included in the roundup and the quick
sort of note here gaming performance
between these is all the same it's
within a couple FPS so the only reason
that ever changes is overclocking and
overclocking on 1080 Ti is a non Pascal
in general is more a function of silicon
quality per chip which is nearly random
than it is of the PCB or the vrm or
anything like that until you get into
heavier overclocking where you're doing
exotic cooling or maybe you go with
liquid and you need the vrm thermal
headroom so we'll be focused on the
cooler quality PCB and vrm design and
clocks are sort of a secondary function
of all of those because basically with
Pascal the cooler you keep it the better
the clock will be
so we can just kind of figure that out
by looking at the thermal performance
which makes it easy the first award is
the most important and is assigned for
the best overall combination of thermal
and noise performance so basically the
best overall ten atti sort of ignoring
price for the most part across all
tested thermal categories that be vram
mosfet GPU diode temperatures we found
that h2 Strix 10 atti to be the most
consistent and impressive and it's their
own performance the Strix keeps its core
temperature low but also manages to keep
vram and vrm thermals equally and
proportionally low to the core this
can't be said for a lot of the competing
coolers all of this comes down to
mounting plates for the heatsink and the
fact that ACS is actually leveraging the
mass of its 2.5 slot fin stack and fin
design pitch and density also all permit
good air flow through the sink the
shroud doesn't trap air inside of the
cooler either so these are all good
things at $800 it's sort of the limit of
what we're willing to spend on a 1080i
and is one of the more expensive ones so
you really have to care about noise
normalized performance keeping the
lowest they're almost possible for the
lowest noise possible across all
components things like that obviously
liquid potentially gets better there too
the only category where the Strix cooler
really loses some ground is that of size
but size and cooling to noise
performance are largely mutually
exclusive at 2.5 slots
some users may instead require a 2 slot
card to better accommodate build needs
for a single card build though this
generally isn't a concern we want to
give an honorable mention to MSI and the
1080 TI gaming X here it's a little bit
cheaper so that helps out the Twin Frozr
cooler remains the most effective dual
fan solution we've tested this year it's
able to leverage its larger fans to spin
out lower quieter rpms than some of its
competition and the Twin Frozr design
isn't the best buy raw numbers but it
has an excellent mix of noise to cooling
performance and manages this at a lower
price than some of the flat-out best
coolers like the Strix that price
reduction matters and to offer a
competitive cooler at a lower price MSI
gets an honorable mention even if it's
not outright the best we are interested
to see how the company improves its dual
fan design for 2018 if at all now that
it's been
three fan designs this next category
best for modding I could also be taken
to me in most room for improvement the
MSI GTX 1080i armor was originally a
$700 bottom-of-the-barrel 1080i rivaling
the reference card in price and was for
good reason
we found the stock cooler to be abysmal
and its performance thermally was just
not good it wasn't good acoustically
either we also noted that the cooler was
highly similar they're not entirely the
same as the coolers that MSI uses on the
1070 armor cards the upshot of this
though is that you can get a very cheap
and very good PCB and vrm for
entry-level 1080i prices the best kept
secret of the 1080 T is is that the
1080i armor for all of its faults and
there are many actually has the gaming X
PCB which is one of the better ones the
gaming XP CB is as 16 of the 50 18 s GS
hooks up to 8 inductors controlled by 8
driver icees and gives an eight phase--
vrm with four MOSFETs per phase the
fairchild dual FET packages contain that
both the highside and low-side FETs and
there's over built erm outputs just 15
watts of heat under a typical 250 amp
load or 40 watts of heat under a 400 amp
overclock that's assuming 125 Celsius on
the components for 300 kilohertz for the
switching frequency if you're hoping to
buy a 1080 TI and convert it into a
liquid-cooled card something that we
tested with this very card this is one
of the best options you're discarding
the cooler anyway at that point so
there's no point in spending on a big
one get a cheaper cooler like the one on
the armor and a good PCB for the
baseline and our testing with a
closed-loop liquid cooler the armored
PCB became one of the best cards on our
thermal charts and that is while
retaining one of the better PCBs and one
of the lower prices you definitely
wouldn't want this thing with its stock
cooler but its primes for modding our
next category is for best technology
which is assigned to the card that made
the biggest contribution to the
underlying tech in an AI v partner card
for 2017 this one goes to the EVGA icx
cards responsible for implementing NTC
thermistors across the entire pc be
improving vrm cooling by increasing
baseplate service area and significantly
overhauling a/c acts after the great
thermal pad incident
sixteen video cards don't change much
generationally so to see a company move
to install thermistors on critical non
GPU components is big it may not seem
like a big deal to the average user but
if you think about it from a testing
perspective icx gives us new tools to
improve thermal testing accuracy of
aftermarket coolers water cooling
solutions and blocks and validate our
own external case temperature
measurements of VRMs with our
thermocouples icx has become a tool for
benchmarking as it's easy to measure
temperatures of components that would
usually go unrecognized this also as far
as the consumer is concerned this comes
at a time when other manufacturers have
dropped the ball on vrn thermals like
ZOTAC with the AB extreme and it's poor
thermal performance when compared to the
sheer mass of its own cooler as GPUs
continue to reduce power consumption and
cards get smaller temperatures of other
components outside the GPU core become
increasingly relevant this is because
you can run at lower fan speed because
the core doesn't need as much cooling
but now your vrm is going to get a bit
warmer icx complements what we do with
our own thermocouples well has become an
important tool for testing other cooler
designs and is one of the biggest
technological changes in coolers for
this year our next award is for best
value thus far other than the armor a
lot of these cards have been in these
750 to $800 range you definitely don't
need a card that expensive to get the
same frame rates and the acoustic or
thermal difference isn't universally
important to people so we were split
between the 1080i SC black and the 1080i
Duke from MSI given the current pricing
of the market the MSI Duke is winning
this card ranges from at 735 to 750
depending on retailer rebates and sales
and adds up priced about where the
gaming axe used to be before the mining
craziness but we have to work with it
the SE black used to be closer to 720
but is unfortunately out of stock at
that price or boosted to 750 now making
the Duke a bit cheaper and for pure
value we'd recommend considering the MSI
card on the opposite end of the value
argument we also wanted to point out the
best PCB and vrm and to quote build Zoid
the most ridiculous overkill PCB and vrm
this isn't something that 99% of users
will ever need but if you're going for a
heavy overclocking or just like looking
at high-end stuff
the galaxy GTX 1080i hof video card is
among the top tier cards build Zoid of
actually hardcore overclocking did an
analysis on this card and believes it to
be the best PCB of the 1080 is the
galaxy all of fame v core vrm is a 16
phase vrm which again the quote build
Zoid is ridiculous and absolutely insane
my galaxy Hof uses an ir 3595 voltage
controller and eight phase mode using a
doubling scheme on the 16 phase setup
for the card the vrm ends up with 40
watts of heat dissipation at 400 amps or
54 watts at 500 apps both of which are
reasonably controllable with targeted
and active cooling the dumbest trend
award or as we've been calling it the
best dumbest trend it goes to gigantic
heat sinks and what can only be
described as a measuring contest some
manufacturers have continued to increase
the mass and physical size of their GPU
coolers often with minimal gain in
thermal performance in some cases being
outperformed by two slot coolers even a
noise normalize performance not much of
a gain
what's worse is a lot of the
manufacturers are overlooking cooling
basics with their massive coolers like
physically connecting hot vrm components
to the oversized heatsink rather than
letting them sit and bake underneath it
sort of the entire point of a big cooler
really stretching into three slot
designs with three pounds of metal
doesn't make the cooler automatically
good it just means that it's big and
often times not at all worth that it
cost to buy or manufacture there are a
lot of good 2.5 slot designs out there
like a messiah's twin frozer and the
asus strix coolers and cards like the
gigabyte extreme or ZOTAC extreme are
larger than each of these yet worse in
some of the comparative thermal
performance this comes down to smarter
design as opposed to just using more
metal for the sake of looking bigger and
as we go into the next year hopefully
the reliance on just loading a card with
copper and aluminum to make it look
impressive will die down a bit as on
card thermistors and things like that
become more prevalent because that means
testing of non GPU components will
become more prevalent and if it doesn't
we're still here and we'll still be
doing it so in always check with us
subscribe for more as always that's the
GPU list for 1080 T eyes we have one of
these coming
or basically all the cards more of an
overall roundup of best in each category
type of thing so subscribe for that
