nexus tonight we're here at PAX East
2015 at the forced to booth that i'm
joined by Stefan groaning the CEO of
beta tofu we looked at first one when it
was new and gave it a review really
enjoyed it so we're back now we can have
forced to can you give us a quick
overview of force to yeah so forced to
is way different than than the first one
it's it's way more procedural generated
it's also allows focused on single
player there probably will be a two
player component to it later on for
right now it's more focused on small
snippets of action in a Cadillac enforce
actually where it's ten minutes but we
also introduced tech building into the
game so we actually have to build a deck
before we go into the match and then
sort of utilize the deck that you
brought their best possible yeah how do
the deck building mechanics work yeah so
in each match to face a boss and you
have to complete a certain amount of
arenas to get there before or after you
complete each arena you get to draw one
card from your deck plus you get some
manner and then you have to spend it
wisely and how many how many cards for
deck so you have 30 cops Bodega and you
simply pick them from your collection
and you'll you unlock more cops the more
you play visually so deck building in an
action game seems like an interesting
mix how has it worked out so far how do
you feel about the mechanical
interaction I feel super confident about
it now because we've iterated it for on
it for so long and and also this chest
here well it's like thousand players
talking about it is really making a one
confident yeah I'd say it's it's a kind
of an untried thing before we have some
like hands of fate and other games
coming that tries it a little we are
super focused on like empowering your
champion building and like a mobile
character with your deck which is like a
difference between hands and fate and us
and I think it works super well because
you don't really go into the game and
have the except same fireball we have to
sort of dream your character and then
hope you get the right combo as you play
first one was four player co-op and was
pretty heavily focused on Co
didn't work as well in single player
still fun but what about forced to yeah
so if post one foster will be super
focused on single player we want to make
that fun this time and then when or if
we do i'm pretty sure we'll do a two
player co-op to start with we'll make
that super fun before we go into three
or four player co-op i know that's a big
shocker from a lot of people but we want
to like not just to a seagull that's
very much the only justice ego we want
it to be very experimental with the
formula and it's also continuing like
the story because before you graduated
from your gladiator school now you're in
the eternal arenas where you sort of
fight for the ultimate honor very cool
so for more information on forced to
where should they go watch the release
date for stuco or facebook / whatever
falls the game and release date we were
aiming for an early exit September but
it will not be like a I don't know
experimental version it will be a pretty
solid product when it hits early access
so price is now finally keep an eye out
for force to as we approach September
and we will see you all next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
