heat sinks the integrated heat spreader
with a copper one from rocket coal
technically the one I just held up the
and the included one is also covered but
it's a nickel plated copper and it has a
bit less surface area than what we have
here this is basically the same product
as when we reviewed the Intel one from
Rocket cool except obviously larger and
custom-made for the risin AP use today
we're going to look and see if the
copper custom IHS actually does anything
thermally and whether it's worth it or
not
before that this is brought to you by
the correct pronunciation of Jif
sponsored by Nvidia's GeForce experience
and MSI's 1080 Jamie and X we use g4s
experiences shadowplay to capture J and
play footage of popular James like Grand
Theft Auto 5 and pop G fun fact the G
stands for jiff learn more at the link
in the description below to grab
shadowplay or the msi gtx 1080 Jamie
necks the major difference with the
Rocket cool intel heatsink that we
tested previously was that it has
slightly more surface area than the
stock Intel IHS and that gave it a bit
of an advantage for cooling this one
isn't as much that way and the n' rise
and IH asses are basically perfectly
flat on the top they don't have the
chamfered edges like the intel ones do
and that's kind of where rocky cool is
able to gain some of their service area
with the Intel copper heatsink that they
made again they're both copper heat
sinks IHS is it's just that one is
nickel plated and one's not not a huge
difference other than a non nickel
plated one is really hard to scrub
liquid metal off of but if you're not
doing what we do that's pretty much an
irrelevant point when you are doing any
kind of deleting what we've learned from
Intel and now from AMD is that the
thermal performance difference is not
just from removing the stock Tim and
replacing it with liquid metal we use
thermal grisly conduct or not but also
removing the silicone adhesive that sits
between the IHS and the substrate that
creates a bit of an air gap between the
die and IHS and they fill it with their
own pace so it's not like it's just air
but having that much extra thrown pace
means that you have that much more
material to go through the transfer your
heat to the copper which is the IHS and
eventually to your actual heatsink
that's mounted to it have
any kind of interface is suboptimal
ultimately we need them to fill
imperfections and services to account
for manufacturing tolerance issues like
again with the air gaps that are created
from silicone adhesive on both the AP US
and Intel CPUs and so we needed a
thermal interface but because we're
individual users and we're willing to
spend the while take the risk and spend
a bit of time you can improve cooling
overall by deleting this something we
already showed with the our 320 200 G
previously where we overclocked it kind
of lightly the point of the overclock
wasn't to push it far but was to
generate a lot of heat which we did and
then tested it and saw a significant
improvement more than 10 degrees in a
lot of cases this time we're doing the
same thing except we're taking two new
tests here one is with the copper IHS
from rocket cool the raw copper we'll
call IHS and the other one is with
silicon adhesive removed completely
versus not removed so that we can see
how much of the difference is a result
of the IHS change and how much is a
difference as a result of the silicone
adhesive removal so we're testing
methodology as always go to the link in
the description below for the article
where we'll talk more about how this was
tested what software was used all those
questions you have questions go to the
article what we're testing today is a
few main things that you need to pay
attention to one is stock CPU with
silicone adhesive unmodified and with
thermal paste from Andy complete factory
stock the next one stock CPU with a
stock IHS from AMD and with liquid metal
thermal grizzly conductor not in this
case the next one stock CB with stock
IHS liquid metal and silicone adhesive
removed and then finally the copper IHS
from rocket cool without any silicone
adhesive so it's that pretty much give
us a full sweep of everything let's go
through the performance tests so getting
straight to it we see the rocket cool
copper IHS is the highest performer on
the chart exiting error margins and
plotting a two degree improvement over
the next best which is the stock IHS
with the silicone adhesive completely
removed that marked us at twenty eight
point one degrees celsius over ambient
forty died both of these tests used
thermal grisly conduct or not which will
link below and had the silicone adhesive
completely cleaned off of the substrate
and the IHS the next test is our deleted
thermal result with silicone adhesive
still present on the substrate
but with liquid metal applied and
obviously a deleted processor that had
us @ 32.6 degrees over ambient showing a
four degree improvement to 28.1 where we
ran the same test but without the
silicone adhesive with it completely
cleaned off the reduction in the gap
between the IHS and dye is responsible
for this performance uplift note that
this is outside of error margins for
reference we previously measured the
stock 2200 G with stock Tim and adhesive
at 47 degrees Celsius over ambient
although it was overclocked so not that
stock and that marked minimally a 14
degree reduction to our D lid with
liquid metal deleting and painstakingly
removing all of the adhesive got us
another couple of degrees the rocket
cool IHS does offer benefits that exit
error margins and are measurable and
it's to the tune of about 2 degrees
Celsius not world rending but certainly
measurable so going back to the coffee
lake 1 then if you didn't see it we put
this on the 8700 K and it was 20 bucks
our conclusion with this was that we
observed about a four to five degree
improvement with the custom rocket cool
IHS and for that side of things we said
basically it's 20 bucks this isn't going
to change the game a lot for you in
terms of overclocking but for a piece of
copper it's pretty damn impressive
performance uplift to have an extra 4
degrees of headroom when this is what
you're changing you'd be hard-pressed to
find 4 degree differences between a lot
of the liquid coolers on the market so
that alone was impressive but again it's
not something that you purchase looking
to increase your overclock in
significant ways it's really it's a it's
a way to give yourself an excuse to have
something fun to do with computers for
an afternoon that was our conclusion it
was this is a really fun Saturday
project for an impulse purchase price of
20 bucks so you can't go to wrong with
it and as long as you're not expecting a
ton it's a fun project it makes your CPU
more unique and yes you do get a couple
of extra degrees which if you were to
try and stretch out the argument you
could say that that allows you to run
your fans a couple of percentage points
slower therefore lower in here noise
marginally so there are some potential
real benefits but ultimately it's about
having a project to do and the
conclusion is more or less the same with
AP use but the difference between in our
testing the rocking cool IHS for the our
320 200 G and the stock IHS for the our
322 energy is much smaller it's it's
about two degrees as opposed to four to
five with the Intel one there are a few
reasons for that one of them is that the
our 322 energy comparatively is a lot
lower heat flux than something like an
8700 K you're dealing with less heat
you're dealing with way less power and
there's a lot less to dissipate so any
differences are going to be smaller
another reason that we don't see the big
changes is because the design of the AMD
ia jazz there's a lot of different form
Intel's its first of all it's a pretty
big IHS and secondly Intel again has
these chamfered edges around it on the
outside where rocky cool had some design
liberties they could eliminate a couple
of those and modify it so that there's a
bit of extra surface area for
dissipating the heat which helped out a
bit obviously so at the end of the day
same kind of thing with the AMD one as
the in Taiwan just the thermal
difference is objectively less in terms
of measurable gains or improvements than
the Intel option because again of the
design differences and the power output
differences ultimately we still think
it's definitely worth deleting the APS
if you feel like it if you're
comfortable with it though the copper
IHS isn't necessary deleting isn't
either to be fair you don't need to do
it but if you're using it in a living
room HTPC and you demand silence for
example deleting drops the thermals
enough that you could then drop fan
speeds significantly we're not talking
four degrees here we're talking more
than 10 that ultimately meets the
original littered results if you were to
lower your fan speeds with more thermal
Headroom so you'd be able to have
significantly quieter fans overall
rocket cools D later works great for
this and is something that we can
recommend we've got a couple of them so
we'll show that in b-roll as well but
the rocket cool D later for the AP use
we've used it a couple of times now and
have had no problems at all in terms of
safety quick recommendation on it if
you're going to use their deal
we'd recommend that when you put the CPU
into the socket and start the delayed
process with it which is turning a screw
we recommend that you flip it over so if
the IHS is down that would be the AMD
included IHS at this point facing down
that way when the lid the seal breaks on
the lid comes off you have gravity
working with you not against you so the
lid should fall away from the SMDs there
are a lot of surface mount devices on
these ap use that means there is some
more risk of damaging them but because
rocket cools D litter is an actual tool
meant for this you're way safer than the
way we did it originally which was a
vise and a razor blade so pretty safe
overall and in the very least again you
don't need to do it you definitely don't
need the copper heatsink neither of
these things are necessary to use the
processor as it is but if you want some
extra Headroom it's definitely worth it
the heatsink less so than deleting
deleting is not difficult with this
though just throw some liquid metal on
it when you're done reseal it and you're
good to go and the IHS if you want to
just have something more unique I guess
throw it on there while you're at it
it's 20 bucks no big loss if it's only a
couple degrees better so that's it for
