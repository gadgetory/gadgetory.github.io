speculation around and these rise and
chips we finally have some official
notes on the bass specs core clock
things like that and the pricing for the
risin mine up we also have critically
tell the names officially this time and
that starts with the horizon are seven
series of chips of course we would
expect more would come later but for
today all we have officially is
information on the r7 chip so the three
main ones are the r7 1700 and this is
low end to high-end 1700 the 1700 x and
the 1800 x again all are 7 and the
prices for those in order 330 dollars
for the r7 1700 400 for the 1700 x + 500
for the 1800 x before getting to the
core specifications for the rest of the
products this coverage is brought to you
by our patreon backers at patreon.com /
gamers nexus do you want to help fund a
more on-site coverage like this for each
of these chips we're looking at the rise
in our seven seventeen hundred at three
point 0 gigahertz for its base and 3.7
for boost there's also xfr for these
products of course but we don't have
full specifications of that just yet
let's go through the specs for each of
the three chips that was announced today
the r7 1700 all of these are eight cores
and 16 threads its base is 3 point 0
gigahertz boost is 3.7 and TDP is 65
watts and that's 330 dodge if the r7
1700 x also eight core 16 thread 2.4
gigahertz base 3.8 boost 95 watt TDP at
four hundred dollars and the 1800 x is a
3.6 gigahertz chip base and boost to
four-point-oh again there's some xfr
Headroom in there as well that we'll
talk about more on the review which is
forthcoming and that's the 95 watt TDP
chip as well at five hundred dollars in
terms of availability these are all
supposed to be available on March second
that's when they will actually be
available to purchase probably our
review will go live around the same time
or on that day these will technically be
available for pre-order as of today but
as always we recommend waiting for our
review no matter what the product is a
game hardware software wait for the
review before pre ordering just because
that's the wise thing to do so we would
recommend waiting even though pre-orders
are
open andy says there should be
availability and that's products
available you shouldn't be a problem of
course it could sell out but even still
better to just wait on the pre-orders in
terms of other items of note from this
presentation the main one is just that
we're looking at a stack of our seven
ships that are supposed to compete with
Intel's i7 so the 1700 is supposed to
compete with the 7700 k kv lake chip in
terms of direct head-to-head pricing and
performance competition the 1700 x at
four hundred dollars is more of a 6800 k
competitor and the 1800 x at 500 is more
of a competitor to me $1,000 intel chips
like the 6900 k also at the editors day
in san francisco and ear and the usual
listing of benchmarks of cinebench would
be the main one and side by side
performance comparisons with intel cpus
are similar to what we've seen a
previous editors day events like this no
one but they were kind of reiterated
here these are all the numbers were
about to show you are all and the intern
also again usual grain of salt with
manufactured benchmark we'll run our own
of course but to give you an idea of
where things stack up from andy's own
testing we're looking at the r7 1700 x
placing the CB score of 15 at 37 with
the system that they use and the i760
900 k placing the cv score of 14 74th
that's a slight improvement on AMD side
the r7 1700 versus the i7 7700 k is a
lot more interesting that one has a 1700
at 1410 CB marks and the 7700 k at nine
67 @ CB mark so quite a big difference
there we don't know the exact
configuration of the system and things
like that so hang around for our
benchmarks but that gives you a baseline
idea at least of where AMD projects its
performance to land and there were also
some other ad hoc benchmarks like there
was a sniper elite demo where we saw
some gameplay of sniper elite it's
really just a side by side to give a
general idea of these two processors
from andy and from intel / for more or
less the same I wouldn't read too far
into any hard FPS numbers you see out of
that demo because it's not like it was
run in a contained scientific
environment there were different objects
and challenge count screen for one PP
than the other and when you have a whole
bunch of sky box from
screen it's going to favor the processor
with all the Sky box on the screen so
I'll leave that there wait for the game
benchmark again from us but they had one
that should somewhat comparable
performance and we've seen that before
with battlefield one at CES and at a
previous and the editors day event so
that's most of the basics there's more
advanced architecture stuff we'll cover
in the review the main thing here is
that this is a departure then is moving
away from the bulldozer architecture of
having a shared floating-point unit per
core or per module it is now a private
FP unit private simdi private l2 cache
for each core and that should help a lot
with floating point performance which
with games is critical and with overall
performance and power efficiency that's
the main item of note there's a there
are a few other things that are known
David Cantor is peace for micro positive
report details a lot of this like the
micro of cash which should help reduce
x86 instruction overhead is also
redesigned l1 cache and everything's of
course saving for lower power more
efficiency stuff like that so as always
article in the description below for
more information on some of the basics
of the architecture check back probably
around the second door on the second for
our full review and otherwise stack up
looks pretty good right now it's all 8
cores 16 threads that's what the gun for
for the future clock speeds look
competitive and the initial cinebench
data even if it's from AMD does look
competitive so it looks like good
product overall to keep an eye on damen
axis on that for more information
