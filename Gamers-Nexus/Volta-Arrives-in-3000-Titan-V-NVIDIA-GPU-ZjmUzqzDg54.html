enough to get you some of the basics the
Titan V is a three thousand dollar
Nvidia graphics card it is not meant for
gamers
it is a scientific workload and
computational card including abilities
for deep learning and machine learning
data sets where you need a lot of memory
this has 12 gigabytes of HP m2 and you
also need some specialized hardware like
tensor cores which were detailed when
the Volta architecture was shown at GDC
this year before that this video is
brought to you by thermal Grizzly makers
of the conductor hot liquid metal that
we recently used to drop 20 degrees off
of our temperatures thermal grizzly also
makes traditional thermal compounds we
use on top of the IHS like cryo not and
Hydra not pastes learn more at the link
below as for core specs the card is a
250 watt TDP it uses a Volta GV 100 GPU
and is powered by a single 8 pin and
single 6 pin power connector this is
cooled by the standard nvidia heatsink
and fan using a vapor chamber and the
cooler is pretty much added to limits in
terms of cooling capabilities at this
TDP as for the other specs
it's got 50 120 cuda cores 640 tensor
cores alongside those and the clock on
the cuda cores is 12 hundred megahertz
at base or 1455 megahertz boost
so we're bit lower than something like a
1080i but targeting a much different
market where things are perhaps less
frequency intensive then for example
games they want more cores instead the
card also hosts 320 TM use or texture
map units and we've got a block diagram
from the original Volta announcement
that we can show this is from earlier
this year the V 100 and you can just see
how packed in the SMS are on each of the
G pcs but this is somewhat standard if
we drill down deeper there and look at
the SM layout this is also from the
Volta 100 announcement you'll see how
the SMS are architected as opposed to
the usual layout typically in something
like a gaming card you don't see the
heavy saturation of F
64 into FP 32 and tensor Coors
all-in-one you basically just see FP 32
for something like gaming with maybe a
little bit of FP 64 on the side if it's
one of the older architectures
especially when there was more focus on
double precision one of the major
examples of the differences between this
and one of the modern gaming
architectures like Pascal is that the FP
32 saturation here is only 64 units for
the entire SM so one SM gives you 64
units of FP 32 similar to what we've
seen on some other scientific
architectures whereas the 1080i for
example runs 128 units that would be on
the same SM so the SM architecture is
much different on a scientific card than
it is on a gaming card you really
wouldn't have obviously a great gaming
experience on a $3,000 scientific card
but this is the first step to Volta
coming out to the mainstream and that's
probably going to be next year as for
other information that might interest
you this reference board has a 16 phase
vrm it's unlikely that Nvidia will
produce or allow partner models of this
card but the reference board has plenty
of phases to work with the Titan v is
also equipped with the same combined l1
and shared memory as seen on GB 100
architectures earlier announced and that
means that the developers should
theoretically have an easier time
working on CUDA or tensor workload
software development by leveraging the
combined l1 cache and shared memory and
for one final bit of perspective here
for you the Titan V host 21 point 1
billion transistors the GTX 1080 TI runs
12 billion and the previous Pascal
predecessor to the V 100 the GP 100 runs
at fifteen point three billion
transistors so the increase in
transistor count is noteworthy as is
presumably the increase in performance
in targeted workloads that like machine
learning and deep learning hence the
tensor integration with Volta we'll have
more information on all of this as we
get more this is a brand new
announcement we weren't even embargoed
on it
so I'm learning this as
as you are right now but there's more to
learn about Volta of course rolling into
next year otherwise stay tuned to the
channel subscribe for more you can catch
the follow up coverage check the article
linked in the description below we will
be updating it if any more information
comes out and patreon.com/scishow stuff
is out directly or go to store it out
gamers nexus net to become a shirt like
this one
if you'd rather support us there thank
you for watching I'll see you all next
