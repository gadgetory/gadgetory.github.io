that game news this week starts the
latest from Blizzard overwatch launched
an open beta on the third of May and ran
until the eleventh and Blizzard has
officially stated that the beta period
brought in 9.7 million players in that
period for some comparison competing FPS
arena hero action team game RPG thin
battleborn brought in two million people
on its five-day open beta in April
overwatch wasn't all Blizzard gave us to
talk about however following the
acquisition of MLG in January we were
all left wondering what Activision
Blizzard's eSports announcement would be
and now the chairman of Activision
Blizzard media networks Steve bornstein
has spoken out on the topic bornstein
was previously the CEO of ESPN and
launched the NFL Network and will be
leveraging that experience with the
activision blizzard's freshly announced
a Facebook partnership to stream the
company's major eSports titles that will
include Call of Duty hearthstone heroes
of the storm and even Starcraft 2 or
what's left of it anyway one of the
companies at first shows to be streamed
on the Facebook live platform will be
the esports report Activision's take on
ESPN's SportsCenter in addition to
eSports news the esports report will
contain real-time statistics with live
programming this feature will bring
viewers statistics that update live
during the tournament the first event to
make use of these features will be MLG
anaheim and the Call of Duty World
League starting on june twelfth star
wars battlefront has sold over 14
million copies since its november launch
though the pc audience has declined
significantly now after an investor call
EA announced a new battlefront title in
2017 major information about the game
has yet to be revealed like the title
for instance or the release date or the
setting of the timeline or really
anything else of note because the title
isn't on the list of EA's game slated
for the 2017 fiscal year March is when
ea's fiscal year ends and in addition to
this battlefront announcement EA has
announced the upcoming Star Wars titles
that will use details from other
upcoming Star Wars films including rogue
one and an untitled Han Solo film the
main series will also be included on top
of a new battlefront sequel EA has
announced their plans to release a new
star wars game every
year for the next four years this news
to coincides with respawn
entertainment's recent confirmation that
they're working on a third-person
action-adventure star wars game further
some small amount of footage has been
leaked recently concerning a Star Wars
RTS game as well after a period on vimeo
the footage was taken down was of course
uploaded to youtube taken down and I'm
sure that process has repeated EA has
yet to make any comment on the game and
there's no Star Wars RTS that's been
officially announced by the company but
if the game still lives and if it's
actually going to be made it will be the
first Star Wars RTS since empire at war
released ten years ago but that's enough
Star Wars news ea wasn't the only one
with major investor reports this week
Ubisoft had its own call that announced
their plans through March 2017 most of
their upcoming games are already known
including it watchdogs to Ghost Recon
wildlands and southpark the fractured
but hall and for otter however these
four titles are being joined by an
as-yet-unnamed game the unnamed title
won't be a sequel either but an entirely
new triple AI p we've been disappointed
by new at Ubisoft ip's in the past here
at GN like watch dogs for obvious
example where I tore it apart for 30
minutes but a big game company taking
risks on a new franchise is always
exciting news and hopefully it actually
works out so that's all for this week's
game news check out the doom coverage if
you're interested in that type of thing
definitely a very pretty looking game if
nothing else and as always pay Charlie
