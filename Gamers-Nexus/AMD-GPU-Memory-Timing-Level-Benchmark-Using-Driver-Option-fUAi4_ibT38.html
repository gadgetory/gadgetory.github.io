its conception was build Zoid who came
to me and said I want to do something
and that is an immediate sign that you
should be afraid so builds I'd wanted to
provide a custom BIOS for our X 570 that
had some timings tweaks to it this is
something that you might have done a
year two years ago if your remaining or
something like that but you can also do
some timings tweaks that might affect
performance in things like games and so
we started the idea with a custom BIOS
and with some memory timing tuning on
the video card so for the rx 570 and
expanded from there to use a and these
built-in timing tuning through their
drivers today we're looking at how that
affects performance if at all between an
rx 570 and Vega 56 before that this
video is brought to you by drop and
their HD 6 xx headphones the 6 xx
headphones offer high-quality audio
output with wide device compatibility
mouth drops 6 XX also includes a 6 foot
cable with 3.5 millimeter plug alongside
a quarter inch adapter for those who
might want to plug into an app the 6 XX
focuses its energy into balancing the
sound leaning toward warmer and bass
your audio they're also easy to
disassemble and replace individual parts
making these headphones trivial to
maintain for long-term use
learn more at the link below this
content ended up being really
straightforward so unfortunately the
BIOS that we applied from builds hood we
did have issues getting it to really
work properly it worked it applied
builds I did provide a BIOS that just
changed the the memory strap and the end
result was using the different variants
that builds it supplied us the card
which is not stable it was freezing it
was crashing and it just couldn't
complete benchmarks so there is more
tuning we can do and for this specific
card it was just struggling so we might
need a different video card with
different memory modules or something
but there's still stuff we can do
through software through third-party
software especially from AMD there's a
lot of memory tools out there for
various and the devices CPUs and GPUs
alike so there's salt or we can use but
what we ended up doing for this one is
just sticking with
the drivers because ages ago when Scott
Watson visited us we said we wanted to
benchmark the AMD timing tuning utility
in the new driver set that tuning
utility is really just a drop-down so
it's got automatic which is stocks
that's the stock timings so when you're
thinking of different memory timings for
GPU is you have gddr5 and HBM these are
different from DDR but in some sense the
actual timing options are similar it's
just the numbers will be different and
there are a few different options mixed
in there as well so it's it's very
simple for the drivers it's automatic
which is stock level one which we don't
know exactly what that does it's all
hidden in the software or level two
don't know what that does either but we
tested those three and then hopefully
our plan is to either work with Bill
Boyd and get a BIOS for a different card
that'll accept it and run without
crashing or use a software utility to do
manual / timing tuning on GPUs which
we're not particularly skilled at
because we've never had to do it but
it's something we could hack around with
and see if there's any difference in the
results when changing the memory timings
for the video card all we're doing for
these tests then is running the RX 570
and Vega 56 through some benchmarks with
the AMD driver changes to level 1 level
2 timings we did a lot of test passes so
for fire striking four times by it ran
dozens of test passes per per line in
the chart and that allows us to
established a really tight tolerance for
errors so we can see exactly how much
variance there is and then for games we
ran the usual games and test passes we
did validation passes for these old
stock results so there's have been
updated for this test and then the rest
of it is well it's stuff like we did
testing with and without rebooting and
that didn't change anything either so
let's get through the results and talk
about the the data if Andy's driver
utility for memory timings does anything
in games and gaming workloads which fire
striking time so I are a quick note as
well our understanding is that these
were initially introduced to the AMD
drivers because crypto miners were doing
timing tuning and it actually did Matt
it actually encrypt through
cryptocurrency and mining our
understanding from from speaking with
fields right and AMD is that it really
did influence the performance games are
different a lot different they're so
different that it was cryptocurrency
mining you can plug into an x1 PCIe slot
and you're fine with games if you do
that you're completely ruined for your
performance so they behave very
differently and this is why the
performance in gaming is going to be a
lot different than what you'd see in
crypto mining in terms of the
improvement from using these drivers so
let's get into the numbers after running
dozens of tests we found firestrike to
have a standard deviation of about 0.2
to F ps4 graphics 1 and 0.06 FPS for
graphics 2 with the RX 570 and for Vega
56 for the gigabyte RX 570 with stock
timings we measured graphics 1 at 65
point 5 6 FPS average across more than a
dozen test passes with graphics 2 at 50
2.2 FPS average graphics 2 will be more
accurate of the two numbers and should
also be more sensitive to memory changes
memory timings level 1 put the graphics
1 score at 65 point 8 3 FPS average a
difference of plus a zero point 2 7 FPS
considering the standard deviation of
0.2 to FPS for this test this is not a
meaningful difference the result of 66
point zero 3 follows the upward trend
begun by timings level 1 and does
technically exit deviation against stock
even at the extremes but only barely
we still can't confidently state if the
difference is statistically significant
but it does appear to have an uptick in
performance even if it does perform
better than stock though the gains are
irrelevant for this workload
graphics to shows more meaningful gains
if looked at from the perspective of
error but they are still meaningless to
the user these differences that would be
undetectable to a human even overclocked
and with memory over clocks the
difference between memory timings at
stock and level 2 whatever that means is
effectively zero
they give 56 showed a range of 0.17 from
top to bottom of the average results in
graphics 1 or 0.15 FPS for graphics 2
technically we see a decline in these
results but they are mo
within error we cannot state any
meaningful difference once again times
pi has much closer final results than
firestrike with a standard deviation of
about 0.03 FPS run to run for both
graphics tests and by the way that's
another couple dozen tests per device on
the chart for this one the RX 570 stock
moves from 25 point five nine fps
graphics one to twenty five point nine
one FPS for memory timings level two
although this is statistically
significant as a change based on our
error from times by itself we're still
too close to feel comfortable declaring
a meaningful result remember that
although we know time spies variants
computers are complicated and could have
unknown background tasks that may cause
interference that could affect the
numbers beyond what we see as our error
for time spy in this benchmark either
way under the best case assuming that we
are perfectly 100% accurate we could
declare an increase maximally of 1.25%
graphics to shows an increase of 0.2 for
FPS for the RX 570 from stock to timings
level to a gain of 1.1 percent assuming
again perfectly accurate results timing
differences with an overclock are also
insignificant although looser timings
may allow for higher overclocks assuming
we had the level of control required to
actually manually push down the timings
and they're just solved for that kind of
does that and we've begun playing around
with it but it's not necessarily so
trivial Vega 56 again plots a downtrend
from stock but like with the rx 570 we
don't have full confidence to declare
changes without making some assumptions
assuming again that the numbers are 100%
perfectly accurate which is unlikely
when talking about such small changes
the Vega 56 slight decays and
performance with the other timing levels
would be mismatched from what we saw
with the RX 570 that said they use
different types of memory and memory
subsystems more realistically all these
numbers are too close to call far cry 5
at 1080 P has the RX 574 gigabyte style
card at 62 FPS average with lows at 54
for 1% and 50 for 0.1% the memory timing
level 2 configuration puts us at 60
point 6 FPS average for the 2 FPS 1% and
50 FPS 0.1% these results were
consistent and within 0.5 FPS average
run
Ron we can't declare an improvement for
memory timing level two although we also
can't necessarily confidently state that
it diminishes performance either it does
look that way here but we're also close
enough to error that we have to settle
for calling it unnoticeable if different
at all they can 56 ran at 98 FPS average
stock in ninety seven point eight FPS
average with level two timings so we
again observed no change 1440p further
demonstrates a lack of difference our
stock results were at forty three point
nine FPS average with memory timing
level two at forty three point four FPS
average and this is well within error
margins we did see more variable 0.1%
low performance here but it's hard to
know the precise cause of this as the
data set is more limited the zero point
one percent low range was wider for the
changed memory timings potentially
indicating some instability or memory
errors assuming this change in software
is working to begin with this is also
something we commonly see with memory
overclocking when pushing too hard at
1440p vega these six reference reported
sixty eight point six FPS average with
timing level two version at sixty eight
point four FPS average so no difference
here once again GTA v at 1080p put the
RX 570 at sixty two point six FPS
average with Louis at forty seven point
six and forty five the memory timing
level two test was almost exactly
identical almost seems like nothing even
happened we're at sixty two point two
FPS average forty seven point six four
one percent and forty five point one
four zero point one percent that's not
functionally the same but in some
instances literally the same there's no
difference here Fagen 56 had us at
ninety four point six FPS average which
is the same as level two timings
changing and it's ninety four point
eight FPS average lows are a little more
variable at the zero point one percent
mark with the timings change but there's
naturally more variance in 0.1 percent
anyway so it's difficult to determine
the exact cause 1440p has the RX 570 of
forty two point seven FPS average and
forty two point five and PS average for
memory timings level two lows are at
thirty two point eight for each and
about 31 to 32 for 0.1% lows which is
with an error there's no difference
between these big 56 ends up at sixty
six point four FPS average in both tests
so no difference again and finally last
one we're showing is f1 2018 for this
one we observed the rh5 seventy eight
six six point three fps
average 1-run stock 65.9 when run with
memory timings level 2 and again we
can't really see a difference here 1440p
testing had the two cards once again
identical 51.6 versus 50.9 which is
within error margins and those were
unaffected we did have more games but
you get the idea they're all the same
the other games we tested like shadow of
the Tomb Raider and Sniper Elite 4 were
also the same but there's just there's
no point showing more charts not super
exciting then no real differences in the
tests we ran there were some that were
sort of bordering on maybe a difference
and that was typically more along the
lines of timing level to potentially
introducing some lower 0.1% loads than
we would expect however that 0.1% low
value is already a really narrow data
set so we don't have as much data to
average against we don't have as much
data to check for things like margin of
error and so the margin is going to be
wider and this is it's difficult to
actually confidently state if there's a
meaningful difference there but overall
it looks like no not really
so we're not a hundred percent sure if
the driver option is doing anything and
if it is it doesn't appear to be working
well it doesn't appear to be influencing
the game and results even if it's
working it might influence minor results
but we're not going to run those tests
now there's not much interested in
anyway and we're not experts in figuring
out how to even check for the how to
benchmark that performance so what we're
left with is the next step if this topic
is of interest to you is for us to
attempt to manually tune the timings
through software or to work with build
Zoid on building a bios for a card that
will more readily accept it because this
one just like I said it froze it crashed
it didn't like any of the things that
pilchard was trying to do so
unfortunately the custom BIOS was a
no-go for for this one from the start
one final note here is that one thing we
we don't really have the sample size to
analyze is that changing the timings if
you make them looser would theoretically
increase your Headroom for frequency
overclock and this is something that
roman their bauer found with I believe
it's the 780ti where when they loosened
the timings they were able to get a
higher frequency and that makes sense
you see the same thing with the
in system memory so that's a potential
item of of note where you to actually
see some realistic outcome or or
meaningful outcome where there's a
result difference but it's not one
that's really worth testing with with
the AMD drivers because we don't even
know what they're doing to the timings
precisely so that's it for this one
subscribe for more we'll probably do a
follow-up on this if you're interested
you go to store documents access net to
pick up the mod mats the medium and
large are both back in stock especially
the medium has been sold out immediately
when we do the first run so that's back
it should be now you can go to
