dotnet and we're here at GDC 2016 in
sunny san francisco today we're talking
about AMD and their moves with DirectX
12 and virtual reality those are big
announcements today from the GPU and CPU
manufacturer we've also spoken about a
couple of other games in recent
conversations here and one of them that
you'll see on the channel very shortly
is with total war war hammers developers
creative assembly that will come up in
this video all this content from GDC
2016 is brought to you by raw Furies a
goner what you're seeing on the screen
now the main announcement from AMD today
is the DirectX 12 partnership with
Creative Assembly for total war
warhammer total war hammer as we're
calling it at the site and that dx12
partnership is interesting for a few
reasons one of the main ones is because
the Total War series have so many
objects drawn on screen at once so many
draw calls and really a pretty heavy
amount of load placed on the CPU they're
actually pretty multi-threaded too
because of all of that Direct X 12
should help move some of that processing
to the GPU like the draw calls
especially and free up system resources
on the cpu for doing things that are
potentially more important like AI
calculations which are pretty extensive
in the total war games so that is a
partnership that AMD is boasting as an
exclusive partnership with Creative
Assembly for the total war warhammer
game and we're talking with the Creative
Assembly developers very shortly you'll
see that content on the channel
following this post the next item is
virtual reality and all the stuff that
Andy's doing there so one of the things
they're looking at is China for VR
development and that is because China is
a pretty rapid and growing consumer of
virtual reality products so MD
specifically is trying to create what
they call VR cafes basically I cafes or
PC veins in Korea and they're creating
those to basically build up a VR
audience in an environment where it may
not otherwise be accessible and so that
of course requires high-end hardware and
requires the VR headsets or the HM DS
themselves the final major item here is
the Radeon pro duo that andy has
announced and it's sort of like Corsairs
bulldog in that it's basically just a
complete system
I end and being sold for VR specifically
and the Radeon pro duo is outfitted for
sixteen teraflops of total compute
performance there's definitely a lot of
performance there and it's got the setup
that you can see on the screen with all
of the components this particular one is
built by main gear we're not presently
sure if other sis or partners will be
involved in the construction of this
particular system but the main gear one
that you're seeing now is what we've
seen in terms of early models of the
radio and pro duo set up now this build
is particular specific ly meant for the
purpose of developing for virtual
reality and that is something that of
course is very resource-intensive more
than what you would experience as a user
playing the game because they've got to
compile and do all the rendering and
rasters all this stuff that game
developers have to do so those are the
three main announcer it's a couple of
smaller things they're doing AMD's
working with Crytek on what they're
calling vr firsts are basically helping
universities get into the game of
developing for and using virtual reality
but other than that the most interesting
item that we've really looked at rileys
I've looked at personally is the total
war warhammer partnership for DirectX 12
development and inclusion in the game
check back for further coverage from GDC

about this and we'll see you all next
