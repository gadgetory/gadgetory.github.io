focused PC cases like be quiet and
Fraxel design typically use a number of
tricks to keep the noise levels down
these are specially designed fans
thicker pads on the side panels for
noise damping foam solutions sealed
front panels and elaborately baffled
vents we tend to prefer high airflow to
silence when given a choice but that's
the thing this is normally presented as
a choice between the two we think with
one solution you could achieve both
before that this video is brought to you
by the EVGA supernova g3 power supplies
unlike other power supplies on the
market that get easily tangled the EVGA
g3 power supplies are modular and you
sleeved cables so the PCIe connectors
won't get caught in your hair when
building system the supernova comes in
several options including popular six
with UI and 750 watt units and it's
fully modular with a noise focused fan
profile learn more at the link in the
description below so here's the
interesting thesis with this one the
theory is if you have two systems one
that's more open like this redline zero
6 from silverstone and the one one
that's completely closed off like the
silent basic so one we think you could
take the open case slow down the fans
and then achieve equivalent noise
performance while having superior
they're all in performance so that is
the thesis for today what we're doing
here is lowering fan speeds in a well
ventilated case and checking if it's as
effective or more effective than closing
off the entire box to try and trap
absorb or otherwise deflect the noise
depending on the different solution that
the manufacturer may have chosen in
cases like this I base 601 you typically
see things like this a side panel that's
closed very tightly against the case no
window here although there is an option
and then extremely thick foam the foam
is useful for things like high-frequency
noise so the type of noise is something
we're not testing here today we're just
looking at basically volume versus
thermals either way though this helps
with high frequency noise because the
idea is the sound wave hits the foam and
then it just kind of bounces around
until it breaks apart and doesn't really
come out of the case in a way that's
noticeable or as noticeable as it would
otherwise another solution for noise is
to deal with low for
Quincy's by making thicker panels an
example would be perhaps in winds
aluminum panels that are very thick
because those help with the lower
frequency longer wavelengths and
preventing them from escaping and get
into the user that might be the
difference between for example a higher
frequency coil wine from inductors or a
higher frequency fan wine versus a lower
frequency hum from large fans that are
just spinning away so those are two of
the types of noise that you're dealing
with with a silence focused case and to
their credit be quiet has done an
excellent job at making a quiet box
they've done that here but a lot of that
can be done just with good fans
something will demonstrate here as well
where something like the are l06
although it's completely open in the
front and has a totally different
approach to things it's using lower end
fans they run a bit faster and so
they're louder more so than just having
an open front would otherwise allow a
lot of that noise is just because
they're louder fans by nature so if you
have the test we're doing that we have
the original test from the reviews we
have the side bass 601 and 100% fans
mean we always test to 100% speed
configuration as the stock and that's of
course fighting against the panel's at
this point so when a higher percent
speed that's about 36 DBA for the noise
level measurement we have the sound bass
601 at fan controller level 1 which is
their silence configuration at 32.8 DBA
then we have the red line 0 6 at 100%
443 DBA it's actually one of the loudest
cases on our bench when configured that
way although it's also one of the
coolest and it's highly affordable at
that so the new tests we're doing are
the are l06 at 58% fan speed we'll go
over the RPMs in a moment and that's
with noise equalized to the SP 601 so
58% fan speed on this thing
leaving the CPU and GPU fans fixed and
untouched allows for a 36 roughly DBA
so we're at equivalence here between
those two configs with this at 100% this
at about 58% and the difference being
the case at that point we also did the
red line 0 6 at 36% front and 40% rear
to equalize the SP 601 at it's level 1
quiet setting or about 32.9 ish DBA and
the red line 0 6 took the 2 silent
Wayne's fans were one other test the 140
millimeters and we shoved those and
they're replacing the three stock
silverstone
which allowed for better silence because
it had better fans in it so for that we
equalised all fans to 55% which resulted
in the SB 601 at about level one once
again 32.9 DBA and then finally the SB
601 tested at 83% fan speed with the
front panel removed this is important
because this is our test with the least
variable so what we've done here is we
took the same case this one and we ran
it with and without the front panel
we've already done that but this time
what we did differently from the review
is we drop the fan speeds low enough
that it is able to equate the same noise
level as when that front panels on so
the only difference is on versus off
front panel the noise level remains the
same but the fan rpm drops to reduce the
noise level through a more mechanical
form rather than something organic and
native to the case so that's what we're
looking at today let's go through the
numbers and see if we can get these two
cases to equalize and noise and then see
which one wins for thermals in its
original review the RL zero six was
measured at 43 DBA with the fans running
at 100% it has three 120-millimeter
front intake fans behind a mesh panel
and a filter and one slower and
therefore a quieter rear exhaust fan
meanwhile the SB 601 maxed out at 36 DBA
or a 32.8 with the integrated fan
controller turned it down to the minimum
speed it comes with to appear wanes to
140 military fans they are high end fans
one is intake behind a steel panel and a
layer of foam and one is rear exhaust
that intake fan is positioned at lower
in the front panel and therefore
benefits the GPU a bit more the first
objective of testing was to normalize
for noise so we matched the RL o 6 and
SP 601 noise levels at 20 inches to
equate one another this was done by
decreasing atcase fan speeds to 58% on
the Silverstone RL o6 bringing it to
36.1 DBA the silent bass 601 also sits
around 36 DBA when I want 100% fan
speeds and it's basically stock
configuration that's because of the
noise damping foam and the thicker
paneling CPU temperatures or the RL o6
is a strongest aspect in the original
review and they remained so even with
reduced airflow the RL o 6 is baseline
performance at maximum speed is about 48
degrees
/ ambience what remains one of the best
results on our later shown comparative
chart it's also pretty loud it's at
about 43 DBA or thereabouts choking the
speeds to meet a thirty two point nine
DBA noise level resulted in 61 degrees
over ambient as the CPU torture
temperature is significantly
outperforming the results when compared
to the 73 degree results of the be quiet
silent base 601 equivalent thirty two
point eight DBA noise level there's no
contest here but this still isn't a
perfectly fair comparison the 601 is
using significantly better fans
primarily in that they're capable of
lower noise levels at higher CFM this is
something for which be quiet gets credit
but to even it out we transplanted those
fans into the RL o six with the 600 once
fans in the RL o six and a thirty two
point nine DBA noise level these same as
the silent basics are one on its silent
setting the RL o six ended up at fifty
five degrees over ambient this is a
massive lead over the equivalent 73
degree result or noise equivalents
anyway and illustrates just how much the
fans matter these are the same fans the
SB 601 used but in a more open case and
spun down to a lower rpm for equivalent
noise the RL oh six has the same
perceived volume but the cooling
difference is one of being usable versus
unusable for non idle workloads matching
the two cases instead 236 DBA the
Silverstone RL o six ends up at fifty
five degrees over ambience with a silent
bass 601 at about 63 degrees in this
instance the be quiet front panel is
more readily overcome by extra pressure
of its intake fans and so it fares
better than at the quiet speed setting
we saw earlier there is a nonlinear loss
in performance as pressure is reduced
against that panel here's the
interesting part
if be quiet had a more open front panel
but instead reduced fan rpm to match its
original noise level 36 DBA the
performance climbs 256 degrees over
ambient that's rough equivalence with
the RL o6 when using these stock
Silverstone fans and that rough
equivalents illustrates the point that
silence can be had with an airflow
oriented case while still achieving
equivalence of performance just for
reference here's a comparative chart
with a lot of other cases on it at 36
DBA the RL o six with stock fans at 58%
speeds
up around the Defiant r6n age 500 P
original case not great not great
positioning at all but it's at nearly
half the fan speed to be fair from its
100% configuration not bad when given
the quieter focus and certainly better
than the 600 ones near bottom results
it's doing better actually than a lot of
these silenced focus cases on this chart
despite being airflow focused and still
very quiet in this configuration or
reasonably anyway for GPU thermals the
Arlo sticks at 1,400 rpm establishes a
clear baseline for maximum performance
between these two cases this one is at
47 degrees over ambient followed most
closely by the SB 601 without a front
panel this is a switch up from the CPU
charts where the rlo 6 dominated in all
performance classes the SB 601 does
better here as it has greater breathing
room between the GPU and the case
paneling and also it only has one stock
intake fan and that fan is pointed
straight at the video card following
this 50 degree it results is the SB 601
at its maximum speed putting the be
quiet fans into the RL o 6 and setting
them to 32.9 DBA improves temperatures
to equate the stock RL or 6 fans at 36
DBA again this highlights the huge
advantage of a good fan we're at the
same performance level but audibly lower
noise levels humans tend to notice noise
differences of approximately 3 DBA are
greater just for reference that's not to
mention by the way that the cheaper cost
of something like the RL o6 would allow
for more budget to buy those good fans
the difference between the two quietest
stock fan results is marginal with the
silent bass and our low 6 roughly equal
at the low end for perspective here's a
comparative GPU chart
well highlight the our low 6 and silent
basics r1 results the our low 6 descends
the chart rapidly as fan rpm is reduced
as airflow dynamics in the case tend to
favor the CPU this is further reinforced
by the proximity of case paneling to the
video card the result then indicates
that the thesis pretty much stands you
can definitely achieve the same acoustic
performance as a high-end silence
focused case by using an airflow focused
case and these are often cheaper because
they use fewer materials and are
definitely a lot more mainstream so big
difference there as well because
if you're producing more volume
manufacturing volume that is not noise
volume then it is cheaper to produce
that said it takes more effort you have
to do more manual fan work if you are
okay with setting things like fan speed
curves then this might be a project
that's worth doing for you you can still
achieve silence you can at least achieve
mostly the same level of quiet as this
while still being an operable range and
that's a big deal here too because
technically ultimately this case could
go quieter if you had no case fans or
something like that you're just dealing
with component fans at a hundred percent
the quiet focus case will have a lower
floor at some point though you're
fighting the noise floor of your room
and you're also fighting the
temperatures to a point of it's
questionable whether you can even
operate at the higher temperatures you
would be running that with a silenced
focus case there's another difference
here that we also didn't test or
actually two of them one of them is open
loop configurations if you're going to
open loop for the most part your water
can do a lot of the work and of course
having a case like this versus the are
l06
there will be a difference and so far as
yeah it's the same thing you could run
the fans lower speed and a more open
case but also you can run the fan slower
speed anyway because it's water and at
some point really it doesn't matter if
you're at 50 degrees or 60 degrees
they're both good unless you're doing
something like competitive overclocking
so once you're on liquid or at least
high-end liquid open-loop liquid really
it doesn't matter quite as much because
you're just you're way under thresholds
for thermal issues anyway and then the
other thing we didn't test or
demonstrate is type of noise so
theoretically and audibly it's not
really that different to us but
theoretically a case like this on base
601 will have a less annoying type of
noise because it's specifically
targeting things like higher frequencies
and you've got open paneling everywhere
here that then always can get out but
the noise level is the same between the
two when you normalize it so you're just
left with type of noise and that's
completely subjective we'll leave that
up to you to figure out
but anyway interesting experiment to do
it's not saying that these silence folks
cases are in any way worthless because
they're they're very high quality when
they're done right and they do an
excellent job at dealing with noise
without forcing the user to do a lot of
tuning now that said
hyoeun fans like the be quiet fans from
this case which are extremely good at
what they do into a case like this one
does get you pretty darn close to noise
out of the box with a little bit of
extra tuning on top of that so just
something for you to think about we're
not saying that it's better to go one
way or the other
because clearly both these cases have a
reason to exist in the market they both
do what they do very well it's just that
one mode takes a bit more tuning than
the other and this silent focused case
does still have some upsides that the
airflow case doesn't have and vice versa
same same goes for both of them so
something to really think about
