talking about frame rate and frame times
and how they are flawed to go by just
the normal frame rate metrics that we
all see that we use everyone else uses
pretty much so we're bringing it back to
frame times get it inside the second
right yeah and that was a pretty big
piece that talked about all the problems
with frame rate as a number and what was
your alternative to frame rate and so it
was really looking at as you mentioned
frame times right instead of rates and
there are a number of reasons for that
one of the key ones is just that we were
always looking at frame rate as an
average and it turns out that averages
can mask big differences that matter to
you as you play a game because if you
have momentary hiccups in your game
you're gonna notice that the animation
is not gonna be smooth and it's terrible
yeah it's a it's a huge problem it's one
we've talked about recently with our
frame time plots and we're gonna be
talking about that more today before
that this video is brought to you by the
federal take em 360 plus liquid cooling
kit which comes with everything needed
for your first open-loop cooling
solution the M 360 plus LC kit includes
a pump and reservoir combo a CPU water
block 360 radiator coolant plenty of
tubing and RGB everything if you're
looking for a one-stop shop for a first
time open loop the m3 60 plus is linked
in the description below so the big
topic here is if this discussion started
from FPS is nonlinear and here's the
here's the secret that so you might not
be aware of if you haven't seen our
previous video together so the secret is
all the FPS data is flawed and you can
only trust it so much but we're gonna
give it to you anyway but frame times
that matters so let's let's do a
masterclass overview what is a frame
time what what is it measuring right so
typically when we talk about frame time
we're talking about the interval from
one frame to the next frame right when
you're building an animation you want to
make sure that you have a pretty
constant flow of updates to the display
updates to the user so the animation
looks smooth and when that's interrupted
then you perceive it as stutter and
slowdowns and things like that and
that's what I want to avoid so if you
can look at individual frame times and
find ways find metrics
the account for those hiccups and
slowdowns it's a little bit better than
looking at an average where you can have
a lot of fast frames and want a very
slow frame in the middle it's a bad
experience but the average will hide
that and will mask that and we'll put a
we'll put a chart on the screen we had a
far cry 5 test recently where just one
product against itself so this in this
instance it was a 9600 K and the reason
it was interesting is because the the
average framerate looked pretty good
it's completely playable I don't know
100 or something then the low is even
we're still like 60 FPS for our point
one percent low metric which in that
video we said well you know there's a
reason that we sometimes show a frame
time plot instead because this is
actually flawed because by that metric
by our own metric 0.1% you're looking at
60 fps it seems perfectly fine you look
at the frame time plot and you have
three or four spikes 200 milliseconds
and so to explain what that means I
guess let's let's pull some numbers so
you have 60 fps what kind of frame the
frame interval are you looking at
sixteen point seven milliseconds right
yeah so let's pull some others I guess
so you look at a like 120 140 or at
seven or eight yellow seconds exactly
and what what is that time mean 16 point
six six seven milliseconds to do what
right from one frame to the next on the
display depending on of course there's
also the interaction with those displays
update rate in that timing right but if
you have a fast display or especially a
variable refresh display like free sync
then you know really it comes down more
or less to the GPU frame time right so
the less time between frames the
smoother the animation and I've talked
about this before because you see people
online saying 60 FPS is all the human
eye can perceive or whatever
get yourself 144 Hertz monitor go to the
Windows desktop drag a window around
with your mouse and you can easily
perceive the difference between 16 144
yeah I have 144 Hertz displays around me
and when I have to use a 61 it annoys me
to copy files
okay there is clearly a difference that
you can perceive yeah and that's and
that's just windows right it's not even
games right right so so the time then
the frame-to-frame interflow interval
you're looking at time between frames or
time to create the next frame I guess at
what what point really is it the the
consistency of that number that users
notice or is it just lowers always
better I mean if you're at right for
milliseconds constantly where do you
draw the line of that being a good
experience versus a bad experience
because of spikes right that's a tough
one because it's about human perception
but it's also about a lot of the stuff
that happens in the PC that's a little
bit sloppy the interaction between the
game engine and when it physics
animation the game engine advances the
GPU and the CPA mand then the display
when it's ready to actually show you
frames there's a lot of timing issues
there that don't always get resolved
well but in a case of a game engine that
does a good job and a fast system and
then say a variable refresh display that
sort of tries to match the timing of
when a frame is ready will show it then
you have the question of what happens in
my head space and it's not you can't say
the human brain runs at 144 Hertz like
it's this analog meatspace wave I'm
sorry
there's analog meatspace thing I don't
think we know exactly but if you look at
all the animation systems that we have
none of them go like I think the slowest
we know of his movies and it's 24 frames
per second and usually in movies each
exposure is sort of window of time
instead of a quick you know slice they
actually leave the camera aperture open
for a while is they capture each frame
there's some blur right even then you
know 24 is not always great right and
that's sort of their their frame rate so
perceptually speaking I think if you get
below that you get around 20 frames per
second about 50 milliseconds I think
that's where you start saying we're in a
perceptual threshold where there's a
problem right right but then they're
also all these
about frame rates varying over time
different people noticing different
things it's complicated and I don't
think we have a at least I haven't seen
good science behind all of that to know
you know a definitive answer to the
meatspace question right a lot of people
try to do that but yeah I have not seen
any any hard science to it other than
like WatchMojo top 10 things you didn't
know about the human brain or something
so for the FPS is nonlinear this gif
fine that's something you put a tweet
out recently we'll put that up on the
screen too with a graph yeah what does
that mean what am I looking at yeah so
if you look at the graph it shows
basically frame time versus fps over
time and it just turns out the FPS
because it's a rate it's not a linear
measure of performance so I guess the
best way to illustrate this is like we
were talking about before at 60 frames
per second the frame times or 16.7
milliseconds you know you you get to 144
it's like seven milliseconds and the
problem is that and at 30 frames per
second is 33 milliseconds so you're not
getting the difference in FPS will
actually be larger especially at high
frame rates than the difference in frame
times you actually have this funny curve
right and that leads to sometimes some
not very good online discussions maybe
in the forum or comments right about the
differences between different
performances and I think the the classic
best example of this is where you're
talking about game performance over 200
frames per second yes right if you have
something at 230 frames per second and
you have another another device that
runs this game at 200 frames per second
people say well that's a 30fps
difference that's huge and a gamer will
know that in certain cases 30 FPS is a
very large difference perceptually
speaking in certain cases but the case
of the gamer may be thinking about is
the difference between 30 frames per
second and 60 frames per second which it
turns out because FPS is not linear is a
much larger difference than the
difference between 200 and 230 yes for a
second right and so you're functionally
having you're fans of Fame interval
whereas you start going up to like 300
FPS versus 270 fbi's rough math but I
think you're at about a 0.5 millisecond
difference between 2/7 in terms of the
frame the time it takes to create that
frame 0.5 second point 0.5 milliseconds
longer to create the frame at to 70 FPS
versus 300 FPS so if we're talking 3.0
or 3.5 versus 3.5 or 4.0 really who
notices that I guess is the question
right well that's the thing is you start
getting into a very high frame rates fps
differences that sound consequential but
turn out to be very small differences in
time if you measure it in frame time so
I'm milliseconds which is a linear right
right and so I think you get to the
point where you're kind of over valuing
or exaggerating those differences at
highest yes compared to low so then let
me what if we do that's let's approach
this from how a lot of reviewers will do
it including us sometimes well if you
convert that into a percentage so now
it's not FPS so it's it's you're not
worrying about the nonlinear side of a
raw number of FPS still nonlinear
because there's a percentage of a lot
nonlinear number right but if you're
talking on 60 FPS where 54 FPS to be
doing percent improvement a percent
reduction is roughly 10 percent
difference and then you have 200 versus
220 it's roughly a 10% difference as
well right so is that an acceptable
approach in your mind
well you're still you have an underlying
metric that's not linear right and so
you're going to retain that
non-linearity yes and so you're gonna
have the same basic problem it maybe is
worse because you've masked what you
just did that yeah you know if you don't
have your units if it's just a
percentage I I think that the
appropriate way if you had to do
percentages and there are problems with
doing percentages beyond this but the
appropriate way if you stat Mathan right
right
but but if you have to use a percentage
or you decide that's what you want to do
then I'd say start with the base unit of
frame times and do a percentage in frame
times instead of an FPS so that you have
a sort of honest accounting of the
difference now that that would mean you
know in in one of our vein or example
cases like the 307 versus 270 yes you
know it's like it's like a half
millisecond difference right yes so if
you take let's say 300 FPS is 3.3
milliseconds for it's just a thousand
divided by the frame rate so 3.3
milliseconds versus we want to say 270
250 270 270 is 3.7 so the percent
improvement of a new minus old divided
by old 300 minus 270 equals 30 divided
by two seventy percent improvement is
11% if you go that direction based on
frame rate res what were our numbers
three point three versus three point
seven I think a three point the new
would be down in this case a three point
three minus three point seven divided by
three point seven you've got roughly an
eleven percent reduction but we just
went to different directions with the
percentage math right because if you're
doing new minus old divided by old and
your new number is now lower
instead of higher that's gonna change
the not the math too so pretend it is in
general yeah well they they obscure
things right yes one of the things I was
gonna say is when you're talking about a
half a millisecond difference and we go
the other way
twelve percent no way okay I contend
right if you don't matter 1/2
millisecond difference in the
performance of two systems then you can
ask yourself the question is is
meaningful mmm right you know is the
display capable of showing me a half
millisecond difference am i capable of
perceiving it right whereas if you're
talking about a difference that's you
know 10 15 16 milliseconds then that may
be a very different conversation right
right and so percentages can mask the
native units and so you're not thinking
about the perceptual element in the same
way as you would be if you're thinking
about that if you
it's yes right yeah and then let me let
me channel my inner Gordon from PC world
some of you may have seen my video where
I was with him Gordon had a great phrase
I thought he said he said but I'm the
internet though
but I'm the internet so Scott if I'm the
internet 240fps 3rf is I can see that
difference I can see 300 FPS so you are
wrong mm-hmm how do you respond to that
but that's an interesting one because
are there very many displays that are
faster than 240 Hertz refresh rate well
if I'm the Internet I'm gonna say yes
without checking we write write write I
write and then we can talk about the
that in that case again we're talking
what about 0.7 millisecond difference
there's something from estimating off
top of my head you know and we just had
this conversation about the meatspace
situation you know where you know we
really notice a problem in animation
above like 50 or so milliseconds I mean
you're at the outer end of the human
scale right yeah plus then they're there
these there's some slop between the the
game engines timing and when things get
sent to this play and when does this
play finally gets the pixels updated you
know that can be more than that point
seven millisecond Delta sure so the
timing on all this stuff is hard right
and so I suppose it's difficult at the
end of the day to dissuade someone who's
completely confident that they're
correct but there really are like
numbers of perceptual thresholds and
realities of other variables in here
that that pretty much will tell you you
know now you're not you're not gonna see
all right right and fps in general I
should also say is just kind of a funny
number to begin with because if it's
frames per second what you're looking at
that active like an FPS counter on the
screen you kind of get into a territory
of what does that really mean because if
I'm playing the game and I'm looking at
a counter of 60 FPS is that referencing
the previous second averaged a frame
time or and I guess that kind of depends
on
after and how it measures - why don't we
all just use frame times I guess would
be the the reasonable question someone
might ask after after hearing all of
this right I think from my perspective
there are two answers and one is
everybody understands it even if it
doesn't necessarily mean it's not a
perfect metric they understand or they
think they understand it the other one
is from a presentation side it's easier
to present a bunch of bar graphs because
if you do an overtime plot like some of
the ones we've shown you really can't
get more than a couple lines before it's
just illegible right so what is the how
do you compromise how do you how do you
compromise between a metric that is
objectively better to use frame to frame
interval frame x versus a metric that is
widely understood by the audience right
so that's just an education problem
teaching a viewer yeah I think to some
extent it is but to some extent you've
got to try to meet the viewer halfway
right so you're one of the conversations
that we've always had about this is I
like the idea of using a frame time and
I actually like the idea of using a 99th
percentile frame time where you have
this curve you give it because this is a
problem you have a distribution frame
times it's not just one and you have to
summarize this entire collection in some
meaningful way you know and so you you
can sort of sort them smaller tire so
you can pick a point on that curve and
you can say okay this is where we are at
you know 99% of all frames rendered this
is the time that we have and we can
compare that across lots of different
things right right and that works then
the conversation becomes well why are we
using frame time if everybody's used to
fps can we do the 99th percentile fps
and the answer is sure you can but
realize that when you do that you're
compromising the native units that
you're going to a nonlinear measurement
and so averages out some of the frames
are spikes too even at 0.1% you average
a lot of those oh well that's a
different thing right when you're doing
0.1 or 0.01% and I didn't know this till
we had a conversation about fairly
recently but 0.1% is basically the last
point 1 percent of frames that that
distribution collected together and then
averaged yeah and when you average then
you can mask problems yeah right and
that's why it's important if you use
those numbers so again our 9600 K review
is the most recent that I can reference
if you use those numbers
you're either referring to them as a
viewer or you're using them as a
reviewer you have to understand the the
whole picture of the data and what might
be hidden by an average so it's still
important to go look at a frame time
plot look at what is where does it spike
then you look at your averaged numbers
and does it hide all of that data and
the case of far cry 5 it did going back
to our earlier example great far cry 5
was objectively a bad experience because
you would hit these stutters that are a
tenth of a second lon
you know it's too long which is bad yeah
but you don't see it in a point one
percent because it is it out even though
it's only 0.1% yeah so yeah it's still
flawed yeah so so it's always a
challenge because you want to do the
right thing in terms of the metrics but
you want people to be able to understand
right and consume what you're doing
right and I haven't found a perfect
answer yet there so there's some
approaches like the percentile thing or
time spent beyond acts that we could
talk about that are I think reasonably
good metrics to certain things but yeah
it it's hard to sort of summarize and in
an ideal world when things go well maybe
FPS would be enough right right that's
that's at least the potential that the
graphics card in the system has to to
produce performance the question is does
it deliver it consistently and that's
another question right yeah so then
you've got the old questions of frame
quality too like if the different
graphics devices render the frame a
different way different colors phase
whatever which is something you probably
dealt with more when you're doing tech
report maybe 10 years ago or something
the frame quality was because I remember
they used to be like a fire strike test
where you could pull like a single frame
render and then compare the frame side
by side on a TI at the time in Nvidia
right well it's interesting because
graphics api's are not compute api's and
a cpu if you compute a number and you
get the wrong answer it's bad right
thing to crash it doesn't work right and
a graph
API if you compute a color and you
output it differently than maybe the
someone else would that's not
necessarily right it becomes a problem
sort of surprise right so different GPUs
have different texture filtering
algorithms that they use and things like
that so there's not a deterministic this
color of this pixel should be exactly
this value right and so everybody in
graphics whether it's the the game
developer or the driver writer or the
GPU architect is trying to do the best
job of combining sort of faking you know
this this is this needs to look good but
we don't want to do too much work
combining those two elements in order to
give you a good experience and yeah it
can get tricky yeah yes so I would say
if you want more of this discussion go
to tech report and read Scott's articles
but you might have already read them if
not check out what is it called inside
the second inside the second from a
couple years ago at this point that's a
good starter and I think we talked
previously I think there was one thing
you might have changed about that
article if you wrote it today the
phrasing of was it latency frame latency
yeah yeah why would you change that
okay so latency or lag is something that
we know in you know computers and gaming
and things like that and I talked a lot
about frame latency when I was doing
some of these metrics and it really was
about the frame to frame interval and
the problem then is that he went AMD and
we started thinking more about how can
we reduce input lag and we actually made
some changes in like reading on software
to reduce buffering in some cases so
that we have less input lag Radeon chill
reduces input lag that's really sort of
latency the the key with animation is
the frame to frame interval time which
is a bit of a different thing so I
probably would not use change the
variable Y and not use that at this
point but understanding that check out
the article if you haven't otherwise
Scott is here with an announcement that
we'll talk about later
so stay tuned for more of that and Scott
thank you for joining me certainly any
time we'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
