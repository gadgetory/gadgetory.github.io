shoes one is this one except the camera
further back it's the aerial shot as we
call it the other one is a teardown shot
where we take this table rotate it that
way and it's shot in this corner where
we also do live streams so presently
there's a shelf here we typically have
stuff on top of it but for a while now
I've wanted to replace this shelf with a
tool wall like the one we have behind
the camera right now and so we decided
to build a tool wall over here so it's
gonna be I'm gonna try this this is a
blue just a metal pegboard basically
we're gonna try these see how they look
put a couple of these up the plan is I
think to make it about two here and go
this way another foot or so so maybe 4
feet wide something like that and about
three feet tall maybe a bit taller and
it's just gonna be filled with tools
we've partnered with iFixit to build the
wall so I'm pretty excited about that
cuz basically I said we like the stuff
you guys make you've been a great
advertising partner and so we're gonna
build this wall do you want to fill it
with tools and they said yes we would
like to do that so we're gonna build it
there's gonna be a couple parts but
probably two primary parts where I'm
gonna go through all the stuff we have
that I bought most of it they sent the
tools and then we'll go through the
building process after that but
basically the hope here is that for
future tear downs I can just like turn
around and grab a tool off the wall and
continue going which will be nice
functionally it will also make it easier
for when we work in this room because we
have a really limited amount of space so
this room acts as the case testing as
I'm like build and unbuilding room as
well and that will help blot now another
small thing that no one would consider
is putting the tool wall up here will
give us back about three inches of depth
coming into the room that's not a lot of
space until you realize how limited we
are an extra three inches of depth like
off of this wall means I might actually
be able to walk through here to get back
behind the table for film instead of
having to walk around and duck under
cables so we'll see see if it goes the
way I want before that this video is
brought to you by I fix it's brand new
man to driver kit
I fix it Mantic it is a universal repair
tool kit that includes 112 steel bits
redesigned from the ground up with
longer necks for 4 millimetre bits
allowing more precision when working on
components the $60 iFixit Manta kit has
everything from pentalobe drivers to why
drivers and standard bits
learn more at the link in the
description below so long-term here's
what the plan is we talked about this in
one of our patreon behind-the-scenes
videos somewhat recently if you're a
patreon backer at patreon.com slash
gamers Nexus we post some of them there
but basically I was telling those guys
is we're planning to this shelf right
now is a mess because I mean I just took
a bunch of stuff off that shelf and put
it here but the plan is to fill this
shelf or this one with the higher end
test equipment so old o-scope we've got
nice DMM as we have a bunch of like
thermocouple readers fantastic Whitman
we have a hundred pounds of power supply
testing equipment coming in not sure if
that's connect on a shelf or not and
this will be filled with cool testing
equipment I don't know what to put here
yet I mean I'm trying to keep the video
card CPUs RAM in the other room where we
do all the testing so that it's close to
the benches so I don't want to put those
here if you have ideas I guess let me
know but I don't want to be product
boxes and I don't want it to be the
components we use for testing because
they need to be accessible and I hate
product boxes and throw them away
because they're a waste of space so I
don't know let me know what you come up
with this will be basically hi and test
equipment maybe we just fill both with
that that's gonna be tools so I'm hoping
what I'm going for here I'm trying to
maximize the space we have trying to get
as much mileage as we can out of it and
I'd like a set that looks like it's in
an actual reasonably sized officer
studio without having that and that also
I'd like to have kind of a more
industrial look like it's where work
happens not as much of a studio look I
really like that kind of almost like a
tested feel Adam Savage's tested I like
their layout although he's got a
warehouse and millions of dollars and I
have neither of those so these are
roughly 16
by roughly 32 so I have six of those and
there's gonna go on this wall and then
for the pegboard stuff I actually add a
lot of fun chopping around for this so
this is why we partnered for I fix it
with I fix it for this wall because I
needed to buy it time to stop oh that's
cool I haven't done that yet so it's a
metal pegboard my other one that we use
right now is just one of those crappy I
don't even know what it is like a
particle board that falls apart
basically and the metal one will allow
me to stick stuff like this on it so
that's a screwdriver holder and I've not
actually tried it yet where do they
screwdrivers go they go between these I
think we need us that'll work okay cool
except we need smaller screwdrivers but
anyway so that's screwdriver holder I'm
gonna I'm not sure how to lay stuff out
yet but I'll show you all the stuff I
got I liked these these look pretty cool
so my plan for these is if you separate
them by color cord in it coordination
color coding everything and I'm thinking
like I don't know maybe like GPU typical
GPU stuff and one or something like that
anyway those are four bits so this is
their the I fix a pro Tech tool kit
which we've used on camera even when
they don't sponsor us because I like it
and I'm thinking we take these bit kits
like this and just empty them and put
all the bits in here now that one looks
like it's gonna fit the larger bits
better which would be in the 128 bit
toolkit I don't think it's not gonna fit
these so I'll have to either put the
bigger bits in there that I have from
there the other iFixit kit or buy a
smaller one of these for these smaller
bits but that's the plan for that one
another option this is where you could
leave a comment below let me know what
you think I fix it's got these magnets
on the back they're great for here
I mean it's that's what it's meant for
but I don't think they are strong enough
to go here so one thing I'm considering
is we just kind of glue right here
some heavier-duty magnets the back of
this and then that would allow us to if
I didn't want to buy one of these except
with smaller holes that would allow us
to just stick this straight to the wall
and have them like that vertically
that'd be kind of cool
so no tell me what you think about those
two options so I just take all these and
put it in a smaller version of this or
magnets stick a magnet on it and stick
that to the pegboard so that's an option
these are all the pliers and stuff but
there's a side and the Manta tool kit
they sent this over as well this is that
I fix this brand-new tool kit this is
the one they wanted us to show off on
the wall and elsewhere but again same
thing and I'm just I'd love to just pull
these fit those all fit okay cool so
those will fit and I need to get is it
magnetized it is magnetized all right so
that's magnetized so that will stay in
there even when it's vertical but we'll
fill those and then this looks kind of
fat for this thing I bought but I have
other ones how do these fit all right
got it okay so I see I see what we're
gonna want for this is to put the longer
nose drivers and those I think it's a
longer driver straps like this or
something that'll work that'll work
pretty well all right so we've got all
the tools we'll go through those more as
I start mounting them all to the wall
they show the other pegboard stuff I got
I'm not sure what I want to do with
colors right now I just have I was
trying to go for blue white black
unfortunately a lot of stuff was red so
I don't know if I'll bother painting
that or anything just leave it but we
can mount these to the peg boards as
well and the plan with these is just I
mean it's just for drivers so you just
put all the drivers in there what else
do I have we have sort of traditional
baskets for mounting to the peg boards
so we've got a lot of those we have
different sizes of them the larger ones
I would like to use to put things like
this in so we can just throw the DMM
Zaandam
meters in there throw a moment a
thermocouple meters stuff like that so
these are really useful for us for the
other wall that I got a couple of bins
so these these are just trays I'm
planning to put like glue screws in
there stuff like that so they'll mount
like this and be supported underneath by
the metal brackets and those just go
underneath and you sit these right on
top of them
so I'd like those four screws four loose
parts like for example when I'm working
on let's just say what's a good one
we're not like a GPU or something and I
end up with spare screws or small parts
I'm planning to have a small parts bin
on the wall to help keep things
organized and just throw a label on it
and then if there's an active project
like taking a part of GPU we can keep
all this stuff in one spot so those will
be helpful what else do I have rubber
mallet there are a lot of times we could
have used these not typically on
hardware but sometimes we can use these
mostly for building shelves like this
right now we hit this shelf with a metal
hammer with a block of wood and I have
other rubber mallets but I wanted one
dedicated for this space not one that's
like in the garage covered in bike
grease and mud and stuff so we got that
brush will help clean everything on the
mod Mac because the GN mod mat is super
traction II it's by design so if stuff
doesn't slide around so I needed
something to clean out the weave and
then standard just kind of pegboard
parts nothing special with these so
that's most of it this is actually this
small thing
this is kind of dumb in that I'm looking
forward to it but just a dollar odd for
the blue shop towel so we can throw that
on and easy to access that for cleaning
thermal paste which is frequent and I
always have to write so here's what you
have to understand right now table
rotates this way
I stand here if I don't have what I need
on the table because I need the table
space to work I have to go I have to
kind of like squeeze through here with
the light and walk around the camera and
go get it and then come back and it
takes like a minute and you do that
multiple times in a video it starts to
get old really fast same thing for a
livestream so I'm really looking forward
to having just everything there for
tools I'm gonna have to fill the wall
with whatever I can comp with so I fix
it's basically let us pick whatever we
can find on their site I might pick a
few more things I don't know if we have
enough to fill the whole wall but we'll
see we have there they're kind of like
stand-alone drivers the non-replaceable
bit one so these are torques i've got a
standard phillips allen key stuff like
that so we have a bunch of these from
them we have the new Manta toolkit the
plan is to empty all these bits out into
the trays or mount this tray onto the
board so they sent over the this isn't
branded I fix it but they sell this one
this is just digital calipers throw this
on the wall as well and then probably
throw like I said DMMs and stuff small
electronics or thermal test equipment
will go on the wall so I mean it'll just
be nice to have kind of a a very
functional set that we use even when
we're not filming so it's not wasted
space and also look cool and fit the
bill for what we're doing on camera
if you here's what I want if you have
any ideas watching all this if you have
ideas about cool stuff to put on a
pegboard so you maybe have some
experience putting together peg boards
and there are specific accessories that
you really like that aren't too common
there are tons of them out there so if
there is some kind of
for a pegboard you really like tell me
what it is below and I'll go find it and
buy it for this wall so I wanted to be
functional and cool-looking and then if
you've got other tools that you think
would be a good fit obviously I know
everything we need for for cheap you
tear down and stuff like that but if
there's other stuff that you think might
be just kind of neat to have around let
me know I'll see if I can pick that up
and throw it on the wall as well but
that's part one so now what I need to do
next is basically pull down this shelf
which is secured into the studs with
just giant hex heads right now so we're
gonna pull this out and this wall will
be painted a dark like a grey basically
which is the same color as the wall back
there behind the old wood wall which is
still up so we're gonna pull this pin it
gray obviously pull these off the wall
probably mount them and hopefully end up
with a really cool set but we'll see let
me know what ideas you have along the
way and we'll try to incorporate them
because there's time to do so so that's
it for this one just basically behind
the scenes except we're pushing it the
main channel because I'm looking for
your thoughts on what we can add since
like I said it's early enough to
integrate your thoughts as the audience
and and I'd really like to see what you
all want to see so that's it for this
one thank you for watching subscribe for
more as always go to patreon.com/scishow
this kind of video and go to store like
cameras nexus net to pick up the mod mat
or one of our new crystal cubes and you
can learn more about these on the site
so I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
