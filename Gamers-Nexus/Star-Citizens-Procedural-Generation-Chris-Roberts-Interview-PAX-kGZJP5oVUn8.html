Nexus dotnet and I'm joined once again
by chris roberts hey guys how you doing
and we have lots of content from PAX
East PAX East 2013 2012 we have lots of
star citizen content up and we were back
again today you just come off of
Gamescom is that right yep yeah no games
chrome was a lot of fun I mean you know
we had this event for 2,000 of the
backers at a pretty big venue its of any
they they usually have you know music
acts and stuff in and we did we
essentially previewed version 0.9 of
arena commander which should drop next
week and that you know has a whole bunch
of upgrades all the hangars have been
completely redesigned made much more
modular and extensible in PBR they look
great we have a couple of new game modes
the biggest one is the race mode which
is a whole new level and track so it's
set in the murray cup which is a sort of
fictional version of space racing think
of it Formula One in around the universe
we're gonna drop a couple of ships that
you can fly additional ships you can fly
so the m50 and the 350 are will be
flyable with the new patch and we also
had vandal swamp co-op so you and your
friends can go against waves of vandal
and there's a host of other like some
flight model enhancements and changes
you know more of the six degrees of
freedom stuff that people have wanted
we've doubled the speed of the ships a
lot more sort of work on the sound
system and effects the HUD the HUD
itself will be easier to use and there
will be sort of control mappings much
more friendly control mapping stuff for
people with all the you know various
hotels or people atomize so it's a
pretty big drop so we did that we also
previewed multi cruise ship combat so we
did a live demo of flying in a
constellation getting attacked by some
pirates you know there was three of us
flying the ship a couple of us jumped
out of the front seats got into the
the turrets fought off the Pirates and
sort of show the preview of kind of what
it'll be like flying the bigger ships
with your friends in the universe which
i think is going to be one of the big
cool things that you get to do in star
citizen that you haven't been able to do
another space games in the past and of
course that's all at the same fidelity
that you see right now an arena
commander and we'll be doing later stuff
so so that was kind of the the the
game's con share was a lot of fun it was
like 2,000 of the you know people that
have helped make the game a reality and
so it's really great to meet everybody
and I had a lot of fun I mean you know
fairly exhausting after the week of
press interviews and doing all that and
then the week after I was in the UK we
were scouting some stages to shoot the
performance capture for squadron 42
which is the single-player story inside
the star citizen where you shooting the
motion capture or what were you well we
were scouting we're gonna shoot so we're
just gonna so later this year we're
gonna do a big shoot and beginning and
next year we're doing a big shoot and
it's gonna be for all the sort of
cinematics and basic motion sets and
it's Quadra 42 and also in star citizen
and then I was spending time in the
Manchester office which is our UK office
and is about 60 our developers there now
it's actually our biggest office of all
our sort of officers working on star
citizen so I came back here on Sunday
few days back in the office and now I'm
up here in PAX Prime back on the PR
slave trade as they say that is four
that is true just recently about ten
million dollars ago because we measure
time and millions of dollars now you you
posted a stretch goal of procedural
generation so first there are a lot of
different ways to define procedural
generation and insofar as the games
industry it's used a lot as marketing
tournament teased a lot as a technical
term what is your what is CI G's
definition of it well we're gonna we use
it I'm now gonna use it as a tool for
the universe building so you know I know
a lot of people think that stutters and
purely just everything's handcrafted and
something like I don't know elite would
be just all procedural but really or no
man's lines or procedural but really you
know the real truth is that you know all
those games have combinations of
handcrafted and procedural stuff in it
some just have more procedural than
handcrafted and some have more
handcrafted the procedural so we you
know or from the beginning had a plan to
do a certain level of procedural stuff
which would be say on the city like down
on the blending environments we have
four hundred and twenty something in our
hundred systems and there's no way that
we can actually have or you know do all
those individual unique one so their
idea is that like on sort of the more
like a mining outpost or something like
that where it's more sort of modular we
sort of have these different
architecture sets so the designers can
put them together pretty simply from the
modular sets and then something like an
earth or terror in the universe which
would have a lot more sort of unique
pieces to the environment so that's sort
of the simplest of the procedure all the
stuff that we were talking about you
know doing the R&amp;amp;D and it's sort of like
the next stage of stuff which is sort of
procedural generation of say the star
the system environment like the asteroid
feels and also creating the asteroids
themselves and doing them in a muhfucka
sole method so you can sort of mind them
and and you know make different shapes
inside them and all the rest of stuff
and then the other level of procedural
that we're looking at is you know the
planets surfaces so not quite yet going
down and exploring the whole surface
like no man's sky style but even from
space we have you know hundreds and
hundreds if not thousands of planets and
it's not conceivable for us to store
unique textures for a mall so there'll
be a combination of sort of procedural
planet surface generation along with
unique service generation for the more
design planets like Earth or Terra and
stuff like that and you know longer term
we'll be doing research into procedural
generation of like areas of terrain you
can land on so one thing I really want
to push is sort of like the exploration
side of it so you can go down and you
know land on a unexplored planet and
sort of Explorer map out areas and maybe
discover some alien ruins or is this
planet site exploration on foot or is
this flying over well this would be more
sort of landing and doing on foot or on
buggy exploration so yeah I mean the one
thing I don't you know long-term would
be amazing to do
this generation of full planets you can
fly over but you know that's that's more
difficult to do at the fidelity we want
so you can definitely do it like the way
no man Sky's doing it but you know in
the case of what we're doing you know
like I think you'll want to feel like
you land at this city and you know
there's a whole ecosystem and it's
trading and those towns and so that's
the level of like world simulation that
I've not seen anyone do yet and but you
know I think that's what people would
expect at the fidelity that you would
have it started ISM so for us we sort of
have to pick and choose our battles so
you know we will use procedural to help
flesh out areas and do a lot of the
grunt work for designers but there'll
always be a certain amount of oversight
in terms of making sure that what was
designed looks good and feels good and
then a designer so like you know for
instance the procedural stuff could like
lay out the landscape and the design and
come in and quickly tweak it to what he
needs and lay a city down on it so it's
sort of a tool that will help us
generate a lot of content quickly as
opposed to something that's a hundred
percent automated which is sort of much
more the no man's sky or perhaps Ely
dangerous setup so sounds sounds pretty
comprehensive
sounds pretty ambitious what's the
current status of the team how many how
many people have you brought on for this
well we have a lot of people I you know
I think the last ten can I saw was about
271 people or so so it's a lot of now
that's not not everyone's on staff
that's a combination of contractors and
people on staff so you know we have
three in-house Studios one in in Santa
Monica in basically Los Angeles one in
Austin Texas and one in Manchester in
the UK and then we have some developers
also working on the game you know
behavior who's in Montreal in Canada and
then we have another developer in phonic
in Denver Colorado that's working on the
first person shooter side of the game
and how about the procedural generation
group how large is that team well we're
doing some procedural generation we
don't quite announced that yet but it's
some people that have done a lot of some
stuff the quite well-known in the
industry
and so that's a combination of some
contractors and some in-house staff and
in terms of the different types of
procedural generation you can you could
go pretty far with with generating
things in a universe so are you looking
at planets systems stars ships well not
not ships not any of these yeah in terms
of like the planets
yes planets a certain amount of the
stuff inside a system right now we're
not procedurally doing the star systems
although that would probably not be a
too big of a leap we are you know we've
got like a hundred design systems but
longer-term we would probably want to
use some level of the procedural system
to help us build new systems fairly
quickly because we'd like to create
stuff for people to explore and it's
really hard to handcraft everything
quick enough to keep up with you know
the how quickly I want consumes current
content but really I we're kind of
looking at procedural content to flesh
out the world we've designed so it's not
so much hey I don't know this universe
is gonna look like you make it up for us
it's much more like okay we know this
universes will look like but in this
system we need you to detail out you
know the asteroid belt here and the
nebula here or this planet here and the
procedural generation will help with
that or or lay out this you know this
class to mining colony so it will help
to sort of build that up pretty rapidly
and then we'll go in and say yeah that's
good or nope let's change that around or
whatever and what sort of constraints
are you putting in for generation that
will a two-part question what sort of
constraints are you putting in in
general and for procedural generation
when it comes to things like planets in
terms of size well it's kind of hard to
say because that's still early stages I
mean one of the other big things we've
got to do is now we're moving we're
moving to 64-bit in the engine which is
a huge change for CryEngine it's just a
huge change for all game engines because
most and we're all 32-bit but we need it
for this sort of scale of distances we
cover but also we sort of need special
handling for planets because we need
prop realistic scale for planets and 32
it doesn't really handle like a size of
our planet compared to the size of a
spaceship so that's all sort of tech
that we're sort of in the middle of
working on to have it you know be I
wouldn't say hundred percent realistic
but you know have a get much closer to
what it would feel like properly within
the limitations of like what we think
would be like fun and everything because
still even in the star system
we'd probably won't have it be you know
tens of millions of kilometres across
just cuz it would take a lot of time to
travel that distance and procedural
generation going forward what's what's
sort of the immediate milestone for
right now you're just doing R&amp;amp;D if I if
I'm following you correctly are you in
yeah yeah we're definitely in R&amp;amp;D for it
I mean the first milestone that we're
using the procedural generation for is
the asteroids so an you know creating
asteroid fields also creating the
asteroids themselves so we don't have to
like build them artists don't after this
item we get procedurally generated and
we can have interesting asteroids and
you'll also be able to mine them so
you'll be able to you know main out
chunks of them and stuff like that so
that's what that's the very first level
of sort of procedural voxel tech were
working on and then like I said the next
technics stage would be working on the
planet like surface generation but
Planet Service generation from space so
what you would see it from your
spaceship not necessarily being down on
the surface walking around sounds pretty
good so I think I think we've covered
procedural generation pretty well you

for more on this content and we're going
to jump to another video on
customization so stay tuned to the
YouTube channel for that and thank you
