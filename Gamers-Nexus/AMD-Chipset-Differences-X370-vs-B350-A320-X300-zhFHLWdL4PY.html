probably be talking about risin and then
for the next few weeks on and off at
least because there's a lot of
information to work through and we've
only just begun to really get to the
surface of what will eventually be out
there for an for its chipsets and the
rise in CPU and any other cps that would
follow for today we're focusing on the
chipset so we'll be talking about m4 and
it's X 370 be 350 a 320 X 300 and a B
300 chipsets pretty basic at a top level
but before getting to that this coverage
is brought to you by cyber power and
there's cyber XL gaming PC which at CES
we saw one with a risin logo on the side
of it you can learn more in the link in
the description below before getting to
the chipsets we need to cover some of
the basics with the CPU here's a graphic
that we made to better illustrate the
blocked layout of risin the current rise
in CPU as we know it will host a total
of 16 PCIe gen3 lanes and that's what's
available for your graphics devices
another set of 4 PCIe lanes will go
straight to the chipset which are then
divvied out to general-purpose PCIe Gen
2 or 2 USB 3.1 and USB 2.0 the CPU also
hosts capacity to fuel for USB 3.1 gen2
online including options to peel those
off for SD and external devices further
the CPU can either choose a B or C and
our graphic and that'd be either 2 SATA
plus 1 by 2 nvme slot 2 SATA plus 1 by 2
general-purpose PCIe set of lanes or 1
by 4 nvme set of lanes it's one of the
three can't have multiples multi GPU
support is possible through 2 by 8 PCIe
lanes that come off of the CPU so this
would all be gen 3 at this point and you
could also do some muxing as we saw with
some of the X 370 boards at CES last
week that would include MSI's titanium X
power board which uses a set of MUX or
chips to somehow better enable multi GPU
we'll have to actually test it to see
how it works of course as always but the
idea is that X 370 supports multi GPU
you run by 8 and by 8 for the two slots
and most of the slots are electrically
wired for
by 16 by 8 and by for the now which
boards you're looking at be 350 will not
support multi-gpu and he just doesn't
see it as a reasonable device to sport
because they figure anyone with two or
more video cards is probably going to be
on a higher-end motherboard and I can't
say that I argue too much with that of
course it's always nice to have the
option but they're just supporting X 370
for multigp for now and that does kind
of make sense the overclocking potential
it's available on X 370 and beat 350
there might be some caveats there we'll
explore later X 300 also has
overclocking abilities talk about that
in a moment
a 320 and 8 300 and or a B 300 as they
call it will not be overclocking ready
so be 350 yes x3 70s X 300 yes and then
everything else no overclocking there
are two core chipsets two am four for
our audience X 370 and B 350 will be the
main ones that deserve immediate focus X
370 can be thought of somewhat as
comparable to the previous 990 FX line
or to the current disease series of
Intel chipsets in terms of its market
positioning the chipset immediately
differentiates itself from B 350 by
enabling a 2x8 multi GPU support but
should theoretically retain the same
level overclocking as B 350 because the
CPU itself contains so much of the i/o
now effectively SOC in status the
chipset doesn't really do much other
than add a few more lanes and it's
really just a few X 370 offers eight
PCIe gen 2 lanes where B through 50 runs
six PCIe gen two lanes so two fewer and
X 370 also has an additional four USB
3.1 gen2 on ports which are effectively
USB 3.0 with a few changes and should
generally run wire into PCIe devices
that consists of again by 16 byte and by
4 where three slots are present as for
SATA Express these lines are more meant
for use as either 2 SATA 3 ports or 2
PCIe gen3 lanes general-purpose mostly
because actual SATA Express isn't really
expected to be used no one buys SSDs
that you say to Express at this point as
for overclocking again it should be the
same on both platforms front we're told
but Andy's marketing sheet does have an
extra really
tiny footnote on the X 370 with
overclocking and that note would seem to
indicate that better thermal solutions
are required for X 370 overclocking as
opposed to be 350 the main reason I
would think something like that would
happen would be if additional options
were enabled on X 370 that might not be
elsewhere which could potentially drive
up the heat but we'll have to actually
see the boards or the chipsets to
understand if there's anything to that
other than just someone slipped up and
forgot to apply the footnote to both
devices as for X 300 that's an
incredibly small chip set it allows for
higher end rise in CPUs to do what
they're meant to do which would be
multi-gpu if you wanted to they run at
full tilt their overclock we'll all that
stuff but X 300 is meant for use in Mini
ITX systems it's an SFF chipset and in
size it's about the size of a pinky now
for what we're told so it's pretty damn
small that means two things one it
doesn't really do any i/o the only
purpose of that chipset other than to
just enable Rison to do what it can
natively do is to allow us to cure boot
other than that there's not a whole lot
going on it's all the iOS handled
through the CPU but the X 300 version
does allow unlocked overclocking where
the a B 300 solutions do not and it also
kind of oddly allows for multi GPU which
is basically totally irrelevant because
no Mini ITX motherboard is going to
support two PCIe full length slots for
GPUs but it's still allowed so I guess
if you put an X 300 chipset on micro ATX
for some reason then you can still do
multi-gpu that said these sub the
smaller form factor and position of the
X 300 chipset does mean that in theory
this frees up some space on the
motherboard so either some sis or system
builders could go do some kind of
proprietary small form-factor
motherboard and cut off maybe an inch or
two squared of space or they could just
fit another m2 device onto the
motherboard or more SATA or something
like that because the chips that will
not take up much space even stuff like
more USB 2.0 headers which is always
really something I want on many
boards and is never there so that's
potentially good for Andy to have that
smaller SFF targeted chipset we haven't
seen any in person yet they didn't have
any at CES alongside the micro ATX and
ATX boards but that's the basics for it
so I think that pretty much covers a B
300 are the lower end s of F SKUs no
overclocking no multi GPU support
although mostly irrelevant anyway and
that is about everything we have so
chipsets for m4 are going to be pretty
simple compared to what we've seen
previously the CPU largely will dictate
what you can do with your motherboard
end system as a whole because it's
handling so much of the i/o now that
would include again USB PCIe for the
video card with no PCIe three lanes as
fallback and the chipset none at all all
the PCIe three lanes on the chipset
there's about four being sent to it from
the CPU then those are divvied up among
other i/o devices so you're getting your
graphics from the CPU 16 lanes there
that means you can split it into two by
eight so it's really quite simple this
time just more than previously pay
attention to the CPU you're buying
because this idea of I'll buy a good
motherboard now upgrade later and retain
all the same support isn't going to work
quite the same way as it has in the past
so buy a CPU that will support out of
box everything you want in terms of i/o
then the chipset will do a little bit
for you but not a whole lot
