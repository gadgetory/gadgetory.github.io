episode of hardware news recapping the
news for the last week this one includes
some fake news and not the kind that
everyone spouts when the benchmark
results don't match what they wanted but
actual fake news revolving around and am
the slide will also be talking about
Gigi dr6 memory controllers for future
GPUs ek water blocks announcements a
pretty interesting Jones bouquet is one
of these suppliers in the case industry
who provide cases to people like
Roseville and Anna DS for the AI crystal
for example and we've got some news
about razor and a couple of sales at the
end with some Metro Exodus news before
that this video is brought to you by
thermal Grizzly makers of the conductor
not liquid metal that we recently used
to drop 20 degrees off of our coffee
leak temperatures thermal grizzly also
makes traditional thermal compounds we
use on top of the IHS like cryo not and
hydro not pastes learn more at the link
below so typically when people post the
words fake news on hardware articles or
videos they're talking about when
reality doesn't match their expectations
but this time it's about some slides
that were sent around so if you recall
about a week ago we had a viewer
question that we addressed where folks
were asking what we thought of the
alleged 5.1 gigahertz 12 core rise in
CPUs where I basically said sorry
that's not happening next year it's not
gonna happen for risin plus we don't
think it'll happen for risin two it's
possible but it seems unlikely in terms
of looking at reality and then we went
on to say more realistically it'd be
pretty cool to see four point two to
four point three gigahertz that would be
a nice thing to see up to four point
five X so far maybe something like that
but no the slide was for five point one
and 12 cores and so that slide was
believe it or not fake big surprise so
that slide was in fact a faked slide and
was sent around the web and posted on
several other Hardware outlets as news
and rumors and things like that so that
is in fact fake despite it being posted
a lot of places most of them have now
updated their stories and things like
that so this kind of reminds me of a
time there was a time with Korres oh if
anyone remembers that launch with
charisma there was a GPZ screenshot I
believe or something like that
a validation screenshot that was faked
intentionally by some users on the
overclock net forum and this was
actually faked to see who would report
it as fact without vetting the sources
so this was a sort of interesting play
because I'll put a link below if you
want to read the history on it because
the screenshot actually had in it some
hidden characters that if he knew what
you were doing you could you could pull
them out you can basically unhide the
characters from the slide and see that
it was photoshopped not real but if you
didn't know how to do that it might look
like a legitimate slide and so you had
sites like guru 3d reporting on this
some years ago so this kind of calling
back to that era but yeah the 5.1
gigahertz 12 core thing not real perhaps
in the future certainly it could happen
but given the current position of rising
in the market there are a lot of other
things that can optimize on right now
jump it up a whole one gigahertz while
also increasing core account seems sort
of out of the immediate grasp of the
architecture not to say that it couldn't
do it but just that's a big jump to have
from rising to rising Plus maybe it's
rising 2 or 3 but certainly not the
rising plus we don't think and to to
probably unlikely though possible we'll
leave that open for possibility I'm not
gonna say it's not gonna happen next one
AMD developing gdd are six memory
controllers for future GPUs this isn't
really much of a surprise but it's it's
kind of a rumor but not really this
comes from a LinkedIn profile of an AMD
employee so not that much of a rumour
really I believe it was removed by now
the details were that this particular
employee was working on developing a GD
dr6 memory controller for AMD product
and this would include future GPUs so
all the big players now pretty much have
announced GDD our six processes
and fabrication plans that includes
micron SK Hynix and Samsung all together
and there's looming widespread
availability of this new memory so no
big surprise then that nvidia and AMD
would be working toward memory
controllers that would integrate with g
GD r6 not so far-fetched and ii could
definitely benefit from doing something
like this in the future
HBM was really sort of a necessity for
Vega it's it's easy to say why did they
use such an expensive memory but the
reality of it is to go with gddr5 you're
looking at way higher power consumption
for what you're getting and Polaris and
later architectures like Vega are just
objectively limited in their memory
bandwidth especially Vega so they're
sort of forced to play the HBM to card
but GD d r 6 could still be beneficial
for future architectures or things like
that so that's what it looks like is
going to happen at least at some point
maybe with Nabi or something either way
it would simplify packaging PCB
integration help with cost probably and
prevent low yields with more exotic
solutions like HP m2 interposers and
packaging all on a single chip so well
single interpose our solution with all
the chips atop it the next one is from
ek waterblock so ekw B continues to
expand their liquid cooling kits
this one is aimed at a loop in a box
business model along with their fluid
gaming line this time ek is offering the
a 240 arkyd purportedly to entice users
seeking a liquid-cooled
RX Vega 56 or 64 GPU in conjunction with
their CPU being also liquid cooled the 8
to 40 our kit will include the new ek AC
radeon vega full coverage water block
the ek supremacy AC CPU water block the
ek a lose stream SE 240 radiator the ek
Varner fans an SP c series of PWM pump
and reservoir combo ek ACF pala fittings
and ek dura clear tubing with some of
their cryo fuel coolant this is all
aluminum metals as previously so don't
mix and match your metals if you
to expand other loops make sure you
stick with aluminum the next one is from
Toshiba who announced their 14 terabyte
PM our hard drives filled with helium in
mechanical drive news this week Toshiba
announced the mg 0 7 ACA which is their
first helium-filled hard disk drive as
well as the industry's first 14 terabyte
hard drive so Sheba's new hard drive
uses nine PMR platters up to 18 heads
and advanced vibration protection and
sensing Toshiba rates the new disks for
550 terabytes of annualized workloads
and 2.5 million hours MTBF with a
five-year warranty these new hard drives
are aimed at cloud storage and exascale
data centers as well as other Nearline
applications this next one is a case
from Jones Bo Jonesboro added their
latest flagship case in the u MX series
the u mx-5 the case blends steel and
aluminum as well as tempered glass
panels the interior also utilizes glass
paneling obscuring the hard drive and
PSU bays and RGB LED honeycomb
adornments traversed the glass the case
offers features consistent with most ATX
mid tower cases like 166 millimeter CPU
cooler clearance 325 millimeter video
card clearance support for 240 radiators
and it also ships with two 120mm fans
RGB illuminated hard drive covers are
present and the power supply if you look
closely is missing in the photos with
the full system but looking at the
bottom left there's a power supply cable
coming out of the back of the case which
is actually routed from the inside of
the case above the hard drive bays so
the power supply we think is front
mounted and towards the top front of the
case that's a bit different the cable is
then routed through the bottom of the
case and uses an extension cord to put
the plug out the back for normal access
and Jones bow to catch everyone up so if
you haven't heard of this company that's
normal
Jones bow is more of a supplier than
anything they actually do some pretty
nice cases as far as ready built and
ready purchased supply goes they
designed the Roseville Cullinan which
you may also know as the AI
Christel by an ADIZ and they've designed
plenty of square mini-itx boxes that are
pretty recognizable they designed the
old like CW 1 series so this is
something that you will probably see
being sold by the likes of Roseville
perhaps an ADIZ and anyone else in that
boat of buying a ready-made supply item
and then rebadging it may be changing
the fans changing the LEDs things like
that so this is their newest one it kind
of looks like some of those dell systems
that the thread Ripper or Rison systems
that Dell was doing with the weird
pseudo ventilation on the front and top
that's really more of a design thing
than anything definitely limited
ventilation on it but it looks a bit
different the power supply shroud and or
lack of one and the power supply
mounting are somewhat unique in this
market so it's worth keeping an eye on
next one razor and ignition design labs
are collaborating on a portal by razor
so razor partnered with ignition design
labs on this project it's a Wi-Fi gaming
router and the new router is mesh
capable allegedly optimized for high
bandwidth gaming and prioritising gaming
internet traffic the new portal includes
technologies like Wi-Fi autopilot and
smart lanes intelligent active traffic
and interference avoidance which sounds
like a whole lot of marketing and more
of something you put on a self-driving
car either way these are aimed at
finding the newest channel and mesh
nodes available and avoiding crowded
unreliable channels the portal by Razer
is currently only available at the Razer
store but it's $150 and has availability
slated for first quarter 2018 how
effective this will be I don't know some
of this type of application like the
killer networking stuff sounds a lot
better than it is in reality so we'll
see prioritizing gaming traffic doesn't
normally do a whole lot for you you can
definitely do it
but you're sending bytes at a time here
so next one metro Exodus this is more of
game news but it's important to the
hardware industry Metro has long been a
mainstay in benchmarking and that
started with the original metro 2033
followed through to Metro last light
Redux later than that so last night we
used four years we still use it
sometimes for benchmarking these games
provide a very reliable repeatable
benchmark that when they come out is
stressful and they tend to remain
stressful throughout the next few
architectures even the reason it's nice
is because after launch they don't get a
ton of updates so you have a really
steady platform to look at comparative
performance numbers as new products come
out so you'll have to retest all the old
ones from previous generations and
although it ages and people stop playing
it it's still a really good platform to
benchmark for that specific purpose so
Metro Exodus is the new one this is
doing fall 2018 will come out on the
Xbox one Playstation 4 and the PC and it
follows the usual Metro story they've
got a trailer out called the Aurora
trailer and it looks like it's gonna be
a good bench title so we're looking
forward to that one
next one here so sales of the week to
point out Corsair is at k70 lux RGB
rapid-fire keyboard is presently $120
marked down 50 we reviewed the original
rapid-fire keyboard and found that the
rapid-fire switches were not bad they're
definitely something targeted at
specific users though so if you know
that you want that kind of switch it's
on sale it might be worth looking into
but they are pretty sensitive compared
to some other switch types out there so
make sure you actually want that kind of
switch because it's a bit different than
what you might be used to on something
that's got a more forceful requirement
to push the to actuate the button the
next one these e3 70 horas gaming 5 is
marked down to 150 after rebates and
sales link to that in the description
below along with the others there's a
decent mid-range board for the easy 370
in that one if you care about looks an
RGB doesn't have the greatest heatsink
in the world put a fan on it it'll be
okay and then on the topic of gigabyte
there's also the gaming k7 which is
still marked down to 160 dollars right
now from the usual price of 110 this was
billed Zoids primary choice and our best
overclocking motherboards 4 a.m. for
round up because it filled both the
price and the function targets pretty
well 160 dollars that is doubly true so
we can definitely support that board for
a m4 users that price is pretty good
right now but that's all for this one as
always you can subscribe for more we
have some pretty cool content coming up
the next few days dependent when this
goes live there might even be one within
12 hours or so so make sure you
subscribe you want to want to miss it
you can go to store dock gamers Nexus
