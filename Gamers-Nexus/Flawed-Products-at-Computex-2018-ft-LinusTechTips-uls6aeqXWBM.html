this is a recap video of the worst in
show two things apply here the worst
products and the most offensive waste of
our time
hey dude so I have a great concept for
you I'm so glad I ran into you have you
seen the vacuum booth the vacuum yeah
and also actually do you mind if we sit
down for maybe like half an hour so I
want to run through some concepts I have
for how you guys can improve your
channel really yeah so doesn't involve
floatplane um no it doesn't no you know
what we should book an hour so I want to
go through flow plane I want to tell you
all about LTX our convention okay and
I've got a new no no new concept for
your thumbnails okay so every thumbnail
gets a vacuum and you're gonna make face
like this try it try it
no no no not extreme that's gonna be
good okay
so lessons how much for lessons for
thumbnails lessons for thumbnails I hear
you charge a lot oh yeah it's gotta be
at least you know like 600 GPUs no you
can't you can't oh oh
worst burn of the show before that this
video is brought to you by the cable mod
vertical GPU adapter a universal kit
that lets you add a vertical GPU amount
to almost any enclosure the vertical GPU
adapter positions video cards further
back from the glass than most stock
vertical GPU mounts aiding and thermals
and also easily sockets into the PCIe
expansion slots of compatible cases the
adapter kit is brand new and makes it
easy to show off video cards even in
cases that don't include a stock
vertical GPU mount learn more at the
link in the description below for
calling this video the most room for
improvement at Computex 2018 video a lot
of products this year are still
prototypes and so still have lots of
time to improve things and change many
of the manufacturers have asked for
feedback from media and will be making
changes prior to launch hopefully but we
wanted to share some of our own hopes
for improvement with all of you Asus is
up first
asus is a big enough company that it
seems to think you can do just
anything and be instantly successful
there may be some truth to that in some
markets but cases are not particularly
forgiving to newcomers to the market
issues announced it's still pending ROG
Strix case tough case and a mini ITX
case presently unnamed with the icx case
being the most interesting but also the
most problematic of design fortunately a
Seuss's team was extremely receptive to
feedback and we greatly appreciate their
desire to make a good product at the end
of the day there's still time for
changes let's go over what needs to
change first off for the ITX case the
case separates halfway down which asus
says is supposed to happen when the
system has a thermal requirement to cool
down it's a mechanical part that
separates it physically so this is sort
of like some of the inland cases in the
past but it's partly supposed to be a
thermal solution feature the problem is
that the bottom and top parts are
completely compartmentalized so opening
and closing doesn't actually expose
ventilation the top and bottom chambers
are 100% sealed against one another and
when open they remain sealed it does not
open any ventilation and therefore
cannot physically improve cooling
separately the bottom chamber is
isolated for the power supply which
presently houses to 120 millimeter
intake fans upon touching the aluminum
side panel we found it to be warm which
doesn't make a ton of sense for an
intake vent and so we inspected further
we noticed that there were no exhaust
fans or even exhaust mesh grills or
anything for this bottom chamber there
was being taken in from the sides and
forced to escape out the bottom the
inherent flaw is that cool air goes in
warm air comes out the bottom next to
the fan and then it immediately gets
sucked back in warmed you and further
and recirculated ad infinitum this
creates a runaway thermal effect which
asus acknowledged and intends to improve
it's funny but this is why prototypes
come to the show and hopefully they have
enough time to fix it the box also has
no intake ventilation for the GPU we've
provided feedback that the aluminum
support beams at the corners could use a
grill for example or that the top and
bottom of the compartments should be
ventilated presently there's no real
intake in the box we thought the design
was very interesting but it does need a
lot of work asus has some
ideas here though finally for Asus the
company also has an rog Strix case and a
tough gaming case both of which have a
few critical areas of improvement asus
is working with larger case companies to
manufacture these like in win but is
putting in the design first and working
with the companies to finalize it for
the rog Strix case we noticed that the
fans are far from the front of the case
which will reduce their efficacy and
pressure where it counts most we also
notice that the glass plate is less than
a half inch away from the fans and that
the mesh filter is comprised of at least
50% plastic which will further hurt
airflow the move to include handles and
market for Portability and land gaming
also feels disconnected from this decade
particularly given that the case itself
is a full ATX enclosure that's more
suitable for micro ATX and does seem a
bit of out of place for a heavy case
like this one asus has some good ideas
here but a lot of work is needed yet it
has to do more than having a C's badge
to be desirable we do like that asus was
extremely receptive to feedback but
let's move on to another company
next up Acer Acer's booth is next on our
list of most improvable the Acer booth
was about 80% empty populated by a few
screens a table a computer and
presumably a staff member somewhere
we're not really sure what a stirrer was
doing but they sure seemed to have spent
a lot of money on a space that was
woefully unused in the very least they
successfully got tech media talking
about them behind the scenes
next up BitFenix we met with BitFenix
again this year following the Enzo's
launch last year that Phoenix expressed
genuine interest in improving their
product and introduced us to the CEO who
took note on avenues of improving their
cases we greatly respect this desire to
improve the product but it still has a
long way to go yet for the new fusion
bit Phoenix's Fusion case does some odd
things it's got a mesh front so it's
going kind of in the right direction but
they also stuck a plastic cover behind
the match truthfully we sort of laughed
when we first saw it
we're confused as to the intentions and
when we asked fit Phoenix why the
blocked mesh was covered with plastic
they said that the intent was to block
RGB LED illumination from the fans on
the front that bit Phoenix opted to
include there's some cognitive
dissonance here but basically that
Phoenix wants RGB LED
in the case wants mesh but also wants to
insert a plastic sheet to block both of
them because they're worried that users
won't like the LEDs that they've elected
to include our argument is that users
who don't like the LEDs will either buy
another case or will buy different fans
and replace them and that it makes more
sense to target one market well rather
than to markets poorly the design is
actually fine overall if Phoenix commits
to full mesh or even full RGB LED
they'll do just fine
the company just needs to commit to one
design the price target is $80 with 2 to
3 fans which would be extremely
competitive it's just that the front
panel needs some work there most the way
to an acceptable mid-range product and
BitFenix still has time to fix up that
panel Thermaltake is up next mostly case
companies this time Thermaltake has some
good initiatives with the level 20
series we think it's a good way to bring
an expensive line down to consumer
market and it's basically the perfect
implementation of a halo products
they're doing it right on that front
Thermaltake also did well to add
rotatable PCIe expansion brackets
allowing vertical GPUs to sit further
back something that Coolermaster added
this year as well but we still think the
company has room to improve its cases
good glass for example should be cut
back as much as possible on the sides or
even the top and potentially further
distanced from these side panels of the
case this would allow for better airflow
and extra few millimetres of distance
from the corner plates for example would
significantly in this department as well
then we'll take also has room to improve
the left and right side panels which are
presently asymmetrical and don't match
one another although both are made of
tempered glass we do like the modularity
of the micro ATX case and the price
point is extremely competitive at $100
but the ATX case could use a bit more
tuning Thermaltake is also on the list
of vendors that have been receptive to
feedback and we've seen the company
iterate its design and big ways as it
works toward building a stronger
reputation silverstone is next up
silverstone has struggled to make
changes in the new industry of glass and
lights the company has always focused on
function and build quality but suddenly
has gotten caught up in trying to
compete in the looks department
although silverstone has several cases
that looked well-designed and well-made
for the show we found the new LDO 3 ITX
a tower to be the most perplexing it's a
good look but these whores far from
Silverstone's core design philosophies
of function the case has no direct GPU
intake or ventilation evidenced by the
usage of a liquid-cooled card on a show
build and relies on bottom intake that's
largely blocked off by the side panels
we'd like to see silverstone introduced
some of their core design philosophies
back into this case like spacing it
further from the floor or adding in more
grills and the plastic ideally the
company also nudges the fan over to give
the GPU more direct intake cooling paths
Intel has last on the list Intel's 28
core CPU shouldn't have been shown in
the state that it was at all the CPU is
impressive enough on its own that it
will definitely turn heads once it's
ready but it simply wasn't this was a
rushed attempt to distract from thread
Ripper we think that the 28 core part
will be a fun enthusiast part from an
enthusiast standpoint and we look
forward to it but it simply was not
ready to be shown Intel hasn't had to
compete with anyone for a long time and
we think that the companies that most
improvable attribute sticking with the
theme of the video is that of relearning
how to compete with a legitimate
contender Andy had some of the same
problems recently where it comes down to
a matter of allowing the product to
speak for itself rather than trying to
build a marketing story around it
because people will see through it
that's it for our most improvable
products at Computex 2018 list as always
