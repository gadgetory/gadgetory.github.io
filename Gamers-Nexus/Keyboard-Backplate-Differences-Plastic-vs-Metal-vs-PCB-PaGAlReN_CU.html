Donna and I killed this keyboard I'm
sorry this is a Tesoro colada keyboard
that I was using to research keyboard
backplates
one of our writers of Michael Kern's
recently posted an article linked here
about keyboard backplates
specifically looking at metal versus
plastic versus PCB backplates and again
specifically at the mechanical keyboard
market so that's sort of what I'm
talking about today just briefly recap
in his article for those who did not see
it and I'm sorry I just have to do this
okay I really had to get that out of my
system so this is a mechanical keyboard
and this uses a metal backplate as many
of them do including ports hairs k70 and
thermal takes Poseidon's II both of
which we've looked at fairly extensively
in the past and a backplate is very
simply what your switches are physically
mounted to so in this assembly right
here we at the very back there's the
bottom of the keyboard that's the bottom
that's what sits on your desk the red
board here is a printed circuit board
and that contains all of the circuitry
the transistors the capacitors all of
those things effectively all the
electrical wiring that ends up inputting
the key input to your computer
that's what's there on top of that is a
piece of metal and that piece of metal
hosts our switches which eventually feed
through the PCB and talk to the computer
in this instance we're using a metal
backplate which I'm not sure if there's
a steel or aluminum but I becoming off
but I believe it is I believe it is a
steel backlight I could be wrong though
some manufacturers use aluminum which is
a bit lighter and more expensive and
then others use steel which is heavier
cheaper and provides really the same
feel as aluminum at the end of the day
so here's the deal with back plates if
it's not metal it's either gonna be
plastic which is pretty rare or PCB
printed circuit board and in the case of
plastic there are some interesting
advantages that Michael Kern's lays out
in the article primarily with plastic
you get this disbursement effect of
backlights of leds and that's because
the reflectivity of a plastic services a
bit different than one that is metal and
it varies based on how they're painted
and it's very different from one that's
that's a PCB
although most PCB boards it will not be
LED backlit there are a few but PCB
boards tend to be very cheap and even
not mechanical in a lot of instances but
plastic is very rare so then we look at
PCB boards and those are physically the
switches are mounted directly to a
printed circuit board and that's gonna
be cheaper it'll flex a lot you'll see
that this I really can't flex it I'm
trying that's probably a better angle
but it really doesn't have much give
what you're seeing give here is the
plastic back the metal is not moving at
all and that's because it's a big piece
of metal and my nerd arms are not strong
enough to flex it a PCB will flex when I
do that and for a lot of users that's
potentially an undesirable effect
because when you're typing especially if
you're typing a lot or heavily or loudly
you really don't want the board sort of
flexing around under your fingers as you
push down some users like that I've
definitely seen the forum posts where
people prefer the flexing nature of PCB
backplates
for metal we get this resilient thick
piece of metal that really doesn't move
when you type and it provides more of a
resounding clack more of a very resolute
press when you push the key down and for
a lot of users that resonance is
resonating quality because it feels more
sturdy or more solid that's definitely
true to the extent that steel is far
more solid than plastic now metal will
be more expensive and will be a bit
heavier if that's even relevant to you
for some people it might be but the
fruit the most part I would imagine huh
it is more expensive though but you'll
still find it in 50 dollar keyboards
like the Nick CS motor which we reviewed
and it's not $50 or thermal takes
poseidon's E or of course there's K 70
which is not a $50 board but a very nice
I think about 70 $200 board depending on
where you're buying and when you're
buying so that is the keyboard backplate

you like this video it's helped us a lot
so far and I'd love to keep doing these
and I will see you all next time peace
