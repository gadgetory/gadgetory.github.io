GTX 1080 hybrid and that is this card
right here it's got a bit more official
set up than what we used for our own DIY
hybrid that we built a few months ago
and the 1080 launched this one is using
an FTW PCB is custom PCB more advanced
power delivery and management system
which in theory will benefit
overclocking we'll look at that soon and
it's got a much more elegant cooling
solution that we'll look at shortly
though to be fair pretty tough to beat
hours in terms of elegance before we get
into the review of the 1080 FTW hybrid
this content is brought to you by
iBUYPOWER and the new element gaming PC
which uses it a modified NZXT s340 case
a large tempered glass side window front
window and LEDs everywhere so we just
reviewed the Seahawk that's this thing
also known as the hydro graphics card
this is a Seahawk ex from MSI and
Corsair they work together coarser does
the cooling solution I won't go through
it all here we already reviewed it but
the main comparison here today is
between these two devices not really any
other 1080 because we want to look at
specifically to liquid quality cards I
don't have a gigabyte water force yet so
tell them to send us one but that's what
we're looking at today for the full
review as always that link in the
description below we've got power
testing and noise testing and a couple
of extra games there that you won't find
here so do check that for more depth but
let's get straight into it here in terms
of core specifications the $730 1080 FTW
hybrid still obviously is a GP 104 - 400
GPU that's the 1080 as expected but it
has fitted the GPU on a custom PCB with
a 10 phase V core vrm and 2 phase of
memory voltage BRM EVGA is using on
semiconductor power phases and MOSFETs
with a doubler and we've got a PCB
analysis coming up in full from build
Zoid soon on our channel if that
interests you further the clock runs at
18 60 megahertz boosted so 13 megahertz
higher than the seahawks advertised
boost and uses 2 8 pin PCIe headers to
drive power to the board as opposed to
the single 8 pin header on the Seahawk X
this is because MSI opted to use a
reference F II board for its PCB and so
is limited by the very same components
found on the founders Edition
including the 5+1 phase power design and
single 8-pin power header RGB LEDs are
also present on the EVGA card for those
who care about such things and can be
driven through software more to the
performance side though EVGA uses a
master slave switch which can be toggled
to drive even more power to the GPU for
overclocking something we'll discuss in
our OC section cooling is handled by the
same ASA tech 4.5 a gen liquid cooler
but with the EVGA model as opposed to
the seahawk MSI model the EVGA model is
using a protruded copper cold plate
that's quite a bit different in terms of
at least how it looks and we'll see how
it performs shortly EVGA has also got
some more unique cooling methods to
dissipate heat from the vram but before
talking about the vram cooling note that
corsair also uses a 4.5 gen cooler from
ASA Tech and now uses a flattened cold
plate to better conduct heat from the
GPU silicon since there's no IHS
curvature as would be accommodated by a
CPU CLC used in the previous generation
this is actually a big deal for
performance and is an improvement over
the 980ti seahawk hydrographics previous
generation cards there's a big story to
thermals here and that's because mostly
the EVGA card was actually running worse
than we expected during initial tests so
we ran an additional 10 or so tests on
this card using all different
configurations between the cooler the
fan and the cooler and the fan on this
card swapping them things like that to
control for all the variables possible
and we also looked at voltage control
for another potential difference pulling
the hybrid apart to take a closer look
is what gave us an idea finally of what
was causing the disparity and that's
with the vram cooling sync that we
talked about in a previous video but
also we're about to talk about right now
from our automated thermal test with the
stock cards we're seeing a thermal
performance output that lands the EVGA
1080 FTW hybrid at 29.6 1 Celsius delta
T over a means which isn't only not that
good but also far from what we expected
the corsair hydrographics which
theoretically uses a worse cooler but
does use a better fan to its favour and
also a lower voltage is that eighteen
point five Celsius delta T that's eleven
sauciest cooler than EVGA is card this
is what prompted all the tests that we
ran shortly after including a swap of
the fans increasing the Corsair V
to match EVGA s an even request in a
second hybrid to validate that we didn't
have a leaky card the FTW hybrid is
using a copper plate to cool its memory
much different from the aluminum base
plate of the FTW non-hybrid card by the
way and a copper plate contacts the c LC
called plate with ten between the
interfaces this means that like the
gigabyte liquid cooled solution EVGA is
now conducting the heat generated by
vram modules into a copper plate that is
shared with the GPU CLC if you're asking
if this increases the GPU diode
temperature when compared to the Seahawk
a solution which cools its memory using
only the base plate and a blower fan the
answer is yes here's a look at the
results from our test where we remove
the copper plate from the equation
completely and cooled only the GPU with
the CL C Inlet air handle the view ramp
the 1080 FTW hybrid is now sitting at 23
Celsius load which is about seven point
four C cooler than when the vram shared
the CLC that's not to say that our
hacked solution is better it's actually
not but it proves the hypothesis that
EVGA is temperatures are primarily
higher because of the decision to cool
the vram and the GPU with the c LC
rather than the more simple solution
that is normally taken as for why it
looks like GPU temperatures increase
that's just because the liquid cooler
can only deal with so much heat at once
and it's becoming saturated between the
GPU and the vram so the diode of the GPU
has a perceived increase in temperature
the rest of the heat accounting for the
gap between the 23.1 celsius variant and
18.5 celsius of the seahawk can be
concluded largely as a higher voltage on
the EVGA card coupled with EVGA zwarst
fan here's another set of test data with
these configurations we learned that
EVGA c LC outperforms the corsair c LC
when we control for the specific PCB and
fan and we learned that the corsair fan
outperforms the EVGA fan and the worse
solution together was to use the EVGA
fan with the corsair CLC on the Seahawk
actually considerably worse with the
Seahawk now at twenty four point six C
instead of its original eighteen point
five Celsius value before moving on to
fps here's a quick look at our endurance
overtime chart to our burnin note that
maxing out the power limit will flatten
the clock rate more aggressively which
is what we want the boost 3.0 behavior
does still tank frequency when it thinks
it can get away with
outs of power savings even though you
lose a little bit on the 0.1% low frame
time side the dives aren't nearly as bad
in this case as when we were thermally
limited like with the tight necks but
it's still obviously a jumpy frequency
internally the EVGA hybrid solution is
actually somewhat brilliant because of
the way they're prioritizing the vram
cooling over what we normally see like
in this card or even the previous
generation EVGA hybrid 980ti or really
most other liquid cooled cards on the
market if you're using something like an
Arctic cooling kit and again it's
because of the way the vram and the GPU
share the same CLC so liquid is
effectively cooling both though it's
indirectly cooling the vram it's still
far greater dissipation than what you
get with an aluminum plate and air
because you're looking at a 400 watt per
meter Kelvin dissipation potential on
the copper solution at 25 C anyway and
then you're cooling it with liquid so
that's a far greater potential in terms
of cooling ability than air and aluminum
or whatever may be the case for the
standard card that you're talking about
now whether or not that tangibly impacts
performance is something we'll look at
in the overclocking section because that
of course matters too it doesn't matter
how good it seems on paper it matters if
it actually impacts your gaming or the
price of the product at the end of the
day the FPS section will be quick this
time since we've already explained all
these numbers in the hydro graphics
review and in the article for the hybrid
starting with Mirror's Edge catalyst at
4k high we see the EVGA 1080 FTW hybrid
mouthful card performing effectively
identically to the MSI seahawk X both of
which sit at 51 point 3 FPS average 42.3
fps 1% blows and with very close to your
0.1% blow as the only differentiator is
in the 0.1% low value and that
difference is not significant looking at
1440p ultra the FTW hybrid post 95 FPS
average the same as the hydrographics
aka seahawk X and 1080 gaming acts more
or less with measurably but
imperceptibly improved 1% low-end 0.1%
low values or the founders edition card
the Seahawk aka hydro graphics and the
hybrid are posting an approximate 6.7%
performance improvement and this is
consistent in most of our tests and is
true to of the gaming ax
since it's got the same clock rate in
similar baseline spec to that of the
Seahawk X stock 1080p pushes us to 139
FPS average for both devices again with
the hybrid managing a marginal gain no
significant difference but a measurable
gap nonetheless this is accounted for in
the 13 megahertz clock rate change to
some extent but the cards can be seen as
equivalent moving on to GTA 5 at 1080p
we're hitting 130 4.7 FPS average for
both the FTW hybrid and the hydro
graphics the cards are as expected about
equal both post performance gains over
the FE card of about 7.5% definitely
noteworthy but between the two liquid
cooled options specifically the FPS is
about the same and the same is true at
4k where each device is 59 FPS average
the FE card at 56 FPS average is about
5.4 percent change or slower than the
two cards were looking at here looking
now to black ops 3 the FTW hybrid at 4k
is pushing 73 FPS average about equal to
the hydro graphics card again aka
Seahawk X we're still at a gain of about
7.3 percent over the reference card and
priced pretty similarly at this point
1440p isn't much more exciting the
hybrid and Seahawk X are again equal
mostly with no significant difference
between the results 1080p is a little
light for these cards when configured to
high settings but both were tested and
the FTW hybrid finally posts a slight
gain but the test variants at this point
increases because the frame rate is so
high so there's more room for potential
error or just variants in the test
results because again we're over 200 FPS
as for ashes of the singularity it's
more of the same average frame latencies
are a tenth of a millisecond off for
1080p high the FPS at 1080p high is also
within a fraction of a frame between the
Seahawk x and FTW hybrid and the 4k high
FPS similarly post near equal results
nothing exciting again as expected for
two cards of such close frequency for
more benchmarks including doom on Vulcan
and OpenGL Metro last light shadow of
mordor and a couple other things power
tests things like that check the article
linked in the description below and now
we're just going to move straight into
overclocking this is our overclocked
progression for the 1080
FTW hybrid it's the same in terms of OSI
instruction as other Pascal devices
we've overclocked using sliders in
afterburner or precision we're able to
get up to a stable clock of 2150 one
point five megahertz with peaks 220 164
megahertz it's not quite as high as what
we got in our own review sample F II
card when we put it under liquid through
DIY modding but that's a tough
comparison because it seems we got
somewhat of a good sample
regardless Eevee JS 1080 FTW hybrid is
hitting 2150 1.5 megahertz core with our
OC and 11.2 5 gigahertz effective memory
overclock it would appear that the
advanced memory cooling does not
noticeably impact the memory overclock
Headroom because we see these numbers on
pretty much every 1080 card so it's
difficult to quantify just how useful
EVGA is elegant solution may or may not
be the shared cooling at this point
mostly impacts review charts because the
practical differences at this point are
pretty narrow but GPU temperatures are a
solid 10 C higher with this
configuration so that obviously shows up
in the charts more than anything
we cannot reasonably measure the vram
temperatures without embedding
thermocouples carefully in a few
different test units and that's not
something we're doing today the unit
Peaks at 1081 millivolts a limitation of
Pascal and is able to toggle to 130
percent when the master slave switch is
switched for reference this is what the
msi seahawk x overclocked stepping looks
like on the screen now we got stuck
around 20 50 megahertz it's got a lower
power target offset and the card uses a
reference efi board and power
configuration which is far weaker in
terms of its voltage and power
management potential that puts EVGA
about 100 megahertz faster in the
overclock dept for core but the memory
OC is about the same so again that
thermal solution although elegant
doesn't really impact much in terms of
overclock potential out of the box
regardless an extra 100 megahertz over
the closest liquid competitor is a
reasonable gain and these FPS charts
show the small few point percentage
differences as a result of that extra
100 megahertz the GN hybrid sits just
above the EVGA 1080 hybrid and OC
capabilities at 21 64 megahertz and with
the highest FPS of all the 1080s we've
yet tested and again that was a DIY
model including the 1080 game index
which also maxes
20 50 megahertz at $730 EVGA s hybrid
solution comes in cheaper than the
Seahawk it's got a better pc d better
power staging a better overclock output
and a more complex thermal solution even
though the diode temperatures appear
higher in the charts because of the way
they're cooling the vram in addition to
the GPU core gigabyte sort of pioneered
this solution with the water force cards
especially for this generation the 1080
generation which we have not yet
received and they seem somewhat inspired
by the fury X which came out about a
year ago at this point reviewed then
even J's taking the idea and distilled
it into something that does seem a bit
more affordable than the nearest
competitor and it works theoretically
well but again the practical difference
is not necessarily there objectively the
EVGA FTW hybrid is a superior PCB to the
reference board used on the Seahawk it's
got higher overclock Headroom than the
Seahawk if you're looking for fun
overclocking you won't get much of that
with Pascal at all but you will
certainly get more on the FTW hybrid
then again on the Seahawk from our
limited sample size testing the cooling
solution is certainly more interesting
and is one we're genuinely excited about
but its efficacy is difficult to
quantify given the already low
temperature performance of gddr5 X and
the equivalent memory overclocked to
cheaper cards one thing we're curious
about is why evj didn't extend their
copper plate to the VRM if feasible and
it looks like it is because that would
help drive down the temperatures of the
VRM obviously potentially give more room
to OC depending on what's getting too
hot I don't think it's the vrm though I
think we're hitting voltage or power or
basically Pascal boost limitations more
than anything but still it would have
been cool to see as for the small things
RGB LEDs help differentiate the card in
a market which otherwise posts nearly
equivalent FPS results between high-end
cards the 1080 gaming X air-cooled card
Seahawk and 1080 FTW hybrid all output
about the same FPS and are normally
within one to two percent of each other
if that much
the cars are appreciably faster than the
FE reference card often six to seven
percent slower than the FTW hybrid but
$730 makes EVGA FTW hybrid $20 more
affordable than the Seahawk X and
hydrographics it uses a better board and
has more OC potential we still think
that these cards should all be
to the $700 mark EVGA is included but
730 is moving in the right direction
minimally MSI and Corsair should drop
their prize to compete with EVGA they've
got a simpler cooling solution a
reference PCB a cheap vrm a cheap
plastic shroud and a lack of LEDs which
although maybe not significant is still
a cost and there's no reason for the
Seahawk to exist at its higher price
point then the FTW hybrid and that
aligns with what we said in our review
of the Seahawk card both are decent
cards but the price becomes the hinge
point between the two and right now it
is in favor of the EVGA hybrid at $20
cheaper I'd still like to see the prices
drop to closer to 700 overall though but
