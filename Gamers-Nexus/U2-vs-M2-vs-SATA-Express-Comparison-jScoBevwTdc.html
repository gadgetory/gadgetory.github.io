of another storage interface this time
it's the you to interface that we saw on
gigabytes unreleased Broadwell eat
motherboards and this interface has been
out for a little bit but it's finally
coming to consumer markets on mass this
TLDR video recaps the difference between
you two and m2 storage devices as
quickly as we can with some additional
information on SATA Express like where
it's gone before that this packed
content is brought to you by cyber
PowerPC or did readers choice by PC
Magazine for gaming desktops first up an
extremely abbreviated recap of current
chipsets Intel's 100 series chipsets
have high-speed i/o lanes that are
almost entirely addressable by the
motherboard vendor this allows for more
differentiation between products and
these are called HS io lanes z170 has 26
HS i/o lanes that can be assigned to gb
e SATA PCIe or PCIe enabled devices and
you - and m dot - are among those PCIe
enabled devices but what is u2 u2 is an
interface that was originally called s
FF 86 39 and it was mostly for
server-side use but it has been renamed
for the consumer market the u dot to
interface connects directly to PCIe
lanes on the motherboard and this is as
opposed to going through the SATA
interface which makes u2 and expansion
sort of on SATA Express u dot T's pinout
allows the use of for total PCIe lanes
and as such its maximum theoretical
throughput on Gen 3 is 4 gigabytes per
second the u dot 2 pin out resembles the
SAS connector if you know those but with
way more pins for the lanes on the top
of the connector and several the pins
are reserved for the ref clock lanes 0
to 3 the SM bus and dual port the
remainder of the pins are used for
signaling power control and the other
ref clock on the motherboard u2 is a
double-decker connector that receives a
similarly double-decker cable from the
SSD on the other end a much wider cable
plugs into the SSD for the U dot 2 multi
Lane interface with an additional cable
for power this is the fastest 2.5 inch
SSD interface currently available to
consumers but that doesn't mean that the
drives are inherently faster more on
that
Carolee SATA Express meanwhile
communicates maximally through two PCIe
lanes on the motherboard limiting the
interface to two gigabytes per second on
gen 3 that's half of you two SATA
Express will become a dead end abandoned
standard in short order as the industry
continues to ignore its existence and
moves fully to m dot 2 and u dot two
interfaces along with normal PCIe SSD S
the SATA Express standard cannot
communicate through four PCIe lanes and
that is its primary limitation and
weakness for reference SATA the normal
interface the l-shaped one has a maximum
theoretical throughput of 600 megabytes
per second which comes down to about 550
per second after the overhead it is
accounted for SATA does not utilize PCIe
which is a small advantage for anyone
maxing out their chipsets laying count
but keep in mind that chipset storage
lanes are not the same as GPU lanes
so even multi-gpu configurations may not
conflict with nvme or PCIe SSD is it
does depend on your configuration though
and it depends on what platform you're
using in the future
MDOT 2 then is the most comparable to
you - it's capable of the same four-lane
throughput for storage devices but takes
a significantly larger footprint on the
motherboard physically and limits users
purely by physical space on the board
you two interests us because it can be
stacked we're current - SATA connectors
our PCIe lanes allowing any way and you
could theoretically run several 2.5 inch
UDOT - SSDs where MDOT - may not allow
one quick note on MDOT to interface
ports though on motherboards you can
actually buy an adapter that adapts them
to you - so this is useful if you have
m2 slots on the board that you're not
using or if you want to use a 2.5 inch
SSD rather than an m2 form-factor SSD
the reason you might want to do that is
because some of the UDOT - SSDs already
have faster controllers or NAND on them
making them more capable of just pushing
a higher throughput through the actual
interface and because MDOT - technically
supports the same 4 Lane allowance as
the U dot 2 interface does adapting it
should work just fine for these 2.5 inch
SSDs if you prefer those now as for the
speed of the SSDs themselves this is
just the interface we're talking about
so even if your SSD is
is hitting the 550 megabyte per second
limit of SATA it might not really make
use of the UDOT to 4 gigabytes per
second throughput allowance maybe it
gets a couple more megabytes per second
it comes down to the controller and then
and used on the SSD and unless your SSD
is rated for higher speeds it won't
actually make use of these higher speed
interfaces but these are important
because they allow for higher speed SSDs
to be made in the future and moving
forward with new controllers and NAND
technology so that is all for this quick
