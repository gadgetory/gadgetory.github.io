and today we're talking about NZXT su+
RGB LED controller and this is for cases
so this is a brand new product we're
reviewing it here today
and what you get with the $60 that it
costs is the RGB LED controller itself
which is a small box about the size of a
2.5 inch SSD although a little taller
but it will mount in 2.5 inch SSD slots
so that's cool that's good future site
on NZXT part it also comes with four LED
strips with 10 LEDs each so you can get
40 LEDs with the stock set up and that
is expandable to a total of 8 strips so
you can buy an additional 4 for $20 more
and the other inclusion here is a couple
of extension cables so with the stock
kit alongside the controller and the
four LED strips you also get four
extension cables two of which are about
6 inches in length and two of which are
about 18 inches in length running nearly
the full length of this h4 48 hour next
meets a mid tower setup looking at the
RGB LED controller the ports on the back
are pretty simple it's 4 ports there's
power there's a microUSB to USB 2.0 FP
or front panel header and then 2
channels for the LEDs with the 2
channels and the stock setup of 4 strips
you could run either 2 channels with 2
strips each for some additional
customization using the cam software and
that is how the LEDs are controlled or
you can set up a single channel with 4
strips for Less customization but give
yourself the room for another 4 strips
in the future the hue plus is capable of
sixteen point eight million color output
with four lighting modes two of which
are smart and audio with audio being
responsive to decibel levels of your
speaker output and it's got eight
display modes fixed color so a single
color breathing pulse scrolling marquee
covering marquee which is basically a
chase light where one color chases the
other color around the case spectrum
rainbow and then alternating patterns
and you can do all these forward or
backward in the case if you have a
preference to which way it's going
an additional LED is press
on the 2.5 inch enclosure but that is
only white so there's no RGB control
there and that controller we've been
able to mount pretty successfully on the
top of the PSU shroud in this h 440 v 2
it'll be the same h4 40mm s 340 as well
and other cases that might have SSDs in
that spot on top of the PSU now the one
limiter here to keep in mind is even
though it is a 2.5 inch form factor you
won't be able to fit the controller on
the rear side of the motherboard in a
lot of cases or even on the top of the
PSU shroud which we've done here because
it is a little bit taller so the limiter
with the PSU shroud setup is if we
installed a PCIe SSD with a heatsink
that like the Intel 750 then you have
collision issues on the lower slots
we're using a predator HyperX SSD here
with a PCIe adapter card and we're able
to get them to work together with the
PCIe SSD in the lowest slot but it's so
close that it's actually a thermal
concern so I would not run it this way
permanently for my own setup for example
I'd probably move the controller to the
hard drive and SSD cage is in the more
traditional vertical mounting over here
away from the SSD lower PCIe slots which
I normally use for something like a
predator or Intel 750 SSD the color
output on the hue plus is pretty
impressive I'm definitely happy with the
vibrance and brightness of the leds
there's not too much bleed in the
side-to-side directions it's all very
directed which is good for lighting
components if you want to do some kind
of spotlighting with the strip in the
top center and light downward towards
the CPU cooler or the RAM or something
like that then the way the LEDs are set
up the way their lenses are focused is
conducive to that type of endeavor a few
of the wishes I have for the hue plus
would include an elbow connector similar
to the SATA 90 degree headers and that
would be so that you can put it in the
corner of the case and get a
wall-to-wall flush very clean LED strip
setup right now we're kind of talking
cabling away and tying it all down with
zip ties
which to NZXT ease credit they do
include I'd also like to see some
additional customization through these
software and luckily for NZXT they keep
this all in-house they have the firmware
in-house they have cams software
in-house and that means that going
forward if NZXT is active in furthering
development of the hue plus controller
they could enable things like game
integration which is something that
Logitech does very intelligently with
game developers so Logitech in that
example they have the g9 10 keyboard
which is an RGB LED keyboard and working
with the GTA 5 devs rockstar games
logitech was able to set up so that the
F keys will actually flash the red and
blues when cops chase you in GTA 5
that's kind of gimmicky but it's a
really cool idea and expanding that idea
companies like Corsair and Logitech
actually have both talked to us about
setting up their headsets with the LED
ear cups so that spectators and eSport
arenas can more readily tell which csgo
Cod or halo player is currently dead or
dying by using red LEDs or LED changes
to warmer colors and things like that
and that's something that could also be
integrated with the hue plus set up in
cases if you had a case on display and
you wanted to integrate with a game to
show how is a player performing or how
our thermals performing if you tie into
a hardware monitor fan RPMs there's a
lot of room for upgrades here to the Q
Plus through cam and the firmware which
is something that NZXT has told us
they're working on but it's not all
currently out there just yet so for
current launch everything you've seen in
the video is what the hue plus is
capable of it's currently selling at
sixty dollars with twenty dollars of
add-ons through for additional LED
strips and the price seems fair but we'd
really like to see it closer to fifty
dollars because ultimately you're just
paying for flashy LEDs for your case so
that is all for this video if you like
