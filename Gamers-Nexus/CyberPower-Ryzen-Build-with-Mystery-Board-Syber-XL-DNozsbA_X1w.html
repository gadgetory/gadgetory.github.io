the cyberpower suite right now and we
have a system with technically I suppose
some form of risin or the x3 70 chipset
in it I'll be talking about that in a
moment and then also some unique cases
from CyberPower and cyber their brand
we'll also be talking about some
different assemblies using known cases
like the thermaltake tower 900 before
getting to that this coverage is brought
to you by thermaltake and their core p3
enclosure which is wall mountable and
can serve as a test bench check the link
in the description below for more
information on that so let's start out
with the risin system next to me this is
the white and black one the unit is
called the cyber XL we'll get to that in
a moment on the back side is sort of an
emblazoned on the side panel big reisen
logo which you'll see in RB role and
that houses some form of an AMD system
now the motherboard has no branding on
it I think it's in a sort of no name
asus board there's no board nomenclature
or anything like that really very little
information it is an X 370 chipset which
we talked about in another video that is
on the channel and that's more or less
all that I know about it we're not
allowed to benchmark it we're not
allowed to touch it so that's basically
it's one of those it exists type of
things but that's kind of the extent of
the risin news but they have one here so
the cool thing with the case this is if
you've seen our dark base 900 coverage
you may remember that the enclosure from
be quiet that we saw at computex can
rotate so you can actually rotate the
board Trey this kind of does something
similar to that where the entire chassis
can rotate and flip everything so you
can either display on the left side of
the right side depending on preferences
and that's done by CyberPower basically
before they ship it on the left side of
this one and we'll have some b-roll
again of this there is a it's basically
an acrylic panel with a diffuser on it
and that gives us the kind of neat
lighting effect where the LEDs from the
inside of the case are almost reflecting
against the side wall and so when I
first saw it I actually thought it was
an LCD side panel kind of like the snow
blind from I by power but it's not it's
just a diffuser a lot cheaper way to do
it and you get the light reflection
that's more or less the extent of it but
is pretty cool looking so that's on the
cyber XL the enclosure as always with
all these sis you just kind of go
through and pick the case and pick all
the parts so the SKUs as far as as far
as the price goes it just depends on
what you pick the case itself we were
told starting at around one hundred
thirty dollars but then the price is
dictated by the components and this one
is all fully water cooled the next
system we're talking about has two
liquid cooling loops one for the CPU and
the GPU separately so that's kind of
cool and we'll move over there now so
this is the second system bill this one
is using the thermaltake tower 900 you
might recognize this depend on how
closely you followed our coverage in the
past last year we showed some
thermaltake mods at CES and this was
derived from one of those so the mods
were created by case modders of course
one of them built a system like this
based off of a thermaltake frame and now
they have the tower 900 which is
basically three tempered glass panels
one on each side and then a large back
area for cable management and liquid
cooling radiators things like that the
radiator it looks like a might be a 420
or something is mounted right here on
the side and that's all ventilated so
that's the enclosure it is available
separately if you wanted it for DIY and
that it's basically just a large display
case like you would have for anything
else in your house so the components on
display are the EVGA hydro copper 1080s
so these are the open-loop version more
or less of the hybrids and those are
connected to the they're actually
isolated loops to the GPU loop with both
gpus is separate from the cpu loop so
you're not pumping hot liquid into one
of the components cuz you can either go
from the cpu to the GPU or vice versa
with one loop and I heat something up
and that is what is this this is a Z 270
motherboard from gigabyte we just
reviewed their gaming 7 I believe this
is the gaming 5 not sure if it has the
same things I talked about with the
gaming 7 we'll find out later I suppose
the piping has this sort of copper
finish almost looks like kind of thing
you'd buy off the shelf at Home Depot
and I mean that in a more unique DIY way
and that it's fitted with thermaltake
fittings and all that stuff that you
need to connect everything so that's the
basics this is the locks
and of cyberpower cases or systems i
should say tower 900 thermaltake case
inside the leds are just kind of their
in-house RGB LED setup which most people
have at this point it's certainly so big
the last here as you all know thank you
for watching as always links the
description below for more information
if you're curious learn more about the
risin and zen and the x 370 stuff we
have content online already you can
check that on the channel or the website
gamers nexus not net subscribe for more
i'll see you all next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
