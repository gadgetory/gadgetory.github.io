zenith board 4x 399 if you haven't seen
that video check it out now we're
looking at the X 299 board the Intel
Board for the upcoming skylake accent kb
lake x DP use this is a flagship they
have plenty of other x 299 boards on
display we'll have some of those in the
article below we're going to focus on
this today for the video before getting
to that this coverage is brought to you
by Corsair and their new Vengeance RGB
LED memory kit you can find out more on
the link in the description below the
kit comes with hand-selected ICS or
better overclocking which will benefit
these platforms going forward so let's
get through this board
first of all X 299 here's new LGA 2066
socket we've shown this a few times now
with gigabyte MSI at least one other
vendor at this point we have the two
sets of four dimm just to clear this up
again to make sure everyone is on the
same page guy like X can use both K be
like kb lake X cannot so KB Lake X will
use one side of the dims and only the
right side typically the others will go
unused that's just because the
architecture is really a refresh of KB
Lake but with the new socket type so
that cleared up two sets of four dims
the power design we think is an 8 plus 2
it's an 8 plus 2 phase power design I
don't know the components so can't
really comment on that unfortunately
though we do have it for most the other
vendors so 8 + 2 2 per side and moving
on from powers design we can go look at
the actual power which in this case is
an 8 + 4 for the CPU fairly standard it
for these boards right now and then
there is additional power input down
here in ammo like which we saw on the
zenith as well and that's for your GPU
power which helps remove some of the
load through the PCIe slot if you end up
with a scenario where it's drawing too
much power out of spec to this slot or
something like that or if you're just
overclocking a lot so that's what set up
there for other things like storage
there's a standard set of Stata
they have you - slots are becoming more
common now finally normal USB 3 and then
a whole bunch of i/o the i/o includes 10
Gigabit Ethernet so that's kind of
noteworthy you get 10 Gigabit Ethernet
on the board and then there's also
wireless ad which is also noteworthy AC
is kind of old news now looking at the
most obvious piece which is going to be
this plate in here
whenever they call it marketing words
the plating is somewhat translucent so
you can actually see the mock-up trace
design with the LEDs on it that's kind
of neat and then you have your gigantic
chipset cover which is largely aesthetic
at this point the chipsets obviously not
anywhere near that big other than this
stuff MDOT two devices can be mounted on
the board under there right for one and
then you can also mount to the DRAM card
so you see this extra slot over here
you've got four four and then one that's
not for memory that's actually for an
add-in card where you mount to m dot 2
SSDs on it and something HTS is head out
for awhile now you can check that out
really on any retail if you're
interested in learning more so I think
that walks us through all the key
components on the floor that we can talk
about now I do not have a price and I
would price on any of the X 299 stuff or
on actually dynamics up we do have a
sort of tentative release date looks
like July for this one so keep an eye
out for that we'll probably be looking
at some of these boards in the near
future but that's really that's all I
have for you for now on the rog rampage
