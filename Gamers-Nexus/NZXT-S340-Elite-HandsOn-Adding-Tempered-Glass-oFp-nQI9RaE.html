in Southern California we're here
actually to check out the new UCI
esports arena but separately checking
out the s340 elite which is what's next
to me so you'd know that as 3:40 at this
point it's one of the cases we recommend
in the sort of 70 to 100 dollar price
range this is a hundred dollar model of
it and the changes are for the most part
it's the s3 40 that you know but there
are a couple of changes that bring it up
to modern trends I suppose that we saw
at Computex and one of them is
instituting this tempered glass panel I
just turned the case off it is not a
temperate is not a tinted tempered glass
panel so you've got a four millimeter
thick panel here that is the glass and
then on the side you may have noticed an
SSD so this is a new SSD mount on the
side of the PSU shroud the original two
are still on top of the PSU shroud and
other than that the changes at this
point are mostly sort of towards the VR
trend as well so there's an HDMI port in
the front of the case up here with the
rest of the i/o and there's even a label
over the USB 3.0 ports and the HDMI port
so that's dedicated to your headset
which is mounted here on top of a puck
so this puck is included with the s3 40
elite it's basically just a magnet
that's got some rubber and you put the
headset on it that's the whole idea
there other than these things inside the
case which because I've turned it off
you'll have to see in the b-roll but the
new NZXT air RGB LED fans are present
and those will be customizable through
software so NZXT cam is what controls
that there you go very good timing there
and this is connected to hue plus
controller so there's two hue plus
controllers here on top of the PSU
shroud and as is these slots and then
the fans connected there's a couple fans
in the front as well and these we don't
really have full details yet on what
they will be capable of but you will be
able to control through software so
that's something to look out for the s3
40 elite is available as of soon it's
announced today and a $100 price point
on that backside I guess we can mention
kind of quickly has some new cable
management set
so this first of all is sort of like
we've talked about in the past with
fantex and fractal
it's basically an extra cable management
clip so you can route your cable through
there and get rid of the zip ties and
then the cable management bar is now
five millimeters thinner than it used to
be that was changed on the s340 later in
production but is on the s340 elite so
that does allow for the larger NZXT
radiators to fit so that's pretty much
all we have to look at right now
anything else we'll cover in the article
