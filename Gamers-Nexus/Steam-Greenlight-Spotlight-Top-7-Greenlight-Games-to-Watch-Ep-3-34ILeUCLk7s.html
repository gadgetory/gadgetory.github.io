Nexus dotnet and welcome to the third
episode of green light spotlight our
community driven overview of games that
you should watch on steams greenlight
service please leave a comment below to
nominate games for next week's video if
you have any in mind that you'd like us
to feature with that said this week we
start off with vit remand slot number
seven Vikram is a first-person puzzle
platformer game that emulates the
freedom of movement found in Portal and
cube with a Q and in victim it is our
objective to collect objects by
overcoming obstacles and solving puzzles
with our cybernetic powers like gravity
inversion materialization of objects and
inhuman jumps the game boasts more than
45 stages and currently has a demo
available which you'll be able to find
on the greenlight page so go check that
page out it is in the description below
if you want to take a look at victims
demo in number 6 we have magic maker and
magic maker I think has the potential to
be a mechanical masterpiece the bright
and plucky platformer utilizes your own
creativity as its core mechanic where
you explore the environment collect
spell components that can be put toward
custom sorcery and effectively create
your own spells by mixing and matching
different components that are found
within the game's mechanics that devs
suggest that more than 1 million spells
combinations are available and that
includes optical lasers making things go
boom homing devices and portals with
which you can think and more if you find
yourself immersed by customization alone
this is totally worth consideration for
you next we have receiver I've been
following receiver which is our fifth
placing game for quite some time now
actually it is by whoa fire games who
are working on overgrowth and it started
off as a game making challenge focused
on a gun centric gameplay wherein the
core mechanic of the shooting game is
actually the gun you manipulate each
element of the gun like the chamber
barrel and other objects and have no HUD
to provide vitals other than
a couple of how to options to show your
commands the game has permadeath
espionage and extremely interactive
gameplay so i highly recommend checking
this one out i am you from the future
there's no time to explain no time to
explain is our next game for this week
it is our funny game for the week i
suppose i should say and no time to
explain you fight your way through a
world littered with duplicates of
yourself probably some of them with
goatees and probably giant crabs and
other monstrosities that are preventing
your future self from warning your
current self about something bad but
unfortunately there was no time to
explain what that exactly is if you like
bizarre humorous and time-traveling
stories with classic platforming
excellence this one is for you switching
things up a bit in third place this week
we have Neo Tokyo a dystopian
representation of future Japan which is
entrenched in tumultuous socio political
upheaval as rival SpecOps groups perform
under ground reconnaissance and fight
shadow wars the first person shooter is
built upon the source engine and offers
unique classes like the Recon class that
we see here and each utilizes setting
appropriate functionality such as
cloaking devices neo tokyo is a
multiplayer game and it is currently
available so if you're interested go
grab it is in the description below if
you click on neo tokyo but it does need
your vote to officially make it the
steam as a distribution platform
incredibly is a ridiculous adventure
puzzle amalgamation actually I am very
impressed by its gameplay and almost in
spore like fashion we expand and build
upon the credit feeds body to overcome
physics challenges and puzzles the game
has fluid artistic direction and musical
backing an excellent challenge curve and
even offers a level editor so that you
can create your own puzzles in levels
the game claims to be an homage to human
creativity and ingenuity but in the end
it just looks fun and finally the most
dangerous game comes to mind with this
one in miasmata I hope I'm saying that
right you play as a plague scientist who
worries desperately to unveil a cure but
alas you're alone on an island that is
infested with infectious wildlife and
other dangerous creatures abound the
game utilizes custom AI that will track
players by smell sight and sound so it
is really important for you to play
smart and not leave any tracks you have
to take your time to discover this cure
it also implements though and this is
worth noting a unique triangulation
system for location mapping so that it
kind of it makes it cool to pull out
your map and it's actually in real time
you can point at different objects and
map the location for those of you that
like cartography are worthy of course
and please like this video if you liked
it comment if you have any questions or
suggestions and subscribe as always and
we will see you guys next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
