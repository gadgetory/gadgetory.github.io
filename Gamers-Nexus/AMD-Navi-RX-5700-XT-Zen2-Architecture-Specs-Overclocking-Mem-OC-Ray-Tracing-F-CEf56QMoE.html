information for both AMD Rison and Navi
including overclocking information for
risin Navi bass boost and average clocks
architectural information and block
diagrams product level specifications
and extreme overclocking information for
isin with liquid nitrogen we understand
both product lines better now than ever
before and can brief you on why am these
working on we'll start with the navi
specs die size and top-level
architectural information then move on
to rising and the also talk about rate
racing during its tech day throwing some
casual shade at nvidia and so doing and
we'll cover that here as well before
that this video is brought to you by
MSI's x57 a motherboard lineup MSI's x5
70 motherboards will be available on
July 7th with the launch of Rison 3000
series CPUs and now include flagship
brands like godlike ace and creation the
MSI edge will be among the more
affordable mid-range motherboards
appealing for most rise in 3000 builds
while the godlike has more overclocking
support an abundance of LEDs and OLED
and a server grade PCB for improved PCIe
for signal integrity keep an eye out for
MSI's x5 70 motherboards for the rise in
3000 launch or learn more at the link in
the description below so first off note
that AMD did not give pricing
information to us today and that instead
will be unveiled at the e3 event which
will be happening or will have happened
right around on this video goes live
so we'll do our best to post a comment
and pin it to the top with the prices
once AMD does unveil them but if we
don't do it please post the prices below
so that everyone can see them and get
that information we do have a whole lot
of other stuff though including a ton of
architectural information and this event
overall yielded a lot in terms of
details on deeper down specs for the
products some of it we're saving for
later because there's too much of it to
go through all here but we do have most
of it for this I want to get one gripe
out of the way first there's these tech
days they they're primarily actual good
tech information but there's a little
bit of marketing screwy in this one and
that was with trying to show a
comparison of CPU thermals between two
different CPUs by pointing a thermal
camera
at a heatsink and there's a lot of
problems with that one of them the scale
on that image was 23 to 27 degrees if I
remember correctly which is insane for a
scale because then you have white hot
and red as a point two degree difference
and separately pointing a thermal camera
at a shiny metal heatsink doesn't do
anything it doesn't tell us what the
junction temperature is in fact you want
the heatsink to be hot because that
means it's working and also you're
probably showing the reflected
temperature of the room or the
environment not the temperature of the
device itself or maybe you you could
deal with emissivity issues as well you
really need like a blackbody object for
that for measurement and then ideally a
scale that's not four degrees wide just
for reference what we would like to see
here is an actual Junction measurement
where you're looking at the internal
processor sensor for thermals or you're
at least putting like a thermocouple in
there between the heatsink of IHS
something like that anything but
pointing a thermal camera at a heatsink
that's that's actually useless so that
was the only real gripe and for that to
be the only major gripe coming from us
is pretty damn good so just kind of set
the stage with that I mean that's that's
the main thing that we have to complain
about and you know our content if that's
the main thing to complain about them
that's not so bad let's get into the GPU
specs frequency and die size first and
then we'll walk through the risin parts
after that Andy has two GPUs it plans to
release in July of 2019 with the exact
date TVD at time of filming rise in 3000
to mostly lands on July 7th so the GPUs
will push out around the same time the
ApS will also launch on July 7th with
the CPUs the two cards will be the RX
5700 XT and rx 5709 XT both moving away
from GCN and towards the new rDNA
architecture we've known GCM to be
extremely limited in cache bandwidth and
in scalability past 56c use so our DNA
will be a refreshing change that should
be interesting to study GCN will stay
alive for now
for the high performance deep learning
and non gaming market segments but our
DNA will be the game in architecture
going forward the RX 5700 xt will host
40 compute units with 64 stream
processors per Cu or 2560 stream
processors
for the 40c urx 5700 xt this is the same
s P Percy you count as Vega 10 also add
64 stream processors for Cu but note
that you can't linearly compare these
streaming processors one to one because
the architecture has changed a lot in an
AMD performance demo the company showed
the press that it's Navi 10 GPU that's
the one being used in the 5700 series
post about 14% higher performance versus
Vega 64 with about 22% lower power
consumption this wasn't am the internal
demo so obviously we need to validate
that at home base but that uplift is
promising for our DNA is significantly
smaller first GPU speeds were listed to
media as 1905 megahertz boost 1750 5
megahertz for gaming workloads and 1600
5 megahertz base wear boost here really
just means the peak clock or the rare
opportunistic clock the delta between
boost and gaming tells us a few things
but one of them is that a.m. these
chosen blower cooler is potentially a
poor choice once again to no one's
surprise there should be more thermal
and power Headroom there to clock higher
and we think that'll be proven once
their custom designs out or when we put
a water block on the card well talk
about the negatives more later but let's
get back to the specs and the
architecture notes first as for GPU size
AMD also provided that information to
the press the vega 64 die for reference
measures at 495 millimeters squared with
Navi 10 measuring that 251 millimeters
squared this is extremely important and
it's for a lot of reasons by
significantly cutting the die size and
also by eliminating the highly expensive
HP m2 andy is able to cut its
manufacturing cost significantly and
finally start competing with nvidia
directly in price and he claims that the
RX 5700 xt will be the direct RT x 27 t
competitor we don't have the price while
filming this but we'll make sure it's
posted below as noted earlier and fill
it in for us if you can't either way we
know her fact that na'vi 10 will be a
lot cheaper for AMD to make then vega
because the die is smaller and there's
no HBM to instead moving to GD d r 6 so
these are good things this means the
price will come down for the consumer as
well in theory anyway
and if an these claims increase of
performance per watt and reduction and
power consumption are even remotely true
which they really should be there's no
reason they wouldn't be then this could
be
and these property entry into the gaming
market for the past couple of years
we've basically gotten refreshes of
refreshes which is extremely boring for
everyone you have an RX 580 refresh into
480 and RX 590 refresh in 580 and and
obviously didn't do a whole lot to gain
and the any ground other than compete
kind of with a 1060 class hardware so
Andy is is still not competing at
flagship level we would really like to
see that if only for the halo marketing
effect that's an important class even if
a lot of people aren't buying 28 ET is
for example it's a marketing move where
the halo effect of having the best
product on the market and that's really
what it is in the gaming world even if
it's not the best value because it isn't
the value of having the best product on
the charts is that people will look at
that and then they'll think I want that
but I can't afford it
they'll buy the next tier down so Andy
really does need to get a flagship out
there at some point but they're starting
with a for TCU part that will compete
with an RT X 2070 and that is a really
popular market segment so it's not a bad
move it's just one that we've seen
repeated time and time again by am the
this time however it does look like on
paper that the the specs are more
competitive than the previous attempts
at competing in this price category so
that's the the hope that we see some
renewed competition with the new
architecture that is promising but we do
really want to see something the
flagship territory at some point it's
just it's not gonna be this time at
least not this launch but maybe this
architecture later down the line
in short the 5700 XE has four TC years
eight gigabytes of gddr5 14 gigabits per
second for four to forty eight gigabytes
per second of bandwidth 17:55 megahertz
gaming frequencies 1905 megahertz boost
likely limited by the blower cooler and
we'll have to see what better solutions
can do later the RX 5709 xt will cut
down to 36 e use 2304 stream processors
with an 8 gigabyte GD r 6 frame buffer
and GPU speeds of 17 25 megahertz boost
16 25 megahertz gaming and 1465
megahertz base and ii was forced to
acknowledge the real-time ray-tracing
marketing battle this time but doesn't
have an immediate plan to support it
from our end we think it's fine that
there's
immediate support for real-time
ray-tracing it's just that the market
demand for real-time ray-tracing is it's
sort of hard to gauge so we know that
there's not a whole lot of support for
RTX when and video launched with it and
the no games supported it for one and so
it's interesting to see the script flip
a bit between everyone saying RTX has no
value to now people are saying well but
it doesn't have RDX and that's something
you'll see more in our discussion with
Gordon from PC world in a separate video
but to give credit to and video they
have forced AMD to acknowledge
ray-tracing and start talking about it
and AMD is a way of doing this was
mostly to say well we'll push the
features and the hardware when the two
are ready to be shipped together so
throwing a little bit of shade at Nvidia
for that and they talked about a quote
driving the ecosystem so that gamers can
take full advantage of the features they
pay for which is a fair comment to make
and a bit of a jab but as a quick aside
and a separate one note that AMD is
planning on making a seven nanometer
plus a navi GPU for late twenty twenty
or twenty twenty-one and that's aiming
to support some form of maybe hybrid ray
tracing in the future we don't have
exact details but and they did note an
interest in moving the sport parts of
ray tracing with full ray tracing
support more targeted for cloud
computing later indicating that this is
not something I am the expects to be
doing locally anytime soon and that's
probably realistic the industry isn't
isn't quite ready for it yet as we've
seen with our TX total board power
should be 225 watts with a fifty seven
hundred XT 180 watch the 709 XT we asked
if V BIOS would be locked and due to
security concerns AMD is locking down
custom V BIOS modifications we then
asked if power plate table hacks would
work this generation and we were told
with a laugh that we'd have to learn new
tricks to bypass the power limits it's a
little bit of a letdown from the friends
use case of power modding but we're
hopeful that we or more likely build
Zoid can find new power bypasses the
reference card will be using a blower
design there are two different shroud
designs that we've seen but the PCB is
overall mostly the same with one change
the V R M so
schoolers a blower cooler unfortunately
it has a vapor chamber this is a design
we've seen struggle a hundred percent of
the time in the past
Andy is adamant that this is the way
they want to go with it primarily for
reasons of using it in poor ventilation
cases which we've done that test and a
lot of the time the dual axle cards do
still work better because you're sucking
all the heat from the whole system
through the GPU otherwise but either way
and he has made some moves in the right
direction by restricting the noise this
time
so the rpm ranges from a couple hundred
rpm at the low end when it's idle to
about 1800 rpm or so max when it's under
load and that will vary depending on how
cool the ambient case temperature is but
Andy says it's limiting the noise level
to 43 DBA now a quick note that doesn't
actually mean anything right now because
we don't know the distance that number
is measured at so 43 DBA without the
comparative of of their measurement
before the original coolers really
doesn't mean anything to us presently
but it's not because they were trying to
hide it just because they genuinely they
didn't know and they have to go find the
answer for that and we won't have it
before we film so what we do know is
that Andy said their measurements more
or less matched ours and for what that's
worth we found that the previous blower
designs ranked about 59 DBA under 100
and so if Andy's capping at 43 this time
that is a significant reduction in noise
remember that this is not a linear scale
it's a logarithmic once that difference
means a lot more than the linear Delta
would be so that's potentially a good
thing but we need to test the card to
see more the reference 5700 XT PCB will
have a seven phase vrm we don't know the
power stages unfortunately did ask but
not something they had for us today it's
probably a six plus one configuration
but Andy can confirm that for us today
again they're not hiding it it's just a
matter of getting information quickly
enough and then the 5709 xt is going to
have one fewer phase that'll probably be
a 5 plus 1 power stages we need to
follow up on and get full full
information on that for the analysis of
how much power the the PCB can handle we
also for what it's worth didn't see a V
bio switch on the card so it looks like
a single bios this time it should be a
pretty final retail version
the card that we saw but there might be
one more revision of changes so maybe we
won't commit to a firm statement but it
does look like probably single BIOS on
that card before diving any deeper on
the GPU stuff let's talk CPUs for a bit
this was a very complex and long tech
day there's a ton of information we
won't be publishing here today on the
CPU side of things
AMD did have an EXO c2 demo at the event
and we learned that Andy was hitting
about 5.35 gigahertz all core on the 16
core CPU which until now is not
officially shown and this was using an
MSI godlike motherboard something for
which we have some some initial coverage
from Computex and builded will have a
full PCB breakdown in his channel but
godlike board is about topped here for
MSI 4x OC and this matches the numbers
we mostly heard previously we've also
heard 12 core this from a board partner
should do 5.5 Plus approaching 6
gigahertz on Allen too so 16 corr 5.35
gigahertz fell into does make sense we
don't have h2o numbers just yet
unfortunately but we are trying to get
them and as for the rest there are a
couple of critical notes for
overclockers that you may be happy to
hear if you do benching then PCIe gen 1
no longer has to be used for Rison for
the actual 3d benchmark or for
benchmarking in general so now you can
do 3d benching with Rison and enable
PCIe gen3 or for previously you had to
disable those and go down to Jenn Wan in
order to run the benchmarks properly
cold bugs will depend her CPU but the
one that was being run for Andy's demo
was run at about minus 150 degrees
Celsius for the Alan 2x OC demo for
memory overclocking reisen 3000 is also
looking more promising than previously
it's supposed to fairly easily support
30 600 megahertz XMP without issue and
then we've also heard on MSI's boards of
going upwards of 50 100 megahertz for
the memory at timings of 1821 21:56 and
1t for the command raid that 51
megahertz 50 100 megahertz overclock was
done without
Elan's who on the cpu so that's just a
memory overclock that's a result of
better trace layout and a results of a
new controller design some of the more
noteworthy architectural changes to rise
in 3000 CPUs focus on higher IPC and
higher game performance interestingly
and these
engineering discussion the senior
architects and and the fellows thought
that Zen to woodsy frequencies
regressing which is something that you
do typically see what they process
reduction for example down to seven
animators for this one engineer's
originally thought the jump to seven
nanometers would result in lower clocks
relegating Zen to to a server part but
it's actually coming out to desktop
client so that's quite the change what
it was going to be otherwise the team
was able to figure it out and some of
the key changes included the following
AMD doubled the size of floating-point
Engine two to three 6 bits meaning that
AVX of 256 can now run a single cycle on
Zen 2 so that's a big change and he has
doubled its load store bandwidths for
data storage and movement integer
execution was also improved primarily by
reducing resource contention during
integer operations and he also doubled
the l3 cache size more data and local
cache should mean fewer hits to memory
but also reduced effective latency to
system memory and the further
highlighted that this improvement in the
cache access and in prefetching
algorithms should reduce the effective
memory latency and as an aside and he
has made the decision unfortunately to
rebrand l3 as game cache so if you see
that name in the future that's what that
means
that is what l3 is now Andy showed some
more internal benchmark charts and while
we know there is an improvement to
gaming of course we'd advise looking out
for our own benchmark test whom the
processors launch some of the internal
charts looked a bit GPU constrained down
which one you look at but we do
anticipate performance uplift if only
from the IPC increase and of course from
the frequency increase so these are
places where you will see performance
increase especially in games versus the
previous generations memory is also more
easily tuned to 3600 megahertz as noted
earlier and beyond to 5000 with the msi
setup that was used for memory extreme
overclocking probably by top PC and he
also walked through architectural
changes that will speak to in more depth
approaching the launch for some quick
stats we learned that Andy has moved its
integer execution to a 92 entry integer
scheduler from 84 previously it has
increased physical register file entries
from 168 to 180 that has grown the
reorder buffer from 192 to 224 which is
meant to help with making up for the
latency hit by increasing l3 size Andy
has increased the historic
from 44 to 48 with increased load/store
bandwidth by 2x and that should recap us
for now so again there's a lot more we
have several documents on all the
breakout sessions there's a lot to learn
here and we'll try to cover that over
the next week or weeks as we approach
the launch but for the pricing we don't
have it that time of recording leave it
below or we'll do it if we catch it in
time thank you for watching subscribe
