donna at CES 2015 we are at EVGA suite
right now looking at a forthcoming
kingpin card there's also a closed-loop
liquid cooled 980 that we'll be looking
at so these are both 980 cards the first
one is the kingpin and all this coverage
first is brought to you by CyberPower
cyber vapor gaming PC so this kingpin
card has 14 phases it's got the AC X 2
point 0 cooler and it can be converted
to a single slot which is pretty cool in
terms of things you can connect to
there's an EV bog connector and which is
an EVGA overclocking utility and then
you can plug into prawns for voltage
readout if you want to use a multimeter
for your overclock in which you're
buying something like this you probably
will be doing that there are 28 pin
connectors plus a 6-pin connector it's
like lot more power potential than the
reference 980 and the max TDP we're not
quite sure what it is but we know it's
more than 300 Watts so a lot of
potential there for overclocking we also
know that the power target percentage
which I explained the Maxwell
overclocking video is higher than
reference but again don't have that
exact number right now so for an extra
dose of craziness there are actually if
you're using ln2 to overclock your card
there are memory heaters here that will
keep the memory warm because if it's
running too cool which alan 2 is capable
of definitely then the memory will
potentially have limits on its
overclocking so there are heaters here
to deal with that there's also an RGB
LED and that can be controlled through
EVGA precision and right here it's just
cycling through all the different colors
but you can customize it in precision
for BIOS chips there are three physical
chips on the board which is of course
useful if you get locked out or break
the BIOS when you're trying to hack it
for a different voltage setting or
something like that so this will be
available in February MSRP is not yet
known but check the site for more
information on that and now we'll move
over to the CLC GTX 980 so now we're
looking at the EVGA hydro copper version
of the 980 this is also not out yet and
also should be shipping in February MSRP
not yet known this is using an ASA Tech
CLC to cool
to cool the GPU so it's just using a
closed loop liquid cooler that you mount
the radiator I believe it is a
120-millimeter radiator you mount that's
your case and it handles the GPU cool
and it's got a normal squirrel cage fan
on there as found on the reference
design so that'll help funnel some air
through the heatsink and other than that
it's it's really targeted more for
silence than overclocking it will
overclock very well of course because
it'll cool better than air and retort
told it sits around 40 to 45 50 Celsius
went under full load and that is that's
pretty market improvement over the GTX
980 s reference cooler of course you
will be paying for that in price so
check links in the description below for
details when we have all the pricing
will tweet it out and post on Facebook
and yeah that's EVGA sweet i will see
you all next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
