of ask GN we're filming another one
right after this for the patreon
extended version go to
patreon.com/scishow to get access to
that but this is the main show so if you
want to leave a question for next week
post it in the comment section below or
on the patreon asked yen channel and
we'll try and get to it for next week's
episode this week we've got a couple of
good ones one on how much does vrm power
delivery actually matter and i took that
question to our expert build Zoid to get
his quote on it and i think that'll
probably the most interesting to a lot
of you but we also have some fun ones
about things like well GN design a case
so we'll get into that after this before
that this video is brought to you by
Corsairs new dark tour RGB SE mouse the
dark poor RGB se is a wireless gaming

the description below
quick mod mat update for everyone first
a couple of you have asked when the next
round will ship the good news if you've
back worded it already or your back
ordering it soon you will definitely get
the next round of mats the we're not
completely sold out of the next round
yet so you have time store doc here miss
Nexus not in that if you're interested
in it we should be getting them shipped
to us within I think our target right
now is 10 to 12 ish days maybe 10 to 15
depending on when this video goes live
and then from there obviously will ship
it out to you also add the usual
shipping time for that if your domestic
or international that's your answer it
takes a while to get this stuff shipped
over after it's finished production so
first question first real question gamer
games asks asked yen a third time asking
sorry
the post keep posting below we get a lot
of comments does vrm power delivery
matter in overclocking EG 13 phase power
delivery overclocks higher than eight
phase power delivery thanks I'm going to
I have a big answer from build Zoid I'm
gonna sort of preface this by saying it
depends the question you're at
skin depends on all kinds of stuff like
what kind of components are you
overclocking how far are you
overclocking them and we'll get into his
answer for the rest of this so build
Zoid from actually hardcore overclocking
he's got his own YouTube channel you
should subscribe to if you haven't he
says it really depends if you ignore the
thermal aspect and just look at the
electrical benefits of multi-phase you
basically get this lower Ripple and
faster transient response basically more
phases equals better voltage regulation
however it's easier to stay in spec on a
10 amp to 20 amp jump than on a 10 out
to 100 amp jump also ripple at 10 amps
is lower than at 100 amps for a given
set of components continues to say at
low currents the electrical benefits of
a multi-phase design aren't relevant
because a single phase wouldn't be
having issues once you get into very
high current draws the multi phase
designs will start showing their
advantages as keeping good ripple and
I'm gonna read this part in builds eyes
for haste once I got to it and transient
on a single 100 amp phase is really
really hard to do now if we weren't
limited by physics you could build like
a stupid high switching frequency single
phase that could rival a massive multi
phase he continues bit by saying I think
the simplest answer is that having more
phases only really helps for higher
power draws though I would recommend
against overclocking on what on less
than four phases even on something like
at 7600 K I think a 73 50k would
probably be kind of okay or at least the
i3 shouldn't clock much worse on a
three-phase compared to a four phase
something like if somebody some 100k
could end up requiring much higher V
core setting to hit the same clock
compared to a mobo with more phases or
more true phases so that's probably best
answer you're gonna get it does depend a
lot this is something I talked to the
builds I had about as well but it
depends on the CPU you're overclocking
as he indicated here with i3 as i-5
Zeiss Evans of course Rison same thing
applies it for example if you're
overclocking an eight-core Eisen CPU
versus like for core huge difference in
the power requirements in the thermal
requirements and the
of heat that the vrm is generating also
again this does depend on what you kind
of consider to be your stop point for an
overclock if you're trying to do stuff
like build Zoid then you definitely need
a lot more than the average user who's
trying to hit like four point eight or
nine on the average Intel i7 chip or 3.9
4.0 on the advertising chip but his
answer is pretty good for you so I'm
gonna leave it there
next question oh and actually hardcore
overclocking if you want to check them
out next question is a balanced diet who
says if given the chance to influence
the design of a piece of hardware such
as a case would you do it why or why not
for example of NZXT he came up to you
and said Steve we're looking to make a
high airflow version of the s340 elite
complete with a mesh front panel and
we'd like you to help us design it what
would you do we've kind of talked about
this before designing cases is really
hard I have a lot of respect for the
people that do it even when like even
when their cases aren't the most
positively received by us I still fully
understand how difficult it is to make
that because I mean we've talked to all
of these PM's and product managers over
the years I've heard the horror stories
we work with factories ourselves now on
things like the mod mats and I get it so
it is hard that said yes I I do think
it'd be fun to work on I don't have a
design in my head right now one day we
kind of have some some completely not
concrete won't happen anytime soon ideas
of making a one-off case just just to do
it just for fun go to like a local
machine shop or call some friends with
the equipment to do it
and some of them some designs and see
what we can put together that's not
happening anytime soon I'm not promising
content on it today or even this year
but it's something I'd like to do it's
kind of like a distant content idea that
I really like and and I think we could
offer a bit of a unique angle on it if a
company came to me
I mean sure if it's kind of like dear
Bower is a good example where he worked
with Leanne Lee to make the dynamic case
I'd be open to it for sure
that said it's definitely an
intimidating task like I've seen a lot
of cars from our viewers really like
Steve should design a case GM should
design a case I we could probably get
the airflow side pretty well but though
everything I also like the looks that's
difficult design ID is really hard maybe
we'll look into it some day for fun
though I'm certainly not going to be
mass producing cases anytime soon
but it'd be fun as just like a mock it
up in CAD bring it to a machine shop or
some friends who can put it together and
and make it and test it just to see what
would happen but uh yeah you sure sure
if someone if a company came up to me
and said we'd like to design a case with
you I'd be like yeah let's do it that
sounds fun but yeah again the
compromises you have to make in that
kind of design are challenging and I
respect what they have to go through to
do it next especially when you consider
the cost of things
next question Matt the tech says hey
Steve I just joined patreon to ask this
question but we'll be staying because I
want to support my favorite tech
journalist thank you I appreciate it
when precision boost override is turned
on on the 2700 X what is the TDI TJ Maxx
of the 2700 X I can't find anything
official about this I was hoping you can
investigate for us I know with precision
boost override turn to off that is
supposed to be 85 degrees Celsius
whether that's TDI or tea control I'm
not sure but there is nothing out there
that I can find about the throttle point
when you have precision boosts turned
off or on I guess depending so the
tricky thing here is that Rison doesn't
throttle the same way that Intel CPUs do
and because Intel's had market share for
so long I think we've all kind of gotten
used to that for like like the
understanding was when a CPU hits a 100
degrees or whatever TJ Max is for the
CPU then it throttles down whereas with
GP is the understanding is every couple
of degrees you lose a couple
megahertz because they use different
boost technology GPB is three and what
I'm even AMD does now in Vega cards
same idea so with AMD CPUs rising TVs
they're getting more and more like GPUs
in the way they boost rise in to just
like risin want except even more so is
really sensitive to temperature so you
could push 90 degrees on it TDI sure but
the stability of the overclock is going
to be much worse at that point
AMD officially just so everyone knows
their official number I I think their
official number is sixty point eight
degrees as the optimal temperature that
doesn't mean you should buy like a 600
millimeter radiator to try and get it to
be sixty point eight degrees if you're
like pushing the high overclock it does
not it absolutely doesn't mean you have
to run it at that temperature but I'm
just saying that was there when when
creating their TDP numbers the metrics
they use for optimal die temperature is
sixty point eight so that gives you a
starting point to answer the question
directly TJ Maxx I think is supposed to
be about 95 but we've run CPUs that
don't hard shut down at that point and
they don't throttle either so that's the
tricky point where you see rise in two
CPUs and it's not like they hit 95 or
they hit 90 or 85 or whatever it's they
don't hit some number and just magically
throttle down 300 megahertz lower like
you expect with Intel typically what
happens is you just lose boosting
Headroom of its stock including access
far too and if it's overclocked you lose
stability so it'll keep trying to hold
that frequency but at some point you're
gonna have a freeze a blue screen
whatever and you'll have to restart now
in our testing and our experience
staying under 90 TDI helps a lot with to
build a whole lot with stability staying
closer to 80 to 85 has proven the most
stable with the lower voltages that we
try to use you can push higher voltages
to maintain a higher overclocks but
obviously the more voltage you push into
it the hotter it gets do you have kind
of a feedback loop where you're trying
to increase stability by increasing
which increases heat which decreases
stability so that's kind of problem you
run into it with it and I don't mean
problem like a design flaw I mean
problem like it's a challenge when
overclocking it works pretty well as a
design it's just you know expect
different things when you use different
products to ever talk so to answer your
question it's about 95 is is kinda the
hard limit in theory but it'll depend on
the motherboard different motherboards
will interact with t.j.maxx in different
ways on Intel for example just because
I'm still the most familiar with that
cuz riding to still new on Intel you can
hit t.j.maxx on a board like a hundred
105 with a EDT CPUs and my down clock or
it might shut down it depends on how its
configured or if you changed it for what
it does when you hit TJ Max and what
kind of protection you wanted with rise
I'm like I said it's not so much of a
hard number that you hit and things down
clock like if you have hardware monitor
open or hardware info open and you're
expecting to see a big down clock when
you hit a certain temperature threshold
it's more likely you're just gonna see a
freezer a crash then then kind of
temperature or thermal throttling of the
frequency except in the case of stock
performance in which case you'll see
some boost limitations but we're talking
more overclocking here because that's
where you're more likely to hit the
higher temperatures anyway next question
Daniel Munez says on episode 77 around
the two-minute mark you mentioned that
on Intel Hades Canyon nook the Vega MGP
present isn't really Vega but it's kind
of Polaris what do you mean by this
Vegas memory controller is made oh yeah
yeah so these are my notes I want to
read to you so here's the thing this
comes down to how do you define one
architecture versus the other AMD calls
it Vega so really at the end of the day
it is called a Vega product it is called
a Vega GPU that's the official branding
but as for what is Vega or what is
Polaris you have to kind of draw a few
lines to decide the Vega M GPUs on the
Intel nook are a semi custom solution
AMD worked with Intel
to make this this Vega branded GPU it
uses Polaris technology he uses Vega
technology because at the end of the day
it still has a high bandwidth cache
controller so I was HPCC to me that's a
very definitive
this is Vega feature HPCC is something
that was really specific to Vega it was
a big deal with vega's development early
on and that's a defining characteristic
that I would I would point to that and I
would say that's Vega architecture
it also has HBM too so it's got high
bandwidth memory something that Polaris
does not have although Fiji had high
bandwidth memory 1 HP I'm with the fury
X but Polaris clearly doesn't have HP on
to you so that's a big differentiator as
well as for other stuff there's
differences of well like I said
polarities GD r v GC n 4 vs 4.1 2 GC on
5 on Vega and you end up with a kind of
just an existential question of how do
you define it because it is kind of Vega
but it's not the Vega that we expect
when we talk about Vega 56 or 64 so yes
you bring up great points here in in
your question but it's it just kind of
depends on if you're using strictly
andis marketing or you want to call it
like Vega asterisk kind of not but kind
of is
PCWorld has a great article on this they
kind of started talking about it there's
some other stuff out there as well so
yeah Vega M doesn't currently have DX
12.1 support but it could be added
probably the Vega M stores HPCC it's got
HB m to it does not appear to have
drawstring binning rasterization or
rasterizer z-- or rapid packed math I
guess so
technically yes those are Vega features
but we don't really see them used too
often anyway and I would call HPCC a a
higher echelon of Vega feature than rpm
but that's just
kind of define it myself yeah I think a
couple other things were pointed out
device idea indicates Polaris but that's
just a device ID doesn't necessarily
mean anything there's a high rob count
versus a low CU countin that's pretty
unique that comes into the semi custom
design so when I said that what I was
referring to is it's not the Vega it's
not Vega 56 or Vega 64 it's not the same
thing that you think of architecture as
those because it's got some polaris
tendencies but it's not 100% Polaris
either it's a unique thin in-between and
for the record we really like the Hades
can you know that's probably my favorite
thing I reviewed this year just cuz it's
so interesting because Intel and Andy
work together on something that it's
really good like yes it's expensive but
it's still really good hardware and I
can appreciate that in isolation of the
price and that's because they work
together instead of trying to kill each
other for five seconds and you know with
something really cool so you end up with
a semi custom half Vega half Polaris
type of thing that Intel probably had
some specification on depending on
whatever they were trying to do with the
box
next question rusty Shackelford says as
stupid as this is going to sound what's
the difference between HB m and G DDR
memory chips is because how they're
manufactured how they're programmed or
something simple like the resources
they're made from I think this question
is referring to price because in the
video this was posted on we were talking
about the cost to make HB m 2 versus
gddr5 were you talking like 60 plus
dollars for a four high stack HP m2
versus nine ten dollars for a an eight
gigabit per second gddr5 piece of memory
so I think that's what it's in reference
to the difference is first of all it's
kind of zoom it out actually it's really
convenient and unintentional but I have
a Titan V in front of me here so let's
just zoom it out start with basics a
card like this has HP m2 on it it's got
its surrounding the the die on top of
the substrate but technically there's
something in between the sub-state
substrates excuse me and the memory of
the die and that's something in between
is an interposer so an inter poseur is
created at
the fabrication plants just like HBM and
other dyes interposes are limited to the
same lithography limitations as any
other dye that you make so they can only
be as big as the largest dye that your
fabrication plant can make even though
it's not a it's it's not like a memory
module or a GPU it's an interposer that
sits under the GPU and the memory
modules and it bridges everything
together
it handles all the communication so I've
got this stack of things where kind of
have like PCB with BGA ball grid array
into the substrate into interpose a GPU
HBM all that stuff whereas with G DDR
memory your memory would be surrounding
the outside of the card so you end up
I mean you've all seen it you know with
memory like this instead and that's the
major difference that memory is BGA I
think it's a 180 ball grid array and
physically HBM is closer to the GPU so
that's an advantage you don't deal with
as much latency it's higher bandwidth as
the name would suggest now depending on
how many stacks you have that could be
kind of negated like running four stacks
we're just - for instance it's kind of
like running multiple memory modules on
a flash device versus fewer where you
kind of have saturate the amount of
channels available that could limit your
bandwidth it if you only use one stack
of HBM for example like the Haiti's
Canyon look you don't have really fully
realized benefits of the high bandwidth
memory except for a few and a few of
them are way lower power consumption
pretty low heat flux on HP m2 as well so
try to cooling hbm's much easier and
power wise it uses a lot less power and
I'm not giving numbers because I don't
keep them on the top of my head anymore
but if you go to our content that's
called I think it's like how much does
HP M cost or how much does Vega cost to
make I went through some of the power
metrics there and what the wattage
actual number numerical wattage
differences are I went through the price
differences stuff like that I would
recommend watching that content it was
all in my head at the time we made it
about other things that are different
with HP m they are 3d stacked DRAM dies
so
HBM when i say for high that's referring
to kind of how big the stack is
vertically it's kind of like I don't
know you know in a way like v-nand or 3d
net where you're stacking layers to
create the memory and that's why you end
up with like on Titan video with four
stacks as opposed to eight individual
memory modules as part of it
density is different to of course
another dish I think I noted a couple
other ones interposer yield so this is
interesting to some of the cost comes
from the yields also the demand for HBO
is pretty low right now relatively but
yields alone you have you have your HBM
die yield you have your inner poser
yield your GPU yield and then you have
your package yield which is should be
high at that point but the inner poser
has its own yield has its own cost it's
like twenty twenty-five dollars cost and
then you've got your HB m that's in the
60s for a four high stack plus the GPU
and I don't know what those cost
unfortunately so that's a difference but
yeah much closer to the GPU much lower
power consumption vertically stacked
which means that it's smaller so there's
a much smaller footprint on the board
you can make I mean I wish they did but
I think that Vega nano was displayed by
Andy a while ago that's an example of
something that would benefit from all of
those things so I'm but check out our
previous content for a like a 20 minute
detail on it next one
wraps up 100 says GeForce experience our
Radeon relive does it relive yes yes I
think it's pronounced relive yeah so um
this is just showing how we cover so
much stuff that obviously I can't
memorize all of it forever it kind of
starts leaving eventually but relive I
liked a lot I we used to use shadowplay
almost exclusively for capturing b-roll
of games gameplay footage stuff like
that and shadowplay
I have a lot of problems with now yes I
know I know we just ran ads for it and
it's still decent software but the thing
is when Nvidia introduced the
registration button that was kind of a
big problem for me because it used to be
with GeForce experience I think 2.0 or
whatever it was you just launch it and
you'd run shadow play
you didn't have to log into anything
there was no involved you just
launched the thing he hit alt f9 it
record your game and now he needs to log
into an account which I had really
dislike strongly clearly they want your
email address clearly they're doing
something with data logging whether or
not it's malicious I'm not gonna comment
I I don't I don't have any reason to
believe that it is but also they're
collecting data clearly so that's not
the problem I have with it though
although I can fully appreciate why you
would have that problem my problem is as
inconvenience here's and shadow plate
hasn't been updated at the same pace as
Reliv so Reliv was like it was really
surprising to me when it came out we did
a couple of videos on it and compared it
to shadow play overhead for shadow play
in games and when I say overhead I mean
let's say you play a game at 100 FPS and
you start recording it clearly you
expect some loss of performance in
framerate and typically if we're talking
100 you would see a dip down to 97 with
shadow player talking less than 3% on
average relive was really damn close to
that I mean in most cases it was about
the same and these days now that it's
been updated and improved further I
would expect it's about the same if not
better than shadow play for overhead so
I do really like it if you have an
Nvidia card you should probably just
just stick with shadow play but I don't
even know if Reliv works with with
Nvidia cards anymore I know that their
previous one GVR
technically worked with all devices but
that was a raptor thing that and he
worked with them to bundle it in with
one of AMD's software developers I don't
know it was a big mess so gbr was was
pretty messy but really if I like a lot
the softer is really good and he's done
a good job to build their software
package in a way that's like much easier
to navigate really small stuff like
navigating folders with shadow play I
don't know if they've updated this
recently but for a while when you tried
to navigate between folders you couldn't
type in a folder path you or even click
on like the windows directory through a
normal Windows Explorer dialog you had
to navigate through this stupid custom
built-in file tree and dig your way up
out of the grave your and to find the
file path you wanted whereas a three
live
you just basically type in a path and he
was there so I really liked relives
navigation I thought it was
well-designed when it came out I'm sure
it still is I just I haven't looked at
the updated versions but I did genuinely
like relive a lot and if I could take
their navigation I think that's really
the main thing I would want to see
shadowplay improve on shadow plays just
fine functionally as a software they're
both great at what they do it's just one
as much better UI and UX than the other
and that's real it's a credit to Andy
there bill bruce says Steve have you
ever watched your videos on point 5
speed I watch them out like 2x when I'm
previewing that before we publish AHA
next question count him out of here says
how do you feel about people calling you
Tech Jesus
I'm not here's what I want to know who
started it does anyone know who started
that was it just commenters or was there
a youtuber who started that I feel like
it might have been pong Kyle but I
didn't let me know if you specifically
know where that came from
clearly I'm no carpenter though if
you've seen some of our attempts ed wood
stains next front wraps up oh yeah I
guess you had you in there twice I have
several 100 under Steve would ever be
employed by one of the manufacturers in
the future no not going anywhere
I've zero interest I have worked for
companies in the past I worked for Dell
it was a good experience but I'm not
really big into the bean employed by
people thing I like to kind of do stuff
my way so no I mean yeah I am NOT
interested in that I plan to basically
stay here forever so if you don't like
that I'm sorry you're stuck with me
that's it for this one thank you for
