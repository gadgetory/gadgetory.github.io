hardware Computex is even bigger we saw
dozens of new components across all
areas of the industry with just as many
prototypes as soon to be shipping parts
cases get a lot of love here at Computex
and this year saw some new trends
developed within the industry LEDs have
already embedded themselves with in
almost every PC component at this point
but they've made a resurgence within
cases and there's also a new trend with
the theme of tempered glass side panels
on most of these enclosures before
getting to our best cases of 2016
coverage at least the Computex edition
this video content is brought to you by
Rose Wells new arcade 9000 v2 RGB LED
keyboard with cherry switches to get
this started and in no particular order
we start off with Leon Lee who debuted
their PC 0/10 compartmentalized
enclosure complete with aluminum
paneling and edge-to-edge tempered glass
Leon Lee has somewhat of a thing for
aluminum and almost all of its
enclosures and drives the price up as a
result but the look is suitable for the
company's designer approach to case
manufacturing the PC 0/10 has a full
tempered glass side panel on the left
side a half panel on the front and a
tucked away PSU and cabling compartment
on the rear side this case requires sfx
form factor PS use but Leon Lee tells us
that this is in conjunction with their
new development on the side of s of XPS
use so there's making 550 watt and 750
watt power supplies in the near future
that will fit this case of course
Silverstone and Corsair also have fairly
high-end SFX PSU is on the market and
Silverstone has traditionally been among
the first to develop high-end sfx PS use
but the pc 0/10 let's get back to that
it's got USB type-c connectors for 3.5
inch hard drive slots and 2 2.5 inch SSD
slots in the rear compartment ATX
motherboards will fit the case and the
pc 0/10 is a prototype so that means it
may not ship but if it does it will
likely be shipping in the second half of
2016 as an honorable mention
Leon Lee also featured a yacht shaped
case similar in some ways to the Train
case they Devon they designed a few
years ago but the only real
similarity is that they're both
ridiculous they're shaped like expensive
vehicles and they are expensive cases
anyone has updated its D frame to a
nickel-plated look and will likely only
sell the D frame version two and a
limited quantity run as they did with
the first one the D frame too has large
tempered glass side panels with a slight
mirror finish and is going to sell north
of 350 400 dollars somewhere in there
more reasonably in one's got the 509
case that we saw heavily modded for the
Computex mod contest or modders only had
24 hours to submit their creations and
this case uses aluminum and steel and
will be available for a more mid-range
targeted market so it's something that
most users will actually be able to buy
rather than the D frame which is really
a bit of a luxury type case we'll have
more info on the 509 as it nears
shipping and if we get a review sample
in hand Corsair of course was also at
Computex we already reviewed the Corsair
400 C earlier this year and gave it
mostly positive reviews Mark's feedback
all that and we marked it as a firm
competitor in the PSU shroud intensive
market particularly against the s 340
Corsair has now begun shipping a white
version of the 400 C which we're only
including here because the white
actually looks good on this case the
case itself is not new but the white
does look good few case manufacturers
are able to pull off a white paint
without mixing and matching shades
across panels but Corsair has done it
well with the 400 C you can check out
our 400 C review for more info on this
case along with thermal benchmarks and
objective reviews and then there's be
quiet be quiet has established its
marketing language as quote quiet and
quality as seen in our case vendor
battle video the dark bass 900 is one of
the best built cases we saw the show
while still remaining semi affordable
for the enthusiast market the DB 900 is
priced at $200 to the non-pro model or
$250 for the model with tempered glass a
quick charger and a PWM enabled fan hub
either way it's a full tower enclosure
that mostly uses steel supporting
multiple 420 millimeter radiators and
including three 140 millimeter fans
stock be quiet we'll use the new silent
wings fans for this enclosure which will
be available three months ahead
the official launch of the case and most
importantly the DB 900 is incredibly
modular the entire inside of the case
can be switched around including the
motherboard tray and this allows users
of both pro and non pro models to invert
their motherboard layout which is really
mostly a personal preference thing and
completely change the drive cage
configuration remove five and a quarter
bays and so on very unique interesting
and well executed overall and we hope to
review this one soon as well Roswell's
Cullinan is the best case the company
has made in years ever since there are
five enclosure rows well has been up and
down in our reviews and the company is
finally making efforts to make a bit of
a comeback and get to the front of the
industry's design curve rather than
follow it it's doing so primarily by
introducing tempered glass side panels
on three sides of rows wells new
Cullinan case the Cullinan is priced at
$150 and serves the mid tower market a
total of three front fans can be
installed all 120 millimetres and rows
well is hoping to ship the case with
four to five stock fans to front one
rear and one or two on the top three
rear mounted 2.5 inch SSDs can be fitted
to the Cullinan with HDD is installed in
the front bottom of the case the biggest
feature is the high quality tempered
glass paneling though and is the main
way that rose was keeping with the
industry's trend Thermaltake is sticking
with its enthusiasts targeted modern
friendly PC case design the new p3 is a
shrunken version of previous thermaltake
cases and is ready for wall mount
including a vase amount support or for a
more traditional desktop deployment the
p3 uses a somewhat bare-bones
semi open-air layout with a clear glass
panel acting as the side and the core p3
is fully modular has invested a
tremendous amount of its effort into
supporting various liquid cooling setups
though they're not required for using
the case the case has a built-in PCIe
riser cable for users who want to
showcase the faceplate of their video
cards offering a unique layout for one
of the flashiest components silverstone
makes a big showing at Computex every
year this year we've narrowed down the
selection to focus on Silverstone's new
primary case the PM 0 1 which might
please NZXT phantom lovers as a newly
styled updated version of an old design
the PMO one uses an almost alien looking
top panel design retained Silverstone's
usual focus on function with careful
airflow pathing and host three 140
millimeter front intake fans one 140
millimeter rear exhaust fan and supports
up to a three sixty millimeter radiator
in the top there's an eight plug fan hub
on the rear side of the motherboard tray
which uses a pwm header so that fans can
still be controlled by the motherboard
two 2.5 inch SSDs are supported natively
with an extra three 2.5 inch SSDs
supported in other locations throughout
the case mainly by stealing from the
three 3.5 HDD cages in the bottom the
case also uses velcro cable ties one of
the few things we liked about the fantex
p400 making kale management easy and
more reusable and there's an RGB LED
switch on the white model or just red
LEDs on the black model the price is
$110 for this case as for honorable
mentions Silverstone's finally bringing
their our l0 5b to market which we saw
at CES it's a $60 mid-tower budget case
and it's positioned as a fierce
competitor in the mid tower with PSU
shroud market including the fight
against the 400 C and s 340 we'll
discuss these developments further in
our review once we've gotten one and
finally Silverstone's also got an
updated ml 0 7 VR present which is
something I really only wanted to show
because it's weird and kind of unique
it's an MIT X case that fits an ATX PSU
includes a PCIe riser and uses 15
millimeter slim fans it's also got a
handle built in and this is the
interesting part hosts a 1080p IPS panel
on the side of the case so basically
they've strapped a panel to the case and
they're saying that it's for VR
demonstration and enthusiasts who want a
completely portable rig to showcase VR
to their customers or their family it's
weird it's a very niche market if that's
really a market at all but it is sort of
interesting so keep an eye out for the
PM 0 1 and ro 5 and all these other
cases as we begin looking at them
throughout the rest of the year as
always thanks for watching patreon the
postal video I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
