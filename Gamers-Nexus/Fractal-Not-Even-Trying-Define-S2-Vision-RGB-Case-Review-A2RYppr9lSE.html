case in that we bought for $240 plus
shipping is about three hundred bucks
total to review so this case came in and
it's a modified version of the s2
clearly by name which is a modified
version of the r6 so the chassis are
very familiar with in fact if you have
seen our s2 or r6 reviews you already
know everything about the internals of
the case the changes have been the glass
the fans the RGB LEDs or the blackout
versions just glass everywhere that's
blacked out with no RGB LEDs and today
we're gonna be reviewing the
implementation of RGB LEDs and fans and
glass on this case that's the primary
change and there are actually some
pretty interesting notes there and then
the thermal performance and acoustic
performance of the solution that fractal
has provided before that this video is
brought to you by the gigabyte ARS ad 27
QD gaming monitor the ad 27 QT is a
27-inch 1440p gaming display with 95% of
dcpip three color saturation for high
color accuracy accompanied by a one
millisecond response time 10 bit IPS
panel and display HDR visa certification
additional features include fluid
adjustment and slide RGB LEDs for
personal Flair and firmware features
like cooldown counters at reticles and
adaptive noise reduction
learn more at the link below so basics
here first the chassis is the same as
noted the button the back remains so if
you want to use the push button to get
the panels out the glass panel comes
stock or you can swap it out for a
filter that's provided which is
recommended for use for things like
radiators that are exhausting through
the top we wouldn't necessarily
recommend it for a positive pressure
setup with intake because more likely
the air will just escape out the top
from that top fan having a mesh hole in
front of it but those are the options it
also comes with a few other things like
new fans and it comes with RGB ones at
that if you buy the $240 model further
it's got a small controller
I guess that's attached to a SATA cable
we'll be talking about a lot more for
the fan control for the RGB LEDs on the
fans and beyond that not a whole Lots
change so some of the positives we
pointed out on the s2 remain here it's
got decent water cooling support the
plate and the bottom front
has changed talk about that in a moment
and the front panel although it's
blocked off it's got a reasonable
exposure to the fans it could always be
better but this is kind of similar to
the rows we'll call in an approach where
you've got your glass panel but you can
still breathe a little bit through the
sides and I believe in the s2 review I
probably said you can have your glass
and eat it too and then probably said
something about don't do that for
liability reasons so yeah unlike some of
the cases we've reviewed in the past
like one of the aged 500 variants that
we saw ages ago
this one does push the mesh intake on
the sides out past the fans so you don't
have the issue where half of the fan is
sitting between that mesh and the body
of the case which would make it a pure
like there's more airflow than there is
no this actually does that reasonably
well
so fractal has done some things decently
but they did those a while ago on the r6
and s2 so it's not really new to this
case so let's get into the things that
are new talk about the RGB LED
implementation on why we think it's a
lazy one for at least the price that
this case sells for 240 bucks and I
think go through thermals and noise the
build section for this case review will
focus exclusively on changes to the s2
vision if you want full details on the
s2 chassis check our previous s2 review
it's the same body as the s2 vision and
that review will probably tell you to
check our six reviews so it's like a
choose-your-own-adventure of reviews
because fractal keeps releasing the same
product the fractal s2 vision comes in
two forms
there's the RGB version that we bought
probably at $240 before shipping or
thanks to Newegg about 300 after we
expedited it for the review and then
there's the fractal s2 vision blackout
for $190 the s2 blackout has the same
fan count at for 140 millimeter fans and
the same glass panels but drops the RGB
LEDs from the fans and RGB LED strips
from the case immediately establishing
that the buyer is paying about $50 just
to add the LEDs to the fans and a single
strip to the case each fan comes with
two cables one plugs into the
motherboard or the included fan hub for
fan control and power and the other one
is an RGB LED cable that split the split
allows ability to daisy chain the LED
cables together which might prove useful
if trying to use it mother
controls rather than an external
controller seeing as few motherboards
will have a total of five RGB LED
headers available for each of fractals
RGB LED components daisy chaining the
fans is a good solution to allow users
to consolidate cables but does create
more of a mess with additional cable
lengths and an unused cable end in the
backside of the case the downside to
glass on the right panel is of course
that cables are exposed so builders have
additional motivation to try and clean
up the cable management that becomes
hard with this many RGB LED cables and
it gets harder if adding a third party
RGB LED controller to the case the
vision s to RGB doesn't come with any
led hub or controller but does come with
the cheapest possible solution a SATA
powered RGB LED switch with three
buttons findable on aliexpress for a
couple of dollars that would likely end
up inside of the system anyway so it's
not very useful as you'd actually better
off using motherboard software or a
third party controller that has a remote
control or software we'd rather see an
RGB LED hub than a bunch of cable
extensions and then an option to power
that hub by a single motherboard header
or by molex or SATA power if not one of
each this would reduce cable length as
the needs daisy chain would be
eliminated it should be designed
precisely like the fan hub ideally just
for RGB LEDs instead that single
terminating connector would plug into
the board for better control and the
included three button switch would have
to be routed as it stands now out of the
power supply cut out in the back but
that becomes difficult given that most
of the wires are in the front of the
case like the LED strip for the case
which routes towards the front
so really it'd be best to eliminate this
solution replace it with something else
that's controlled through the front
panel or through an RGB LED hub of some
kind otherwise you're taking the panel
off just to push the buttons on that
switch Fraxel did all of this out of
laziness or cheapness the company is
trying to reuse as much of its tooling
as possible as is illustrated plainly by
the at least six iterations or skews of
the r6 and s2 cases on the same chassis
it's okay to stretch tooling to get ROI
but this is beginning to be a bit much
not retool in the front to accommodate
an RGB LED button is insulting to those
who pay
$240 for this case and it's about the
level of quality we would expect from
cases three years ago back when just
adding glass and LEDs was enough to get
attention the game has been stepped up
since then but fractal is left
floundering in the past while charging
up modern prices for a subpar
implementation of a feature that has
proliferated every case on the market
it's not special anymore the saddest
thing is that fractal wouldn't even have
to retool the front panel some cases
repurposed the reset button which we
thought was the laziest solution to
become an LED control button turns out
it's not typically these would cycle
through different LED patterns or colors
you get kind of one of each or either
and that's just done by changing that
reset button to do something else and
not everyone uses the reset button
anyway so it's not a major sacrifice
Fraxel would only need to real able the
reset cable to turn it into an LED cable
and that more or less do it the fraks
will define r6 is about $140 right now
the s2 is about 130 to 140 they're
roughly the same case and our review of
them was by whichever is cheaper the s2
vision blackout is $190 so you're paying
$50 for the glass and the fan change
which actually isn't terrible
comparatively the s2 vision RGB is $240
so $100 more than the s2 rr6 base and
it's still 50 more than the $190 s2
vision blackout version so now you're
competing with the H 500 M the C 700 P
and it's more expensive than the H 700 i
its battling the fan tax evolve X
without the upgrade kit there's a lot of
competition in this price range these
days and it's not easy to stand out as
far as things that have changed with the
case the radiator plate in the front
bottom of the case has more holes in it
to better accommodate water cooling
components which is a good upgrade it
also has the extra rails for mounting
liquid cooling components and a cutout
to fit a third fan on the bottom front
these are good things as well the case
further comes with a filter for the top
panel the same as in the s2 but without
the metal and that can replace the glass
if you wanted exhaust instead this is
only really recommended if mounting the
radiator up top as positive pressure
setups would not be benefited in general
from a top filter unless you're actually
using that top for mountains
a small attention to detail thing that
Fraxel did well was the blackout
coverage on the side panels which hides
the seams and connection points of the
steel to glass plate where they are
bonded together so this brings us back
to the thermals let's get into thermal
testing and noise this is the biggest
point of interest for this case that's
the biggest change with the extra fans
and different fans will run through
these numbers and then talk conclusions
at the end starting first with CPU
tortured thermals featuring only the s2
vision the s2 vision RGB manages a
results of 52 point one degrees celsius
over ambient for fall stock results that
places it as better than the original
define s2 marked at 57 degrees over
ambient and not distant from the s2
massif i removing the front panel
illustrates the degree to which air is
obstructed bringing us down to 45
degrees from 52 this actually isn't all
that bad considering we've seen cases
recently with drops in the 10 plus
degree range from changes to the case
all of those fans in the vision RGB are
able to somewhat level performance out
by pure brute force and this is
something we've seen work in the past it
does make it louder but it also sort of
overcomes the front panel comparatively
the vision s to RGB stock results end up
in the top half of this truncated
results charge it's within error margins
of the Evolve X and not distant from the
H 500 meshes at forty nine point nine
degree results although the s2 vision is
limited by about seven degrees in our
chart by its front panel it's still able
to force enough air to perform
reasonably we wouldn't call this
performance good especially not with the
number of fans present but we would call
it acceptable it's just that the price
doesn't justify the performance you're
really paying for the glass and RGB LEDs
here however there's still a big story
to be told with the GPU thermals that
we'll get through over the next few
charts looking next at G B thermals for
the s2 and r6 cases which all share the
same chassis the s2 vision ends up at 49
degrees stock which is the best of the
stock results for fractals new cases the
s2 mesh of five falls behind by way of
its fan positioning and quantity and
quality something we discussed in the
mash fight review removing the front
panel entirely gives us a slight
improvement to forty six point six
degrees over ambience we have a more
over the s2 original case which was
ranked at 59 degrees over ambience
comparatively the Fraxel s2 vision RGB
ends up at 49 degrees over ambient
roughly tied with the Roseville Cullinan
of similar design this is also within
error margins of the Helios the PMO 1
and H 500m match the vision RGB ends up
in the top half of the truncated results
and once again performs reasonably well
3dmark
testing is typically stressful on the
GPU but less so on the CPU providing a
real world gaming stand in thermal
benchmark under this workload the s2
Massif I ends up toward the top of the
truncated chart not distance in hard
numbers from its torture performance but
the absence of heavy CPU workload seems
to benefit the s2 vision
disproportionately the case actually
does well here once again proving that
brute force fans can work have provided
sufficient air pathways this is a large
improvement over the stock s to mattify
but that's because the s2 metruff I
didn't have as many fans and lacked some
of the positional advantage that the s2
vision fans offer blender GPU results
but the s2 vision toward the top of the
chart at 23 degrees over ambient for GPU
temperature this ranks it as just behind
the SL 600 M which had some of the best
GPU cooling we'd seen last year but the
vision manages better CPU performance
than the SL 600 Adams compartmentalized
layout blender CPU testing positions the
s2 vision less impressively than the GPU
result ranking it more toward the
halfway mark or slightly below and
within margin of error of the NZXT H 500
stock case noise levels plant the
fractal define s2 vision back into the
realm of reality showing that no thermal
gain comes without a consequence whether
that's a visual one or an acoustic one
the vision ends up being the loudest
stock case on our chart measuring at
forty nine point one DBA at a twenty
inch distance far overpowering the
native system noise that's produced by
the rest of the fans in the system this
is tested the same way as every other
case on the chart and so all these
numbers are directly comparable
perceptually this is about two times
louder to the human ear as the eight
seven hundred I stock case and that's
just because decibels are logarithmic at
the end of the day then it's it's
difficult
the price directly in this case it's
really not just objectively bad or
anything it's just it's considering the
money argument it does feel a bit lazy
this is a refresh of a refresh of which
there are several other skis now they're
at least five to six other skews of the
r6 / s2 body and so it does sort of it's
not particularly exciting from the
chassis standpoint it's not a bad
chassis it's just you got to give me
something new especially at two hundred
forty dollars or have a really good
implementation of everything at two
hundred forty dollars if you're reusing
tooling or at least large parts of it
and going with just glass and LED
upgrades it's really got to be good like
it has to be one of the best on the
market because it's a really competitive
market these days at $180 plus that
wasn't always true just in the last
couple years it's gotten flooded with
good cases and a lot of bad ones in that
price range so Fraxel needs to stand out
more than it presently is doing and this
is even really just a lot of it's
reminiscent of the Roseville Cullinan
which if you don't know it's just a
Jones bow case nose hole doesn't even
make it so Joan's bow is a common
supplier in the industry used by like
store brands like Rosewill or other
small brands like an ADIZ made the AI
crystal made there in quotes as well
because it's also a John spoke case so
the point of going on that tangent is
that that Jones bow case although in
other ways not as impressive as this
case was cheaper so it was a hundred
twenty bucks
it came with a good amount of fans it
wasn't as RGB crazy as this stuff
because you have to remember it was a
couple years ago which actually
surprisingly it was a different enough
time where things have changed an LED
land and it achieves a lot of the same
things from a pure looks external
standpoint could be better we're not
saying necessarily that that case is
worth buying over this one this case the
chassis we think is advantaged in
several ways but the price Delta there
and the time gap is what's kind of
absurd because you're looking at a
couple of years time which in the world
of tempered glass and LEDs is
significant
and still a cheaper solution maybe again
it's they're not saying like they're
mutually exclusive not saying buy that
one because probably well not the best
suggestion either but the point is that
fractal could have done something
hopefully more impressive even just
changing the buttons on the top of the
case so that you end up with instead of
a reset button maybe like an LED change
button like we've seen elsewhere that
wouldn't have required retooling it
would have just been a change the
labeling on that cable labeling get rid
of the the reset icon there on the top
and plug the cable in to control your
LEDs and that would have been a lazy
solution that's still better than the
internal cable but anyway the case
itself to be very clear here is fine
like in terms of the enclosure so the r6
the s2 at $140 they're not terrible
they're really not the case is sturdy
it's reasonably well built and there are
design elements that we like and check
those reviews to learn more about that
but at $240 is simply too much for what
you're getting and it's not new enough
from fractals line to really justify it
there's it's just not a clean enough
implementation so that's it for this one
that's huh that was an expensive review
to do because thanks to expedited
shipping I think we were at like $300 or
something to get this case and but it
was worth checking out because we know
it was popular so thank you for watching
