be live at this point I think I think
we're live so we have a lot of boxes
here one of them contains a dead 20 atti
and are we dispersed the first question
is are we getting audio are we even live
looks like we should be okay cool
Chad says where Chad says were here okay
good so yeah we've got a lot of boxes
here and we kind of let chat come in for
a little bit first let people get in
here
I'll tweet it out where we go through
the fan mail for the last month or two
that it's built up and then we've also
got one dead 28 ET I will open up and
check that out we have more 28 et eyes
coming in but only one today and for the
rest oh yeah we have we have to do a fan
art video at some point where we're
gonna make a like a pixelated GM logo
out of the CPUs that came in so Patrick
will be joining me for that and I don't
know if we're gonna do a stream on that
later or just a video we might just do a
straight video with that that way Andrew
can get involved because he's probably
the most artistic out of all of us
get the glue gun out yeah well to get
the glue gun out for that okay so are
you signing shirts that are bought
during the stream no now we're not doing
that though I was going to add a another
you mention it I was going to add a
discount code for during the stream let
me do that
I mean I'll just rename the last one
probably still want to do it live do it
live code for 10% off on any order
during the stream let's use that one so
let me enable that as chat fills in
we'll get started here we have a we have
a lot of stuff that we need to catch up
on so like dry ice for example is one of
them and Irene able this here we go and
then we also need to
to reconfigure the rip J bench to do do
that stream at some point hopefully
start building that up this week it is v
so will tell this to expire on v at
11:59 p.m. okay all right so answering
that first question there will be a
discount code on the store tonight and
I'm setting that up right now so that
code is do it live if you want to pick
something up first super Jackie and ram
k $5 chat is ready to press F when that
card is hun boxed and then corrected
himself inside unboxed yeah so we do
have one of those cards that should be
should be a month II the first of seven
to 11 of them depending we've got it
kind of depends some some people have
offered them then there are M a window
came in and the RMA window was too tight
so they'd ship it back which is fine so
we're just trying to lock down all the
cards still but it's looking pretty good
so far and I just need to update one
more thing and then we'll be good to go
so let me do this
C 10% off during the stream with code do
it live do you remember which bugs the
court is in yes okay all right so let's
let's get started with this I need to
open up C okay we've got a good amount
of people in chat now cool so ya know we
have a p.o box in the description if you
want to send stuff in if you want to
send 28 et isin contact us first dot
don't send that unannounced I need to
know that it's coming in and we need to
work out details on how it's getting
back to you I'm paying for shipping both
ways so if you want to send a card in
like a dead one for us to investigate
send an email to dead 2080 TI @ gamers
nexus net if you want to send anything
else in like fan mail CPUs that we can
use for wall or whatever we have a good
amount of those at this point then you
can use the P o box in the description
but let's let's get started so
I think I don't know let's I think
Patrick and I will take turns on this
that way one of us can keep an eye on
super chat what's there - any boxes so
let's just start deconstructing this
mountain and then I'll pull the 20 atti
and a little bit we can open that one
here do you want to start with this yes
do we have two knives we definitely can
have two okay I don't know who this is
where's the name on this one
oh there it is oh yeah yeah from X yes
this is a good one to open check that
one out I think I know what's in that
one so if you missed it last time have
any debt how many 20 80 eyes died with
custom boards or just ones using the FEV
boards we know for sure the FT ones are
the most common out of the ones that are
coming in to us none of them are custom
boards they are all reference boards so
there are some EVGA models coming in
there is a gigabyte model coming in but
all of those are our reference board so
answering that question no custom cards
reported to me yet might be some out
there though and I'm Sam I gonna cut
towards myself and then what well so you
can say oh yeah we have it's just the
best knife I have you don't have a knife
on you
mmm that's okay I got it
we have that a razor somewhere blue
handle oh yeah that's better than a
giant flathead so okay so that first one
Patrick's opening is from Axios who is a
patreon backer as well where that blue
razor line this is that part of oh yeah
nice core memory this is core memory
this is really cool actually so
if you never saw it and mostly probably
does not see it I have a dead 2018 pinga
$2 I have a dead 2810 atti would you
like it no I'm good I don't need 1080i
yes we are specifically looking for 20
ATT eyes because they are potentially
dying for other reasons so okay this is
core memory and it has a label on the
back Y and see our training center I
think this came from this didn't come
from the UK I believe in the California
Republic yeah so with that and we saw
some core memory a while ago at the
Mountain View Computer History Museum if
you haven't been and you're near there
you might end up near San Jose we would
definitely recommend going so we did a
video at the Mountain View Computer
History Museum they have a lot of those
types up there this is memory it's like
basically Ram so really cool is just a
bunch of copper wires all interwoven and
thank you for that we can put that up on
the wall somewhere for wall art very
much appreciated how much oh yeah I have
to mention the got a couple of you know
that Swiss Army knife sometimes come
with screwdrivers two birds with one
stone don't ask me where I learned to
that yes this is a lot of core memory
quick mentioned two of the advertiser
for the stream so advertiser for this
one is NZXT they have their H 500 case
no not that one it's the other H 500 we
like the NZXT h 500 actually when it
came through its a successor to the what
was that case that has to be 40 that's
it the successor until s 340 no thank
you and it's a successor to that so you
check a link for it in the description
below or find our review of the aged 500
the mjx th 500 that is if you want to
check it out
but thank you Axius for the core memory
that is a lot of core memory and we'll
clean it off a bit hand it up somewhere
that's that's been around a long time
we're a very small amount of memory I
mean wow it's a large amount of core
memory for relative to other core memory
this is a box full of CPUs from Aaron he
says he has somewhere in the range of
700 individual models so these are his
duplicates Wow
any backstory on why someone has 700
okay most of them don't have a story
except for the two hundred thirty and
thirty megahertz opinion MMX is he had
and likely still has the fastest socket
five or seven pinion on the planet in 3d
more 2001 Wow and he sent us two of
eight that he was using for different
clocking nice slow to speak news Thank
You Aaron he's pretty cool again
what was this there's a Pentium 3 here's
the side side removed so you can check
out the is a adding card check that out
there's your Pentium 3 there's how many
more in there couple more there's a few
more of the slotted CPUs and then
underneath that there are a bunch of
more modern like up neurons and stuff
like that there's a bunch in here I
guess with 700 cpu-z you would have
liked a lot of duplication yeah let me
check some of those out dig so see
standing where I'm standing
what is this one so viewer Aaron sent
these in who has apparently 700 CPUs at
home and had some duplicates to spare
pretty cool so yeah we've got a slot one
CPU we have this says power on it is
that an IBM power it means it's really
good it's powerful its LGA though a lot
positive what this is anyone can anyone
identify that I think I might know the
person who sent this in like I think
they message me previously but I'm not
positive it's almost messaging me about
a box of CPUs oh yeah yeah
I have everything ranging from x86 to
spark to arm to mips to power and
everything in between all the way from
kilohertz rated models to 12 cores eons
I could probably get more but I've
always avoided buying from the bulk eBay
sellers as it's not as much fun that's
from Aaron who says as patrick said most
don't have a story and a collection from
samples that were used to determine to
basically bin them see which one to
overclock the past PowerPC thank you
very cool so yeah we're still working
out on what we're gonna do for creating
like some GNR this is just as Yong 2008
Z on some kind of like pixel are out of
CPU there's something like that
and that's that's the Xeon right there
you don't our that is a square someone
says alright so here we go stresses says
IBM power 7 3.5 5 gigahertz 8 core thank
you Strabo for sending that in very cool
and I'll know it as well for anyone just
joining now we have a debt 20 atti that
we have not opened yet and we will be in
a little bit here so the dead 20 atti is
the first one that came in it got here
pretty early because it's from a local
and then we have plenty more coming in
as well I think we're up to between
7-eleven right now depending on people
in my inbox right now was a completely
undamaged 4.2 gigahertz it's weren't
athlon x4 from dewayne my first computer
I had since my discharge from the Army
in 2012 oh and I respect their packaging
skills because like every CPU we've
gotten his head bent pins on it except
for this one yeah
yes pretty impressed that looks good we
should set that aside because it
probably still works right let's keep
the this box empty yes ok
let me hold this up and then set it
aside so that the pins don't become bent
that's on x4
a couple super chats came in so like I
was saying if you go to a store today
store I guarantee X's net you can use
discount code do it live for couple
percent off of anything purchased during
the stream it looks like I said a 10
percent off for things purchased during
the stream and I'll try and shout you
out as well no guarantees because we
sometimes have enough volume of super
chats and stores I can't keep up but I
will try to shout it out we have a chi
you ketsu ninja better every time two
dollars some money for you thank you
Michael sir serene serene two dollars no
best panzerschreck yes five dollars
Derrick Virg neva right very very good
I don't know five topics a shirtless
stream is demanded now though the whole
point just to promote this shirt the
limited-edition boil shirt which you
should pick up on the store start I
cameras X's on that set this over here
with a four-way crossfire oil on it now
all four of those are foil bazinga
two dollars I'm at that 1080i would you
like it answer that we're good on the
dead 1080p eyes twenty ATT eyes I'm
interested in yep i Christofferson DKK
20 this looks like a pretty hefty game
Jenga yes yes it does hahaha Jennifer
Roger five dollars petitioned to have
snowflake help open fan mail next time I
did just for anyone who follows on
Twitter on the at gamers Nexus Twitter
account I did just tweet some photos of
rebuilding that old set so I've got you
got to finalize the lighting and I think
couple more things then it'll be good to
shoot in so I'm hoping to do like a
nasty on there every now and then
otherwise some b-roll and then side
channel stuff so so if we can't help
with more stuff coming up soon let me
get through a few more of these before
we go back to the male panda tract yes
by Lars t-shirt fabric quality is number
one both standard and limited-edition
thank you very much
the these shirts and particularly the
foil shirts so Paget's got the old one
on that's sold out now and gone we
cancel anymore yeah but this one and
that one
we have a it's completely custom so it's
custom fitted we did the measurements
ourselves and custom made in basically
every aspect so selected the fabric it
is custom stone for us so thank you very
much glad to hear that you like it
because it's a lot of extra work Axios
$5 regarding the core memory you're very
welcome
glad it got there in one piece yes it
looks great actually no damage at all
from what we can see Jeremy Clayton Ford
$4.20 don't forget the best card the
Tohono the 1060 blaze it I do need to
get that that one I set aside because it
was handed off to me where is that was a
very nice letter from someone in Austria
who sent us their phenom 2 that they
used for 10 years and I can't read their
name but they have very nice handwriting
that's a total lie but you can't read
their name sorry give it a shot
oh no I can't read it
what is that I think it's a username I
think that's why you can't read it yeah
because it's not something I'm used to
seeing probably I can't read the name
anyway so what is this one right there
so that's if you read this my stuff's a
first CPU for CPU has I'll let you look
at that I start working on this my first
ever CPU has successfully crossed the
Atlantic to be displayed in your new
studio it is an AMD phenom ii x4 810
quad-core cpu at 2.6 gigahertz nice
apparently they've played battlefield 3
on it which is pretty recent
well that is fairly clean your home is
fairly recent I guess that's about right
though I think I was playing battlefield
3 or Bad Company 2 in like 2010 they
replaced it in 2016
very nice thank you
hopefully you know who you are if you're
watching because of what we've read and
what you said I can't read you to him
all right I'm assuming it's a username
or something or I don't know but that's
what they said in toad is a phenom I got
to open up this this 1060 blaze it that
was also given to us by a viewer by
actually by Zeta who's a mod in chat
right now so this is a pretty special
card data I don't know feel free to ping
me on discord or something if I miss any
details or if you want to provide more
but I'll give my best understanding of
what's gone on with this this so insane
how's your shot on that I'm like afraid
to hold it without supporting it on both
sides hang on once okay open up OBS so I
can see what you're felling so this card
is pretty cool there you go this is one
of our committee moderators data on
discord
he got a 1060 I think he bought it on
ebay or something like that and I think
it was used and non-functioning when it
came in and so it came in with a stock
cooler
of course I Wow actually I think the
data was this the cooler that was on it
it was what the other stuff I think it
was I think this is the cooler that was
on it and okay it's just making sure it
didn't land on enter and then hit the
stop streaming time I think that's what
was on there originally and so here's
what happened this you're probably
familiar with the Louis Rothman video
saying that the reflow and stopping it
oven doesn't work and don't do it and
Linus did a video with him later it was
pretty interesting series this went
through the oven multiple times so Zeta
I think there he goes how many times did
this go through the oven Zeta oh he said
so I bought it untested on ebay it was
dead replaced be by us with the ASIS
turbo baked it four times and it still
works parenthetically probably
so you took the cooler off replaced the
bios put it in the oven for x to the
fourth time that it seemed to hold it
does last time when he handed off to me
it still worked we think and so that's
probably some kind of micro fractures in
the solder somewhere or maybe the BGA I
don't know maybe that ball grid in there
had some kind of solder contact issue or
cracks or whatever either my tree
flooring it apparently works welling up
and he's stuck on this I think it's a
sight cooler is that it's a scythe fan I
think it's a sight cooler
so there's your custom mod the fan is
big enough that it's something going to
hit like the limited amount of VRAM
that's on there and the limited vrm
that's on there so very cool this this
has gone through so much that I think we
probably need to set this set this on
the wall or in a frame or something
separately cuz I survived the oven four
times I don't know what temperatures are
that the temperature was that Zeta
oh look at this court if you answer that
what do you have I have an Intel 8088
from Adam from yesteryear PC but he also
mentions that he sent us this because he
forgot to put it and the other package
Wow
so I guess we'll come back to Adam in a
minute but okay there's another one
somewhere
yeah and 8088 a single 8088 yeah yes
that is I believe that's to better than
the 8086 it's from 1978 or 1983 there's
two dates one year in 1983 they probably
did not make it in 1978 and then predict
what they're making it like all right
you can mod that fan for a rip J's to
sense lives Trey Hammond okay
so let's do this let's do one of the 20
ATT eyes well the only one that I got in
so far I'm gonna take it over to this
table I don't know is that okay
is your light okay Andrew over here
yeah no you're revealing our secrets
now they'll know where the switches I
mean part of that knife - thank you okay
so first dead twenty atti of money to
come this week we have a really detailed
system here of tracking these just see
now so we've got a spreadsheet I have
all of the senders like there where it's
going back i've email address tracking
numbers the amount that they paid to
ship it and then if I have reimburse
them or not yet and all that stuff plus
I'm gonna be tracking the cards by
serial number part number all that so
very carefully tracked to make sure they
all go back to the right place and some
of them are kind of cutting it short
because of RMA windows so how's it doing
needing me to move over there are you ok
good so this one is from from David
locally and it is an EVGA card so one
thing I should note here we have a bit
of sampling bias and that people who are
most likely to send us their debt cards
are in the US which means that we're
more likely to get cards that are sold
heavily in the US so I would include EBG
Nvidia primarily Asus has not put a lot
of models up on sale yet and that would
be to why we don't have any coming in
most likely so it's a bit of bit of
sample bias we don't have a huge sample
size so we can't get a perfect
representation of failure rate per brand
but we have a gigabyte model coming in
we have a couple of these we have a
couple of the EVGA XE gaming or one of
them actually and then we have a lot of
28 ET IA pounders different cards coming
in and this one
is probably sorry I guess I'm just
looking at right alright so I mean yeah
it's a it's a twenty eighty GI doesn't
look crazy or anything I think this one
I don't know if I had an artifact
initiative not some it's all the cards
coming in there's a lot of really weird
issues we've heard from you all and and
getting the email that has become
apparent to me that there are a lot more
dead twenty ATT eyes than really seems
acceptable because originally kind of
look at reports online it's like okay
really how many people is that that
what's the percentage but we're getting
videos from people artifact in there's
one guy who emailed me and said his card
will no longer clock above 1350
megahertz which is just really low and
bad so we have a we have that coming in
thirteen fifty megahertz stock Oh stream
problems plane strain problems stream
looks fine so we have that one coming in
okay and then we have a thirteen fifty
megahertz one founders additions that
are artifact in lots of memory artifact
in lots of BS our DS but I that I mean
bsod or to crash the desktop without
artifacts I'm going to assume is
something else if it's like artifacting
flickering stock frequencies that sounds
like a hardware level issue so that's
the first one that came in and I'm gonna
have to repack this in a second to make
sure it stays away from all the other
boxes but yeah so that's first one that
we got and thank you David for sending
that in we have a lot of plans for these
so first one is I have to go through all
of them and validate that I can
reproduce the issue and some of the
cards the the mode of failure is a
little unique so it's gonna take some
work to reproduce failures on those and
then
them we're working perfectly fine for
like a week or 48 hours or something
like that and then they just up and died
so there are a couple that won't even
post or what people tell me like it's
just a black screen so we have a lot we
can work with here and different failure
rate or mode rather is both good and bad
that is that if we find the solution for
one or find a cause for one doesn't
really mean anything I'm like on the
whole so that's the first one that came
through and we'll be looking at a couple
more this week
pretty soon probably this box needs to
go with the original container to be set
aside and untracked check what are you
what do you have I don't know yet
because I can't open anything tonight
everybody posting up and then chat for
your tune 80/20 80/20 $80 stream the
crushed a half for the 20
oh yeah watch your mic on the boxes
you're opening OOP trying to hold it a
little farther away yeah
microphone popping dude on boxing yeah
just like open that farther away from
you all right
so see where the rumor is true what what
rumors
maybe I don't know which one still
talking about the rumors every day um a
couple of super chats came in so we got
hunter Brighton $5.00 really appreciate
what you guys do I have learned a lot
watching you all keep up the good work
Thank You hunter for the five bucks the
stoker somebody got $7 hi Steve do you
have plans to review the new Corsair a
iOS I've heard the OEM is boy yeah so I
do want to look at those because there's
some quality and some
haze attack models now I think under the
same name accepts its Pro versus
platinum just think which is them so
platinum is especially cool it till I
see if you prefer I definitely want to
look at this but I have not scheduled
for any to come in just yet after office
hours five dollars just ordered some
thermal burns they cry enough as I will
be throwing a water block on my twenty
ATT I will this be good to use on the CV
as well yeah I mean definitely it's not
electrically conductive so you know I
can have any problems let's spill over
anything like that tie their own
conductivity totally fine use on the CPU
it's largely what it's meant for
baby Cairo to dollar Steve it which
should I get the twenty atti or the 2080
oh the the problem is 1080i is kind of
going away now otherwise I would I am
inclined to say definitely not the 2080
but if all attendees are gone that kind
of leaves you with the twenty eighty if
you're trying to buy high-end I would
prefer a 1080i though if you can find
one over a twenty eighty because the
price is typically a bit better and then
the twenty ATT eyes
I don't know presumably the failure rate
isn't a hundred percent so if you have
the money I guess the extra thirty
percent performance might be worth it to
you but it's really for me it's just
it's too expensive this is too much
Leviathan brim do dollars hello GM crew
hello thank you for the super chat
Phoenix 1861 come wanna go through here
two dollar speculated speculate on the
up cone and oppressor tomorrow its
enterprise stuff it's it's all
Enterprise so not gaming cards not
gaming CPUs it's all enterprise and I'll
leave that there but that we are not
involved in that one we're not under any
kind of agreements for that one
obviously not there it's it's an
enterprise event I already confirmed
that Jason Azevedo four dollars 18 cents
Canadian it's a very specific in the hot
well you make a video to have to the 900
K not sure but we have we have some
other CV videos coming up this week so
hopefully that will help answer some of
your questions let me answer one more
here
non sponsor wit five died
got any ideas of what these TV pixel art
will be think the the first one we're
gonna try and make will probably like
the GN like just just the circle logo
just the GN well see how that comes out
I think we don't know if C V is to do it
and I don't know what we're gonna do
with the context he plays it yet because
it's yeah it's already done that
it deserves something special maybe just
testing I don't know each maybe just
benchmark it
alright big all caps message if you get
artifacts down clock memory GG r6s
clocked too high happens someone at YT
so first of all I want to dress this
I've seen a lot of people saying it's a
memory problem memories overheating it's
memory issue that might be true but we
haven't actually no one's confirmed that
yet and the problem with the internet is
people see some thermography and then
suddenly like everything is absolute
fact and confirmed so memory were not
confirmed if it's overheating the models
we've tested are within memory spec for
GG r 6 so that might not be the issue it
might well be the issue on some devices
as far as the memory clock just because
you can down clock it and get it to work
doesn't mean that the issue is its clock
too high it could be something else in
there that we don't know about might
even be GPU silicon level but I kind of
doubt that so anyway we will be looking
at all that soon with all the dead cards
coming in and ok love the video about
the Maximus 11 hero vrm would you say
people should avoid buying that board if
they are buying the 900k I think it's
just overpriced
I think it's the the problem with it for
what it is but it was fine we
overclocked the 5.4 gigahertz on it so
it seems okay alright what do you got
we have a couple pinions from AJ Evans
so those will go into the pixel art and
we have a and Athlon 64 x2
from Rob I think in the UK I just like
the that the package survived a box yeah
he said he decided to send that to
industry and so yeah this one still
works apparently and was never
overclocked so oh man condition a half
on 64 x2 dual-core processor I'm just
looking at the marketing language on it
enhance the virus protection I need that
in 2000 whenever it came out so enhanced
the virus protection 2007 is the
copyright on this box anyway so five on
the OHS they time-traveled again yeah
hypertransport tech 2000 mega Hertz
system bus cool and quiet virtualization
technology of course but unfortunately
no virtual reality technology morning
its yeah not usable he gave us the
insert to so we gonna put it back
together please flip the new egg box
arrows point him down well no I mean
it's definitely got fresh new egg items
in it and was not reused for something
else okay just let's not open it and
make people happy you can't do that
forever hat just you have to make them
you have to make them wait yeah set it
upside down like the middle frame making
youtube videos let's move on that's why
jeomsun just saying kept saying it just
works because it doesn't I saw like
there's a ten hour video of Jensen
saying it just works and I think it's
maybe about one minute of him actually
saying it just works in different ways
but that's still an impressive amount of
time to spend saying it just worked
haha I didn't realize didn't up there is
that the person drew on there yes it
doesn't matter as I've said
went to the post office you can survive
anything
and one more item I'll note here like I
said you pick up something from the
store during the stream I will try to
shout it out I'm about to open up the
store orders now and take a look at
those but you go to store it on cameras
access dot net to grab something during
the stream we have a discount code of do
it live for 10% off anything you order
during the stream and I'll get through a
couple of those after we see what this
item is that was bothering everybody
this is nine CPUs a penny improve for
opinion fors opinion dual-core opinion D
a slotted Celeron and AMD ninety eighty
from 1977 and an i5 4690k that
overclocks to 4.6 gigahertz and still
works apparently 4690k yeah that's a my
Sassoon let me see if we have one of
those we we have a 4790k in there yeah
I'm just thinking if it works on at
overclocked well we might want to test
it first for like a revisit something's
cool look this is still shrink rip I get
seen every one of these it he says he
only knows for sure that one of them
works but I would imagine that if it's
still factory sealed it probably works
we do have a 4690k so that can that can
be used okay so it's still shrink ripped
that's impressive
I think I heard about this one too
that's really cool
this product is intended to be you to be
professionally installed
that's him pro processor this box
contains one 180 megahertz Pentium Pro
processor and installation manual hahaha
what does the marketing Tex a hundred
eighty megahertz or 256 K cash with fan
heatsink and it says Intel Pentium Pro
processors provide unsurpassed software
compatibility and reliability this
processor uses a high quality ball
bearing a fan with a custom design
heatsink also included with this box
processor
is an Intel Inside Pentium pro processor
sticker for placement on
integrated system refer to the
installation manual for additional
information well we have to open it now
to get in the sticky that's important
not supposed to open this I don't think
I would I don't think we should we're
gonna reduce the value that's right
although I I do want to make sure I read
the manual that came with it before we
use the sticker as intel has very strict
rules about how you use their stickers
and where they should be placed
did anyone send us a board that would
work with slot in CPS we got like a
couple of boards last time right yes we
have a couple couple boards that might
work with it someone says based
cameraman that's a good thing I'm sure
is so good at 3d modeling and being a
cameraman someone also asks if it's
affected by a specter don't open it it's
what everyone stay open it unless the
person who sent it in like you want to
send me an email or tweet or something
and say open it but I'm fine with
leaving it in the box and framing it or
something so cool so did you linen Rob
okay do you have a note from them from
yeah yeah it's in there okay cool
this box it's a good start is that a
capacitor yeah shows the best circus in
ping-pong this has been most of the
boxes we've got on the Fed at least one
was fastener in there something it's not
one that way because then you get to
find out whether they were rather than
just knowing yeah surprisingly even
stuff that's packed really well
sometimes just does not survive the trip
we've had a lot of small like those
really small ceramic caps fall off too
although some people have literally put
their CPU in an envelope like for a
letter and mailed it and and there were
PGA - yeah PGA those don't survive they
don't do well but I think they knew they
were dead when the when they sent them
wow this is a lot of CPUs this board has
been through it
this is all mismatched heat spreaders oh
nice little capacitor breakage I think
the idea ID that Rams Rams worth a
lot of money now TDR to CDR one ddr1 her
hate so this is still from Rob
this one's been used so much probably
with a diamond their silver compound
because the plate is like the IHSS has
so much of raisin on it you can barely
read it actually let me I'll read it
after we showed a camera because I
haven't looked at it yet so there's a
there's one of those how many died r-tx
you received so we got one I showed off
and someone says I need a contact number
for to send SGI stuff we have a Google
number you can use for that send me an
email with your user name and what
you're sending and I'll get you like a
burner number you can put in so anyway
let me see what this thing is this an
SGI is pretty interesting company a lot
of history it's a Pentium 4 3.2
gigahertz and I can't read the rest they
pranked me with this blogs
that's upside-down Oh another Intel
Pentium D all these have been very well
used like with a lot of a lot of thermal
paste applications or just pretty
thermal paste that pulled away some of
the spreader a Pentium 4 as well what's
this one dual-core each 2188 this one
probably a lot of people recognize a lot
of people recognize that one okay let me
get a couple of the store orders on
store documents access dotnet holder
shoutouts while Patrick works on reading
through that so first one is from Jacob
from Illinois who picked up the limited
shirt and one of our oh yeah the hoodies
are in I forgot about that
though winter hoodies are back in picks
up one of those as well thank you Jacob
david from ohio takes up a G on keychain
and one of our anniversary edition teal
logo shirts thank you for that Debra in
Arizona picked up a blue print shirt
thank you those have been pretty popular
actually I guess having a non black
shirt on the store has been doing well
for that one and then see another Debra
a different one in Severn picked up a
foil grap logo shirt thank you so what
is the box you just opened this is from
dubs the 560 ti+ that's this one is dead
the hard drive is a 10k rpm there are
nice I always wanted one of those when
like before SSDs were thin it 36.7
gigabyte 10k or fee and Reza to Raptor
yep nice but I think it's missing some
capacitors in this point and yes micro
ATX motherboard and CPU installed on it
are still relatively new but while they
work they are very cheap 50 LR combo
he thinks it is AG 4,400 but it's too
lazy to take off the heatsink and
recheck but problem solved
service snip that off that is some
really durable thermal paste though it's
a little caret at this point hmm
I like the the Raptor drive I always
wanted one of these this is like I
remember that I guess is a heat sink I
never really connected those dots before
I don't know if it's meant to be a heat
sink it was just Brandon I always wanted
one of those
before SSDs or right around when they
were getting big anyway and not getting
big coming out it was the correct
phrasing really loud drives now someone
pointed out inch at 10,000 rpm and they
were expensive back when I look through
them raptor is extinct yeah this is AG
34 17 let's suffer that was some
sacrifice was this video card for the
same person
yes Radeon X 850 Pro who wants to guess
does it say anywhere on here before I
show I like the patent notice on it
alright so of those that are visible
there are four Mary modules on the front
side and four on the backside so we've
got eight that we just but let's go with
eight without looking it up X 850 Pro do
you know how much memory is on there so
I'm just gonna look it up and cheat but
everyone else have fun how quickly can
you google yeah that's really the
question is how fast are you - AGP might
be a GP is that a GP I don't know I
haven't looked at it's not PCIe that's
for damn sure
uh-huh are the shirt size is pretty good
they're pretty standard yes the custom
fit ones the foil one that's up there is
it's like marginally tighter than our
other shirts at the same size but I mean
it stretches pretty well as you wear it
so they're pretty standard yeah 256 is
correct for everyone in 1756 I've got a
couple 512
they're shooting a little high on that
although I probably would've guessed the
same and that if that has the hole I
always thought was a shark but I think
it's actually a Minotaur I think that's
supposed to be a Minotaur on there
that's when they put cool graphics on
the video cards don't see that anymore
yeah cool now they just put I just put a
clear acrylic on them instead this is a
two gigs of memory and a Pentium 4 hi m4
so this might have worked before it got
milled in yeah oh yeah nice got a couple
of apps it's a GPU their timing no that
looks like it everything looks like
every IT mailroom ever yeah
all right so I need to do super chats to
a couple to store orders to read we have
some others haven't gotten to yet I'll
try to but no guarantees Daniel from
Virginia picked up a graph all right
yeah i graph logo shirt thank you and
use the coupon go do it live on the
store for 10% off during the stream only
we got one from John and huge bill we
picked up a mod Matt thank you we're
working on getting that order in soon
for the next round and then one we're
all being Jed from Texas picked up a
graph Aloha shirt as well thank you for
picking that up and I've got super chats
with you too but I'll let you introduce
the next oh yeah that's unlike that I've
marked as damaged by listens from the US
Postal Service it says dear postal
customers the enclosed was found
loosen the mail or was damaged in
handling by the Postal Service so
unfortunately this is an empty envelope
come on Elliot yeah yes it's from
Australia and it is from Lucas Kay we're
very sorry Lucas you all right sisters
did not make it here I'm assuming that's
what it was I'm a Syrian Sarah but uh
they did a number on the envelope we got
a note that says here you go
so we got you hey if you only sent this
you went through a lot of effort
and the post-office what it was
apparently confused enough to say this
has to be missing something but if you
sent more unfortunately someone is now
either happy
it has thrown them out or it thinks it's
an explosive one or the other
all right it's just a really
passive-aggressive no yeah here you go
where's that one over there yeah I mean
people together to preserve this yeah
that Pentium Pro is really cool I like
that one
Pentium Pro on the core memory are
really interesting if you missed them
earlier I'll just show these again so
sealed Pentium brow with a kind of cool
diagram on the front she was like heat
spreader and stuff like that on it
artists interpretation diagram of course
but still
and then core memory so very cool stuff
for the walls I'm interested in this one
because they took the trouble to print
out and tape ABS you take little go to
the side of the box maybe it's a power
supply this is from the wall of RIP just
in the FG took 8800 GT Sam messages RTX
Sam I saw your email that your card we
probably want to try and get yours in as
well I haven't replied yet but we have
between seven eleven of the twenty ATT
eyes are dead coming in so probably want
to bring yours in as well I'll reply to
you as soon as we're done with the
stream probably it's the honey crunch
I think that's CPUs in there wow this
planet
so it's a PFG label box yes Justin page
huh
Justin can patreon Giga scope on easier
we'll give him a shout-out you guys go
apparently signing this in thanks for
all the great content I've included
something for your new office art
projects as well as any side projects
security read through this
I am the 8800 GT e popping rated from a
BFG 78 out of GT like hell that or I
have one of those I look I have the 8800
ultra he's shocked by how powerful it is
you can't handle it the 512 megabytes no
the reason he's making that face is
because he knows they're gonna go
bankrupt in a couple of years
oh we have a PFG paris boy in there
maybe would be FG Paris why we I bought
like all the FG stuff back when I
started building systems to look at a
prison if it works we could we could
potentially use it for testing
yeah it doesn't say anything it's us he
upgraded so yeah I probably might work
that 88 or 86 88 he honored yeah it was
a good cart I have an 80 800 ultra
somewhere too Hayato GT might be the
best card ever made it was very good at
the time yeah I don't know rip BFG it
was like I remember it was around when
crisis came out like that was when the
can't play crysis Thane was actually a
question and not just a stupid joke
I was repeated for 10 years past it's
expiration date
well now we can actually test it riff
DFG you tell us purchase the gnq thank
you for that
oh yeah yeah so someone picked up one of
the GN cubes not this one though because
it'll have fingerprints on it so thank
you for picking one of those up it's 3d
laser raps cube laser engrave and it's
got some cool stuff in there like we
have fake prm's and GPUs and blower fans
and stuff like that probably higher
chance of this if you plug it into a
computer that's probably higher chance
of this working on RT X 28 TPI at this
point it doesn't actually do anything
you can't plug it in don't complain how
many sticks of RAM can i est at the same
time he sent us a bouquet of RAM these
are 512 megabytes 6 yeah like a flowers
away is that gonna be FG box yes 512
sticks but a lot of them what is it is
there one missing I always smart I could
look at the pins and to open um having
some you see number on it PC 2 4200 you
have forgotten all of those of the pin
counts memorized PC 2 4200 you what was
it what was it was it oh nice you can
get kits of the speed for 10 dollars and
40 cents on new egg apparently no I
could come on from a computer base bald
spots what the K ddr2 PC - 4200 uh this
other kid is 5 33 megahertz by the same
240 pin for the record okay how's the
president 288 alright so thank you for
sending that in Steve Carosi 399
launched this month please probably all
right let me get through his couple
super chat so we had
cut that one get that one
I got speculation on the a and the
oppressor tomorrow answered that one
Enterprise stuff like I said Ram k2
dollars and that was for I think the
envelope with nothing in it hey Gilbert
W $1.99 answer my email Steve I'm
searching my inbox what a Austrian and
German and Oh from six minutes ago
that's why I didn't know what it was
referencing okay
I'll mark it I was on red and I'll I'll
look at it after the stream Adam two
dollars GM body pillow one you guys are
so weird
bazinga a hex toppers Corsair mp5
pen any good the same as the clients
leave the same as the 970 Pro right
faster than the 970 pro but the mp5 10
is $150 blast for the one terabyte
version I am NOT up to speed on all the
SSDs because honestly that stuff I used
to follow really closely we had all this
testing methodology worked on ages ago
and I prom I with SSDs now is that if
it's a today's and it's kind of at the
limits of SATA then I just don't really
care anymore honestly like they're cheap
enough right now that if it looks like
it's got these reviews overall I'm not
gonna stress about an extra 10 mega
megabytes per second for sequential one
way the other random speed is what I
look at more these days then sequential
but if you want your answer from a
competent SSD reviewer I would recommend
Alan Melvin tano he may have looked at
those from PC / you can look up Alan al
ly n and then PC / and type in those
SSDs see if he's reviewed them she's
very good best is the review let me do
like two or three more before we get
back to the mail
Mohan $2 please last bag crinkling ears
bleeding I think we fixed that earlier
that's from I tried that so sorry that's
from 30 minutes ago
motorsport madam $2 is that an
79 80 X e now and if one came in it
would have been in that envelope or the
way as soon as it comes in
yeah let me do one more here at
laser-beam $5 any further information on
the 28 ETI problems is it a block with
specific serials can you give us a rough
pretended about P cards with problems
20% fail question mark definitely not
that high I don't think we had some
numbers sort of vague ones in our news
video but from board partners who are
less affected by this than Nvidia from
what we understand today their failure
their RMA rates are not any higher than
previous generations so that makes it
really difficult because the reason for
RMA they the ones that are spoken to you
don't seem to be getting a whole
mountain of like the card die they're
still getting the normal coil whine or
the fans aren't spending when it's idle
and so they think it's dad stuff like
that so I my understanding is a lot of
them are like 0.1% still but those are
board partners so you have to remember
they've sold fewer of them at least in
that first month and if they've outsold
Nvidia at this point it was at a later
date so it might take a little longer to
hear about failed cards some companies
like Asus have just sold fewer models in
general they don't have as many SKUs up
yet they're still working on skewing up
there are TX cards so it's really hard
to say what the actual failure rate is
right now and then block of cereals I
have a lot of the serial numbers from
people who've sent them in and people
online who have posted them one thing if
you want to contribute to any of those
sheets that have serial numbers online
just typing the numbers 3 to 3 and does
not help I saw a lot of people typed in
3 to 3 that's the first part of the
serial number but like the next three
digits still matter
because those are the ones where the
number actually changes 3 to 3 doesn't
really seem to change card to card too
much if at all so I just I don't know
I've looked at the numbers we have and
the range is enormous between them so I
don't know if it's a block like I don't
know if it's a batch that was bad or
what but we'll find out soon
last one we read for now Mohan's you
guys please flip the
box arrows are pointing down got it I
think that one was fine actually
it was definitely find very careful
about the directional I mean I think it
matters how it's sitting we went through
the mail got kicked so we have an f1
ship and two Athlon ships from Christian
Germany and he told us to take good care
of them and we can do that somehow none
of the pins are bent so we can actually
hook we can actually do that not break
them he says there was no IHS on CPS
Beckman and no need for a direct tie
frame from Durban where the intern
Germany call out cool what are these
there's a there's an Athlon South in
hives on XP 2400 plus and 1999 Athlon
299 t is lots AMD thunderbird 1333 where
is this package right here yeah so I
don't know how they didn't get that
that's impressive that's that's is this
from Germany yeah and I reused that's
that's Hamazon book what's the
difference between the Postal Service
and different countries I guess how do
those knock out destroy there was a
bubble wrap out there hey I got ready
let's say that's not that's literally
impossible
and then from Tristan we have an AMD k-6
with a chunky IHS on it k-6 yes and then
I think like one gig of memory this is
what you use these 98
yes use a CPU to open your boxes did you
do that no the loophole is all right I'm
trying to this is like the best way to
cut yourself is with one of these
morning hot surface on what the memory
yeah what is it what's the brand Samsung
Samsung like direct you can go to
Samsung SEMICON they used to make a lot
of memories I mean like modules they
don't do that too much anymore but
they're a lot like for a while holy crap
Wow this is what the dual oh I don't
know what that is actually though this
is um I think I know what this is I
forgot I'll look it up in a second you
didn't put a letter in here yeah I think
I know who that's from
I'll look it up in one second I want to
see what this is first who is this this
from where's the label where's it
another box I guess today get here all
right let's see what the hell this is so
I guess they decided to destroy the hard
guy before pal ha ha ha
nearly caught me when I opened it and
there's metal fragments okay did they
shoot it what is this a buyout haha what
it looks like we've been using it for
target practice so that's very that's a
one terabyte drive so they definitely
did that before they sent it in because
there's no reason somebody would just be
sending a one terabyte drive right
apropos of nothing I'm just just kind of
chocolate inside of it ah it's cool they
I mean they just shoved a dry like this
or I Drive what can people get away with
putting in the mail yeah we do something
with that with the platter
I don't know if there's maybe this was
in one of the other boxes yeah I haven't
seen that before so does not have a
label shipping label on it all right so
I need to check out a couple things yeah
yeah that drive was definitely smashed
or shot or something what the hell
happened to the harder I don't know if
the person or something driving it
someone says that looks like standard
usps shipping
that's not instead that's probably
already service you can pay extra for
that kind of damage
oh yeah ma stains my mat if that's from
mustards my Matt he's contributed before
$2 I did shoot the hard drive when there
okay my a shot hard drive looks cool
yeah look from the other end of the
platters got shot someone says is
salvageable yeah take it to a way to
drive sabers are you okay yeah we're
gonna Linus's sponsor you said you were
professionals I don't know if he heard
you can fix hard drives so this is a
quantity this this box here cost seven
dollars and 20 cents to ship which maybe
gives an indication of how heavy it is
it is completely full of CPUs huh - oh
and they're like all PGA pieces this is
like a nightmare and I'm alright
everybody listen listen closely so this
is a oh I guess you just ha ha
this is that box of CPUs it says Tech
Jesus for life hashtag rip J we'll get
back to that sin
you gotta rebuild that system ha ha
stressing everybody out it's like Legos
except they're CP is I can hear
individual pins and they of this planet
we need if anyone needs a replacement
pin CPU
rip to that man oh man I think we can
fix that one just need a credit card
yeah I raise it around straighten out
the pins somebody well no because like
that permanently like this we're back
and forth for the reflection there's
some opinions in here too one says ASMR
nails on please stop
the trick is that even with the Intel
chips a lot of times the capacitors will
snap off on the back yes so whenever
we've gotten Intel chips without like
foam around them they're missing
capacitors when we find them in the
bottom look what this one isn't isn't
missing any caps and it's not missing
any pins they're just bent well this is
like when 80% of the CBS we need
probably need an intern
your first job homeboy unbend of the
pins of this box of process solder these
caps back at is there a non bent pin on
it yes actually a lot of them were not
been read the off the CPU models yes
sure how are you a couple of there's
like 100 CPUs in it this is from a guy
who saw one by the pound on our server
I'm not sure maybe there is a that is
what he saw was right see used by the
pound he sells a lot of things also he's
a Samsung member out here this there's a
guy in our patreon discord who I don't
know his user name I'd have to go look
patreon discord patreon accomplished
cameras axis if you want to join that
chat he posts in our by cell channel and
Sol CP is by the pound
do you know how much they are per pound
how it's a reasonable price I guess I'm
really
like 20 bucks a pound or some 10 bucks a
pound or someone tempted to buy a pound
a pound CP is nothing else to see isn't
for instead of sandbags for the lights
people what's not telling you this yeah
so we've got a triple 7 is the sound
familiar
oh I can see if that's the same person
triple seven apparently there are
multiple people out there that just have
pounds of CPUs deal with we're one of
them now so for the models its there's a
Pentium 4 1.6 gigahertz I can't read
that
oh 1 2001 wow they're all paste all over
these do I need to wash my hands guess
how much they're all paste this is so
scratched up from all the Pens scraping
the hell out of I jazz thank you all I
can read us 2004 on that one it's the
only legible text I just destroyed all
right build a Linus wall but UCP is
instead of motherboards we could have
this one Intel 2001 Pentium 4 as well
all right I mean there's let me just
show the boss I guess like if you can
maybe get a shot inside so people can
see what we were met with check that out
she scammy everyone into signing I'm CPU
so they can recover the goal yeah we
want you to pay us pay $15 shipping this
in as a fraction he's 30 cent mad well
this box might be worth more than a
centerfold do you see in there okay
said of yes
yeah okay no I was looking at chat sorry
the gold is easily worth more than the
majority of those CPUs cash for gold
calm thanks for the tip thanks I'm the
house I'll have an email right away I
have a son a picture up all the broken
pins I have this how much would I get
max J three four five sent us a Pentium
and I think an i5 that we're gonna get
thrown out at work and they're mostly
undamaged I think one capacitor came off
that's pretty good
what was it and I should camera I'm
gonna look up this this memory I have
five twenty four hundred unfortunately
that's the one that's damaged but one
capacitor you know who needs them get
away without one capacitor for sure
demand which one it is and then an e
5400 Pentium dual core as well so this
is what I thought it was this is RAM bus
memory um I have to pulp the Wikipedia
page for this so this stuff that we saw
earlier that Patrick pointed out had the
funny slot in it with that gap in the
middle do a couple sticks of this it's
really cool actually and this isn't the
right quick pedia page dan I do however
like that it says Rambis incorporated
founded in 1990 as an American
technology licensing company has also
been labeled as a patent troll comedy
became well known for its intellectual
property based litigation following the
introduction of ddr sdram memory that's
how I'm looking for their Samsung Ram
bus after it's been too long since I've
where's that email you already open this
one but I haven't seen it so I can pack
it surprise is Steven I don't know what
it is yet have enough and it Oh
magazines oh yeah yeah those are
actually pretty cool
one of the top two it has a story and it
says so on
because they're old magazines I don't
remember what that publication
sorry noise I think it's either this one
or the second one I think it's this one
start is the publication these are
really cool
number one guide to the Atari ST and
this is particularly interesting because
there's some old ads in here that we
might like and also there are there are
some stories that we liked about what
was one of them is video game violence a
problem or our video games too violent
or something like that
and so let me see if I can find that one
I want to I want to pull that story and
frame it actually I need to find it if I
can so man it was a good it was a it had
like pixel art or is it PC did oh - okay
so I need to know I might need your help
looking for a story in one of these take
a look at the table contents in there
and look for like our PC games - violent
or something like that like the cover
yeah covers I don't like to show that
cover I don't know if I showed that one
I don't maybe if I was a one for 1989 I
would understand that I think it is in
I think it is in your oh here it is
computer game violence by Amy H Johnson
and Richard P Greenfield is there too
much I see that the headlines haven't
changed much in the last how many years
so page 58 let's take a look at that I
want to pull this article and frame it
just because it's still discussed today
and where is it okay yeah computer game
violence is there too much take a look
at those graphics I wonder what these
authors think now I shouldn't find them
an email like hey I read your article
from whenever this was printed
when was this printed nineteen eighty
nine and so are you
sorry now that graphics have advanced
beyond this down here do you think that
there's too much video game violence oh
and there's an ad on the back pro text
the last word processor you'll ever need
I don't think they exist anymore so that
that was false advertising you can
supercharge your Atari ST nice there's
some more graphics they were using in
their video game violence article I
could just read these for the rest in
the stream he left with all the inserts
yeah I saw the floppy drive insert right
and these graphics are amazing I need to
find this memory still I want you see if
there's any any interesting ads or
headlines in there weed one off I like
this they not Sam son semi Oh included
floppy disk unopened nice so we can we
have an ST start disks now I don't know
why or I guess that's just a brand name
it's not actually a start disk
exciting music graphics utility programs
in more such as a ray tracer by Tom
Watson
there's a sand spring night is really a
game or an application its Nvidia RTX
1987 no it's probably a game I'm
assuming it's a game
Jensen's done it our D Ram okay our DRAM
there we go found what I wanted okay so
I have to read the Wikipedia page for
this that I apologize I'm not just
naturally informed on this memory RAM
bus DRAM is what this is we have some
sticks of it I believe they work too and
it says I'm just gonna read the
Wikipedia entry Rambis DRAM Rd RAM and a
successor in current Ram busty Ram CRD
RAM and director and busty Ram are types
of synchronous dynamic Ram developed by
Ram bus which is regarded as a patent
troll from the late 1980s through the
early 2000s the third generation of RAM
busty Ram dr DRAM was replaced by x dr d
ram again some things don't change
like apparently naming things related to
memory ram busty ram was developed for
high bandwidth applications and was
positioned by Rambis as a replacement
for various types of contemporary memory
such as SDRAM see if there's anything
else I can even hear here here is an
interesting point dr DRAM was initially
expected to become the standard and PC
memory especially after Intel agreed to
license the Rambo's technology for use
with its future chipset further dr DRAM
was expected to become standard for
graphics memory however our DRAM got
embroiled in a standards war with an
alternative technology DDR SDRAM and
quickly lost out on grounds of price and
later performance by around 2003 dr DRAM
was no longer supported by any personal
computer so that's some really cool
stuff as someone says in chat party Ram
was very cool so what we needed is
something I can use
it would be G a ship my RAM gets hot as
house on saying so I guess the logo the
label it says it's gotta burn to handle
it don't put a McDonald's copy logo on
it nice so this from the what does that
problem it's from Stephen that sent us
the magazines okay it's not the magazine
soon what is it
it was an Intel pin I guess for me in a
literal pen now yes yeah and it's got
you can't see it I'm not even gonna try
but it's got the etching for the CPU on
there like really subtly oh yeah that's
pretty cool for the dye mm-hmm that's
really cool
we can try and get a close-up of this
it's gonna be difficult for Sandra to
the limit man that's a super cool pin
though so um you know almost certainly
not gonna be able to see this on the top
half of this pen there's a slight
itching of the CPU die let me see if I
can like there yeah that's kind of
visible there you go he says he doesn't
know what CPU diode was for okay really
cool pin though the PAC's pin collectors
would be very jealous this is a an APU D
soldered from a water damaged 2013
MacBook Air nice with Rothman be proud
yeah well that was actually water
damaged or was it the h2o sensor just
detecting humidity and saying its water
you'll never know because the apu is
here in my hand and not in the MacBook
so it probably doesn't work I'm gonna
add this pin to our wall of pins in the
set it will permanently be in the set
nice above the stupid Corsair pirate
things like 50% of the Pens of course
everybody now Wow 50% off 50% Corsair so
we need to get something from AMD
otherwise we branded chills the courser
Ram one's kind of cool though there's
some shroud of the avatar pent up there
as well from Richard Garriott personally
that's right yeah that pen is is very
close Bueller path point and so is the
RAM bus memory we got to figure out
something we can do with that we can set
that aside all right let me do some
super chests following behind on those
so we've got laser beam oh I got that
one Mohan got that one
Troy Jeffers in ten dollars thank you
how much money would the GN community
have to raise to shave your head just
curious you can't possibly afford it
must ends by Matt ten dollars having to
arm a meise 390 Maximus 11 code and
without two drives are being detected as
storage drives but not as bootable Drive
so you have any advice is welcome about
an 80 350 K while I wait for the 9900 K
I think hmm I don't know being detected
as storage but not bootable make sure
you're nice make sure you're in the
correct bio setting so like UEFI not
legacy and I don't know with what the
code has for BIOS options but sometimes
there's an option in there for nvme
specifically so take a careful look
through the the chipset page and the the
page with all the storage devices but
that yeah I don't know contact ace is my
only other advised only make sure you're
in UEFI mode if you're not and another
one James $2 don't forget to vote
tomorrow it's from James and then we
have I don't know it scrolled up let's
scroll DUP mark slap $5 update on the
mini mod mats oh yeah actually I want to
go with my
sized one I want one to go with my
normal sized one actually my cat wants
it even more than I do
she loves laying on it well first of all
secretly that was the plan all along as
a snowflakes been in R&amp;amp;D on the team
lately and she scratched tests all the
products we made and the mod mat holds
up for you all the scratch testing so
yes there is an update as of a couple of
hours ago actually on the media mod mats
so we got a sample back that we're
really happy with we've been working on
getting sampling for that for months now
have done slight revisions every time so
we got a sample and that means we can
enter production pretty soon so not too
long here I don't have an ETA on it yet
but it's at a point where we can enter
production so not too long typically
maybe I don't know we'll see we got to
kind of wait out the next large mass
shipment as well so we've been out of
stock on those for a couple weeks and
then probably after that gets in we'll
start figuring it out so very soon
relative to the timeline we've had which
is several months and how like probably
half a year or something you got like
two more monster at it's $10 love your
content keep up keep people honest and
pet snowflake snowflake tweezers fund
tweezers and quotes of course yes
snowflake is a is a big fan of the verge
and they're tweezers and thank you for
for the super check donation I'll just
mention this too if you're sending super
chattin I'm only about 30 minutes behind
tonight it looks like but sometimes we
get to be like an hour behind a super
chats we do get through all of them by
the end of the stream I will get to it
but yeah just keep in mind that we might
be a bit delayed and we have some store
orders as well I'll check after Patrick
let us know what he has but if you do
want to place an order I'm trying to
shout them out tonight there are too
many to get all of them but I'll do my
best to spot check and get through a
couple of them go to store documents
next on that we also have a do it live
discount code during the live stream for
10% off so Patrick would you what were
you laughing at a second ago oh well
okay what I was lacking on a second ago
is the excellent hacking job that Chris
having I
it used Creedence Clearwater Revival's
20 Greatest Hits
has a packaging solution from are his
three AMD CPUs I'd say I think it was
crisp because the purple sharpie wiped
off of pretty much everything oh yeah
there's a sticky note on the back okay
some history so CP is Chris says the
oldest was my first computer it still
ran but got that bad I think that says
no but oh it still ran but had to throw
it away to make room the frowny face it
had Windows ME oh thank you Chris for
sending that in ha ha ha very much
appreciated and excellent packing job
honestly how did they they arrived ok
yeah they seemed wow so pro tip I guess
a little bit of one pennant and finish
kind of bent but it's totally fine the
pro tip first of all the old AMD CPUs
are like tanks apparently some giant
pins on there and the pro tip is
apparently you use Creedence Clearwater
Revival CDs mm-hmm jewel cases as a
package or CP you didn't send us the CD
though damn one of us hang out then from
Tim in the UK and Athlon 64 3500 which
worked ok 10 years ago which is
apparently when he stopped using it
that seems fine though nevermind
no it doesn't work anymore ten minutes
oh man it could work though we can fix
it
yeah there's no missing pins he put it
in a hard drive bag and it's still got a
silica packet in there so it's a very
dry CPU
I have the tools to fix bent pins hey do
the rest of the screen is yes do you
need some tweezers yes thank you I think
we had some actual tweezers on the table
at some point but no they're gone now
her head
I get like two or three store orders
here while you sort packages Peter from
Winnipeg so I went up there or he used
to be up there limited-edition Graf logo
shirt thank you Peter for that order
Samuel from Texas picked up a
limited-edition shirt as well we have an
order from a different Peter in
Massachusetts he picked up a foil shirt
we got coal from New Jersey
grab the mob bat Thank You Cole for that
an autographed one as well like I said
we're working on getting that next round
produced for the large ones so once
those are in I'll go sign all the ones
that need to be signed you're from North
Carolina actually picked up a graft logo
shirt as well okay I gotta get these
super chats in a minute but what do you
what do you have I have a good feeling
about it I thought I was gonna cut into
it and it looks like a swap a can
actually cardboard all around it so
we're safe I have a magazine PC
computing from 1995 February 1995
there's some ultimate pcs even bean
counters of all of wow that's offensive
even bean counters so if you're in
procurement
apparently a large company than even you
might like this computer yeah so if
you're being countered it's okay because
this PC only costs three thousand six
hundred and forty nine dollars Oh Oh in
nineteen ninety five dollars
someone says stress Oh says Steve talked
about the Andy event tomorrow he
believes will be enterprise news and
Jenna's not involved at all I think
someone else was asking about that is
the shirt that Patrick is wear
and sold out yes that one is gone that
was the previous limited-edition shirt
this one is the one that's coming in
after it so that's going to be produced
anymore we have one up there and just
the way we're getting these made because
they're completely custom like like I
said custom sizing we have to go through
a couple of extra hoops to do the foil
and the design the way we do it because
they're completely custom we're just
making them limited and then that'll
allow us to have multiple designs nice
that's pretty cool I did damage this a
little bit because I thought it was an
Acer box but I'm sorry that's pretty
cool though I like that computer can
just sit on the table with the pop-up
open yeah it's got a monitor suitable
for Counter Strike yes so the event is
an A in the event it is a an enterprise
event and we are not involved oh okay
there's a letter here okay check the
magazine that yeah so like I said that
that shirts sold out if you wanted one
but we do have these up there for might
last another couple days I'm not sure
how many we have this is from Jake
this magazine mm-hmm this magazine was
being thrown out when his parents moved
recently and hashtag ripped a hashtag
rip ltte hashtag rip Paul nice 486
pentium power mac it's not if it's when
no matter how fast your PC is it can't
outrun a power problem get
uninterruptible starting at $119 from a
PC that's they survived can't be said
for all the companies in here I really
want to open this one
it's from David who gets a gold star for
from this creative packaging solution he
wrote I couldn't find packing tape so I
used superglue scotch tape when staples
smiley face I'm surprised that wasn't
like pulled aside by the hippo and
there's one two three four five six
seven stamps on here which are crossed
out the various degrees and then there
are two more three more stamps under
those
so I don't know what he went through the
Senate I do like this ad though first we
meet your specs then we make your
accountant giddy for a Windows 95
machine and it's only $2,100 excited or
you can lease it oh okay
it's a 486 DX - 66 megahertz processor
with 8 megabytes of RAM and oh my god
what have you done is it a fidget
spinner it's a fidget spinner ok
someone was sending us a fidget spinner
CPA he put a bearing in the middle of
this CPU I need some degree yeah we need
to uh well you just have to use it a lot
and then it'll free up this was an i5
750 I see and it looks like it's a 3d
mat over there that's definitely the
fidgets spinner here someone emailed me
about this I don't know I'm just reading
some of this some of the chats so I know
I got an email about this one for sure
it's pretty cool oh if you zoom in on it
so they was do you know the person's
name David David so David I guess
punched a hole through the middle of it
someone says dear Lord
spinner Oh Becca Hall it's a pizza
cutter wouldn't be a bad pizza cut it
out so I don't know how it's supposed to
work it's those brains pretty grindy are
you supposed to remove the blue thing or
does that stay on I think that stays one
I'm not experienced with CPU fetches
balance but also not experiences it
looks like he put a bearing in there and
then 3d printed a handle and glued that
on yeah and then maybe it got a little
dinged up in the mail but there's a
handle that it still rotates
it's a spin top you fools
no I mean you can twist there's a
bearing in there there is a bearing in
there what has science done press f4 the
processor hashtag rip CP here alright so
there is that we'll have to figure this
one hat this one's very formal it's from
Peter and he's sent three old processors
opinions in a 486 and three old sound
cards yeah and he apologizes if the
sound cards are over the top but I think
you're fine you're we just got a fitted
spinner made out of CPU I don't think
anything successive after that you ready
is it just spinning is it it's not a
spinning set well okay I guess that
proves me wrong needs a little bit more
uh there you go that's not bad
it's like the this is what I bring them
to the inception world I guess with me
oh man Wow okay when who said pinion I
didn't really seem that even the patent
is called that's seriously original gold
packaging yeah I don't think anybody
else a sent us one in the original this
is 92 93
that's make me one of the older ones
who'd gotten who and integrated heatsink
on this now and ice just clips for him
on that yeah it's like a 50 mil fan or
some I mean a heatsink it's just
literally a fan blasting the IHS there's
more stuff in there there's sound cards
something check that out
there's that actually there's a bit of a
heatsink on there it's got some metal
it's got some mass to it that's kind of
cool
oh man again when you say sound card is
that what that it you don't necessarily
think that's creative yeah I don't think
we have anything to put that in what was
the note for this one what does it say
it's from Peter
relatively new viewer only a couple a
couple of years that's not new that's
the majority of our subscribers yeah
three old processors Pentiums in a 46
and three old sound card and some Westar
16s and and awwe 32 and in like that's
the Maidan and yeah I'm just speaking
too quickly back in the late 90s I was a
PC / land technician for a school
district and as Hardware was getting
packaged up for the junkyard
I'd scrounge around and keep things I
thought were cool nice good way to do it
I created 1992 for this one that's a
massive sound card really connector is
Sony Drive creative Panasonic Drive
Mitsumi drive those connectors are on
the end over there very cool thank you
for sending that in what was that
person's name Peter Peter thank you for
setting that in he's got a socketed chip
on it yes socketable sound card two of
these creative cards and then one other
one in there somewhere is a interface
yeah
are these real-time auto-generated
captions are there actually captions
that I'd be pretty impressive we've been
impressed there are captions see if you
can fool what hang on play that's scary
oh it's not showing me any captains oh
that no wait yep there they are
socketable sound card to these creative
cards and then one other one in there
somewhere is an interface yeah that's
pretty close now we're gonna be reading
captions without reading the captions so
let's start you start seeing if we can't
rip it out okay that one's nope are
these real-time auto-generated captions
that are actually there are actually
captions that would be pretty impressive
at least in feedback there are captions
if you can fool what hang on play it's
scary okay it's starting to reach
singularity it's not showing me any
captions Oh yep there they are
our socketable sound card do these
creative parts and then another one and
respect is interface yeah it's
performance art if I open this loudly
enough it'll break ill they'll also
caption them so we already know what
this is but this is from this this is
what I think it is so we haven't
actually looked at it no this isn't a
toad on it broke Steve hurry
hmm okay I thought this was the picture
on back it's like stuff that you know -
yes
looks cool if I can might know what that
is I don't want to bend the history yeah
also uh fingerprints get on those very
easily may not never come off I know
because we so many were so easy and I
had the pack some of that well somebody
had the back of in here in the first
yeah okay got a store order in while you
check with that brian goldsmith
a limited-edition foil shirt it allows
we got got one from Danielle who picked
up from Georgia I picked up a mug oh
yeah the anniversary mugs we haven't
sold one of those the stream I don't
think thank you for picking that up
we're actually Bo I'm stocked again we
have been constantly low I'm stock on
these mugs checking the stability of
that package uh-huh
as I've said before does not come with
the dead memory in it but that does come
with the cool my this is a IP address
space said I think it's pretty awesome
I'm turn on the kink it so you reach
under 17 up a little if you go this is a
new poster too nice so maybe I am
getting for comfort zone for future use
multicast announcement sighs it's pretty
cool when we can actually unroll it and
actually look at it at the same time I
guess we can look at it in the screen
yeah yeah I'll have to watch the stream
you see a better
oh nice you're not getting fingerprints
on it Kohala ford US Department of
Defense HP US Department of Defense
there's a lot of US Department of
Defense blocks on here yeah believe it
that's I mean what are you gonna do we
want that block you can't have it it's
mine now we got a couple super chats in
Joshua Bell to digest Drive a Packard
Bell 386 of DX to you and North Carolina
I don't even know what that system is oh
man that is a it's got there were
pictures of it playing Wolfenstein 3d
and chess someone posted it on Reddit
and said it my 486 can still kick my
butt in chess retro battle stations it
has an old system I think I think it
will pass on an entire old computer we
have a limited amount of space the good
thing about CPUs as they're small thank
you though
I too like the pictures have I playing
Wolfenstein 3d just for some some some
reference on age which we I will know we
might at some point do a like a fan meet
or something like that locally I don't
have a media plan there's been requests
for it and I think we're starting to get
enough local people where it might be
worth doing and it wouldn't just be like
me Patrick and Angie or show up and then
no one else does so keep high we might
want might do one of those at some point
which put on $5.00 why is it Andy
wasting their time with a 590 series
when they have Vega and Navi around the
corner confused about their roadmap so
keep in mind talking about wasting time
with silicon few things here that's an
existing architecture Polaris so it's
not that hard for them to Reese pin it
as something new there is a shrink down
to 12 nanometers as far as we're aware
but it's not like they have to Rio
architect the entire thing so it's not
really wasting that much time they're
getting more value out of the same
product which is what any company tries
to do especially when it's been a while
since they've launched the product and
then they can a V I don't really know
anything about Vega around the corner is
primarily going to be an enterprise
solution the most immediate one so how
that affects gaming in the gaming market
I don't know I don't know if it'll come
to the game market if it does we don't
know if it'll be any good from a cost
proposition whereas the RX 590 might get
some revival in the mid-range space
where Nvidia you have to remember Nvidia
is not really currently competing except
for with the GTX 960 in that market and
the 1060 is perceived as old and the 519
though it's a really old architecture
well be perceived as new so you've got
that perception thing where there's
value there because it
looks newer and it is newer and then it
is good in respawn we don't know it
might be better should be more efficient
should be lower voltage for the same
clocks and if they don't have anything
else they could do today then it's not a
waste of time if there's stuff they
could do today that's better I would say
it's a waste of time but also that's not
the case so and you have to remember to
you andis a big company they have a
relative to the others they're a bit
smaller but they are a large company
still like objectively so there are a
lot of people who work there and you can
work on multiple things at once I read
one more Marco Mascaro CHF five hi Steve
if money was no issue money were no
issue with Z 390 board would you get for
an i 999 hundred K we have liked working
with I well I'll tell you what I want to
see that I haven't yet is the dark
lizzie 390 dark it's I don't have one I
don't think it's not out I don't think
and the X 299 dark was so good that I'm
really hoping EVGA can get somewhere in
motherboard because they've tried and
they've kind of struggled in the past X
99 they had pretty bad memory support
they passed it up next to 99 a lot so
really hoping that give me J I can do a
good job on there Z 390 boards because
the X 299 board just worked so well for
overclocking so I really want to see how
the dark does I am cautiously optimistic
about it even J's had a mixed past with
with motherboards so that would be my
the one I most I'm the most interested
in seeing the Maximus 11 I'd probably
skip at the price the gigabyte gaming
nine equivalent I don't know what that's
called now extreme I think that's got
good Hardware on it
it's gigabyte BIOS but they are updating
BIOS so the gaming 9 equivalent I think
it's called the extreme it's actually
pretty good board so those would be the
ones I would consider looking at if
money's really no issue I haven't looked
at the high end a C's for yet there
apologies for the noise I'm slicing my
thumb off eventually um so that poster
thought I was sent straight from
CafePress I think no there wasn't a name
on there right they just ordered it
oh my god we also have a pretty cool
poster from I'm just getting the they're
all pissed off of my hand right now not
actually sure but this one got a little
mashed in the mail and I want to take it
out but I'm afraid I'm going to tear it
if I try to pull it from the end it is a
circuit diagram yeah I've seen that I
know who sent that but yeah cuz inside a
box too it's inside a tomb inside of a
box gonna go do you know who sent it
I'm not sure I mean I'm not seeing a
name I'm almost positive I know what
that is and printed in Cana yeah I think
they might have ordered it directly as
well yeah I might need to take my time
on this one yeah it's just I think it's
a little stuck together - yeah pliers
and ER says we should use players this
is a you need to I just cut the Box open
off stream or something I think I can
extract it if I just cut through the box
like surgery somebody named diehard
Barrett sent us this nice he really
wants us to call him diehard wasn't
stream again but he did the neatest job
of texting all this stuff what is it a
bunch of CPUs I think in CPU trays which
is nice because we are always running
out of those I know this is really cool
because I'm pretty sure I know what this
is by looking at it so I want to show it
but I think I am going to have to
carefully extract this off stream
because it's pretty stuck I don't want
to damage it and if we do this on stream
I'm gonna end up damaging it I'll try
and rush can I set this one aside so my
favorite part about this one so far is
that all the tape on every individual
thing is US Postal Service tape so I
think may have come open I'm sorry hard
bear it sat in the post office and
individually wrapped every single one of
these CPU lice
that means it probably survived though
these are I'm assuming these other CPUs
there's a bunch of these they're CP is
in there yeah and a few loose parts and
some slotted CPUs this is not a lot of
CP it's take a look at the summary you
start looking through those while I
catch up on chat for a second and
something oh here we go
got most of these from my local
electronic recycling center on the side
I make shadowbox coffee tables using old
electronics that's really cool you
should email me a photo of one of those
that sounds cool also included is a
battery meter I designed and patented
for UPS batteries
I don't do custom loop water cooling so
here is a water bog so just a bunch of
stuff in there cool check out my GPU
wall you should make one Instagram
diehard Barrett
that's like let's sugars into tees
diehard very on Instagram
is it BA or even have the letter got it
okay let's check out diehard Barrett's I
don't think that's China's one word the
transistor symbol versus yeah okay oh
yeah there's a hello cameras Nexus one
hour I guess yeah our thumbnail all
right honey
I was instagram page so let's let's
check it out what's in there well that
looks cool there's some interesting
stuff in here here's the package of
stuff that he sent out to us gamers
access requested CPUs for his new office
decor here's a care package headed your
way I find some kind of whoa that GPU
wall is actually kind of Awesome
there's a challenge in here as well I
don't know how to use Instagram you said
everything can be deleted deleted if we
were honest and that's good luck D
letting the two gold / glass IHS CPUs I
sent I don't know anything about them so
did you find them
uh no they might be one of the injured
individually wrapped one running out of
space I need to turn around the monitor
to show off diehard Barrett's GPU all
turn you're gonna have like a lot of
gamma loss and this monitor is not good
for pointing a camera at sorry so that's
the hang on a second any of the mouse
that's the GPU all from the viewer who
just sent us in a bunch of CPUs the ones
with the US postal tape all over the CPU
trays we'd use this traced here that's
pretty cool though that sure enough okay
on camera cool this looks like a full
system on a board did you have any in
slate down this I will look this up
momentarily have to turn around here you
go
so we're obviously not archaeologists
and I only know so much what's your
hardware go ahead and if anyone knows
what this is go ahead and look that up
or you know what it is tell us what it
is in chat I will check your commentary
all right so I get back over the chat
look at his table of motherboard someone
says sure why not
table of motherboards oh that's pretty
cool so they say hang on he has an alpha
cool is that alcohol
now that's mod right isn't it he sent
this you have a mod right mod Matt we
fixed that he sent us pictures of his
furniture suitable for framing
that's pretty so this is a like a coffee
table and they got a nightstand kind of
let's just all from the recycling center
you said right yeah pretty cool
well I'm diehard Barret I will I will
definitely take a look through some of
your other posts
it's pretty interesting stuff like he's
I see the the photo you just showed of
the coffee table that's really cool on I
like the idea of making an art out of
old electronics instead not gonna do
anything else anyway
alright so a couple stupid shots go
through who we have here it's the water
bullet
Oh what is it is XP c XS PC race storm
CPU / APU water block for Andy and the
crow plain don't need a P is underwater
mm-hmm ma stains by Matt $5 I sent in
the pentium pro thank you you do what
you want with it
I thought it'd be a cool display unit
since it's sealed but it's yours now so
what happens we can keep it sealed I
think it's pretty cool that weights here
CSA Wilson's do daughter's age limit on
PC parts olders better please doctor who
867-5309
and come to the realization every time
I'm halfway through that number $2.00
tech Jesus Tech Jesus bobblehead doll
when okay agent Kay $4.99 just curious
what happened to the crisis franchise
will there be another crisis sequel it's
more of what happened to Crytek at this
point like really what happened cries
egg um all right you didn't do the
engine for hunt showdown I guess I don't
know anything I don't so that's quite a
fall they failed to pay their employees
for six months and then did it again a
few months later so I don't know
Crytek's kind of gone but I guess they
still exist technically they're suing
awhile they filed a complaint against a
cloud Imperium games or their choice to
move away from CryEngine so I don't know
that's that's the yeah that's what's
going out crisis right now jtr to 69 did
you ignore my question earlier
yes because of the content of the
question
look sorry Leviathan p.m. two dollars
this dream has an RT accent Eric's
turned on yes well that's more than we
can say for really any game at this
point so there's something I guess days
when did when did the 28th et I
officially at launch I think was like
what's 19th of something so much that's
helpful September 27th and the 20th so
oh man we're over a month without any RT
X so these are the gold IHS Wednesday's
talking about I'd that's really cool
yeah sorry to spend like 20 minutes on
one cool there's some really cool stuff
in Hyuna see so there's a couple of
those oh yeah it does have glass there's
a 930 86 that um was not meant to come
off of whatever board it was on there's
a lot of yeah shredded pins on there
this one's pretty cool though what do
you know what this is
no I don't know he does either um so
alright let me open up chat do we have
any computer historians in chat what is
that and I'll flip it over in case the
numbers on the back help you I'm using
the best appearance settings for the
stream and it didn't help sometimes I'm
back to performance I don't know if
that's supposed to be an insult but if
it is it's a good one
Steve your life is passing by unraised
yes it's a very sad thing except for the
fact that real life is basically
retraced so there's the CPU what is it
someone tell me what that is Pentium Pro
is out that is okay so that's what would
be in the other box then
ptoo 19b it's a gameshark g-code Pentium
Pro get another one saying Pentium Pro
CMOS sensor some form of UV erasable CCD
chip Pentium Pro Pentium I don't think
that's a cc CPU it's a CCD okay
alright well send the man a mod mat he
can't be with that one referencing
Barrett I believe I'll try and find a
good way to get in contact with with mr.
Barrett was I don't want to be too
informal mr. Barrett try and get any
contact we can send without fan upside
down oh yeah sorry I can't see that side
just mentally flip it in your in your
head I guess not Pentium Pro zone size
unless it's been deleted so dumb
people's hands CCD it's what people
people are saying DMD chip there are a
lot of answers on the hat and it hasn't
been there just like a window on it of
the silicon yeah some kind of
charge-coupled devices seems to be one
of the college's oh here's one from
Strazza samsung four seven one nine DLP
chip DLP chip what is that samsung
let's say oh yeah yeah okay digital
micromirror device well I'm not sure
which one of you is right but I'll look
into it I guess pretty cool
looks like an image sensor we're getting
more people say an image sensor at this
point DLP is Samsung DLP
okay cool all right we have a bunch of
oh here you go
is this email recent here's here's a
referencing that pen that pen I put up
on the shelf back there
hmm from Blake emailed us hello Steve
watching the live stream you showed a I
showed off a pen that had some dye
pattern etched into it I have an old
Intel keychain that has a very similar
pattern in it so I quickly took to
close-up photos of it I don't want to
part with the keychain
but enjoying the live stream give it to
good definitely keep your keychain we
don't need the keychain of course it
then that's same goes for all this stuff
do not send us anything your
sentimentally attached to or you think
has value we don't we're not like
desperate but if you don't eat it then
consider it it's just yeah keep the
stuff that you want we don't want to
take that from you so anyway his
keychain is an Intel 386 keychain that
says the winning architecture it's
that's smaller than I had a quarter
recall that some store orders came in so
they read a couple of those I like I
said I'm not gonna get every single one
of these there's too much between super
chat store orders emails I'm doing my
best but I can't get all of them I will
do my best to spot check so if you go to
store my cameras next to stop that we
have the live stream discount code up
there today for do it live he got 10%
off on anything ordered during the
stream probably not that run until 11:59
p.m. Eastern or something like that and
that includes the limited grandpa logo
shirts that we have up there so just
during the stream though and this one's
from Ross in Missouri who picked up a
limited edition foil shirt oh yeah and
one of the cobalt blue beer glasses this
one this one
to be washed but whatever hahaha
so thank you for picking that up but the
gold rim on it and everything we still
have a couple of those on the store we
should last through the next couple days
I do need to order more than but your
glasses on the store they have discounts
up to you four glasses
we got SATA cable more SATA cables also
IDE cables and firewire and where's the
main SATA cable Ben there's one oh yeah
there we go
okay so Patrick and I were joking about
this earlier Patrick said on the store
I'm a store we should have a checkbox
that is defaulted to on that's as I want
I say have free SATA cable with my order
because we have a problem that's gonna
suck if it falls and that we have more I
don't know like I can't even it would
cost more to ship them to someone and
then it would intend to just buy one so
it doesn't make sense for us like like
we can't list it on the store so I'm
gonna lose money a lot of it so even if
even when I sell it like I'd have to
sell it for you to you for multiple
times the price of a new one because we
can't compete with the people selling on
bulk for a dollar we have to strip them
all down for copper someone says I have
a whole box of IDE cables should I send
them now to finesse and I have the whole
box of IDE cables everybody has some
hunks of IDs I have just straight boxes
of cables do I think most people do and
don't even know it's one of those like I
might need this someday this is from Don
by the way he did send more than just
idea inside a cave what else was in
there mother some memory and mainly a
motherboard
which I mean I that box I have that
motherboard so there's like a bridge
that's pretty cool so your graphics card
one graphics card like that any plated
Ram
I am glad in Gordon what is that
Oh SLI MSI k-8 and SLI board yes okay
Emma
what's the CPU in there Athlon 64 nice
4,000 plus M SCADA 3d and 3200 which is
part of the model number but is not
thirty-two hundred megahertz that would
be very high oh we're getting we're
getting polls leftovers Paul he sent
stuff in the Paul first have any sense
stuff does he had this so this is the
stuff that wasn't good enough for Paul
it's cool memory though and an extra
stick I guess I think that's from the
same case someone says they have 400
scuzzy cables we don't want those either
no I will refuse the package I think we
haven't you I haven't seen a scuzzy
drive since like ever
yeah sauce ass and scuzzy drive that
dowel in the server room because last
time I worked with them Jodi purchased a
from California purchased ATO logo shirt
and on the bugs Thank You Jodi we also
got an order from Casey in New Hampshire
the Surinamese is like a test of my
knowledge of two-letter state
initialisms and sometimes i don't know
which one it is
but I figure there's people pass it up
it's probably some someone named that
name in that state and no one will know
any different
picks up a mod Matt Thank You Casey and
also for of the beer the beer glasses
the blue and gold beer glasses thank you
very much for that order
you pretty much appreciate it always
helps us do more of these streams
they're a lot of fun for us too
all right let me get through a couple
super chat before we go back to the mail
so we had Jeffry out a $5 Canadian
what's up come in from a 4790k a 4.7
gigahertz do you think I would need to
upgrade at the CPU if I drop in a 2084
1440p gaming up for 144 Hertz you know
we benchmark the 4790k I did not
overclock up to that review can you say
4.7 4.7 yeah that's pretty impressive a
high right we benchmarked at the owner
9900 k review and apparently there was
some discussion on wasn't the bill the
PC or the Linus discord herself in
asking I like why we tested that don't
tell them don't tell them that I'm in
line since discord so I walk right
before we had about we had enough time
up before the 900k review to benchmark
one more CPU and I wanted it to be an
older one because I know like it's so
easy to get caught up in all these new
CPUs and forget that most people are
upgrading from stuff that's multiple
years old obviously I didn't want to do
that 2700 K we did that kind of recently
and it's more issues as an older
platform so it is a 4790k and where did
that fall on the charts I ran it stock
1440p far cry with the 28 ET I mind you
was at and this is going to be GPU bound
47 while actually might not be with the
CPU 4790k it was not gb back
it was 107 fps it's pretty damn good
that was with Ultra setting or no sorry
that was with normal settings that's
1440p with an XC ultra 20 atti
so 4.7 gigahertz though you're probably
looking at closer in this benchmark
maybe 115 fps an f1 2018 we have the
4790k at 205 fps so I guess your mileage
might vary just depends on the games and
how low you're willing to drop the
settings
you get a couple more in here jtr dollar
69 no message thank you Indrajit singing
five dollars just curious if you still
want the hardware I listed in my email
Pentium 4 2.8 and BFG 8800 GT s plus
money for food of your choice thank you
for that for the 5 pounds and p4 2.8 we
we have lots of those I think at this
point Pentium fours 8800 GT s we have
one eight we have a BB F G 8800 I would
say hang on to um we could probably find
something to do with them but we've got
one of each of those at this point so
hang on to them if you have any other
use for them Nestor Hernandez $50 wow
thank you very much 5050 British pounds
thanks for working hard on investigating
the 20 atti issue
well now we're behind so I had to run
through more of these actually thanks
for working hard investigating the 20
atti issue I'm one of the affected
customers but are I made it before it
was known that it was Riley commented
who you are not alone we got a lot of
emails like that where people obviously
just thought it was a do a card and are
I made it and then found out everyone's
having this problem so I'm not everyone
but a lot of people absolutely we like
this kind of work I'm greatly looking
forward to I put it over there so the
dead one that came in earlier today
we're gonna start looking up that that's
our first test subject up I tested
tonight and we have another seven to 11
of them coming in the next couple days
vanna on the emails in my inbox
presently C Motorsports $4.99 I have
built I have about a terabyte of
registered ddr3 if you can use it all
all of it is 1308 gigabyte DIMMs I built
an ass with solve it I don't know we
might end up with that much memory yeah
how first of all and I guess a little
slow 13:36 or something 1366 whatever
that frequency is I don't know we had a
lot of ddr3 CP is we could probably
build an ass out of it yeah I don't know
if we have enough in boards for its hair
might that's a good morning that's a
good point there yeah and there
right them so the most we could use is
like 64 maybe we do that math word
that's a lot of RAM I just want to know
where you got it
Wesley Runyon 199 want a matching
motherboard prop to match the GPU on
oh it's Westar from patreon mm-hmm yeah
we have that in the set background over
there with the XFX card no right we
could definitely use we could definitely
use something to hold up motherboards
yeah so Westar for those of you is
pretty old at this point relative to the
subscriber growth we've had so a lot of
you probably haven't seen this Westar
made this it's a a very nice wooden GPU
holder it's got some screws in it to
hold stuff together we can adjust the
size and we just seated our the the
first ever GPU I bought for gamers Nexus
test benches like the first when I moved
into a standardized bench that was the
one that's a 7850 and a Westar built the
GPU holder there which we can use for
b-roll as well so yeah I mean well just
send me a message well you might have
sent me a message I have a lot of them
on discord I'll try and find it though
if you did and we could definitely use
one from other boards all right let's um
I do like couple more of these and then
we'll get to that box
another HL PC $5.00 watching your skin
with my RTF 20 atti PowerPC Steve's hair
is so breathtaking with r-tx on bad news
that's just the artifact in boom two
dollars our X 480 is rebooting my PC not
Parris oh and our X 480 is rebooting my
PC not the power spyro drivers help
exclamation point the card is rebooting
it it's not your power supplier drivers
go through the really basic list make
sure it's socketed try swapping the PCIe
cables you never know
if you're really I don't know what
you've done to verify the drivers but if
you haven't done it grabbed edu it's
free display drive around installer
reboot into safe mode with it
remove the drivers try reinstalling them
if that doesn't work you try rolling
back the drivers I suspect drivers
typically with this could be a power
delivery issue on the card if it's may
be used or something but receipt it move
PCIe slots change PCIe cables reinstall
drivers once you've done all that
there's not a lot more you can do unless
you have another PC on standby where you
just test it out Daren or Daren $5 can
you do it if you have the 900k 9700 K at
87 or K the same clock also does the
900k appear to be overclocked well as
the 87 okay well we yes the 900k
overclocks pretty well we got it to 5.1
gigahertz easily and then with a lot of
effort 5.4 with that 540 millimeter
radiator next to Patrick so it's pretty
overclockable no plans down at the same
frequency right now we don't typically
find those tests super useful but it's
always a possibility
Peter DKK 20 dice dry ice money
eliminate J we'll get to it hahaha 5:09
five guys when are you going to sign
gamers Nexus to flow plan no current
plans go bomb 152 dollars go bomb 150
again $2.00 I can intern and I'm local
referring to when I was saying me an
intern to unbend all the Pens oh Jesus
yeah yeah GPU abused five dollars I'm
super impressed with the camera quality
share the camera and lens specs cutely
good work well first of all thank you
and we're not you it's not even an
interchangeable lens camera you should
own a what is it aux 180
I think that's thing of it the X 180
Steven Casper sick 999 excited to see my
atari magazines getting a new lease on
life
keep up the great work guys well thank
you like I said I'm gonna look through
the table of contents and others and see
what stories we can pull on frame what
do you have there so this is one of our
envelope CPU wow yeah
packages I don't think it got actually
just this one's a little bit better than
the other one I was thinking I'm on
vibes yeah this one no no no no it
didn't survive this is from Mitchell or
know that the Oh Mitchell this is from
Jeremy this is his first dual core and
he has a couple of estrogen questions in
here okay the other side we haven't
filmed the one this was builds Lloyd
rambles too much and one of them so he's
made an enemy there oh yeah builds I'd
knows what he does right
he knows God's right knows full well how
he makes content and a lot of people
really like it hey it wasn't and I share
was a yeah ingest Mitchell sent this
package this is 64 megabytes of memory
and two CPUs teach to the inside of the
package which yeah sure there's a camera
so that one's kind of interesting novel
method he did not send us the 850 Evo
that originally came in this box say
Celeron there's not a year on their
their play is on the actual die and a
300 megahertz and ek6 that looks pretty
heavily used it's it's like one down
yeah who's this this one from is this
this cheering yeah yes and that's Jeremy
okay we got the pens on that got it I'm
gonna set this next to my system so
remember they asked Jen questions so I
can take a look at this Matthew male in
the SPN and these are from
Chris F on 2x4 Athlon 64 x2 5 5 30 to 30
M say former moderator at Amiga org he's
into Amiga now a nice let me go OS I
mean us
so that's who these three CDs are from
and then one met from Ontario Canada who
sent us an AMD CPU that he doesn't
remember the skew of and it's one of the
ones that they don't mark the yeah real
model name on it so it's aimed the FX
and then it was wrapped in a music sheet
that says 8350 this is an i-5 32 30 M
and stuck the Intel i5 sticker on there
so bad news this is outside of the
license agreements of the sticker
Intel's license that specifically says
it has to go on the computer which
houses the processor and this sir is not
a computer and so it's the right to
break into your house correct your
mistakes I'll break into our office now
mr. Hayes sure and those lawyers will be
in contact with me posthaste okay a
couple messages to look at we got a
super chat from Eric Jackson two dollars
I have a phenom to be 97 and a half on
64 X 250 200 plus do you want or do want
rather I think we're good on on those
specific models of CPS we have a couple
of those and we still have to plant our
pixel art hopefully start planning our
think about that this week Stephen $1.99
user poured a cup of water on the
MacBook Air this is
fronting my system earlier there that
tea period actually woods so it was
actually water damaged we can put a call
with Rossman love now salamander Tech $5
Steve enjoy that Rd RAM and the k62 as
well for chip got way less screen time
I'm sure we can find it if I watch one
was it case 62 chip that came with the
Rd Ram that Sam son memory hmm okay that
was one of the first ones yeah very good
one data file two dollars quick send him
more money so he there behind no need to
catch up to two-bit marksman five died
I'm gonna I'm trying to run through a
bunch of these in like that couple
minutes so we can catch up a little fit
to it marks when fog loggers glad I
finally got to catch a live stream I got
a CPU for the wall are you guys still
accepting Seaview donations I'm sure
yeah the peel box is open he's sending
it if you want if you don't need it you
don't have any attachment to it I will
probably do another one of these I think
we're gonna do these about once a month
something like that so feel free to send
along like I said there's some we have
lots of like duplicates of Phenom 2's
I've on 64 is Pentium Poor's stuff like
that but um I'm sure we can find other
stuff do Troy Leonard $5 please make a
mousepad the size of the large mod mat
with the same design not gonna do that
but we do have some mouse and math plans
we just haven't finished the designs yet
so we have ideas we'll work on them I
like the idea of having multiple designs
available for four different products so
we're gonna try and rework that and I
guess I won't mention this snowflake
character so this I showed my patreon
backer video that's gonna be published
today I guess but that's a different
sort of remade version we have the white
blue model of this on the store the
mousepad and a lot of people really
wanted a black and blue model which is
totally fine so we made one of those you
do not have it on a story yet this was
the sample so you're seeing the first
one that came in some slight revisions
we're doing but not much and that will
be on the store once we get them
manufactured they're in production now
and we got a super chat from zbg hello
is EDG good to see you
ten dollars I look forward to the new
sweater it gets cold here and southern
hot in New Hampshire are there any plans
to make a GN Arctic parka and Rio
Patrick and you all rock Thank You Gigi
we have no plans for an Arctic Parker
right now I guess if we have a lot of
viewers in the Arctic please let us know
I will try to make something for you
they bite I was gonna say maybe by the
time it's summer I'll have something out
but then I guess that's still relevant
to you isn't it
I do like three more for right now Ronny
seek ten ten Australian hi from
Australia I love what you guys do please
kill all the hard work it really shows
in the quality of your videos thank you
very much also what are your thoughts on
the courts here 70/50 d airflow it isn't
forced air some to the deaths remember
which one that is first cuz I I remember
this case doesn't just have a mesh front
because I liked the case originally for
the overall build quality I remember
that I think it does just have a nice
run airflow addition this is old oh yeah
no that's a fine the case is fine I have
no problems in that case visually anyway
I haven't tested it but it's got some
holes in it and it's got fans behind the
hole so it should be better than rest
cases on the market data file to god
Braeden it to an Intel event and show it
to them we probably actually could
arrange something like that katha we
should get like some architect assign a
20 year old Intel CPU fish LexA collars
left an idea for a case video on the be
quiet 601 review I'll check it out cute
with a good work guys thank you and I do
one more here for a bit like our system
$5 I have tons of switchgear I like
networking switches I always think
Nintendo oh that name networking
switches I guess I'll play Mario yeah
d TK MRP if I thought it's do you think
BFG went under because of their lifetime
warranty big great stuff at a
water-cooled video card from them I
don't think that's we killed them I
don't know I have to look into it I'm
sure it's it's publicly found at this
point all right so what do you have that
looks kind of cool I like the the
writing in this one Steve my first
computer cost me $2,000 and was a
smoking fast 386 at 40 megahertz
sporting a huge mechs for 80 megabyte
hard drive a 14 inch high-end viewsonic
bubble tube monitor and a 24-pin oka
data dot matrix printer the first game
that I played in that computer line
break the first game that I played on
that computer was period bold Leisure
Suit Larry in the land of the wild
lizards course it's very dramatic
yes so he's sent us this is from mm1 yes
and enormous amount of fake copies yes
these are big memory cards I don't know
what's fake bill don't plug these into
any online systems because if they're
fake as I'm like that the Chinese like
that 8 gigabyte USB key that was like a
hundred megabytes never know it's hot
hey we should look at these there does
he say how they're fake no but there's
also adapters and to build the system oh
I got it I wonder if the adapters are
faulty something like that
fakes samsung micro SD cards maybe you
can use these in a show about fake cards
or something definitely we use all 80 of
them but you definitely use them for
that our videos on those have been
pretty popular so I hope it's not
actually 32 gigabytes
there's the processors just if this were
actually 32 gigabytes and he sent us
like a half terabytes opinions that he's
not a nice penny importer is one of many
opinion force looking for just checking
out these fake samsung cards
I'm curious to see how they're fake
Thanks we'll check it out in
state-of-the-art double-sided
high-density five and a quarter floppy
disk
I guess that's what's people are laughs
you know the bootleg SD cards and that
Leisure Suit Larry that's Jesus isn't
her hound anymore is it I mean not by
the same developers but right as well
put anything on Steam that's true
literally got a friend in trouble who
copied it Leisure Suit Larry and now
we're back to talking about how our
bombs about the new Diablo game I
honestly don't even know anything about
it it's unwinnable game let's go people
okay yeah that's reasonable to be bummed
about that Marco Mendoza $10 found your
channel right after the principal
technologies Tabaco I've been watching
you religiously since then I spent more
time at work watching your backlog
working don't get in trouble
we can't fire also a love magic we need
more magic
we got $10 from here I am dr. Caine I
just want to show my support to this
channel for all the sport you guys show
us testing these twenty atti is that
your own expense is very noble endeavor
well it should be pretty fun
and I look forward to that and the
shipping cost and some of them is a bit
high because it's harder to me UK and
they're insured so it's like over Hydrox
each way but we I think we'll be fine
so like the interesting thing with this
is our ROI will be lower than other
videos cuz the cost is so high to ship
all these things around the world in
some cases but I will still will still
be fine obviously this cloth
it's a real flow yes so there's just a
cover my data back up week one no it's
really good yeah there's a discus stuff
in there I don't know how well protected
it's been all these years I think
there's a reason they stopped making
them actually floppy Diablo suit Larry's
once
purple is 'red 1.2 mix all they did was
try to make a game let me get that no
the other one oh yes okay sorry
this one is from Anton and has a hasn't
a customs no dialect as it came
international and it says the items
described processor used value declared
$0 processor fan used $0 ddr2 RAM used
as your house did Irfan coppers didn't
send us we're suit larry you didn't ya
send us anything connected with first
like real game I played was probably
lemmings it's good for opening boxes and
I'm later Red Alert red alert command
conquer lemming oh this is shanks T this
is fairly shame minor shank so nice I
see that this person Anton that means
with awesome yes it was trying to get it
out okay this person some Dustin there
have the same problem that has been had
for ages with PGA CPUs as you can see
the CPU is firmly attached look cooler
so if we can if we can crack that
concrete over
yeah oh nice Dominator for what is this
Oh gigabyte okay that's uh books or I
think that has at least ten polygons
yeah at least ten triangles in it they
you know they used this nvidia MX 4000
to render this image it's really that
powerful nice they didn't what is it
there's no way at max 4000 yeah hey GP
that's really cool they use the stocks
to ship three of CPUs but I think the
Box look cooler than the GP would be it
yes the boxes from the era when they put
very poorly made 3d girls on everything
and he had a AMD head Ruby and NVIDIA
had that green berry that was call
nearly bought a ruby action figure hard
arrest for the office they're like 15
bucks on eBay for some reason people
don't want in the promotional the gears
from 2004 no wonder it's $0 to click it
someone says alright welcome to the
future yeah there's your ray tracing so
this one's got some not Tom Platts just
Dom's so I share Dominator memory this
is actually was fairly high end stuff so
1024 megabytes per stick one gigabyte
sticks 800 megahertz timings we've been
talking about timing a lot lately
check out those time he's this would be
pretty tight memory timings for four for
12 I'd like to return to that and lose
all the other advantages of high
frequency high-capacity memory oh nice I
didn't see Angie you gotta zoom in ha
yeah we're gonna display that now yeah
zoom in on the Andrew you think you can
3d model stuff that well I hope not all
right so that's the bottom Anton thank
you
so they have the theory on the daily
plan video yeah ash remember Andy Ruby
because that one was he is even kind of
recently might have been and it's he I
oh yeah it wasn't at the I thin it was
definitely a TI all right some super
chats Douglas I'm five dollars thank you
for doing these streams it's cool way to
bond with your audience
also maybe Thai food for dinner question
mark so we've got five bucks to put
towards Thai now hahaha
five dollars here's some money it's very
straightforward super thank you I I
accept the the sanitary transaction of
here's some money
Robert Geyer to died WNY 98 Toughbook
for wal shelf works with cord the or you
weren't the Dell you'd like tough books
right this like gigantic Titan I did
work with them yeah Robert I wonder
whether they were actually like durable
or worked on were literal military
laptops like they got sent to
Afghanistan those are seriously having a
book so I was wondered about that if I
was just like a marketing thing no they
put them on shock and vibrations it's a
table it's got a bunch of Pistons that
punch the laptop from below and just
rattles the hell out of laptop all
around the table so that's a shot
convene their drop rigs you hook it up
to a platform and a wire
and when you tell it to go I push the
button or pull a lever whatever depends
on the model just drop it however many
meters up you said it and then you can
measure the you set force
you set the height by way of force and
then see you take it apart after do like
a an operation on it like a surgery and
see what parts fell out of it what cut
jostle blue stuff like that so those
were actually tough but not all of them
are like that
see this was from David by the way the
gigabyte box and the f1 and Celeron in
there but no litter with that one
anyone got a laptop recommendations all
right so we got no more super chance I
should try and get through am i catching
up at all oh I am catching up nice
that's awesome that's so rare
hahaha siharan let me just get through
these I've almost caught up on the super
chaps thank you for being patient with
me yeah obviously they're doing a lot of
ones with like the store order shoutouts
I'm sort of camera sexist on that do it
live is let's go to the stream the stuff
that's coming in the students had some
normal chat to her have you gotten ahold
of an RIT f28 CIF tw3 Ultra GPU if so
there's is there a universal cooling
block that will fit and can the BRM be
air cold that BRM can be air cooled and
i don't know if there's a universal
cooling block that will fit but I would
assume you can make one fit I'm pretty
sure I can make one fit like you that me
gotta see I'll see you on there you just
might need some special mounting
hardware drill some holes in something
we do have one though I haven't tested
it yet but we have one we're busy with
the dead 2080 guys right now to work
with the living ones Brian Jensen $2
what phone will you be playing hit
Diablo on none so I have a Samsung
export s4 and I don't know what my phone
is called
I tried I haven't I tried to play
there's a
Shin Megami Tensei game that came out on
mobile I tried to play it and I couldn't
so I don't think I've successfully
played a game on my phone since Pokemon
go
that's like the limit before the s4 can
do so on go is pretty good for killing
their battery and incinerators I think
Andrew did your that kill your phone
early you think no it just did it it was
just time to be obsolete if they hit the
timer to become obsolete this user needs
to buy a new phone now we didn't buy one
of those they're right about a different
phone this time they can hear you yes
they can hold your phone out when you're
talking so they can track everything
you're saying sways are Swasey five
dollars I have an X of X if I need some
kind of GT that I can send if you like
we don't we haven't had one of those
sent in yet I don't think I need to
figure out what to do with GPUs I'd like
to be like a DQ wall I don't know to
think about it maybe even a bit inspired
what been inspired yeah we got it to
like yes yeah yeah before I saw is I
want us to do specifically a wall of RIP
though like brands that have gone out of
business and their products and would be
FG x FX are still in business but they
only make AMD a now couple more to get
through them and now I'm gonna try your
last days alright d dy RK o lb o TN 20
Norwegian thank you upgrading from 2600
cage with 2700 X while watching well I'm
glad we can provide some background
entertainment for you while you're
building I always like to leave the
youtube playlist going while I'm
building system so happy to hear that we
can we'd be in the background that's a
big upgrade although numerically it's
only a hundred digits not upgrade so
Troy Jefferson $5 use mega mint d6 for
$350 in Vega for 450 I would use like
you're buying worth the price currently
running our lines unite in my system and
needing the upgrade if you're saying
Vega 64 before
50 i would favor the 56 model and then
unlocked it in anyway as you feel
comfortable doing so it's 56 a pretty
good card I always liked that one worth
the price I don't know check the tent so
DTI prices I still can competitor I
don't know what the cost right now but
it is a big upgrade from a 290 that's
for sure and a couple more to get
through your motorsport for 99 I have a
dual socket T 7500 twin six core x6 56
and 90 most times like a car at that
point it takes six and six dims for 96
gigabytes
well that's like I've had like a
terabyte of RAM a few server racks went
to surplus for a waste I save what I
could that's pretty cool
Oh a few of your server racks my sticky
rice that is a cool system though then
grow again five dollars building an
office PC on a tight budget basic 3d CAD
work which would you recommend 2200 G
with 4 gigabytes of RAM or an older APU
with 8 gigabytes I guess I because tight
budget gotcha yeah the 22 energy is a
really big upgrade over some of the
previous eight years so it's hard to say
I don't know it is I guess open one of
your cab models that you're working on
and look at how much memory it's using
and if the answer is a lot then go for
the eight gigabyte if you're not using a
lot then you could leverage the
additional processing power it's really
hard to say without knowing specifically
what you work on but there are ways to
diagnose it yourself or look around
online see if the software you're using
is memory intensive that could help
answer your question I would lean
towards the 2200 G because I find it
easier to upgrade memory later when you
have more money than then the whole
platform and we do like two more before
we move on sevilla say hello from
seattle please make GN parka thanks you
p88 we have no current flat stack of GN
parka but we've now had two requests in
one night and one of them was e DG's and
one of them is EEG who wants it for Hoth
apparently what do you have so from Jeff
M we have an AMD cooler with some really
everybody will be really happy about
that sticker place
what oh nice yeah we should turn that
fan on and some low profile memory he
says he has the motherboard and CPU
which he wants to keep but he would be
happy to lend it out I think we're I
think I can dig up what we learned
somewhere we can find systems yeah but
that means that this should work did he
also sent a 9600 this card card yes yeah
he's on the card the cooler was for an
Athlon 7750 all of it is still
functional video card just needs a new
thermal paste to keep it from
overheating are you talking about that
cooler is so big that's it great and
we'll ever need a things I can
practically pull it off without removing
the screws but then we also have this
box which was already open and I forgot
about it this is from Patrick yes and oh
it's got an cypher el okay subscriber so
this is from cypher el okay uh let's see
so you've seen this already oh nice
yes oh yeah yeah this is really cool
actually new silicon wafers we can use
these for some wall art for sure
definitely so let me read some of this
cipher LK said let's see I'm showing
Andrew I forgot these are like mirrors I
shouldn't be pointing them towards the
camera
when baiting is privacy yeah that's
right okay so they say the history I've
been in the IT industry since I
graduated high school I've been
fortunate enough to work for a couple of
fortune 100 companies a little more than
20 years ago while working for one of
those companies a co-worker had a
relative that also worked for another
predominant fortune 100 company at the
time and worked at a facility where
these wafers were processed in the u.s.
these were considered reject samples
while normally they get destroyed he was
able to save a small bat he had
something he's out to his brother who
was kind enough to
picked two up from the rescue batch as
you can see by the wafers I picked one
that was clean and another that had the
lithography process completed that's
really cool and I'm like the one I
bought on eBay over there it is not
shattered into pots and pieces a little
chipped up but pretty good they probably
were before you need something then or
will pecked as for what these were
destined or created for we never did get
a straight answer however considering
the source these came from out of the
time they were created
it was our speculation that these would
be part of a powerful PC chip intent
well I can't confirm or deny that these
decorative pieces have been great
conversation makers over the years
hopefully you'll be able to clean these
up a little bit after their 24 years of
travel and storage in some cases and be
able to make good display pieces out of
these definitely definitely can thank
you cipher L okay for signing those in
really cool stuff and that came from him
as well right yes when I just instantly
rip the label off the CPU so I probably
should have been good and that is fraud
that is a and AMD Athlon chip yes nice
okay there's more than one AMD oh cool
yeah so can frame those yes definitely I
need to we can I don't know if we're
gonna do like a stream for framing all
those or considering how long it took me
less time well it's not broken this time
sometimes also I'll be easy yeah that's
true considering how long it takes us to
open the boxes you're like GM art day
Saturday for eight hours
nothing um we got a super chat couple
Marty through I always say that crossing
out five dollars hospitals and
overclocked two to four cords 500
gigahertz and the rest on 5.0 I'm 900k
on any motherboard to save thermal
Headroom
also when can we expect a Z through 98
dark PCB video as soon as I have one for
that answer and I am looking forward to
get anyone and then there are some some
guesses and
chat by the way PowerPC chip someone's
asking failed psychics chips make a GM
logo out of them with a router I would
love a wafer size chips like we were
assuming about our PC yes I would assume
there's no based on the based on the
letter for me also I forgot I left that
captions going pretty impressive for
real-time captions
we expect to see through night a dark
PCB video as soon as I found one for
that answer and then we're gonna keep
getting one and then there are somewhat
guesses and chat by the power pcs chips
someone's asking failed chips make a GMO
Co out of them with a router it's like
an infinity mirror yeah hey babies I
would love a wafer sorry chips like we
were assuming power chips I would assume
so based on the based on the laughs I
just want to wait till it catches up
also I forgot I left captions going
pretty impressive the real-time captions
we expect to see through night of the
dark PCB video as soon as I have one for
the answer get one in then there are
some again asses at hand chat by the
powerpc it understands it understood the
part where you compliment in the caption
system yeah and then immediately went
downhill Oh Josh oh yeah yeah the
overclocking question 2 to 4 quarters
5-1 4 gigahertz sure Billy a lot of
cooling for that 85.3 I it depends on
the quality of your chip but
you're kind of I don't like doing
different our clocks on different cores
for anything other than a benchmarking
machine I would prefer to stick to one
frequency let me just benchmarking for
fun than sure Steve Justin spent $5.00
Steve would you be interested in old
issues of the unofficial PlayStation
Magazine PSM have issues one through 104
if you have any cool like game or
computer ads in them that are tannic
kids who you're funny or old or whatever
consider setting in a lawn if you don't
want it and we can probably look into
doing something with fun framing it or
something like that
we got a $5 the micro Drive was one of
the products that I have managed it back
in the day 1 inch platter hard drive and
compact flash form factor did you open
that already micro drive up my oh yeah
it's the one that's sitting over here
yeah yeah 6 gigabyte micro drive so for
handheld devices oh this is like yeah
those unmould laptops we have like the
super super big memory card slot PC
PCMCIA still sealed PC cards so we can
sell that to you baby yes excape is
Hitachi so are thousands of
high-resolution images capture hours of
video little did they know that we're
yeah yeah a 4k yeah maybe
probably not six gigabyte might probably
six minutes actually yeah six gigabyte
micro Drive weighs less than a roll of
35 millimeter film
so there's your marketing point quickly
exchange high-capacity files between
computers equivalent to over 4,000
floppy discs that is enough when you get
into the thousands that is no longer a
good form of measurement we only have
one populace that's show yeah it's it's
a good thing this
let's see we got a super chat from tell
us two dollars and I can find my Holt
9800 GTX want me to send it we have a
ninety six hundred and eighty eight
hundred right
I don't know we're probably like it's
hard to say I don't know what we need
yet I kind of need to do that like doing
stuff with the stuff video first to
figure out how much we have and what we
can use a working title
yeah Kelly Gaynor $5 ask your helper if
he wants an Asus zenfone three deluxe
it's sitting on my task taking up dust
I've not used in over a year
can't mail it in for fan mail hey Hannah
sorry I can't I appreciate your offer
but I'm not soliciting cellphones from
people right now you get with your
samsung s4 yeah I think I'd rather have
fun thanks old at this point yeah well I
don't like the I had the other day I've
been pushing off updates on mine since I
got it and the other day had died and I
rebooted it and it had updated like so
now it's probably worse than it was in
several ways and the battery is probably
gonna die sooner yeah I've actually had
shorter charges since the update Matt
Del Greco $4.99 just finished my first
ITX build the screw kale mash you can't
love the channel guys ITX cable
management is really hard so if you did
any of it then kudos to you
Chuck Bennett $1.99 I've got maybe about
a half dozen of these to go through
through till we're through with all no
Maxim Thank You Chuck clone fire 666 one
hell of an unboxing I should be going to
sleep by now
hahaha damn rice or stone so $10 having
a 240 and 120 a IO core CPU and GPU is
very common nowadays would love to see a
video on the most efficient placement of
them using different cases for testing
we've done stuff like that you do
something like that for the H 500 P
original case but typically
you want the coldest component to be
front-mounted if your amount any
radiators in the Front's probably or GPU
CPUs to care less about frequency or
about a thermal frequency curve then the
GPU does so your front especially if
it's in tile your front mount the GPU
radiator if you only have two spots on
top mount the other one
couple more Austin Nichols two dollars
am i watching LGR what is that lazy game
reviews now it does retro Hardware no
okay
yes you are let's listen Oh max right
any five dollars just dropped a package
in the mail should be there Thursday
enjoy thank you well I'll probably pick
it up at the same time I pick up a whole
bunch of twenty-eight et eyes that are
dead Robert Geiger ten dollars my se got
screwed up any interest super jet in a
98 Toughbook for background piece okay
now I understand for background piece or
wall shelf that works with the cord I'm
the eighth Toughbook is that a Panasonic
product don't forget about that but no
no there were no at some point Adele
does make tough books but so does
Panasonic Panasonic has the registered
mark on it I don't know if they'll
actually they might not call him tough
but hey they bought the name I don't
know like I said to the earlier total
system Oliver probably passed on full
systems and laptops just cuz they're so
big like I don't know where we put it
yeah
we've had a few offers for really cool
like complete systems but we had to turn
them down just because there is a
limited amount of space CPUs and video
cards are easy because you can kind of
put a bunch of them in a small spot open
$95.00 any thoughts on the asus rog eric
a io cooler know if they're any good if
not what CLC do you recommend for need
7r k so the acer is one they're just the
ace attack pumps so it's the same pump
you've seen I think it's Gen 5 and all
the other Jenna Jenna six coolers which
is most of them at this point so as far
as the cooling solution remains that
goes it's the same as everything else I
think a
two's scare with their calls like Ryu or
something like that the only the gimmick
with them is that there's that display
on it that's the only thing that's
different so and one of them like pushes
air down to the VR I'm just totally
pointless so if you want the display on
the top of it then you can't really get
it anywhere else if you don't care about
that then just just buy something
cheaper because that's the only real
difference with it
Shana won five dollars what's your
favorite small form-factor case for an
MIT X gaming rig has to be able to
squeeze a long dual slot 1080i in bored
of my big rig so Patrick's on more case
ITX stuff than I have lately do we have
any that we liked how's the fit fit a
big video card this Silverstone one was
good yeah the NZXT small form-factor
cases are usually pretty generous sized
but that's just because they're smaller
versions of the full-size case is
basically mid-tower but yeah I mean we
like the full-size version of those
cases so if you're really needing a lot
of room in there I just the clearances
on those I think it's called like that
as 200 H 280 280 yeah at this point it's
aged 200 and there's a they have two
different skews ones Mini ITX and ones
microwave we like that Silverstone SG 13
also we did a video on that one
but I don't know if it'll fit a huge
card yeah it fits large cards I still
how big yeah the Silverstone ones are
pretty low because the ones that are
like really flat and use the riser cable
no there's absolutely 13s that white
rectangular oh right yeah okay yeah
that's that's pretty long check the SG
13 see if it'll fit the card you have
make sure you account for the cable
length that you added the card and that
I liked that one a lot but it is smaller
so it's - its it is usually like $60 I'm
gonna think it's even less now yeah we
have five more that used to go through
Maki makes stuff $5 should I upgrade my
2080 to a 20 atti SLI I have a 29 50 X
and T Titan next piece I would say hold
off for right now wait and see what
happens surprises as Pascal goes away
and also wait to see what happens to the
28 et eyes like if they solve the dying
problem
data file $5 try to hold off on your
phone upgrade still found at the 5ge
chips head start rolling out that's
actually pretty good point present now
$5 are you going to do an in-depth guide
on how to stand down a 9900 cake die no
it sucks it's awful I wouldn't recommend
this I Roman who is more of an expert on
this Dave are more of an expert on this
than I am spent a week on it I was
talking to him behind the scenes as he
was working on it he spent a week doing
that and getting it perfect and there's
a chance you destroy something I would
not recommend it in general
Dylan Stratton 5 died looking to do my
first custom loop for a 900k in 2080 ia
what case would you recommend I don't
like RGB or glass siding I want a
functional box well we have similar
needs
I like the for that kind of you'll get
glass anyway because it's kind of hard
to avoid now but for that kind of need
check out the 11 dynamic maybe that will
have an error but I like the dynamic
more honestly and you say you're gonna
do a custom roof anyway so Lee Anne Lee
is the company 11 dynamic that's the
case I'm using right now for my work
system that does have a glass side panel
but it doesn't have RGB so you got that
con 4 yeah that's like a hundred bucks
th $10 what is a reasonable all for
overclocked for an 1886 k 5.1 gigahertz
Oh with a th 15 cooler maybe 5 gigahertz
D 15 something like that okay well you
got I have some very beautiful
letterhead here I don't want to show it
just because it's good addresses and
stuff alright these are literal
dumpster-dives epu so nice you see he
rescues this is from will he rescues
computers out of the trash and he
recycles he will take whatever parts
that are valuable and recycle the rest
to the charity across the street from me
Frankie free geek Toronto though oh yeah
- as in his videos these two CPUs were
found somewhere around the 2009 to 2014
that's a pretty generous time frame they
are a little dirty and in the original
state I found them at 15 ye do wait you
said 2009 or not
we're team you have less generous than
what I thought was ahead 1999 to 2013
and somewhere in there for customs he
claimed these as old CPUs value $10
Canadian Wow that's a little generous
yeah right there there are Pentium I
guess they're both minions yeah so
that's pretty cool we also have from
Matt a old laptop CPUs and RAM and a
Quadra FX 5500 that he picked up in 2004
to start his journey into GPU
programming is nothing CUDA development
down the road nice um let me talk to you
yes good as interesting it's very useful
that's what this is card in here and
then some blob thought memory this is
from David did you write that on there
okay by way of Japan it says David
there's no XFX check check out that art
that's that's even more advanced than
the 3d girl that was on the gigabytes
yes it's incredible internal debate of
how to solve products there's there's no
way to stack these together right
well I the so like you're just like what
package engineer was like weeping at
night because they can't fit the maximum
number of cards and hit the minimum
space it costs a lot to do stuff like
that
because the stores gonna hate you too
and you know that went to retail stores
yeah cuz it wasn't going to new I
probably didn't exist so you mean your
whole capacity so david says want to
give you a little context these now
ancient purchases as you discovered by
yourself on your own trip to Japan PC
on us here a little pricey and a
selection can be limited it's not as bad
these days now that we have more online
retailers but there weren't many options
at the time I think it was 2006 I just
moved to this part of Japan I didn't
have a car yet so I had to make multiple
trips by mountain bike to the only
computer store in the area then fill my
backpack with parts and head back a
20-minute trip each way this is brutal I
could have afforded better components
but stubbornly or foolishly insisted on
getting the best bang for the buck the
choices I made we're interesting because
axe-fx doesn't make any video boards
anymore that's definitely true I also
chose a motherboard from the now-defunct
a bit and aftermarket coolers from the
nearly the four installment okay catch
it
Salman is a fun fun company I work with
I hope you can find well they were a fun
company to work this until they went out
of business so comes around goes around
Allen I hope it's for this stuff
thanks I kindly provided over the years
huge help to me and so many others thank
you Dave for sending that over I think
there's something else in there oh yeah
I wanna show off to ya it's the one we
already open because it was so heavy
this pile of trash is getting large
hahaha oh yeah I like that one's
interesting so 3600 GT with an awesome
werewolf die on it it's got it's from
poor you trading company apparently and
there's the there's the back of the card
with the Zalman cooler on I should open
that I guess and check it out nice
velcro oh well they knew it was gonna be
reused for the next two decades
I know well the sad thing is I don't
know if you actually didn't want to get
up so I think it just reveals the the
hand and that has ddr3 superfast memory
can play Starship Troopers you can see
how's that on there starts flood nice
how do you get it out
a knife you can why don't you show off
yours all over this okay this is a full
liquid-cooled system that has been
broken down and as far as we can tell is
mostly undamaged
there was one whisk faster in the box
when they opened it and we opened it
because it is incredibly heavy because
it is like 50 percent copper yes so to
560 it means very very shiny blocks on
them and an asus rog board oh this is
it's not that heavy but it's pretty
heavy it was like a complete system we
could hook this up probably yeah and I
don't this is from Kari I don't think
there was a note in there no calm but
I'm assuming if there's not a note and
it was this carefully wrapped that um
it's probably functional it looks like
it there's I got heat killer one
capacitor and little bag in case we
could actually find where he came from
which I don't think we'll ever yeah
they're really nice water blocks though
yeah and there's a CPU in there check
out the back too that's got a copper
back plates on everything I don't think
we're never gonna figure out what CPUs
in there until we put it up so I'm not
taking that block off I think the some
of the water cooling components might be
more than the GTX what is it one of
those uh five six five six these I
didn't thought what could claim parts
might cost more but SLI was also more
viable and so this package is absurd
you're talking about package engineers
weeping I think this is how they got
back at everyone it's like okay so first
you have to remove it from an x-shaped
box and then you have to undo one flap
for each part of the ax
and then that might reveal a video card
I like that he taped an all-night cup
for you
is that it way too easy to tell and they
open an opposing directions of course
and cysts awful marketing and sick okay
we got we got a Oh Sheila this is sir so
we can proceed to not use it I think
it's either like got an LED in it or
it's um grounded to the case or
something I think it's coming over here
yeah insist on nvidia harvest and sell
that copy that looks like good water
coin setup though that's less then let's
see it's got the Zalman plate on it and
the Zalman fuller on it with some of the
tiniest bends I've ever seen and uh I
just like the mix of aluminum and copper
that they're using for the cooler just
for branding I guess I don't know I'd be
curious to mess around with this cooler
song Salman I liked a box more than the
card for that way nicely yeah it was
does the card match the box I believe so
okay pay attention to the actual
hardware 9600 well we only have a couple
more so let's get through the last year
they just put an aftermarket cooler on
them yes they they rode in Japan wrote a
bike to the store 20 minutes each way
filled their backpack with as many parts
as they could and brought them back it's
pretty cool actually I'm gonna repack
this box after the stream I'll set it
over here
I've been putting stuff where we can
sharp over it just to make things
interesting later then iam one to 33 and
aimed ek6 300 never overclocked it's not
a challenge played quake and quake 2
with various mods most notably quick
paintball they included a JPEG of a
quake paintball logo and this is how a
million nice fake paintballs a couple
super chats before you hold those up I
guess and just plug in the camera into
so hopefully we don't go down here
battery if it does we'll be back you
need to plug it in dirty if you come
closer it'll use less battery cuz it
doesn't have to see as far that's how it
works
alright here we go we're going for the
John for the swap I was looking around
for those silicon wafers I could see how
I we actually are using one as a mirror
currently and the office I don't like we
ever show that off no no I don't think
you know it all right
is that is that it did you make the
transfer nice how about Siri chats so we
got John won $2.00 thanks guys no
problem
andrew is Zacchaeus five Australian I
guess any thoughts or plans to overclock
the gigabyte extreme Horus board and
high from Mackay Australia hi
I think the matter which one you me and
I think we just got the extreme
motherboard in and I think we're getting
the video card sent at some point zdg
five dollars Adam reservoirs in discord
it thinks his padded envelope was it
left on the other table
next to the RT Xbox and broken wafer
headed envelope next to the RT Xbox and
broken way through our text boxes and
over there oh he means on this table
Oh to be open those last time I think
that's why I was over here but no no
well thanks EDG for pointing that out
$5.00 Good Samaritan okay
doron f1 turn on whole family's here
phenom 2 cables to buy cable adapter
that's not what this is oh wait this one
was actually protected slightly multiple
people have sent us CPUs in like tiny
Ziploc bags yes like this so I'm gonna
hold that pretty well this one was in
its little box
okay that explains all right I
understand the system now I'm sorry for
making both of it I have phone 64 try
and get this open Phaethon 6800 you said
you understand the system you finish
them off
so z2g monkey makes stuff my gosh did we
get a case review on 1000d and finish it
off a building right now for 480
radiators has insane beats my 750d no
plans to review the 1000 d not really
the kind of case we really work with
coarser didn't offer I don't think they
even have money anyway data file $2 you
need that RGB for maximum ROI bro gauge
Lindo $5 thanks for giving me something
to listen to
update firmware how to stack of Dallas
servers reboots take forever
gladder give me something I don't have
it's much better than that though haha
like a couple stories I should try and
read like I said no guarantees we're
kind of closing out at this point too
but if you go to store that gamers Nexus
dotnet and use coupon code do it live
you'll get a 10% discount during the
stream I'll try to shout out a couple
more orders no guarantees that we have a
lot of volume between everything going
on so Joe from Indiana first a mod Matt
thank you Joe getting those in soon
Charles from Illinois purchased a teal
logo anniversary edition shirt thank you
are you a couple more here Christopher
from Michigan purchased a tee logo shirt
as well that's popular designed and then
we got Mohammed from Abu Dhabi the UAE
purchased a mod Mac let's go on a
faraway thank you for picking it up and
as I said the limited edition Graff logo
foil shirt with the Quad SLI or
crossfire foil colors on it is on the
store as well on starting cameras nexus
net and then once it's gone it'll be
gone when I can make more so what do we
have
we'll have a I haven't open this one but
here you can do this one because it
looks like it and provided by 60%
divisor
because they sent us a bunch of tweezers
the box of tweezers by the way for
anyone who's missed it when we say
tweezers it is a reference to the verge
who called a pair of zip ties tweezers I
had to it took me a minute to screw
screw my brain around enough to remember
the reference that's a literally just
just tweezers nice feet
I don't think it is okay no it's it's a
box with CPS inside of it that makes
more stuff so yeah this is from Adam
wasn't a really good way to do it
oh yeah that depends at the styrofoam
make a couple people tried that I oh
this is the okay when I took that chip
out like ours to go at this point yeah
this is for madam as opposed to that
package until 8088
Pentium 1 AMD k-6 to 500 megahertz and
Intel Xeon 50 150 mm I wonder if that's
one of the dual side ones I wonder if we
should buy a dual socket word is a bit
of a vintage computer collector he has
over 40 machines from pre 2000 just for
the heck of it and if we meet any parts
let him know nice and we can borrow it
cool so these from I believe Chad yes
these other than a lot of zip ties or
tweezers if you prefer there is when I
first saw this I saw the underside it
made me think it was the Intel CPS and I
are okay but it is a deal later when I
say but it is an and the Athlon so I
chad actually deal it at this Athlon and
this is similar to the process I went
through for the 900 can deal with these
things it's not difficult to get the lid
off but then to sand down clean like you
can see the kind of divots in there
where the indium was that's it's not
terribly difficult to remove it's just
hard to flatten it out and then you can
see the gold contact area that's on the
900k as well so they have multiple
layers of metals in there to make
connections of the solder so pretty cool
very very cool lid I think we should go
back to having fan / heatsink required
printed
on the IHS does it say that yes ah
sounds pretty cool it's the cyrix into
bio by way of deduction it doesn't say
that anymore therefore you must have
figured that might more right there was
this two more boxes uh I think so
and we opened the first twenty atti
earlier if you missed it earlier in the
stream and that was a XE ultra and we
have more coming in of various brands
primarily Nvidia founders Edition so
keep an eye out for that coverage as we
get through it we have to test the first
one tonight see how it does see if we
can replicate the issues I'm pretty
confident we can based on the
information that the user sent Ilana
so we'll be looking at a lot of that
funny you guys down
oh nice more magazines to fall like old
ads from I like those okay
computer gaming world nice showing bed
got an address on there it's come John
Madden okay it's got address my corner
tears although this is so old they
probably move by now
dear gamers Nexus let's see and conclude
in October of 1993 I purchased a Dell at
forty six txt towers try still have a
computer game X win I lost the next six
months of my life playing that game from
there I've been purchasing new computer
inside upgrade parts building computers
are playing games now that I'm over 55
years old I really thought it would have
slowed down by now but happily I was
wrong that's pretty awesome to hear I
wanted to send you a few old computer
magazines I had out in the shed I was
thinking that if there were articles or
advertisements you found that carried
nostalgia or had computer history worthy
of remembering you could cut the page
out and frame it in just a standard 8 by
11 frame I hope you may find a few that
would grace the wall of your new studio
headquarters I added to the back a list
with a few pages that brought back that
brought back memories me thank you for
doing that that's gonna save me a lot of
time oh nice these look pretty good
actually
in conclusion I wish to say thanks to
Steven the entire Korea gamers Nexus for
the many great videos and support for
the community from granddaddy 69 so
thank you for sending that along let's
see what the list says carefully
addresses but I think you're good you
can show those yeah it's those raise our
show well okay so we've got these are
the magazines that are in there
computer gaming the world September 1999
Maximum PC 99 PC Magazine 96
let me curious to that one PC Magazine
97 I wonder if 96 is talking up to
Starcraft at all minimum BS I remember
that slogan they still have that up
until the point they were consumed by PC
gamer hot new k63 is put test gordon
worked for them and that a cpu on the
cover is one of the ones we've received
in the last couple hours here so that
max that's max PC right yeah yes max PC
page 4 has an advertisement for ATI this
is awesome now this list page 4 it's got
an ATI ad of some kind speed kills
is that their ad though and he's being
sliced in speed killing pieces speed
kills by a slow video card and will
decapitate you and slice you in half
that's pretty gross actually
now they have a quick quake 2 framerate
it's not even quick 3 nice they have
let's see max PC also page 11 ad for
silicon graphics graphics card so that's
SGI if you don't know Jensen from
founder of Nvidia left silicon graphics
to form a video some history it's short
until your digital visual magic digital
flat panel solution pack then let's look
at maybe one more from this one page 64
3dfx boo 2 3 that's a good one that's a
really good one to look up which page 64
that's fitting
ooh man here we go and people are really
into quake 2 it's all that it and kills
him someone's asking when was the 28th
ETI
it was within the first hour this
opposite the system shock 2 review nice
I'm trying to find where the 28th et is
battle zone somebody's yelling at me
right now for saying kill zone instead
of Edelstein yeah here it is by the way
so 2 hours and 54 minutes ago is when I
was opening that X 28 ETI goodbye um
alright so let's do one more page
courtesy magazine which year is that
this one it's hard to tell 96 and 97
okay so for 96 there is an ad for page
300 I don't know it seemed at rocks 114
Mattox is dead now that'll be a good one
really crammed a lot in here huh
it's like three hundred and something
pages look fat magazine this is when
they were all doing really well this is
an ample page 114 oh okay there we go
there's matchbox raising the bar again
on the left side of the page man where
is him he performance bar again mg a
millennium added features at a new low
price what's that benchmark 1024 768 8
bit nice it's got benchmarks all right
cool I think that's the last box
Netscape Navigator included oh boy keep
that with us
and then if you want to take that one
out nice spots not opened yet which one
that one was already on the table I mean
I I thought you put it there no okay
maybe we've opened it if we yeah if
there's something we left behind we'll
find them and we'll do do them in the
next dream I think this was the only one
that was on the table
yeah okay z17 motherboard battleship
gigabyte hold of warship this is a
recent board oh yeah
timo from germany just picked up a mod
man thank you team out and Aegean blue
and white mouse pad and also on the
limited shirts one word read Alex from
North Carolina picked up two of the beer
glasses thank you one of the limited
shirts and will the anniversary teal
shoes this is from Chris
I kind of doubt that the board is
actually what's in the box
yes oh there's like electrical tape down
there oh yeah that would make sense why
wasn't opening
yeah some other stuff check check that
out so this from Chris let's see
hashtag pocket and zxt reference there's
a CPU and motherboard out of an old
gaming rig a friend of mine asked you to
clean it for him
sadly the machine was too old and dirty
so I told him to get a new one that's
the easiest way to avoid having to clean
different word for people yeah you
should buy a new one I don't I don't
blame him can you fix this it's
impossible only burglar set a connector
to I don't know I don't even do that
maybe he did that to make sure the
friend don't they know I never use the
damage here to the plastic it's very
important sadly the machine was too old
and dirty so I told to get a new one
these parts sat around my house for over
two years as he did not want them back I
have learned a lot about PC Harbor from
watching your videos for the past couple
of years that's great to hear thank you
and I would like to say thank you you
helped a lot of us at noobs more than
you know Chris and I'm sorry for the bad
handwriting a Sharpie is not easy
hashtag pocket haha I like the heat pipe
on that motherboard though hmm he took
care of the CPU yeah if we can actually
get this up north bridge South Korea is
a PDA yes Athlon 64 x2 they can upgrade
the next order that's maybe I don't know
if the is compatible here it went on
well I mean if that board works assuming
it's compatible with these CPUs then we
at least have a platform for them so I
don't know that I do otherwise
although it won't be hard to buy one
okay so we got one more box under here
whatever that is and this envelope
that's empty okay got that one
Nia says I found this brand new in a
data center that was being
decommissioned they had a dual 486
server there too
this is a Wow
okay so it's still in the original like
did they reseal this so this is a penny
I'm 200 megahertz MMX but it doesn't
look like the seals been broken all the
way on it
reseal baby I know it's got two stickers
okay when we see home legacy we sealed
it for like inventory probably yeah
brand-new and a data center that was
being decommissioned so maybe it's new
or maybe they took it out and then like
label it really careful right and put it
away
what is this do they say what it is I
think it's what it says on the label
like they didn't reseal it they found it
in the back right okay
I let you open that and I'll hit a
couple of super chats
let's see it's morphin time $5
would you like an eight ten seven eight
nine TK maybe see if it hits five
gigahertz I don't have the best a 18 X
we have that one thank you that we have
those those are new enough truncate this
guy's name
slinger $5 X $2.99 aces prime with high
point SSD PCIe raid vs. rampage apex MT
raid card which is faster I don't know I
don't work on storage I'm ashamed to say
that I specialize in other things and I
don't try to be an expert at everything
because it's not possible so
unfortunately I don't have a good answer
for you I don't really know that much
about storage beyond alright like I know
pretty well how it works and which
devices I want to use but I don't I
don't benchmark anymore for storage I
check out Allen Melvin Donovan PC fair
for that I will gladly to deflect you to
him he's an expert over there some
opinion with MMX technology it's uh
either like completely unused or an
inventory for a long time
1995 that's pretty cool it's still got
the original like packing on the pens
yeah
I mean you can probably leave it like
that nice only one pen bent GN story I
want to close that discount code soon I
think I'll leave it all on 59 actually
so Jed from the Philippines purchased a
GM logo shirt Thank You Jed we got a and
this is from earlier Thomas from Idaho
purchased a blue and white mouse pad and
the foil graft logo Limited shirt a
couple more Rubin from Florida take the
pay mod mat Thank You Reuben Tim from
New Jersey picked up a few things decals
a mug and a shirt thank you Tim and we
have we have a lot more in there too
like I said I can't hit every single one
of them I try to spot check them though
and thank you for your patience on all
the super chats and the store shoutouts
and stuff so there's the last box we
have from you all and then we'll close
out the stream I think so from Brit
Brett last fan mail for now did I cut it
no okay
oh I don't know the rest of the fences
I'll fold it over for now but there's
what the bottom says I think you even
need to read it important please use the
included tweezers to handle the board's
unless you are wearing your LIVESTRONG
bracelet neither of us are wearing our
loose strong bracelets that not even the
real guy Steve and GN peeps nice job on
your growth and transition to your new
studio digs congratulations after your
call went out for interesting hardware
and CB is I ended up watching the do not
watch vid with the on-air openings for
what was already sent in that made me
remember that I actually had yeah we
didn't oughta test the train please
ignore haha I actually had a few things
from he sees I built in the past bought
some very cool I think and saw a rare
Sun Microsystems hardware which I was
using when I ran my Colo hosting
business off of them colocation hosting
so I pulled a few old video cards in
storage and found an entire space on one
you be 210
and to you v 240 motherboard which looks
like it probably used the CPUs you
showed during your video that's actually
pretty awesome so then I think how much
CPUs in it - mm-hmm
dang that is serious is it harder than
that we don't have to boil do like it's
a simple yeah be careful with that cuz
we could probably boot off of that one
let's see it was where they stopped it's
rather unusual so I thought you would
appreciate some degree absolutely please
have your way with the cards on board
the CPUs on the board the RAM etc paste
them break them up or blow them Huff I
remember the Sun is at the center of our
solar system haha have a great day and
keep up the fifth hazard work on your
videos then please use the tweezers
included well thank you very much to the
fret right Bret thank you that's a
really cool piece of hardware actually
it's gonna close up on that so is your
dual socket board it looks like it's
probably functional and it's got RAM in
its that makes our job easier it's the
monster some cobwebs some curds in here
as well that's pretty cool mod map shows
backordered now yes it is on back order
we sold through the last round we have
more coming in I think like first week
of December or something like that this
is kind of our target one capacitor it
fixed it is that from this board yes I
think so unless it came out of the other
box somehow that's no works don't all I
need the capacitors that was pretty big
and it's not the same it does look
exactly the same as the other capacitor
is holding earlier so I don't know if
that's somehow made its way in the box
but alright I think it's from this board
okay well we'll keep them together just
in case new can glue it into place later
good luck finding the power supply for
that thing yeah that's a very good it's
well the 24 pin looks normal
24 pin is normal um the 10 pin is not
the
yeah we could I'm sure we could adapt
something to it
famous last words but yeah the mod mats
on backorder it will we're definitely
trying to get them in and show through
for Christmas not 100% guaranteed but
it's looking okay right now for that for
the large mats and I agree with you the
person who said that board is beautiful
looks pretty good good we can get a
Paris play on that too so anyway
really cool stuff I'll read the most
recent store order and and then stop
reading those for the night Daniel from
Utah picks up a mod mat as well Thank
You Daniel and I'll leave that coupon
code that do it live 10% off coupon code
I'll leave that up to 11:59 Eastern and
then it should automatically expire
after this stream and super chats we got
all of them so we're good there I'm not
gonna read any more if you said any more
in and yet thank you to everyone who
sent stuff out really cool hardware we
can do a lot with it next thing we need
to do is figure out how we're gonna work
with this stuff for putting on the walls
and things like that so we'll have to
figure out if we're going to do a stream
or just probably video it and then edit
it and upload it something like that and
then other than that the 20 ATT is we
got one dead one in I'm gonna start
working on that tonight and tomorrow and
then we got we have a couple more coming
in this week so we have a pretty good
sample size on that keep an eye out
we'll post updates as we test them it's
not gonna be all on one big thing so
it'll be multiple videos on that and
yeah thank you for watching as I've said
you can go to store like and razaaq's to
top that to make up a shirt like this
one or one of the mod mats on backorder
also the medium mod mat sample came in
tonight as I said earlier in the stream
it's in really good shape now so we're
gonna start making that soon it won't be
out for a while like another month or so
but where you start making that so page
on our comics are scammers exit stops
out there subscribe for more and I will
see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
