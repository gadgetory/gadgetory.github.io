nast the D s 1515 plus on the floor here
this thing is still in its Franken Nath
setup and it's not for a good reason
but this product died on us and we end
up buying this one next to me it's
better I mean it was an upgrade but it
was an upgrade that was forced and we
didn't want because the other one failed
and so the reason the 1515 plus on the
floor failed
we don't 100% know but it appears to be
somewhat common because looking around
online as any of you would do when you
experience a failure it seems like it
might be tied to a power issue or
something like that because going to an
external power supply did fix our issues
were able to run it just fine after that
but the officiais entually was that the
power button no longer worked and it
wouldn't turn on and we have another one
of those today and that's the
unfortunate reason I'm bringing you back
to the the psychology topic before that
this video is brought to you by the
gigabyte z 390 ARS master motherboard
which comes equipped with one of the
more powerful Z 390 V RMS for heavier
overclocks on the new 9th Gen Intel CPUs
the ARS master is also one of the few
motherboards with a really heatsink this
generation featuring a mix of high
surface area fins and looks oriented
cover blocks oh and it's also got
updated RGV illumination learn more at
the link below
ok so for today unfortunately I
recommended a cytology Nass to our
distributor the guy who handles all the
shipping for a store doc gamers nexus
net so you buy stuff from there he ships
it and I recommended a psychology mask
to him before we had repeat issues with
them and now his has failed and his was
a newer model than ours ours the 1515 I
think his is an 18 models we're gonna
check that out and see if we can
troubleshoot the point of failure on it
but if not in the very least it appears
that this is a somewhat common problem
even on the newer models of the sine
ology attached storage devices so here's
our distributors Nass and here's ours
the one on the left
well they're both broken but one of the
left is the most recently broken one as
indicated by the fact that pushing the
power button you should get a bunch of
green lights fans should start spinning
and it's it's not doing any of that and
it is plugged into the same power as all
the lights so this is having a similar
issue to the one that ours had where
it's sporadic sometimes it'll boot up
sometimes it won't
and it's just unplugging it and then
plugging it back in after maybe couple
seconds every now and that it might boot
but obviously you shouldn't have to sit
there and unplug it a thousand times to
get it to turn on so this is how how old
is this it's about six months but the
problems been happening so six months
old had the problem since the beginning
but this one separate from our issue has
an external power break and ours is
internal I mean as you can see the
motherboard it's a custom form factor
board but it uses all ATX power headers
so you can plug in a normal power supply
to it and force it to boot which is good
but this one's external which kind of
leads us to wonder if it is a power
issue it might be a power board issue it
could be a power brick issue it could be
a motherboard could be a CPU no idea no
idea what the problem is but I guess the
the real concern here is that this is
now - sigh knology NASA's that affect us
directly and this one too and looking
online it's also a pretty common problem
the other concerning thing is this is a
different model so it's not like it's
the same one this is a 918 plus we have
another one here I don't know we could
try plugging in the power adapter from
the new one and just see if it always
works but sine ology did fulfill the the
warranty for the broken one
unfortunately they send out refurbished
units so the question is kind of I mean
you buy six months old you kind of feel
bad about getting a used one but
probably has a bunch of like cat hair
from someone else's home before I got
refurbished and also you don't know if
it I don't know it why did it get I just
I don't personally I don't like getting
a refurbished product as part of a
warranty if it's so new it's just old
enough where you can't reasonably return
it anywhere and get your money back and
buy a brand new
thing so I'm just gonna plug in the
power for uh that's a Ethernet cable for
this one and see if this adapter fixes
the problem but I have a feeling it will
not
okay so simple test it doesn't turn on
or not the answer appears to be no so
yeah so not turning on which if it were
as simple as power adapter failure that
would have solved it but the fact that
Synology sent out an entire new unit
refurbished unit as a replacement does
kind of indicate that let's just make
sure it's not a push and hold does kind
of indicate that there's a problem
outside of the adapter so I don't even
know at this point I guess we'll we'll
transfer the data of course onto the new
device or transfer the drives
fortunately it's an easy process so you
remove the drives you keep track of what
order they're in you can label them or
something make sure they're in the exact
same slot order you have to boot the
replacement mass with a new drive set it
up through DiskStation manager swap the
drives over and then that's kind of it
it should work again all the data still
there it's not a painful migration
process it's just you also shouldn't
have to migrate and a lot of businesses
use these types of things so you start
introducing downtime especially when you
have to wait for RMA s and I guess to
their credit it looks like they sent the
new one before requiring the old one to
be sent back so that's good but even
still it's just it's down times not good
and this seems to be not a one-off
failure we don't know the RMA rates we
just did that r-tx video and talks about
how it might be overblown on the
internet if you kind of look at all the
comments online it sounds like this is a
really common issue but we also have no
idea how common it truly is so what
we're gonna do is transfer the data of
course transfer the drives but I think
internally what we want to do is start
testing a different brand for the the
Nass just because I'm kind of worried
about our larger one that's in use now
failing because this one for us failed
in about six months something like that
maybe maybe
not quite a year so the other ones
getting to be about that old and we're
gonna check out I think an ASIS torn ass
which we actually have so we can grab
that so here's a here's one that we got
in recently that we need to do some kind
of review or something with because we
want to use this internally it's a much
simpler Nass it's it's not as good as
the one that we bought the suit the
high-end one in there that's I don't
know that was like a thousand dollars or
something but this is a four hundred
dollar knives and it's about the the
same type of Nass as this old one we
used and we want a secondary one as
backup or as additional storage or as
test storage so we do need another nasan
service and I think it's about like I
said four hundred dollars but it
includes a 10 gigabit connection so
that's that's important because we use
10 G internally and our our high-end ass
the thousand dollar one we bought is
okay the the high-end one has 10 gigabit
so we use that for the media server this
one's one one gigabit and I believe they
want the broken one right here is also
one gigabit but we want to test this and
see if it can actually handle the the
throughput it says it can this is an
ASIS to our NASA so it's a s 440 we
talked about this one at Computex and
we're gonna try it out because it's a
cheaper model but you know the thin is
clearly paying more look at our TX
paying more doesn't always mean you get
something that works as we just
discussed so if it's cheaper but it
doesn't fail then that's fine it might
have slower through put in some
workloads I'm not sure we'll test it and
find out but I guess really my my
objective at this point is doesn't fail
and will of course also still be looking
at building our own internal server we
we have plans for that we're just
waiting on silverstone to ship the right
case where we really want to use their
CS 381 for that project but this one
will go through testing for now and then
as for that's for the broken one we
on the table below fun 918 I guess this
goes through the warranty process gets
sent back and it doesn't appear to be a
power brick issue we don't really have a
great way to validate that but some
other wider spread problem potentially
so I don't know
public service announcement just be
careful with the sign ology NASA's I
guess to Scientology's credit we emailed
them when I was originally failed and
asked for an expedited replacement
because it's clearly in use for business
they had sent it to us as a media sample
originally and we asked them to replace
it
sine ology told us to file a ticket and
that just wasn't fast enough for us so
we bought a new one instead in this
instance it's oh and also they they did
email us several times after we posted
our first video so clearly got some
attention but doesn't fix the issue so
anyway yeah that's it's a PSA about
hachi NASA's if you have this problem
the good news is really all you they've
made it pretty easy to transfer it
drives hopefully unrelated to the
failures but all you have to do is put a
new blank drive into the new unit in the
box over here and set up DSM DiskStation
matters their OS and then swap the
drivers over in the exact same order
plug it in turn it on and if it boots
then that should be pretty much it you
go through a set of process in DSM and
then that's it that's it's not all the
data still there no major risk of losing
stuff unless you install them out of
order or don't follow the guides they
have online so they've made it easy to
replace it it's just that again you
shouldn't have to do that so that's it
for this one not much here for you other
than the PSA we'll keep you posted if
this continues to be a problem because
two units of different models affecting
to people who are linked directly is
it's kind of astronomical of chances
that you do wonder how high the RMA rate
really is so check back for more
subscribe as always go to store
documents access net to pick up stuff so
the guy that owns this can ship it to
you so that he can get a cut and afford
replacements in the future because it
might happen again we'll see I'll see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
