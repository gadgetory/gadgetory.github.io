safe and some of our post CES coverage
remarking that it had all the cleaned up
marks of a modern case but took no risks
with the case it now launched it's time
to see whether that opinion stands the
test of a build and the Corsair 500 D is
a $150 enclosure that repurposes parts
of the five Sony AX tooling but
introduces new paneling and styling to
the enclosure a $250 glass variation of
this case will ship one's front panel
yield issues are resolved and other than
some RGB LEDs and glass and fans it will
use the same tooling and largely be the
same enclosure but today we're focusing
on the Corsair 500 d version that we
have for thermals noise and build
quality before that this video is
brought to you by thermal grizzly makers
of the conductor not liquid metal that
we recently used to drop 20 degrees off
of our temperatures thermal grizzly also
makes traditional thermal compounds we
use on top of the IHS like cryo knot and
hydro knot pastes learn more at the link
below as usual let's go over the whole
case before getting into the build notes
and thermals and noise discussion first
of all it's obviously something of an
artistically styled case they have the
top panel that's got slight raises on
the sides and comes down in the middle
and it only has ventilation in the
center which is not ideal for thermals
but it looks kind of cool and that's
what they're going for
the front panel is aluminum out of this
version there will be a glass version
later for a lot more money but they also
I think include more fans that are going
to be RGB which further increases the
cost and for the doors this is probably
the best feature really these partly
come off of the project slate case from
Computex that was really more of a halo
effect than anything so these doors are
tinted tempered glass and they are able
to look curved without actually being
curved so courser does get credit for
that of course I was basically glued on
this aluminum front that's curved that
way towards the front panel and in doing
so they've saved themselves the trouble
of glass yield issues where bending a
glass panel increases your cost a lot
because you have to throw away a lot of
them or recycle them or whatever so
they've resolved the issue of curved
glass yield for the
or for the sides rather and they've
still managed to make it look like it's
curved so they get credit there the
panels are pretty easy to remove
vertically there's a screw on the top
right now to hold them in place you
remove the screw you pop it up panel
comes off internally the case is really
pretty simple overall and that's part of
the thing with this case is that it
doesn't really take any risk it's it's
kind of boring that's not necessarily
bad but taking risks is always
interesting for new products this panel
doesn't fully grip so this is something
they've done well and also not the panel
attaches via magnet to the case which is
pretty cool but also this magnet doesn't
align perfectly in the bottom corner
whereas if I tug at this one you'll see
it doesn't move until I apply enough
force to actually open the thing whereas
this one flexes a bit and the same is
true for the opposite side the top left
so the magnets don't align perfectly on
our samples maybe that's just a sampling
thing but either way let's go to the
panel I've taken the screw out so that
comes out pretty easily and inside the
case which is quite heavy with all the
stuff in it pretty expected layout for
the last year now there's a vertical GPU
mount which you absolutely should not
use with an open-face cooled card it's
probably fine with a reference sized
open-loop card but not open phase air so
there's vertical GPU mount there there's
a weird power supply shroud that feels
more like taking a box than providing
something because the thing with this is
you can evilly easily have a power
supply that comes out to here and
there's very little space lapse for your
cables at that point so you're going to
be removing this front of it which is
removable so that's good however if
you're doing that you really might as
well just get rid of the whole thing
since it kind of interferes with lower
PCIe slot utilization anyway and we've
typically found that power supply
shrouds do impact GPU thermals if you
have especially fans in the lower
position of the case not a big deal
though it just seems like the power
supply shroud is more of a taking a box
than anything so because of how empty
the rest of the enclosure is and because
this doesn't go all the way across it
doesn't really feel like it should be
there but that's more subjective than
objectively what I can show you is that
the front can fit three 120 millimeter
fans we currently have a weird
configuration in there for testing the
top can fit to 140 s the back has a 120
in it presently that can be adjusted
vertically if you needed to and a
feature that we like with the case is
the fan cages for the top and for the
front which we remove with two thumb
screws just like that then you can pull
it out and we've got the fan cables on
there now but the idea is that you can
really easily get the fans on to a
separate sheet of metal and then attach
that to the case just like that
obviously no not really don't do that
but you attach it like that so the
reason they've done that is because the
front panel is more or less not
removable so to get this panel off it's
two screws underneath one screw inside
that's not particularly accessible with
the power splice shroud and then two
tiny screws up here they've put a lot of
effort into making it difficult to take
that front panel off you can do it and
we did do it for testing but the point
stands that because there's no real
reason to take the front panel off there
needed to be a good way to mount the
fans to the front of the case so they
thought that through and we give them
credit for that because otherwise you'd
have to take out one two three four five
screws to get fans in and out of the
case so this is good they've done a good
job with this one other cool thing that
we did like was the filter installation
so the filters are attached by magnet
they slide out of the side of the case
this is something that we've been
hitting case manufacturers over the head
with for a few years now sliding out of
the back of the case is kind of dumb I
think they actually still do that with
the power splash shroud to the credit of
the manufacturers there's not a lot of
other places you can put this thing but
if it's coming out of the back of the
case you can safely assume most cases
are against a wall and now you're moving
your case to get the dust filter out
there are better ways to do that but
perhaps not with the way the feet are
positioned on this one or whatever
or doing a lawn filter that goes all the
way to the front of the cage point out
the front but either way this one's good
this is in the front and it means that
because there's no real reason to remove
the front panel you can still pop it out
to clean the filter the tops the same
way it's a little bit harder to remove
but you basically just push on it from
one side and then you pull it out and
there's your top filter so they've done
well with that speaking of the top panel
however it's very strange so it's got
this artistic arc to it if you like it
cool that's not really up to me to
decide they have a weird tessellated
pattern in the top I'm sure you can do
the math and show how much more
efficient holes would be instead
whatever that's clearly not the
intention of a top panel what is a bit
stranger though is that because the way
this is positioned you can tell that
this panel was somewhat designed around
the 570 X because if you look at the 570
X the glass is boosted up and that's
glass it's a it's a clean sheet of glass
on the top so they've kind of had to
design around those parameters and for
whatever reason it comes down lower in
the middle and it only has holes in the
middle so if you're planning to put a
radiator in the top you're seriously
restricting the airflow of that radiator
I mean obviously I would much prefer to
see this boost at higher or changed
completely because it's a strange setup
for a radiator it's not gonna work that
well but we can talk about thermals for
the rest the case as well for the set up
so the stock side up one 120 millimeter
fan front and center right in the middle
here it's splitting its air flow between
the GP and the CPU that has
traditionally never worked very well
however they have fan slots for more
fans you're probably buying this with an
extra fan if you go by our
recommendation or if you're going with
liquid coolers anyway the downside is
that it's $150 and you're buying an
extra fan that kind of sucks it's got
one 120 in the rear which is fine both
the fans are acceptable they're not the
worst fans we've worked with in cases
and there are some really bad ones but
they're decent it's just we wish there
was another one or if there were another
one then we'd really be getting close to
the 570 X configuration in which case
you're kind of wondering why does this
exist but the
sir is primarily because it does
actually slightly boost the height of
the case so that it can accommodate
fatter radiators and it also changes the
design completely so there is a reason
for this case to exist the tooling is
familiar that's fine it's pretty normal
for tooling to get reused that's how you
profit as long as there are significant
changes elsewhere and clearly there are
for the front panel the front panel
actually does have significant spacing
here we have more than what we typically
recommend for spacing once you close the
glass though it does chew through some
of the extra space in the side of the
front panel
but as we'll show in testing the panel
is not nearly as bad as a lot of the
others we've seen in the past year it's
still not great but because it's full
top-to-bottom openness not even a mesh
it's just completely open about an inch
or so there's enough room for the fans
to breathe reasonably you know again
it's not like a red line o6 but it's
okay going through some of Patrick's
notes here for the build and appearance
section of the review which he has
written in the article links in the
description below
Patrick notes that the chassis of the
500d is only a slightly modified version
of the 570 X the case that we gave a
quality build award back in 2016 but
that doesn't give this one free pass the
exterior panels are often what make or
break the performance of a case anyway
we'll discuss that in the thermal
section as for looks Corsair has
successfully adapted old tool into a new
model without obvious compromises other
than some cutouts around the edges that
were clearly intended for steel side
panels on the left side of the case but
those aren't visible with the case
closed the side panels are completely
identical and more or less
interchangeable which probably benefits
Corsair as much as it does consumers at
the front there are rubber wrapped
magnets that clamp firmly onto the case
when they work they work well but the
manufacturing tolerances are very fine
and not all the magnets on our case made
strong enough contact with the case
metal that said once it's closed as long
as you're not moving it around they're
fine they closed securely enough when
stationary the side panels complement
the curved front panel which is brushed
aluminum on the version we're reviewing
here but is made of tempered glass in
the upcoming special edition
presumably contributing to a
much higher cost there are intentional
gaps all around the side panels but
especially at the front where there's
about a centimeter of empty space on
either side of the front panel for
airflow it's a no mesh front but it's
better than some we've seen behind the
motherboard tray the kale management
channel has some excellent cable tie
points with velcro straps pre-attached
something we've always liked and there's
also a gutter shaped piece of steel
designed to clamp over and contain all
the cables it's a good idea but it's a
tight fit for everything to get in there
and once it's installed every cable must
go through this channel in order to get
the cutouts usable we use the bare
minimum of cables in our test bench but
if we added any more they probably
wouldn't fit we'd have to remove the
kale management bar to better fit
because otherwise it's blocking off the
channeling this is all necessary because
the side panels are both transparent so
messy cables would be fully visible and
because the side panel is just held on
with magnets and doesn't really have the
force to squash down the wad of cables
there is extra need to manage everything
cleanly get into the thermal section to
fans is pretty underwhelming for $150
case the non LED courser sp1 20s look
and feel decent but we've tested many
cases by now with one intake and one
exhaust configurations and they've never
done especially well for additional
tests we did the usual no front panel a
vertical GPU and an additional Noctua NF
a14 fan added to the front top of the
case vertical GPU mounting was difficult
as frequently as the case with this
configuration because we've got a tower
cooler for the CPU and an extra-wide GTX
1080 sometimes there's space but
Corsairs at vertical PCIe slots were too
high for the card to fit properly this
time
and we took a zip-tie approach just for
thermal testing we obviously wouldn't
recommend it for normal use this would
be better suited to a reference size
card and as we've stated it constantly
for open-loop configurations we can
still test it thermally though taking
the front panel off was also one of our
tests it's not the easiest thing to do
but it's okay on this case for the
additional fantast we chose to move the
stock fan to the top slot in the front
and put the nock to a fan in the middle
simply because that was the easiest
layout to use for the mountain
hols looking at a chart first only with
the 500 d before we getting into the
comparative data cv temperature in our
tortured test averaged fifty six point
seven degrees celsius over ambient
removing the front panel lowered to this
thanks to the less obstructed airflow
but only by five point six degrees to
fifty one point one degrees we've seen
much more dramatic shifts with the front
panel removals before indicating that
there is reasonable airflow through the
side venting on this case but also that
there's a limited intake anyway given
that we're based on one fan the top
panel is ventilated so it's possible
that the cpu cooler could be drawing
some cool air through it even without
the front panel removed adding an extra
140 millimeter fan brought CBO
temperature down to fifty one point
seven degrees within margin of error of
the panelists test vertically mounting
the GPU resulted in a lower than stock
fifty three point six degrees celsius
cpu temperature but we've seen this
behavior multiple times in the past
airflow patterns change and the GPU
isn't able to dump heat as efficiently
which overall means that there's less
warm air next to and below the CPU
cooler the radiative heat off the
backplate of the GPU is also now more
distant from the CPU cooler thus
reducing the cpu temperature
comparatively for CPU tortured thermals
fifty six point seven degrees can't
quite compete with the five seventy X's
fifty point two degrees but adding the
one forty millimeter fan almost gets
there the five seventy X has three
intake fans but no exhaust and exhaust
fans do benefit our CPU cooler a good
deal with the stock configuration CB
temperature is average to below average
around the level of the KL zero seven or
even the age 500 P and thus far there's
really nothing spectacular about the
cooling performance of this case
baseline GPU torture temperature average
fifty seven point three degrees Celsius
taking off the front panel lowered this
to fifty two point eight degrees which
again isn't that drastic a reduction
compared to something like the H five
hundred P or some other case that more
seriously restricts airflow mounting the
GPU vertically raised it to sixty three
point two degrees a surprising nobody
this was also after accounting for
throttling so our frequencies that were
lower and our temperature was still
higher
mounting next to a side panel is never
good for GPU air coolers and that goes
double for this case there of course are
instances where it's okay but those
would require spacing between the panel
and the GPU not something present in
this particular enclosure adding the
nock to a fan raise the GPU temperature
to sixty point seven degrees which we
found attributable to the change in air
flow patterns by relocating the higher
pressure 120 millimeter fans at the top
and installing the nock to a fan more
centered on the GPU thus pushing more
air over the backplate than previously
rather than straight into the face of
the card so these numbers do in fact
make sense despite the fact that it's
slightly higher it's because we changed
which fan was where comparatively GPU
temperature isn't good there are cases
on the chart with absolutely awful
thermals that averaged more than 60
degrees but at 57 point three degrees
the 500d is still in the company of the
pure base 600 and the n1 805 eye both of
which we criticized for poor cooling the
best way to improve this with an
air-cooled GPU would be to add a fan at
the bottom of the front panel rather
than the top or just fill all three fans
lots at which point you've created a 570
X and that posted a GPU temperature of
fifty one point three degrees this is
practically on the opposite end of the
chart at this point and shows that the
570 X which this one is based off of was
still a reasonable case and it's really
not that different in price either the
looks are quite different though like
the Mesha phi you'd have to add more
fans to make this case better the fire
strike extreme test got GPU temperature
to about sixty point six degrees Celsius
because our 3d mark chart is smaller and
doesn't include the always awful
vertical GPU numbers that means the 500
D is tied for worst score with an Tek p8
impressive one fan splitting airflow
above and below the GPU backplate never
works especially well and at least one
additional intake fan correctly
positioned is a good idea for the 500 D
CPU rendering with blender resulted in a
CPU temperature of 38 point one degrees
Celsius over ambient that's right in the
middle of the charge between the H 700 I
and the C 700 P
the two stock fans are positioned with a
bias toward cooling the CPU so although
there isn't much airflow through the
whole case CV temperatures are
acceptable in all of these tests
rendering on the GPU the 500d did better
comparatively than it did in the fire
strike test thirty point five degrees
over ambient is still on the warm end of
the chart but it's just about equal to
the stock match up I see and definitely
cooler on the Antec p8 and Corsair spec
for the blender test doesn't push the
GPU to its complete limits and doesn't
strain the CPU like our gaming stand in
3d mark does so it provides an example
of temperatures to be expected with a
normal production workload as opposed to
a gaming workload moving on to noise now
the relatively small fan diameter and
the front panel air gaps that are
pointed directly towards the user make
the 500d a bit louder than it could be
but there are still only two fans they
don't make as much noise as something
like the 570 X 37.4 DBA isn't again as
loud as the 570 X was with three front
intake fans at full speed and instead
falls closer to the 270 R and the spec
for both from Corsair which respectively
had two and one 120 millimeter stock
fans case manufacturers have to balance
quality and quantity of stock fans of
the final price of the product the best
case scenario for enthusiasts is a case
that includes a small number of high
quality fans so that the stock fans
don't need to be replaced and the user
can shop for their own additional fans
that's only good if it's reflected in
the price though the 500d is $30 at less
than the 570 X which has more or less
the same chassis and an additional fan
in a setup that's more beneficial to
cooling for our particular case that
we're testing today or our configuration
anyway so the 500 d would probably look
better in value without the reference
point of Corsair zone 570 X but the
looks are very different if you like all
glass the 570 X obviously is a winner
over this one if you don't like that
look well there's plenty of other
options so speaking of other options
there are a lot of good cases
at $150 this one although not really
impressive isn't offensive either it's
just it doesn't doesn't do anything
really other than change the looks of
things there's nothing new about the
case they have a lot of good ideas that
have been applied to the case but
they're not new ideas there are also
some kind of weird or nearly bad ideas
that we've already gone through in the
thermal section so it's it's okay
it's just in the middle of everything
and there are a lot of good cases at
that price so to go over some of them
this case is competing with things like
the be quiet dark bass 700 the high
airflow Silverstone cases like the PM oh
one that we liked a lot or the PMO two
that we didn't like as much and these
examples are less than $150 all of them
and they're all pretty good cases that
we've liked but they're in the same
ballpark the 500d looks nice and
performs okay but for its price we'd
expect something just better like
something something to make it more
desirable or to stand out more than its
competition the special edition of this
case which will be like $100 more or
somewhere around there will provide that
something specific to stand out for
people and that will be done with its
curved tempered glass and apparently
some extra fans that I think are going
to be RGB again though that's $250 so
now you're competing with things like
the dark Bass Pro 900 the weird cases
like the Cougar conquer you're getting
into kind of artisan territory or very
near it so courses positioned in a
fiercely competitive market right now
the 100 plus dollar case market has not
been this competitive in years and for
that this case is going to have a hard
time fighting again it's not bad just in
terms of build quality it's quite good
they've definitely gotten that down for
the most part we only really had one
build quality defect and that was the
panel not quite closing which is minor
you're not going to be picking the thing
up and moving it a lot so quality wise
it's fine they've done some really cool
stuff we like like the detachable fan
panel
it's just that thermally you basically
should buy better fans or more fans that
we used to go with it and even though if
there are more SP 120 so they're fine if
you had more of them or run a liquid
cooler or something like that that comes
with fans which is probably what they're
gearing towards but the price should at
least reflect it I think their price is
high because it's got aluminum brush
panels and a lot of tempered glass so
yeah you're paying for looks and if
that's what you want it's okay but
that's more or less what this case boils
down to it doesn't excite us it doesn't
offend us there are certainly cases that
