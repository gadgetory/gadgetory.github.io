episode of ask Gianna's always leave
your questions in the comments below but
quick note here there's a new rule I
guess we'll call it because there are so
many questions on these videos now I'm
still reading every single comment for
asked G on videos but it would help me
tremendously if you could upvote and
downvote the comments with questions
that you think deserve most to be
answered I'm still going to go through
all of them so it'll be as democratic as
possible but it just will make my job a
lot easier because then I'll immediately
know okay this is what people are
interested in this week so please do
that I got to get the cat hair off the
table
we've got a video on o cat that just
went up working on more of it so that's
still in flux but let's start off with
the sgn content so for the first
question we've got one from covenant 11
who says dear GN what is it about Crysis
3 that keeps benchmark junkies using it
as a benchmark even though even as we
approach the four year anniversary of
its release what features and options is
it about the engine that keeps this game
by pushing the hardware Crysis is
definitely abusive in a lot of ways in
terms of visual effects and
the geometry all kinds of stuff in there
tessellation so that's one reason we
don't really use it I know that at least
a couple outlets use it for maximum
power load testing staring out of skybox
is power draw a different way but it
does put a lot of strain on the GPU on
the system and in total so for a couple
of reasons it's good to keep around to
old games if you worked on Crysis years
ago when it came out and you've worked
on it since then it's not a bad thing to
keep around and the same is true for us
with Metro last light within the past
grid Autosport that lived on our
benchmarks for years and a couple of
other games as well shadow of Mordor
some people sometimes will ask why did
you guys waste waste your time
benchmarking shadow of Mordor and Metro
last light no one plays them that's not
really the point we benchmark games like
GTA Battlefield Gears of War or whatever
happens to be new so that you can see
what the performance is on a game that
you play
but games like Metro and shadow of
mordor we keep around so we have a look
backwards in time and that can be used
later for really important things for
example let's say we wanted to do a
driver benchmark where we're looking at
how do the drivers impact performance of
these cards maybe the 700 and the 200
series cards over the period of three
years or whatever it may be we can do
that with Metro last light in shadow
board or because I've already got all
that data I don't have to sit there and
pull drivers from three years ago and
rerun it all we have all the data on the
same platforms even so that's pretty
useful now it's also useful because with
these games two more reasons one they're
never updated so you don't have to worry
about a sudden game patch like with doom
just requiring that you rerun all tests
which really really sucks but it's
important to do because when a patch
comes out and it increases and changes
performance obviously you can't recycle
your old data we talked about this in a
previous video but or you could but you
shouldn't if you're comparing new data
with it so we try to keep the data the
same age as much as possible and using
older games helps with that and mix in a
few newer games that are popular at the
time another reason you would use Crysis
3 as a benchmark is because Crysis 3 or
for us Metro last like both games we
know very well where a particular card
should fall on the chart based on just
sort of intuition with benchmark you
know all the other cards so if I know
this card has X shaders xq2 cores or
stream processors whatever has X shaders
and it has Y memory it has the whatever
else clock rate I know it should fall
between these three cards so that's a
really powerful tool for benchmarking
and for figuring out rapidly if your
numbers look good because more cat hair
if the numbers don't like it we just
shot a video a snowflake on a table
because if the numbers don't look good
you want to find out immediately that
way you're not wasting your time running
through all the other benchmarks so
that's probably why some I would still
use Crysis 3 I never jumped on it when
it was
because we weren't really doing that yet
but Metro is kind of my equivalent of
shadow of a crisis 3 and in shadow of
mordor is in there as well
though we've kind of moved away from
that recently next question is absent
who says do you think the price of mlc
and TLC nand will continue to rise into
2017 and beyond prices keep climbing
with no end in sight it seems so this is
a topic that comes up pretty much every
two years and it's normally with Ram but
kind of the same boat with SSDs it's
just as if these are more visible now
than they used to be this is not
something I have studied as closely as
other outlets and I'll give a shout out
here at Toms Hardware has probably the
best article on these SSD NAND prices
I'm not going to go ahead and try and
compete with them you can just check
their article on that for information if
you search Tom's hardware that says
demand prices I'm sure it'll be top
result so what they were saying and all
of this I agree with is that adoption
and mobile and notebook and in desktop
is at an all-time high for NAT and if
you don't know what Nanda is we have a
video on it that explains what it is as
animations and everything but basically
because one prices are lower than were
prices were lower than ever for SSDs and
two in notebooks and laptops you can
decrease the size you get a smaller form
factor you decrease the power
consumption pretty considerably
considering what's actually in there and
how it's already low power consumption
our hard drive 2.5 inch drive even at
five volts is still drawing a decent
amount of power compared to the rest of
the components when the when an SSD
might be a watt or less if it's idle so
that's a big reason and I guess well
speed of course so because of these
things and because SSDs have kind of
proven themselves in the market now
there's a lot more people buying them
for desktop but there's a tremendous
amount of NAND being Huston phones right
now and NAND being used in just flash
memory being used in notebooks basically
every Mac notebook and a good deal of
Windows or learning
or whatever any other notebook out there
but especially Apple right now
so with that your prices are gonna go up
and it doesn't it's I don't have an end
in sight I'm sorry
so Tom's talks about it a bit more you
can read more there for information next
question is Chris Arellano Arellano aka
hell guide and I suppose who says what's
the oldest processor you have lying
around and what did it come out of where
did it come from I still have one from
my first PC a Pentium MMX 233 and it's
funny to look at now compared to current
stuff first first to note we did a tour
of the Computer History Museum in
Mountain View California you should
definitely search for a computer history
museum on our channel because I was
joined by Jim Vincent who is for all
intents and purposes a computer
historian he's been in this industry for
eons and he's been programming since the
start so he talks in that video about
some really old processors and that's
kind of fun we go through like the Cray
supercomputer era and before it even the
one the oldest stuff I have I have an X
386 system somewhere in an attic but the
oldest one that's actually accessible
and ready to use it would probably be a
Pentium 4 from around I want to say 2004
maybe 2 that somewhere in 2003 to 2005
area and that processor I keep around
because it was the to my knowledge the
first consumer available hyper threaded
CPU there might have been one other one
but I think that was the first one at
least that was in my price range at the
time so that is a Pentium 4 or something
I don't have the Mach number hyper
threaded so it was the first poor-man's
dual-core basically that was really
available and I think from memory it had
quite a few issues at launch but I think
they kind of smooth that smoothed it
over it was an interesting time that was
not far off from when Andy put out their
Athlon 64 which just recently I reread
the review on an attack or a non tech
about the 64-bit Athlon see you the
Athlon 64 because it's actually a really
critical point in history I didn't know
a lot about it cuz I was really in into
the detailed part of computers at that
point so I want to reread it and learn
from a historical perspective what it
did it's a good article you should read
it if you haven't but yeah my old stone
probably Pentium 4 with hyper-threading
and I don't know it's a p-series chipset
I think I still got the system too it
was in an antic land boy maybe not the
land boy air that came out in the last
few years but a land boy the silver one
with the blue plastic grille thing on
the front and the tray and it that held
screws so if you ever tipped it upside
down it would dump all the screws into
your case and short something that was
the case it was in next question Tek
Pascal he says thanks again for
answering my previous question my new
question is how our games optimized and
what determines if a game is poorly
optimized for example Ark survival
barely runs at 60 frames per second on
my Titan XP at 1080 P max settings
that's really I didn't have not tested
that game
that's impressive in some ways I guess
is this due to poorly Optimus for
optimization of the game or is the game
that graphically demanding how can you
tell a few things so on the graphics
side a lot of optimization all the most
optimization HAP's that happens at the
developer house and some of it happens
in the drivers especially for older
older API is like the x11 where there's
more driver side optimization how can
you tell well if you look at things like
geometry how smooth are the objects in
the game the models how detailed are
they you can look at meshes so in GTA 5
if you scale the mesh quality you'll see
on top of some cars like jeeps we just
note Andrew the camera guy just noticed
this yesterday in our Reliv versus
shadow play video you should go watch
that and you'll see on top of the Jeep
there's some headlights and they're not
there on the AMD device and that's not
because we change the settings but it's
because of a mesh quality tuning feature
that Andy has and the drivers we'll talk
about later but the point is that's part
of the mesh quality so if you were to
scale settings back those types of
things would disappear so in your games
you can look up these really
objects like that like headlights or in
black ops 3 from memory I remember there
was a tank and you lost some of the
roundness of the turret on the tank
because it's not like an actual thing
that's used in the game so you're really
not supposed to pay attention to it but
if you stare at it and you change the
mesh quality it'll turn more square as
you go those types of thins
impact the performance because the more
primitives you have the more Poly's you
have the more tessellation there is the
heavier it's gonna hit your GPU and
that's pretty easy to look at and tell a
lot of the other things you could look
at like how smooth are the shadows if
it's for scene anti-aliasing and stuff
like that some games for say a texture
resolution some games will go crazy with
texture resolutions and do like 4k
textures when it's totally unnecessary
for something like a chair so it looks
freakin great if you go like prone and
stare at the chair leg but totally
unnecessary so that kind of stuff does
eat into vram specifically with texture
resolution and then the rest of it like
geometry that's really heavy on the
shaders post-processing stuff kind of
happens at the end of the pipeline as
the name would suggest the rasterization
is is in there as well we have video and
already calling that now as far as the
optimization side of things it is
largely the game developers job to
figure out how do I make this look good
and keep this quality but not make it
kill my computer or my client or my
customers computer whatever maybe so
what they can do there's software like a
logarithmic which works they actually I
think they're represented by the same
firm that represents F mod if you've
seen that logo it's for audio but
software like that will help developers
to do things like build textures that
have multiple basically sample sizes
multiple resolutions that can easily be
deployed so you have really good LOD
scaling level of detail scaling so what
happens is as they build one texture and
effectively an infinite resolution
almost a vector like box they can save
it out and it can be saved at a 16 K 4 K
2 K 256 and all the way down the chart
so that lower end hardware is better
supported so that's optimization on the
game side
you can also do things like call useless
triangles called primitives call the
really anything that's either not going
to be seen or appreciated by the player
get rid of it and that's again on the
developers side so that's where
optimization was in driver's side
the driver developers which would be the
IH visa or Nvidia AMD they go through
and they say the way that this developer
is executing this particular effect
doesn't work well with our shaders in
the way that the architecture is
structured around them and so we are
going to change it so that it executes
this way that's how it happens on the
driver side next question is from
stealth v to ths stealth one says
question what kind of lifespan should
people expect to closed-loop liquid
coolers I've had a coarser h100 since
2013 s been running great when should I
consider replacement are there any signs
to be on the lookout for such as pump
failure originally had this on the 3770k
and now in the 6700 K yeah so we talked
about this briefly in the past as well
but just refresh everyone a lot of the
ASA tech coolers have a bit of a
lifespan of about five years that's
pretty much the industry standard the
new ng oxy cracking coolers have a
warranty of six years you can actually
expect them to last that long and
basically though it sits around five
years plus or minus 1 depending on which
supplier and which generation of pump
you go with for science to look out for
that's the important part you should
probably if you have this is what I do
because I'm a little paranoid about
liquid coolers because we've worked with
so many I've seen probably three or four
fail at this point and it does they work
great nothing works better than an AI oh
if you want something fast cheap to
deploy and way better than air for the
most part there's some exceptions but
good AIO
will be better than decent air good air
even so when I deploy them I set up at
least something like speed fan but
ideally use a bit more advanced software
but speed fan of the least is free and
it does check the core temperature a
little inaccurate with AMD that's that's
just also
at this point it doesn't necessarily
read the and the temperatures perfectly
Intel works fine AMD I need to research
still but generally you'll at least at
the very least even with AMD it is
inaccurate
in a consistent way I don't know how
much that assault rivers is AMD and what
they have on their chip for diodes but
the point is it's inaccurate in the same
way and so if you're seeing a
temperature even on AMD Hardware that's
like let's it often reports below
ambient for me so let's say it says the
temperature is 20 C probably not real
but whatever let's say it is and that's
what it says for the entire three years
use the cooler one day it says 40 C well
you know there's a problem and the thing
you can do with a cooler best thing you
do monitor temperatures occasionally and
listen for noise when it starts making a
lot of pump noise there could be a few
things one you might have a tubes
oriented incorrectly and check the
manual for that or two it could be that
the liquid has begun permeating the
tubes and that's just what happens with
these the liquid it it doesn't
necessarily evaporate but it permeates
into the rubber and so the the plastic
or the rubber tubing over time will pull
enough of that liquid out of the actual
loop that it starts to lose its
performance the pump has to work in ways
that it wasn't designed to work and you
get pump noise normally Gergely and
things like that and that will happen
with some of the like the kraken x41
series a so tech coolers made some of
that gurgling and on and off throughout
life no matter what even if they're fine
so don't be too alarmed but if you hear
it a lot then maybe look into a
replacement you can also touch the tubes
near where they connect to the pump and
if they feel hot it really should not
feel hot if it feels like it's about the
same temperature as the backplate of
your video card then it's time for
replacement because that means either
one its operating way out of spec you
need a better cooler anyway or to the
pumps just not really working anymore
and it's not pushing the liquid through
fast enough to cool down on the radiator
it sits there in the tubes and heats up
really fast so that's what you can look
out for I'm sure there's
things but that's that's the short ride
