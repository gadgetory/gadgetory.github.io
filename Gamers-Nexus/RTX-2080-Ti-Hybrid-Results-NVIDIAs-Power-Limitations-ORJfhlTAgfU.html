and videocard since the GTX 1080
launched later with a 1080i we've done
work with the 980ti hybrid actual cards
from EVGA and generally the takeaway has
been that reducing the thermal Headroom
limitations often created by the
reference coolers even these the non
blower ones reducing those limitations
significantly improved the clock
boosting Headroom which enabled greater
performance and a lot of the Adhan board
partner models that do better than
reference it's because they are better
cooled not naturally because they're pre
overclocked so today we are doing that
again with the 2080 ti that says 2080
we're doing with the 2080 ti there are a
lot of cards and pieces right now and
seeing what what the limitation is
because probably gonna be power this
time because NVIDIA has changed things
quite a bit for this generation before
that this video is brought to you by
EVGA SRT X 20 atti XE ultra video card
we recently use this to beat our
founders edition overclocking results
with its additional power target
Headroom and cooling capabilities the XE
Ultra uses a 2.7 extra thick heatsink
for a quiet operation under low loads
but also maintains higher clocks on
average over the FE model learn more at
the link in the description below so we
stuck it be quiet to ATC I'll see you on
there and we used fans for airflow over
the vrm and vram you actually don't need
any kind of heatsink on the v RM or the
memory modules on these cards in a test
bench where you can blast thousands of
rpm worth of air at the Bayer modules in
a case you should probably have heat
sinks or fitting stacks or something
because it does get quite hot actually
we found that the memory tested and this
chart won't be in here but has to just
bear with no fans on it at all just just
a liquid cooler on the GPU nothing on
the memory or the vrm found that the
memory was hitting about 90 C which is
about spec so obviously we added some
fans after that we stuck to on there for
the most part 1 on the top exhausting
one in front angle intake blasting
straight into all the hot components
then we had some airflow from the CLC
attach the card as well testing today
the primary focus is going to be on
their own performance versus frequency
performance we're using 3d mark and fur
mark for that and then we also have some
game benchmarks to see if lifting the
thermal limitation gives us any
additional boosting Headroom that
actually benefits us in games typically
the answer is is worth doing because
typically we get anywhere from 5 to even
upwards of 9% and a couple of our past
tests with either vago or the Pascal
series cards and so that's worth doing a
hybrid mod but it's a lot different
these days because we're power limited
to about 15 amps down the PCIe cables
starting strictly with frequency will
help best illustrate the performance
characteristics of our hybrid mod we'll
get two thermals momentarily but first
for this test we're using 3d mark
firestrike extreme on a frozen frame to
render the same data repeatedly with
both cards that left completely stock
aside from the cooling differences we
noted that the hybrid card was able to
sustain clocks were on 1920 to 1930 5
megahertz with a flatline more or less
from start to finish
plus or minus 15 the fact that there is
no immediate drop-off at the start of
the test illustrates that there's a
frequency benefit from a cooler core the
stock card meanwhile air-cooled
experienced frequency decay from 1940
micro Hertz down to around 1775
megahertz where it's at for the rest of
the test the total difference in clocks
is about 160 megahertz which may as well
be an overclock at this point that's a
lot of frequency loss to thermals and
NVIDIA steps its frequency curve based
upon temperature starting as low as the
40s or 50s Celsius and scaling up to 63
degrees sorry 9 degrees 84 degrees 87
degrees and so on where you drop some
frequency each step of the way better
coolers will sustain higher clocks it
doesn't have to be a liquid cooler
either but it would be tough to beat the
GPU core thermals that we managed here
well look if those in a moment before
the thermals though here's what it looks
like when we add an overclocked line to
the chart we were able to sustain a
highly stable 2130 megahertz clock once
we found stability you'll see a few
crashes in there from when we were
finding the limits the all-time peak was
2175 megahertz and then we stabilized
for a little while at 20 145 but the
application crashed shortly thereafter
firm stable frequency of 21 30 megahertz
was possible in fire strike with the new
cooling solution that's a major jump
over the air-cooled card but whether or
not it gets leveraged in games will
heavily lean on when the power limits
are encountered let's look next at the
same test as the previous two charts
except this time from the perspective of
thermal results on the GPU die only we
can look at vrm and vram temperatures
next note that for this chart we heavily
controlled ambient temperature and
monitored it every second data is
presented with a constant ambient
temperature the air cooled card sits at
a near constant 75 degrees Celsius plus
or minus 2 degrees the hybrid managed a
42 degree constant temperature with
occasional fluctuations also plus or
minus to see the overclocked variant
pushed to 45 degrees but stop there and
is very impressive in its thermal
positioning and for individual component
temperatures on the next chart we saw
the GPU core dropped to 18 degrees delta
T over ambient again that is over
ambient which was about 22 degrees
Celsius during this testing the vrm
temperature averaged for our hybrid mod
and fir mark was 60 point 8 degrees over
ambient with the memory temperature at
40 point 8 degrees also over ambient
these temperatures were achieved
entirely with just a ton of air cooling
we had two fans pointed directly at the
VR m and V RAM during this test
illustrating that heat sinks are
actually not necessary with sufficient
airflow we'd still advise heat sinks
especially inside of a case but they are
not wholly necessary in the right
environment the stock air cooled card
averaged a 52 degree over ambient core
temperature and 50 degree vrm
temperature also over ambient with
memory at 58 degrees Celsius over
ambient F 1 2018 is up now this game
uses Codemasters ego engine and is
useful for a heavily GPU intensive title
it's also our only racing game
representation at 4k the hybrid mod 102
FPS average managing a lead barely
outside of error margins when put
against the air-cooled founders edition
the difference is about three percent
it's entirely limited by power at this
point we're pegged to 15 amps down the
PCIe cables for both the air cooled and
liquid cooled versions of the
card overclocking gives us some extra
room but results in a tie with the
air-cooled overclock this limitation is
resultant of power limitations again we
can only really circumvent that with
shunt mods or something similar at this
point like higher-end board partner
cards with a bigger power limit but
Nvidia still restricts that to some
extent just in case you were wondering
1440p is the same situation hybrid mod
pushes about 4% faster frame rate than
the 2080 TI f e not impressive for the
amount of work involved and ultimately a
power limitation once again we're stuck
at 15 amps down the PCIe cables not
counting what's drawn through the PCIe
slot
we recently praised Sniper Elite 4 for
its impressive scalability from the
team's in-house asura engine and proper
dx12 implementation unfortunately it
also posts 0 meaningful scaling showing
hard power limits and killing all hope
for thermal differences triggering
meaningful clock boosts that actually
impact performance far cry 5 is next
this one uses the dunia engine and is
commonly GPU bottlenecks particularly at
higher resolutions the game is also
running a representation of a DX 11
title at 4k the r-tx 2080 TI fe operates
at 74 FPS average with the hybrid model
evan t 6 FPS average we see zero scaling
when both are over clocks have plus 200
megahertz core and plus 850 memory the
scaling has vanished as we've bumped
against a hard power limitation 1440p
posts the same thing we're hitting power
limits more than thermal limits despite
the stock hybrid card outperforming the
stock air-cooled card by 2.7 percent
overclocking both ends up fully limited
by power shadow of the Tomb Raider is
the last one will bother showing this is
a modified crystal engine game on DX 12
we have other games benchmarked as well
like GTA ashes but results scaling is
identical between these and all of the
others it'd be boring to show 20 minutes
of charts that are power limited suffice
to say the hybrid model helps marginally
for this generations reference card
we simply need more power as for Tomb
Raider though at 4k the numbers are
nearly identical for both stock hybrid
and air-cooled cards and the overclocked
variants alike no meaningful change from
thermal advantage
so there's your answer completely not
worth it even a water block for everyone
who is like oh why not just use a water
block well that wouldn't matter either
because the temperatures gonna be about
the same in fact temperature for what we
did is probably lower because we're not
sinking the heat of the vrm and vrm as
well it's just the GPU so it doesn't
matter it doesn't matter what block you
use because I mean if you're just going
for silence that's one thing but if
you're going for maximum overclocking
Headroom it's irrelevant there's a
massive power limitation which is
interesting because the PCB that goes to
these cards the ti especially it's the
best PCB that Nvidia is done on a
consumer card that I can remember it can
take a lot of power they've capped it
where it doesn't need to be capped where
it is the PCB the vrm can take it the
GPU can take it so we're not exactly
sure why they did it perhaps maybe the
GPU does start to have problems in terms
of longevity we don't know exactly how
the process ages or how the how this
particular GPU and architecture age is
under different thermal and voltage
conditions but the vrm for sure can
handle it and it just says overclockers
even it kills the card we'd like to have
the ability to push more power into it
anyway
but that's kind of beside the point so
yeah not worth it water block if you're
doing it because you know you'd like
water cooling or you like the silence
that liquid provides sure those are
completely valid reasons but it's not
really a great idea to do liquid cooling
specifically to get additional
overclocking or boosting Headroom
because you're not gonna get any so not
worth it there the biggest limitations
power there are reference PCBs from EVGA
like the XC ultra that have a v bios
version that lets you get an extra seven
percent power or so but that's not that
much and liquid cooling it's not gonna
get you anything really significantly
better anyway now there are thermal
steps for frequency at something like
the there's one at 63 degrees one at 79
83 or 487 and so forth so lower
temperature does help a bit but just not
enough because you're constantly hitting
the power limitation all the time so
biggest problem here is power limit not
a hundred percent sure why and video
said it where they did will try and ask
them and maybe find out most likely
their excuse is that it's probably for
longevity of the card maybe for health
of the die something like that which
would be valid if true we just don't
have a good way to validate that and
finally if you do have a custom board
and we have some like the Asus ones we
got MSI's in we have some others so if
you have custom boards that allow more
power throughput then yeah those would
be better liquid cooling candidates but
the cooler some those are already pretty
good anyway so we'll be looking at those
more in the future but the next thing to
do with the hybrid card that we built is
probably just short the shunts and see
if shorting the shunt resistors gets us
any additional power Headroom it should
but probably not a lot so that's it for
