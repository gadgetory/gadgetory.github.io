Nexus net and we are testing a power
supply today in this basic PC hardware
guide we're going to use a paperclip a
green wire and a black wire to test the
power supply and make sure it turns on
some power supplies will need to be put
under load but I'll get to that in a
second so first make sure your power
supply is completely unplugged just for
safety purposes there's really not much
risk of getting shocked here but for
safety purposes I would advise you to
unplug it and completely turn off
everything turn off the switch on the
back find your green plug and your our
green cable excuse me and your black
cable which is ground and we are going
to connect the green cable and the black
cable via paperclip to jump them
together and once they're connected
which I'm doing right now you see I have
them connected in the 24 pin or 20+4 pin
connector rather and once those are
together you can pretty easily just plug
the power supply in like normally of
course there are there's only one way to
plug it in which takes me two or three
tries at least so we're going to plug
that in put that cable aside and then
simply flip the switch and you'll see
the fan spins up hopefully the YouTube
quality isn't too bad but the you should
see the fan spinning right now and then
I'll go ahead and disable it and bring
that a little bit closer so you can see
it better now what I want to say is some
power supplies won't respond to this
technique I think the OC Z's power
supply specifically won't because they
need to be put under load otherwise they
just won't even turn on so if that is
the case with yours I have a trick
coming up that will basically plug in
some fans and put it under a tiny bit of
load just a couple watts
that way we can be sure that it's
working this is not a extremely
definitive test in terms of checking to
see if the the right wattage is being
supplied or to make sure the power
supplies you know completely functional
it is a good test though just to narrow
down your options if you if you have
some kind of failure along the line if
your computer is not starting up this
will help you tell you know hey is it my
power supply as my motherboard what's
going on here so this is a great always
a great start when you're
troubleshooting your PC
and it's very easy so now you can see
I'm grabbing the molex for pin 2 3 pin
fan adapter I'm going to plug that into
the fan that I pulled out of my CPU
heatsink yesterday which is in the
previous video and it is a very fast fan
so I plug those in then we're just going
to skip ahead here while I fumble
through for the right wire and we
connect the molex connectors and then
we'll just do the same test again except
this time with a fan and as I said ocz
normally is the one that causes trouble
some others do as well you may need a
couple fans you might even want to plug
your hard drive in there it's it's just
plugging into the power supply and then
turn it on it doesn't need to be in a
system or anything like that
just needs to spin up so here we go I'm
reconnecting the green and the black
wire as you can see and it has three
green and black as I said there's
minimal risk of shock because these
power supplies are designed specifically
not to cause those problems but you want
to be safe then unplug everything and do
it just like I did there and sometimes
capacitors can store charge so you might
want to use pliers if you want to be
ultra safe but again you should be
pretty in the clear here so we see that
it turns on perfectly with the fan then
spins up and this is actually the first
time I tested this fan so it was a good
way for me to see how fast and how loud
is this fan in comparison to my
replacement fan and the answer is it is
a very fast and it is actually really
quiet I think my new one's a little bit
a little bit slower and and about the
same noise level but I explained that
last video so there you have it that's
how you test the power supply hopefully
that helped someone out and as always
like this video if it helps you please
subscribe to our Channel I can besides
that enough subscribing really helps us
make more videos a lot of you who have
subscribed from the last video so I
appreciate that keep subscribing keep
liking comment on videos will help you
out wherever possible I'll see you guys
next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
