at one of the first things you'd seen at
the show so this is really cool last
year we spoke with kingpin at the ebj
headquarters and we're back now talking
about something that at that time wasn't
done yet but this is a hybrid sort of
closed-loop ish solution for liquid
nitrogen cooling where basically we've
got two tanks on either side of this
system and it's feeding in so there's a
CPU block and a GPU block and same ideas
open loop water cooling except it's
liquid nitrogen so that's what we talked
about today pretty cool for overclock
and as I understand it kingpins actually
using this for his real benchmarking so
this isn't just the show system it's the
real thing before that this video is
brought to you by thermal Grizzly's
high-end thermal paste and liquid metal
thermal Grizzly's cryo knot is an
affordable high quality thermal compound
that doesn't face some of the aging
limitations of other pastes on the
market cryo knot has a thermal
conductivity of 12.5 watts per meter
Kelvin focuses on endurance is easy to
spread and isn't electrically conductive
making it safe to use on GPU dies
thermal grizzly also makes conductor not
liquid metal which we've used to drop 20
degrees off some temperatures than our
dee-lighted tests buy a tube at the link
in the description below so walk you
through it basically on this side we
have an input tank so this is where all
the LNT is coming from right now there's
a stainless steel hose on the backside
feeds in through up here at an intake
manifold and then that is split between
two valves one for the CPU one for the
GPU and those are controlled based on
two things as well one of them is
current so look at the 12 volt line and
see how much current is being pushed so
if for example you start a benchmark and
it starts pushing a lot of current
before there's actually any temperature
build-up you'll get an instant response
or near-instant with low latency versus
typically if you're reading something
like a socket temperature which this is
with a k-type thermocouple which we'll
talk about in a moment those take a
little while to heat up because it's a
copper block needs to actually have some
heat to sink first so if it detects a
high current load the valve can open up
sooner and try and achieve a target
temperature and that's the next big
thing with this the temperature target
is set via software and there is a
controller in the backside of this case
that we have a shot of
hooked up via k-type thermocouple so you
can set X degrees Celsius and then it
will try to achieve that and as I
understand it achieves it pretty quickly
typically within 20 seconds or so
depending on how low you said it as
opposed to pouring it manually where
you're trying to achieve maybe full pot
or something like that for Ellen 2 so
that's the basics now you have as I said
with the valves you have a current
control and a temperature control based
on the thermocouples in the sockets the
CPU valve comes in through here on to
the X 2 99 CPU it's on currently the
EVGA dark motherboard actually one of
the board's that we liked a lot for
overclocking so feeds into a block and
this is kind of it's it's a very large
block on top of the CPU so you can think
of it as a truncated ellentube pot
except on the top there's a copper plate
and then internally there are channels
so it's actually got it's not like micro
fins but it does have channels for the
Ellen 2 to flow through and do some cool
in it and of course when you're talking
to Ellen to cooling at some point things
like micro fins probably don't matter a
whole lot anyway it's not like we're
working with water here as it goes
through comes out and goes out through
the exit manifold and then comes back
into the other tank on this side over
here behind me where some of the ln2 can
be reclaimed
so maybe gasps it just kind of depends
on if for example this entire system is
frozen over like they're pushing really
hard then you'll be able to reclaim more
of the El and two more of it will stay
in liquid form less phase change going
on whereas right now and it's idling
just apply a bit more burning off so as
I understand it when this stuff moves
over to the other tank kingpins able to
reclaim something like 75% in a good
case scenario of the ln2 so there's
actually some recycling a balance here
going on and more importantly just way
more efficient to work with and standing
there manually for hours pouring that
allen to thermoses over and over and
over so that's the I think that's the
basics of it couple more things here
this is a Titan v card it's got a GPU
block on it similar idea to this where
it's a custom
I guess machined or CNC block copper and
it's got some channels in it as well and
then for everything else it's stainless
steel hoses with just insulation on it
and you'll see some foam build up in
some places as the temperature drops
right now it's running pretty
conservatively because otherwise gets a
bit loud for
a couple other things here for the
components they've got a 79 80 XE which
I know is a meme with our audience but
79 80 XE this gets pushed up to about
5.7 when they're actually trying for
frequencies so 5.7 gigahertz here the
GPU is a Titan V as noted it's been
modded a bit and it can get up to
something like 20 300 megahertz I think
saying mod it a bit maybe it's a bit of
an understatement but a couple of mods
on there and 23 other megahertz HP m2
from what I understand doesn't push
quite as hard it's a bit of a different
beast so that's I think that's the
basics for you as noted controller on
the backside talks to software on a
laptop via Wi-Fi or wireless and I think
that's all done through Raspberry Pi and
some custom Python program as well so on
the front there's a relay this is being
fed by Raspberry Pi via five volt and
that's what's controlling the valves as
well and we might have some audio that's
or you might be able to hear it while
I'm talking about there's clicking every
now and then that's when the valves are
opening and closing based on whatever
the softer is set up to so I think EVGA
by the time this video goes live we'll
have done a live stream with this system
you can probably see more there in terms
of results and actually pushing it right
now it's more or less just in showroom
state but that's it for this one so they
call it the Robo clock or will probably
have an article on it you can click that
