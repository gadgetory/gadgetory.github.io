is part two so we have three that we've
just made one of them should already be
live on the main channel there's one on
the patrons sgn side of things if you're
at patreon subscriber and then we have
the third one here in the old studio
well just for the start anyway featuring
senior AMD analyst snowflake how's it
going before that this video is brought
to you by the gigabyte Z 390 ARS master
motherboard which comes equipped with
one of the more powerful Z 390 VRMs for
heavier overclocks on the new 9th Gen
Intel CPUs the ARS master is also one of
the few motherboards with a really
heatsink this generation featuring a mix
of high surface area fins and looks
oriented cover blocks oh and it's also
got updated RGV illumination learn more
at the link below alright and we're back
in the studio not sure what shirt I was
wearing in the the first part of this
featuring snowflake but it's probably
different one now has been about a week
so uh first well actually know what
there is there's one not really a
question but there was a comment
recently I think on the hardware news
video where someone said isn't it about
time GN upgrades of technology you know
why don't you have a 4k camera well
actually we have an a7 r3 and/or a 7-3
art whatever its called
and pretty nice lens on it and we have
this one which is a u X 180 that we've
had for a while now it's it does 4k 60
the thing is YouTube has been completely
just butchering 4k 60 uploads lately we
are not alone a lot of creators have had
this issue we've spoken with many of
them the easiest solution was to just
film at 1080p 60 until YouTube fixes it
we might be able to some more often get
away with 4k 30 but it's really not
worth it so so yeah we switched back
1080p 60 till YouTube figures out what
the hell it's doing because I mean we
can use less than a third of the data to
get the job done and the problem was
uploaded in 4k 60 it still works but I
would have to sit there and do it like
five or six times before it finally just
clicked and up until that point you'd
get like 360p exclusively it would never
under 1080 which it used to do or you
might go up to 720 and then the video
playback just break
you can ask hardware unboxed Steve had
the same issue over there and again
several early creator so anyway because
of that comment we're trying this one
for K 60 K so I am positive I will
regret it and probably have three render
it for a rehab load at multiple times
but we'll try it anyway
first another one there's another non
real questions sky Lancer 77 said
snowflake you're the best Steve I love
you man but snowflake is far better than
you even if you are cyber Jesus I still
love that video where a snowflake ate
your script okay okay she's not a fan of
the Nvidia news items for killing the
claim Nvidia NDA discussion on the GTX
1050 discussion he done thank you so
next one first real question Nintendo
eats in the early days of 3d accelerator
cards dedicated pipelines and fixed
function hardware engines were an
important part of overall performance
provided that game developers targeted
those features with the prevalence of
GPGPU and abstracted api is like the x11
i'm wondering if this is still true it
seems as though the bulk of modern video
card performance comes from having a
processor which is turing-complete
but sacrifices fast integer calculations
to pursue improvements in matrix and
vector math are these really two
different paradigms how much of the
speed of a modern GPU owes itself to
specific or tasks specific hardware i'm
particularly curious about where
tessellation falls in this discussion
thanks as ever for the great work for
this one this is a fantastically worded
question thank you for making it so well
written i actually pitched this over to
david cantor who's an expert analyst he
might as well be among the architects
that we interview in terms of knowledge
and so I pitched it over to him because
he's he's about the best we can get to
answer this one David said the following
the rasterizer is fixed function and
most importantly so is the texturing I'm
not entirely sure about tessellation if
you look at intel's studies on lrb they
might give you somewhat of a hint in the
context of much older dx9 and the x10
stuff today there's a lot more compute
shading in games a CPU and GPU are
really very different it's not just
fixed functional hardware that
differentiates them GPUs are efficient
for throughput tasks and terrible at
anything latency sensitive CPUs are
designed for excellent latency and are
okay at throughput that impacts
everything from transistors it's a
circuit design to architecture so
there's David's a quick short take on it
and I will say too specifically to his
point of computing games and stuff like
that so we've noticed specific games
like shadow of war and sniper leap
forward to some extent there's at least
one other one I want to say maybe rise
of the Tomb Raider not not sure about
shadow but rise of the Tomb Raider I
think those three games specifically a
Wolfenstein 2 that's another one those
are all they actually do leverage some
of that that integer pipeline and like
in torre√≥n for example and that's
something we talked about in our
interview with Nvidia at CES so if
you're curious about more of that side
of things you can check that out but
that is David's answer for you next one
Roger asks paying up for a review is
paying for a review it necessarily a bad
thing
so long as they aren't paying you for a
biased review they're just offering to
compensate you for your time that's a
terrible thing it's really bad on the
list of bad things for a review outlet a
media outlet it is the top bad thing
there's not a bad thing worse than that
for a media outlet now if you're talking
an influencer it's not really a review
at that point it's just it's marketing
but let's just pretend let's just
pretend they the the influence or the
uploader markets it as a review if
they're paid for it they disclose it and
everyone knows that they regard
themselves as an influencer then it's a
little different but not much it's still
month like bad things in our eyes so
here's how I break down I'm gonna make
this as short as I can and not like go
on a rant about and try and stay
organized in my thoughts so I you do
have I fully understand your question
it's a great question thank you for
answering that let me get that other way
first so let's let's address this point
my point they are less where do I start
with this
so long as they aren't paying you for a
biased review starting with so long as
they aren't paying you they would be
paying me and then for a biased review
I put breaks down uh as transparently as
possible it is already very difficult to
filter out certain bias issues with just
with like working with the companies for
example if we're working with the
product and we have a really hell of a
hard time with the PR team but the
product might be perfectly fine but the
PR team is just is maybe awful really
hard to work with duplicitous stuff like
that it's happened and it still happens
every now and that's its bit less often
but it still happens so in that scenario
where you've got pretty good product
horrible team to work with that alone is
really difficult to filter out that bias
you're constantly like I don't attack
the product just because I don't like
these people that I work with if the
product is its own thing the consumers
will never interact with those people
those people shouldn't really influence
the review of the product because it's
not relevant it's not relevant to what
the consumers experience will be they're
not dealing with PR in this made-up
scenario so this is a scenario that has
happened probably at least once a year
depending on you know the cycles of the
time so that alone not involving money
just involving relations of that is
difficult to filter out like it's we
have to make active efforts and we do
peer review and things like that
sometimes to really make sure like was
this too much did I go too far here does
this seem reasonable to you someone else
you know in the team does this seem
reasonable and if it doesn't tell me why
and we'll tone it will dial it back
before we publish and reevaluate so
that's difficult once you add money to
the mix it's I mean it's just you know
you can you can pay for things like for
ads ads we're fine with obviously and
the way our ad model works isn't really
worth going into in this question but
you just kind of we just run a random ad
on a video basically it's how it works
they don't buy a specific adverse
specific video they just buy ads and
then we run them on the videos so that's
one thing but paying for
the time to review the product is
another and the thing is you have to
look at what's our business model how do
we make money and the way we make money
ultimately is to produce content a
review is content that we produce they
don't pay for that effectively you are
paying for that and either it's directly
maybe you buy stuff on the store maybe
support on patreon or it's indirectly
you watch the video you get a YouTube ad
or sort of indirectly you might have
YouTube rather premium as it's called
now and we get a small cut of that or
maybe you add a super chat during the
live streams either way it's some level
you the viewers are paying for it and
it's it's either with money actually out
of your pocket and for that we are
greatly thankful or it's just from your
eyes from seeing an ad that YouTube runs
and chooses and we really have no
control over before the video so that's
how we make money it's we produce
content that is the business model we
make the content we put it out there
we run ads we sell some you know merch
shirts like this and then we get money
from those transactions to then add
another layer of the manufacturer paying
for that is just it's it's not only I
mean it's not necessary it's not how we
make the money because we're already
making the money from all the other
stuff the more views we get the more ads
that serve our the more people who
biased for support on patreon
that's where the money comes from so the
time should not be compensated for a
view a reviewer especially by the
company that has asks for the review or
maybe they haven't but you are reviewing
their product there are times when a
company can transact by giving an
organization money to do something with
their product that those things they're
either like really specific projects and
to give you an example there was what
was that there was a series that fractal
did with like with Kyle and I think J it
was really good and they just like built
a computer I think while they were on a
boat or in a tank or something and
saying like that so that's an example of
a sponsored piece of content which we
don't really do that that's not part of
a business model but for something
like that it's it's totally appropriate
it's it's entertainment and it's
ridiculous
and there's no way that these youtubers
on average would come up with that idea
and then you know go fund it and work
together and do all the logistics so in
that scenario it kind of makes sense
it's it's an entertainment value thing
they're not really reviewing the fractal
case they're just working with it in a
fun manner so you know trying to build a
computer while the tank is bounced
around or whatever it was I don't know
it was I don't why is it a tank I don't
know but uh that seems too crazy I think
it was though but you know that's one
thing but to then say you know I I want
to pay for your review of this CPU of
this video card whatever all i'm doing
is compensating your time well what
happens then if you give a bad review
it's going to soil the relationship they
won't get it they're gonna feel offended
and you're like well what the heck the
product wasn't good so to avoid that and
to avoid the alternative which is you
you tone down the review the harshness
of the review you just don't accept
payment to review products period so so
that's my explanation of how we make
money and why you know we don't take the
money for it I didn't fully explain why
exactly this is bad but I think you can
kind of connect the dots you know what
I'm talking about like it's hard enough
to isolate relationships from products
and every reviewer is biased there's no
such thing as an unbiased reviewer this
is something I learned when I used to
review games and the important thing for
you as the viewer the audience is to
identify reviewers with whom you can
familiarize with their biases so if you
know that for example in our reviews we
tend to favor four cases in our reviews
of cases we tend to favor cases that
have a bit more airflow and we can give
a good review to a silent case and we've
done it plenty of times but on average
you know when you watch our content that
we tend to favor things with more
airflow more function focused more
performance oriented that's just well
it's what we do but that's a bias now
that's a known bias and it's also not
really a bad one the
bad kinds of biases are the ones where
you're getting money to review something
it's more of a corruption than it is a
preference of the product so to have a
bias of you know maybe someone really
likes RGB LED that's totally valid some
likes performance some like silence
someone likes whatever it is no pump
wine maybe as a more objective one but
could still be maybe you've had just you
know pump wine killed your your dog and
so you hate pump wine that's a pretty
bad bias but as long as it's disclosed
it's okay money is not really one where
even disclosure is okay because it is
always going to influence the content I
mean this is this is something we
struggle with constantly in terms of
just internally figuring out like is
this even an advertiser we want to work
with and fortunately our team has grown
strong enough now we can reject
advertisements we don't like we can sort
of do whatever we want and we're gonna
be completely fine but it's really hard
to get to this point and then it's also
hard daily to not fall into the trap of
accepting easy money for things that are
just genuinely unethical and then
further there are FTC guidelines as well
ethics ideally should not be you know
you should be able to just kind of
follow your ethics to run a business
based in media but if you do require
legal oversight to say no you actually
aren't allowed to do that the FTC does
have some guidelines on unpaid content
as well and disclosures and all that
stuff so law TLDR a paid review is not a
review is is I think how we would define
it is marketing and and that's not a
good thing so there is tremendous cost
involved in reviewing a product if my
time Patrick's time Andrews time other
editors on the team software utilities
that we have to build ourselves that's
time potentially hundreds of hours of it
and those costs are very high in office
it's stuff like that
payroll of course and
all of the many thousands of dollars of
lights and cameras and all that it's all
cost but it's the cost of doing business
and it's paid for by the rest of the
business model we don't need the extra
from the the maker of the product now
one last point here if you see ads by a
company on our channel for we have one
right now for the gigabyte there's e 390
master for example that is one it's a
product we've already kind of evaluated
and determined to be acceptable to
advertise for secondly it is not run on
content for gigabyte products and the
content it's run on gigabyte doesn't
choose we just sort of go well let's put
it there so just to give you an idea of
how that side of things works because
sometimes people are like wait a minute
this is this is a video at the Asus
booth but it's got a gigabyte ad why did
you do that well it's because if ASU is
paid for it
that would be messed up that's sponsored
content we don't do that some people do
but it's not part of us because we see
ourselves ourselves as a media outlet
not as as just sort of you know
entertainment or something like that so
so in that scenario Asus would have no
involvement in us being at the booth
aside from signing the NDA s if there
are any and there are often aren't or
working out the time and date that's
about the end of the arrangement so any
ads that are run during trade shows
those are pre negotiated before the show
they just run for the month and until we
hit whatever agreement we've we've made
with the company in terms of you know
performance things like that but they
don't pay for booth visits ever and all
of that's in 100% of our agreements for
ads that are sold near or in the
vicinity of trade shows you you do not
pay for booth visit and actually several
times we haven't visited advertisers
who've run ads with us during a trade
show because their products sucked so I
yeah just to give you an idea of how
that runs anyway that was a really long
question and I almost feel like it
should be a separate thing but whatever
next one Big Mike
Steve who is Jim
I think there's a reference to bit wick
Kyle's bit Witter nitwit celebrity
edition should be called minor celebrity
edition Jim appeared in that and
answered correctly for me the what was
the the capacity the first hard drive
ever made and Kyle said something to the
extent of thank you for making Steve
look smart and Jim said smart I'm just
old so Jim was in a he did a computer
history museum tour with us I've known
him my entire life he was a business
partner of my dad's and has been a
programmer for like probably 40 years or
something at this point and he's he's
written
he's coded and everything Fortran
machine languages everything up until
modern day a lot of Java or as he calls
it Java because he's Canadian but Jim is
a sort of just like a friend of the site
he is a friend of mine and he shows up
in content occasionally the Computer
History Museum tour we did with him was
amazing
because Jim is a a walking encyclopedia
of often movie quotes garbage and
computer stuff so and he openly admits
this Jim is is happy to recite for you
all of his terrible jokes about every
store we go by on like in the Las Vegas
Strip for example where every time we go
past strip burger he says it's called
strip burger because it strips your
intestines things like that so Jim's a
really fun guy he was in that video
because he goes with us to some shows
he's not really on editorial side he
just adds some fun value when we're
traveling and also though is incredibly
reliable for computer histories it's
just incredible what he knows ok next
one baver na says it seems that there
are many opinions about buy and used
graphics cards that were used for
cryptocurrency mining what are the risks
if any with buying motherboards that
were used for a cryptocurrency mining
seen quite a few boards that were used
for mining for twenty to thirty five
dollars free shipping some were marketed
for my and some weren't so would there
be any issues the number one potential
issue is maybe blown-out PCIe slots if
they weren't using powered risers
although I'm pretty sure pretty much
every miner
does so maybe not as much of a concern
you run into things like maybe
capacitors for example capacitors are
more they have a life whereas some of
the other components the life of them is
relevant to something else will die
first so caps you might be working with
let's say maybe a low and mid-range
board something like that kind of
suitable for mining where you just need
PCIe slots if you're working on one of
those you might have caps that are rated
at 2500 hours at 85 degrees Celsius it's
pretty pretty bad you might have maybe
5,000 hours at 85 or ideally had 105
something like that hours but if you
have a lower sort of rating maybe 2500
hours 85 degrees Celsius and it's been
running under heavy enough load with no
cooling over the board the caps on the
board just on the cards it is definitely
possible in a hot server environment
effectively maybe and I mean with poor
cooling or ventilation that it could
have been running at about that 85 range
for a significant part of its life or
you go up to 95 you had about 10 degrees
Celsius and suddenly you're having the
life of the capacitor so it's roughly
half for the extra 10 degrees C pretty
significant change for only another 10
degrees Celsius and that's I guess your
main risk
I mean how realistic is this risk I
don't know it depends on I guess the
mining operation and how well cooled it
was where the caps are on the board do
they have a heat sink fan on the CPU
that's downdraft or something like
there's a million variables but that
would be probably a number one risk is
at some point does a cap blow out sooner
than it would if you had thought new
that said if they ran at about spec and
it's rated for 2500 hours and it ran for
well I actually wouldn't take that long
to kill that if you're running a 24/7
mining under load it's just a question
of was it actually at 85 C and probably
a lot of the times the answer is no it
just has been a bad environment so that
be my main concern I don't know really
how relevant that is ultimately because
like it's there's just so many variables
and if if it had enough airflow over it
it's probably not really that abused but
I would
we avoid the lower end boards that we
used for mining for that reason because
if they have just bad caps to begin with
that have then been abused 24/7
potentially in a hot environment you
don't want to like build the whole
system and then in a year you can't use
it you know you got to replace the
motherboard that kind of sucks so but I
don't know
speaking of biases from earlier this
this would be a bias of mine is I don't
genuine generally like to buy used
hardware even if logically it's sound
just because my I value my time greatly
and I would rather spend an extra X
dollars than to deal with a couple hours
of downtime later which could cost me
you know potentially a lot of money
depending on when the downtime is next
one now I had some other notes here oh
yeah you might be missing some advanced
overclocking options they might have
some settings pre-configured you know
make sure you clear BIOS stuff like that
reduce PCIe generation for example might
be one that they set next one L PI I
think on discord I was wondering if
you'll soon do any memory pricing status
post CES like he did with GD v @ vs h BM
&amp;amp; y HP AMD chose the latter for Vega and
you can combine that with ddr4 pricing
as well it'd be interesting to see how
g6 goes against HP I'm - and what will
happen or at least speculate with g5 ax
and g5 like they'll still be used for
mid to low end cards say an on our TX
card or Navi low-end card just get rid
of supply if there's much less I'm just
going to read part of something we wrote
previously about this and we'll open up
that page and we can for the editors put
the page here to show it so this is from
our content of why does AMD use HBM and
what was the cost of Vega and this
should answer your question of why is
aim the using HP I'm still it's so
expensive so what we wrote at the time
was AMD has to use HP M Vega
architecture his memory starved
HBM to critically allows AMD to run
lower power consumption than gddr5 would
enable given the Vega architecture and
at the time we spoke with build Zoid and
learned that vega frontier Edition 16
gigabytes of HP am to Paul's about 20
watts max using a
he used some tools to determine the
consumption this ignores the voltage
controllers 3.3 volt draw but we're
still at 20 watts memory and no more
than an additional 10 watts for the
controller so that's less than 30 watts
for the entire entire memory system on
Vega F II we also at the time we wrote
we also know that on our X 480 uses 40
to 50 watts for it 8 gigabytes which is
already a significant increase in power
consumption per gigabyte over Vega F e
the RX 5 480 also has memory bandwidth
of 256 gigabytes per second with 8
gigabyte gddr5 vs vega 64 484 gigabytes
per second the result is increased
bandwidth the same capacity and lower
power consumption but at higher cost to
build in order for an Rx 480 to
hypothetically reach similar bandwidth
power consumption would increase
significantly build Zoid at the time
calculated that a hypothetical 384-bit
gddr5 bus on polaris architecture would
push 60 to 75 watts and an imaginary 512
bit bus would do 80 to 100 for this
reason alone
HBM 2 saves AMD from high power budget
that would otherwise be spent solely on
memory this comes down to an
architectural decision made many years
ago by AMD where they which were most
readily solved for with HBM 2 and
there's a lot more notes in that content
but Andy was more or less forced to use
HP m and stick with it once they made
that decision so as for the rest of your
question the answer is yes we can do
more confident like that for sure we
have the we have the the data already we
just have to put it together
last one scooby-dooby is AMD making any
money off of it
Radeon 7 16 gigabytes of HP m27
nanometers and then a confused face
excellent question so speaking of the
previous content we can kind of use
parts of that to evaluate this I am NOT
current on HP m2 pricing I haven't been
for about 6 to 8 months but it shouldn't
be too different might be a bit cheaper
I don't know so keep that in mind I
would need to go last time I got lucky I
sat next to someone on a plane from SK
Hynix
and then he got drunk and told me
everything so I haven't had that happen
for 8 months but
for pricing at the time what I knew is
that HBM 2 was about a hundred and fifty
dollars for what was going on vega 64
and and that may have may well have come
down but let's just pretend it hasn't if
it hasn't then you're looking at you
know upwards of two 250 $300 for HB m to
on well what would be sitting here is
the Radeon seven card so that's a lot of
money I mean that's for cost
that's what AMD pays and then you're
talking GPU cost - I don't know what
that is but the inter poser plus the
yield might be like 25 bucks something
like that and then you're dealing with
the die yield you didn't with die on
interposer yield with HB m as well so
the costs add up very quickly are they
making money on it I would say yes
they're not selling at a loss they
really can't afford to but are they
making a lot of money no probably not
and for anyone who complains about the
pricing I mean you may have will see how
the performance is of course I don't
know when this video go up but we'll see
how the performance is and if it's if
it's justified but if anyone's
complaining about the pricing there's
only so much that does because and he
can't reasonably sell it at a loss so I
would say it's close I would I would
estimate their costs to be quite high I
mean you're probably probably
approaching 300 for memory assuming the
price doesn't change it probably has
your memory plus board components I
probably you know call it 50 bucks or
something for all of the miscellaneous
board components PCP all that stuff
maybe a bit more cooler it's gonna be
like 25 to 40 dollars depending on the
metal I guess of the shroud and how
complex that is to assemble with the
screw count so I I would say they're
making a bit of money yes but I don't
know call it like 500 bucks or something
cost plus or minus 50 something like
that really rough estimate if you quote
me on this then say that's a rough bad
estimate on old data
but just to give you a rough idea that's
about probably where you'd be you know a
year ago something like that
so assuming seven animators had been a
thing so uh yeah this is also why I
think partner models will be scarce if
and when they show up and and the price
and will be a bit higher probably
because AMD sells the GPU to them at a
slight markup and then they you know
they have their own markup so are they
making money yet
I would absolutely assume so I think
they would get killed by their investors
if they sold it for a loss but it is not
a lot of money and and I think the price
is probably fair strictly based upon the
cost of the product based on the
performance we'll talk about that in the
review I actually I'm not being coy I
genuinely don't know I haven't looked at
the data I do that specifically so that
I don't accidentally say things and
videos we filmed before the review so I
don't know right now it today but you
know when we film tomorrow or the next
day I'll know
