hardware news recap for the last week
this week we have news on things like
the gtx 1650 specs and our biggest
question to you all is how many of you
care about this video card and that's a
serious question please let us know in
the comments also AMD and sony
confirming some of the rumors from last
week on third-generation Rison and Navi
in the next PlayStation console MSI
clarifying a statement on rising 3,000
support for 300 series boards and these
50th anniversary and some rumors about
Samsung and Intel potentially working
together before that this video is
brought to you by the gigabyte z3 90 ARS
master motherboard which comes equipped
with one of the more powerful z3 90 BRS
for heavier overclocks on the new 9th
gen Intel CPUs the ARS Master is also
one of the few motherboards with a
really heat sink this generation
featuring a mix of high surface area
fins and looks oriented hover blocks oh
and it's also got updated RGV
illumination learn more at the link
below
the first news item is the GTX 1650
specs and price 1650 has been rumored
for a while now we noticed with the 1616
on Ti there wasn't that much interest in
it most of the reviews on youtube got
about half of the views they typically
get including ours J's was a bit low and
this was true for most other reviewers
as well so interest in the 1616 on Ti
apparently not that high but the 1650 is
what we're curious about supposed to be
$150 in theory it should have based on
tech power-ups spec sheet that they've
posted in their comment section of one
of their articles should have 896 CUDA
cores it should be at sixteen sixty or
so megahertz boost four gigabytes gddr5
128-bit interface which would be eight
gigabit per second gddr5 memory and
likely later there will be a ti because
typically nvidia does this at this price
class and it's also not a full GPU so
should be 75 watts and no power
connector that's really the main thing
here it's it's like a 750 Ti to 1050 Ti
replacement and I guess the question is
do you care because we're going to
review on but the amount of interest we
saw in the 1660 review
was not encouraging and shows that
people seem to I don't know if it's if
people have had too much nvidia lately
or if it's just that it's a lower end
product so the interest is naturally
less or something like that but anyway
sixteen fifty the rumored release date
is April 23rd based on the story online
Sony and AMD confirm third-generation
rise in in their upcoming PlayStation
partnership so the PlayStation 5 as
we've been calling it is something we
talked about in the last Hardware news
episode as well Sony finally outlined
some details about its upcoming
successor to the PlayStation 4 in an
interview with Wired magazine where mark
Cerny
spoke with Wired at length about the
upcoming of hardware solutions for the
PlayStation 5 the most notable item here
is of course Sony's continued
partnership with AMD which will see the
console using a Zen 2 architecture third
generation rise in SOC boasting 8 cores
and 16 threads this is now confirmed the
new PlayStation will also get a custom
variants of and these upcoming Navi it
should support well so here's here's
where we get into the weeds a bit but
supports ray-tracing and supports 8k
does not mean plays at 8k this certainly
does not mean plays 8k with ray-tracing
that's not gonna happen but I guess
let's let's talk about that word support
for a moment technically just about
everything out supports ray-tracing
ray-tracing has been supported for
decades so supports ray-tracing doesn't
inherently mean anything real-time
ray-tracing is what you want to hear if
that's if that's the buzzword you care
about right now and I mean an rx 580
supports rate racing you can do it it's
not going to be fast and it probably
won't be real-time but you can do it and
as an example in blender you could do
rate racing and then just render it out
over time now this doesn't work for a
game so typically what people may and
when they're talking about supports rate
racing for games is in real time the
next question is how many samples are
you taking and is there any denoise and
applied and what other effects are
chicks are being used to optimize this
so supports rate racing is one thing but
how well it actually does it and to what
degree it can rate race is another
secondarily to technically there's a ray
traced audio solution you could do so
supports ray tracing in conjunction with
Sony saying that it's interested in
improving its audio setup for the
PlayStation 5 which is something that
certainly confirmed as well could
indicate ray traced audio as one of the
interpretations of those two statements
made separately so either way it's
interesting here there's there's kind of
two perspectives that we take on this
one is either Nvidia knew that this was
a plan and preempted it with RT X or the
other one is Nvidia has such dominance
in its marketing that by introducing
real-time ray tracing making it a point
of interest for people and dominating
the news cycle with it for the past
couple of months now
Andy is now forced to acknowledge ray
tracing as a feature when previously it
wasn't really something people talked
about for games
so it's either Nvidia preempted a launch
or AMD is forced to respond to Nvidia's
advancements in ray tracing and either
one of those is interested and may be
worth a separate discussion topic but
either way certainly confirmed these
details with Wired so you can check the
article linked in the description below
if you want to see our show notes for
that but 8k ray tracing are the buzz
words and then eight core 16 threads for
the SOC solution with a variant of Navi
in it and more to come later on that msi
clarifies rise in 3000 support on the
300 series boards sort of so earlier
this week there's a reddit thread which
is always a great source of news and it
talked about an msi service rep stating
that the upcoming rise in 3000 series
processors would not work on the X 370
motherboards that MSI has this is a
customer support rep they don't really
typically have insight to upcoming
product roadmaps and support so it's not
really surprised and that msi came out
later and officially said it is coming
to our attention that an msi customer
support representative has regrettably
misinformed in a messiah
with regards to potential support for
next-gen AMD CPUs on the MSI x3 70 X
power game in titanium motherboard
through this statement we want to
clarify the current situation at this
point we are still performing an
extensive testing on our existing lineup
of 300 and 400 series a.m. for boards to
verify potential compatibility for the
next-gen and the rise in CPUs to be
clear our intention is to offer maximum
compatibility for as many MSI products
as possible towards the launch of the
next-gen and these CPUs will release a
compatibility list of MSI motherboards
so crisis averted
but the skepticism here comes because I
am these new CPUs will be higher power
consumption especially the high core
count 16 core CPUs that we're expecting
at some point from rising 3000 series
and with that means potentially some
limitations with the power design on
these older motherboards that were made
for the first generation rise in release
so these X 370 boards of the patch
probably won't work with the highest
court count rise in 3000 series CPUs
just because of power requirements but
that doesn't mean that all 3000 series
CPUs won't work on it so we'll keep an
eye out on that and up next TSM C is 2nd
gen 7 nanometre extreme ultraviolet
lithography or UV lithography is set for
june volume production EU V's been sort
of a a holy grail for the THOG Rafi for
a long time now and for silicon
fabrication and manufacturing finally
there's some spread and usage and tsmc
is among the first to implement EUV
successfully despite over a decade of
not being able to quite get it done we
have another video in the past by the
way with David Cantor talking about EUV
ten nanometer process struggles intel
has faced and ye UV is important versus
things like existing lithographic
approaches to manufacturing silicon or
things like multi patterning and you can
check that video out we'll put it
somewhere up there in the cards if you
want to see it
tsmc will be ramping its first
generation 7 nanometre UV based process
into mass production this June according
to the new reports TSM c7 nanometer node
will power chips for customers such as
Apple Qualcomm
Huawei Huawei Kiran 985 processors are
expected to be the first chips
mass-produced on tsmc is seven nanometer
lines with apples a 13 processor to
follow TSMC also has plans to leverage
its second-generation EUV to produce
chips at an intermediary sixth nanometer
node and at five nanometer with the
latter currently in a risk of production
so Huawei an appalam on the first to use
this new manufacturing line next up Sam
son is ready in five nanometer EUV for
customer sampling and this is in similar
semiconductor news to TSM C's not to be
left out of the EU v-ray Samsung is
working on its own chips that are sub 10
nanometer the preeminent players have
been samsung and tsmc thus far as
GlobalFoundries has largely bowed out of
this race and Intel has obviously
struggled Samson announced the addition
of a five nanometer process No - its
foundry that's apparently far enough
along to be ready for customer sampling
Samsung's 5 nanometer FinFET process
uses UV and like TSMC Samsung appears to
have made great strides in the realm of
EUV Samsung states that the 5 nanometer
process will port much of what was used
at 7 nanometers IP tools design rules
etc to ease migration and time to market
samsung also notes that it has 60
nanometer in a customer tape out but
didn't elaborate on the designs or
customers Samsung is also expected to
bring more UV production lines into
swain and the second half of this year
in commemoration of AMD's 50th
anniversary coming up on May 1st and he
was founded in 1969 it would appear that
there are some celebratory anniversary
edition pieces of hardware coming out so
last year you might remember Intel
released the i7 8086 K which was in
limited limited quantities of I don't
know if we can say how many there were
but it was in like the hundreds of
thousands so limited quantities for the
8086 K an anniversary edition of its
vaunted 8086 processor from ages past
and he is now looking to do something
similar with its Rison 720 700 X several
online retailers have posted a
placeholder for the chip and while none
of them detailed specifications it does
appear that it will be
with the Wraiths prism LED cooler and
should be listed for around $340
sapphire AMD's premiere AIB partner also
appears to be getting in on the
celebration a listing on retailer PC di
GA indicates sapphire will be releasing
the Sapphire AMD 50th anniversary
edition Nitro+ Radeon rx 598 gigabyte
video card it's really long name outside
the gold-coloured aesthetic on it the
I'm not gonna say the whole name again
the video card will share the same
specifications as its brethren the
Nitro+ rx 598 gigabyte and the Nitro+
590 special edition lastly gigabyte
seems to be planning a new motherboard
in the form of its x4 70 or as gaming 7
Wi-Fi for a 50th anniversary releases as
well so lots of AMD's stuff coming out
most of these like the r7 2700 X are
based on actually all these are based on
existing products and the the question
just remains what's happening to the
2700 X so for the 8086 K and how Ben did
a bit and you end up with higher
overclocking CPUs on average and that
made them sort of interesting to work
with so we'll keep an eye on the 2700 X
limited edition one and probably buy one
for testing hopefully these are
especially Bend or higher clocks because
that would make them a lot more
interesting to work with so keep an eye
on our channel for coverage of that if
it ends up being interesting origin the
best launcher in the space if you
haven't opened to origin in a while now
is probably a good time to do so or to
uninstalled EA has patched a significant
security flaw on the launcher so
seriously if you haven't opened it in a
while actually do open it enough to hit
it
researchers at underdog security found a
vulnerability with an origins URL scheme
and address using origin colon slash
slash that could be used to trick users
into running malicious code or pretty
much anything an attacker wanted
according to a statement to TechCrunch
the exploit could potentially have been
used to either run malicious code
remotely or inject malicious links or
emails John Reese paired with EA
addressed the flaw and confirmed a patch
so you can actually
get rid of this just make sure you go
and patch it and then this one might be
a bit of a stretch but the rumor mill
has been running with it
Rajat Kaduri posted a photo in front of
one of Samson's
manufacturing facilities in Korea and as
the adage and the tech world goes
whatever Rajat Kaduri does on Twitter is
news so what's happened now is I guess
the jump that's been made is Raja works
at intel on AXI graphics and on the
future GP years Raja has at Samsung ergo
samsung is making these GPUs so it's
it's possible it's certainly possible
Intel has pushed some of its fabrication
off to other entities recently
especially with the 40 nanometers
shortage so this isn't an impossibility
it's also not confirmed but it could be
anything it could be meeting with
Samsung because well actually couldn't
be anything it could be a limited list
of things relating to memory and silicon
manufacturing but within that list it
could be anything so could be meeting
with Samsung for memory reasons may be
memory support on the upcoming GPU or it
could be something like fabrication and
we're not going to run any further with
the story that it's already been
tortured online so let's leave that one
there you can see the Twitter post if
you want
it's him standing in front of a statue
and that's enough for news I'm in the
hardware space apparently that's it for
