celebrated titles and PC gaming and the
game first launched in 1993 setting its
sequel to follow quickly in 1994 it's a
flagship first-person shooter series
genre which developers in south were
effectively created back the 90s between
Wolfenstein and doom being 23 years old
though a lot of the modern gaming
audience has never even been exposed to
do and so it's time for refresh but that
always bears with it the risk of these
older games not quite meshing well with
modern mechanical demand and the meta of
game design it's been 11 years since the
eponymous film and we've now been
introduced to doom for simply named a
doom capslock optional dooms name may
carry stature but it's being launched
into crowded waters for most publishers
it's simply not acceptable to just make
a single player game these days
especially in FPS and dooms focus has
always been on single player quake has
sort of been responsible for multiplayer
gaming and it's old software stack but
obviously that's been out of commission
for a little while now working with
Unreal Tournament quake carved out its
own entire genre competitive online FPS
games with twitch based shooting
mechanics that even carries over through
zone today's shooters today at call of
duty overwatch and battlefield call the
shots and have shaped the multiplayer
market and there's an emphasis on this
mobility speed and reflexes that we saw
even in quake and now in the modern doom
game but there's also more emphasis in
these modern FPS is on what happens
between the matches that revolves around
the idea of character progression
loadout management's leveling up and all
of these unlockables and that doesn't
really mesh that well with the older
design approach to twitch shooters it's
just it's too much complexity and it
takes players away from the core
mechanic of pickup guns that are on the
ground and shoot people with them
there's also regenerative health in
modern shooters and that's something
that titles of your would never stoop to
they'd much rather do these pickup
approach to health and armor packs do
makes compromises with the modern design
demands that
and in software have met halfway with
the market and it levels up player
accounts now with hack modules put
unquote hack modules that unlock weapons
and armor load outs are built with
weapons and grenades and then further
modified with cosmetic only armor
add-ons and weapon classics include the
old rocket launcher of course fun is
always a multiplayer and minigun with
iconic double barrel shot is and pistols
and more the major mechanics throwback
adopted into the modern era of games is
that pickup system health in Doom goes
old school the new doom doom for
whatever you want to call it starts us
with a hundred HP and you lose it in
combat there's no regen offered so if
you lose health tough luck go pick them
up and also don't die doing it in terms
of armor there's also pick ups for that
and that's not to be confused with the
cosmetic armor for character progression
armor pickups dot the map and offered of
course a bit of armor before your
Health's as a buffer and it's similar to
quake and UT in that approach map design
also goes old school this is something
that we really liked with the new doom
game it offers a unique mix of platforms
and passages that leverage the game is
double jumping and ledge grabbing twitch
mechanics perfectly so there's a
flawless execution of a twitch based
high-speed shooting and a lot of
punching by the way mechanics dooms most
standout multiplayer feature though is
its demon runes system and this is a
unique add-on when compared to even
against newer titles demon runes spawn
in fixed locations kind of like the old
UT Redeemer and they have lon cooldowns
on that spawn time demon runes also then
transform the player into iconic demons
from the single-player campaign some of
them even dating back 20 plus years and
the demon rapidly becomes the center of
attention so there's plenty of games if
you wanted to make the weak sort of
comparisons editorial comparisons you
could point to things like battlefront
with the hero system or plenty of other
games where there are these transform
properties for multiplayer combat but
the demon runes one really is unique so
you become the center of attention you
draw tons of damage you can soak that
damage about as well as you can dish it
out and that means a lot of racks up
killing sprees but the lawn spawn timer
and
the sort of hidden nature of the demon
room does make it feel more difficult to
get and of course it's a magnetic pole
for all the players in the map but
there's one major oversight with doom 4
and it completely overlooked this
feature it's simply a free-for-all mode
a game mode that effectively is just a
deathmatch and multiplayer that's about
as perfect a fit as could be found in
terms of game modes for this game for
doom and there's just no death match at
all for a twitchy shooter that acts as a
pick up and play title with even pickups
in the game and in our Cade style
approach to mechanics deathmatch is
almost too perfect even further because
of the lack of classes and because the
gameplay is largely isolationist you
pretty much spend all your time alone
it's really not meant to be a team
shooter like something maybe csgo would
be we can only imagine how fun an
instant toggle would be in a death match
type mode but I was reading that some of
the Alpha files contained references to
an FFA or deathmatch mode so it is
possible that it will consider adding
this in the future team games that
currently dominate the market of course
lowland dota 2 dr team gameplay from the
MOBA side and see us going overwatch
push it from the FPS angle so it makes
sense that doom would conform in some
regard to this modern team driven
approach but we are hopeful of a post
launch deathmatch mode because honestly
not every game needs to be csgo
regardless it uses the environment and
atmosphere design and combat design to
keep players fiercely engaged in both
single-player and multiplayer gameplay
there's a slew of new demons who fit the
series well spicing up gameplay just
enough as they're dropped in sort of
infrequently it's a single player and
that helps prevent the creepy and
feeling of repetition that we so often
get with these types of games finishing
moves also add some satisfyingly violent
and gory animations not the least of
which is what I'm just going to go ahead
and call these stop hitting yourself
attack when you rip the arm from a team
and proceeded to beat him over the head
with it and then there's of course world
craft which offers unique and
progressive approaches to the
the atmosphere of the game as the game
moves forward we transition from a Mars
base filled with sprawling corridors and
some verticality and futuristic elements
to of course hell which is a central
theme of doom and that is more dominated
by the verticality than Mars was it's
also got design elements like floating
platforms and some other chaotic items
that help keep gameplay fresh single
player remains the biggest draw of doom
but the multiplayer seems fun enough as
a standalone title we'd value
multiplayer only if you're only going to
play multiplayer probably in the twenty
to thirty dollar range for some quick
pick up and play fun but if you like
single-player and multiplayer and this
looks like a good game to you just
looking at the gameplay footage then
dooms worth your consideration even at
the launch price but that's all we've
got for now so if you want to see the
benchmarks and the technology side of
doom check out our previous videos on
that or just go to the website gamers
Nexus Donette and read the GPU benchmark

world craft and design a veteran see
