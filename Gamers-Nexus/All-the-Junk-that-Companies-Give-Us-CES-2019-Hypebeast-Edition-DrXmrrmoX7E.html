did a video stupid stuff that the
vendors gave us at CES this year turn
into a hypebeast question do that too
hard and one of the things he needs to
know is that it just got real so what it
says everyone today we're gonna do
something a bit special and go through
all the stupid stuff that manufacturers
gave us for CES 2019 so it's pretty cool
though
for example this this genuine Las Vegas
pen from bit wick Kyl and we also have
stuff from all the show the show floor
booths and frankly we need to get rid of
some of it before going home because
this would not fit in our luggage so
we're gonna open it here and coal the
good and the bad and and rate each
vendor based on their swag that they
gave us I guess before that this video
is brought to you by the open bench
table a lightweight and ultra portable
test bench built with high quality
anodized aluminum and with a modular
approach to design the open bench table
is easy to collapse store and assemble
to test different parts and is one of
the test benches that we use in the GN
labs the open bench table contains
everything you need to test PC builds
and configurations and it's available in
silver black red and a mini ITX version
learn more at the link in the
description below first up this comes
from Kyle
he doesn't really count but it's the
best thing we got here it's it's from
bit Witter nitwit we all did horribly
because it was the last day of the show
and everybody was sleep deprived and
starving but we got to do the
competition I think as Rock wins the
award for the the biggest bag and also
the least attentive booth out of all the
ones that we visited so I'm just gonna
alright so there's a lot there's a lot
of bags and we hate to get rid of them
Linus Linus gave us some of his cable
ties at the horsehair sweet so another
youtuber doesn't quite count but he
didn't pass them off to us while he was
there technically I think Colton was the
one who sauced
we got mouse pads from deep cool and
deep cool had some pretty interesting
products this year like the assassin 3
and the captain 240 Pro which we have
coverage of those online separately
their mouse pad says 2019 piggy bank
exclamation point make money and go
forward so we have I think four of these
I'll just in on one second just right
there so I can make it home safely next
one up is lucky the flash drive lucky is
the msi dragon that Emma SIA has
invested great time into over the last
couple of years it's become a bit of a
character of theirs and it's a it's
actually a pretty decent quality like
rubber toy except it's got its underwear
hanging off at the bottom there but
that's because in order to access the
flash drive you have to behead lucky so
to quote Keegan from earlier it's a bit
morbid and a little bit disturbing and I
don't know if MSI is trying to send us a
message or not by giving us one of these
but you do you do have to kill lucky to
get the drive out and then I think as
his head come all the way off
you can also skin lucky so that's just
kind of just kind of disturbing all
right although I will say the quality of
the print and the rubbers is quite high
perhaps MSI should look into making toys
as well maybe not for children though if
they're gonna do it that way next one
the EVGA new audio this is actually not
junk that Venters gave us this is a
review product but it ends up on the
list because I put it in the backpack
and we open it and this was in it but we
have maybe some footage of this it's a
nought
it's a sound card from EVGA and we have
I don't know we might try and review it
I we don't really do too much with audio
so would require a lot of effort on our
end to learn how to test it properly but
either way if you saw our our tour and
type a of EVGA ceo's audio room I think
that was kind of the inspiration to make
this because he's he's a complete audio
file and admits it openly and has a
whole lot of high-end audio equipment so
they're gonna try and get into the space
so that we'll go over there somewhere it
doesn't get mixed in with the deep cool
prize that we are we're treasuring what
is that one postcard from Discovery
Channel and that's all yeah never stop
being creative from MSI partnered with
Discovery Channel for some reason our
creativity leads us to discover the
universe I guess I mean the universe is
ultimately heat and MSI has has
discovered some pretty creative ways to
encounter that in the past don't stop
being ok next one also from MSI is lucky
the dragon in a bigger form and this
this got to us eventually after a fedex
figured out that we exist they sent some
of these for the holidays I think and we
never got them but they've given us some
more now so we can have some lucky the
dragons there you go stoic with that
light you've got a lucky the dragon
phone holder so these are actually it
once again really not not bad quality
just also completely distant from the
brand we have three of these here and I
think we have four of them at home so
I'm not really sure what to do with
these but um that's empty
thanks for arranging this Keegan I'm
just kidding we're not throwing all the
Lucky's out I'll try and figure out how
we can use seven of them we've done off
at Messiah for a little hit we have some
as rock stuff what are these these are
brochures
I think they printed their website we
have some codes of the division - this
is from Andy yeah they give them to
Esther you pick them up at the booth so
these are codes from from Andy for the
division - and where's my bit whip pen
they're scratch scratch to reveal the
code I think this has to be redeemed
basically right away so don't delay on
this one if you want it here you go
PCM zv5 5j art I think II may be f sm
4:00 a.m. and 9:00 I don't know where
you have to redeem it but presumably
somewhere and the rewards com / items
maybe I don't know
good luck so that's all yours though if
you want it I guess we'll use the others
for maybe test benches or something next
up is gigabyte gigabyte gave us a couple
of things one of them is a business card
holder which which looks very nice so
we're gonna just migrate Keegan's
business cards over to hit here just
expecting worse than that out of the BMW
M Series card holder and into something
classier so I think just go okay alright
and there it is closes very nicely
Thanks there you go
gigabyte also gave us this thing which
is a it's actually a cool cool item on
the list so this is a motherboard LED
thing that requires batteries that we
don't have everyone really appreciates
the gift thank you gigabyte this one
this one's kind of cold probably go on
the set background it's an acrylic sheet
with a motherboard outline on it and it
lights up
RGB LEDs but we don't have batteries
here so pretty cool and makes up for the
business card holder we also got hats
last year we got a hat from pic Co that
we were well I will show what it looked
like
but we had a pact from pic Co this time
we have some phantom gaming hats
oh they won a hardcore that's probably
not that cheap to do that says as rock
all over the inside so as arc phantom
gaming everywhere and these are I
believe referred to as dad hats because
of the way the strap works so we got
another one you want it oh you it's
mine the next one is from Roman aka
their Bower so thermal grizzly is
working on a new product and this is the
container for it we have a separate
video with him that might be live by now
and this is a it's I think it's called
carbo not that basically feels like a
microfiber cloth that's pretty fragile
but you cut this to size where it
actually is going to be pre-cut to size
by the time he makes the has the retail
product but this thing's supposed to be
a is a sort of lower performance versus
thermal paste but higher performance
reverses in theory the the graphite
thermal pads something that can last for
a long time so it's an endurance product
as opposed to a performance product and
doesn't really have a curing time like
the pace do so this is actually pretty
cool and something we will be testing
shortly sometime after the show because
there's supposed to be a real product
coming to market for like under 10 bucks
or 10 at least under 10 euros on average
it's just a question of how does it do
versus the existing the existing pads
that I think Linus's team reviewed last
year or two years ago at this point so
fans this from in win the crown ac 140
high static pressure fan have not used
this not too familiar with it but they
had a crown fan at Computex previously
and here's the I guess the final version
of the product
so AC 144 this one they gave us four of
them we can actually use these for
testing or for test benches things like
that so this one is one
we'll get youse it's got cable hookups
on the end here end of the frame this is
a tea set so this is from deep cool as
well this is actually kind of cool so
this is actually pretty nice
it's a personal tailor by I I know
enough that I can read the word P so it
is in fact T and it comes from deep cool
I think Keegan is probably taking this
home and that's what's in it
do you know anything about this anyway
there's the there's a tea kit so this is
this is kind of cool and one of the
better things we got and it's consumable
so it can be gotten rid of when it's
done with and I believe this one is
going to Keegan so alright I'm gonna
call it there
we have we have some hoodies from cooler
masters from thermal take we have some
shirts most of this stuff will probably
be going home and then we'll sort
through it but some of the marketing
materials will probably stay behind so I
mean as last year of course no
disrespect to the manufacturers actually
most of them did mention this video to
me when they were handing us the stuff
saying things like this can make it in
your stupid that manufacturers gave
us video direct quote from at least two
people at the shows here so they're
they're aware of what happens it's in
good spirit and some of this is actually
pretty useful and functional for example
other than the unicorn pen there's also
fans an audio card that will be used to
review and then probably how you gotta
find something else to do if you wash it
to this point so I'll see you all next
time thanks for watching subscribe for
more goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
