out today so I'm filming this myself I
want to talk about an issue I just had
with a package that was shipped to us I
got it about 20 minutes ago and it was
empty as in either stolen from or never
contained anything to begin with this is
the second time this has happened and it
only happens with the next day service
from amazon it doesn't seem to be a
problem when I get boxes from UPS or
fedex or usps well I guess they do
handle the next day mail sometimes but
we're going to talk about how happened
so basically I got this package just
typical yellow envelope the package does
not appear to have been tampered with as
in the envelope was not opened before I
got it which is good the box that was in
it however this SD card that I ordered
you can see this is this is exactly how
i received it just FYI you can see the
white china damage tape mark up at the
top that was not for me opening it it
came like this with the top open already
and when we removed the card from here
there are two things in this box one is
an instruction manual with the code for
some software and the other one is what
was supposed to the shell that was
supposed to hold the SD card so this is
supposed to hold a 128 gigabyte SD card
that writes have 300 megabytes per
second and comes with a USB card reader
because we need it for video production
that costs 245 dollars after tax that is
not an insignificant amount of money
especially for a small operation now
before going further in this I will say
that I called Amazon I got an answer
within five minutes from a human and
they resolved it i'll have a new one
shipped out it'll be here in two days
and everything will be fine I don't need
to have to return this one which would
be stupid anyway his empty so they
realize that would be dumb they didn't
ask her return and they're shipping a
replacement all good thank you amazon
for that but i would like this to not
happen again so i think i don't know the
company dynomax handles this mail i
guess i don't know if they're like a
middleman company for amazon for their
one-day shipping the sunday shipping or
something i would assume it had to be
the sorting center or the shipping
center or maybe like starships an empty
box
that seems pretty unlikely so somewhere
in the chain this was stolen this is not
a mistake it was clearly opened by
someone after it had been packed and it
was clearly emptied and the fact that
there's still the software and the
manual tells me that they just wanted
the SD card that's pretty expensive so I
don't really know what the point of this
video is as I guess there's not one
other than this is the kind of
that I deal with on a day-to-day basis
and we'll have no more videos coming out
for you all week as always pretty much
every day I think to the week but I
don't know i'm probably i'm very happy
with how Amazon helped me I'm probably
not going to be using next day mail
anytime soon because I the two times the
mouth thankee so thank you for watching
as always a challenge with virtual video
kinda helps out directly links in
description below oh they won't be
linked to the scripture below because
I'm not to write an article about this
gamers accessed on that for the normal
coverage subscribe for more hopefully
doesn't happen again let me know if it's
happened to you I'll see you all next
time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
