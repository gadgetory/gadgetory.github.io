nexus not nad we're here at Computex
2016 i want to do a quick live
overclocking demo of some of MSI's new
GT x 1080 cards so we talked about these
yesterday in our previous video if you
want to learn more about them what we're
working on today are to 1080 Z's this is
the top end of MSI's line of Twin Frozr
6 cards so they are effectively the
flagship we're gonna just kind of see
very quickly on the show floor how far
they can go obviously this is as serious
and overclocking test as you might get
from our labs at home but let's just go
ahead and set something up here so I'm
gonna set up fire strike to run custom
in the background I only want the
graphics test to because the most
intensive on graphics I'm gonna loop it
I want to put it in windowed mode and
we're just gonna run this and I'm
basically going to keep it in the
background while we tune some of the
settings you can see here we've got
three monitors setup so the scaling is a
little bit ridiculous but we're gonna go
ahead and launch that to start let it
let it load once that's loaded in I'm
gonna be playing around with msi
afterburner which you can see right here
and we're just gonna tune the clock
settings and see how stable it is and
where we're sort of the thresholds are
for performance so one quick note this
is an SLI setup which means it behaves a
little bit differently for overclocking
but we are gonna still go ahead and try
this so 3d marks are almost done loading
now it looks like our maxed 107 on these
particular cards and I'm not sure if
there's any limiting because of SLI but
we're just gonna go ahead and start with
this max I'm not applying it yet because
I want to monitor the clock rate so you
can see the clock rate right now 1987
megahertz and the memory is 50 54
megahertz it's an effective times to
rate and then we have our tuning
settings here so let's go ahead and
apply the 107 for our power target and
then we're gonna keep the temp limit at
its max it's 92 I'm gonna start with a
pretty conservative seventy-five
megahertz offset and we're just gonna
apply that and see if it remains stable
so you can see I've got fire strike
running in the background that all
that's doing is stress testing the
overclock as much as we can with a
pretty simple setup I'm going to move
there
over a little bit hopefully doesn't
crash so I move that over
we've got afterburner here we're running
stable right now 20 37 I saw it spike to
20 50 briefly I'm not sure where the
voltage control is on this version I
think it's up here it's up here so we
can over we can over vault in a minute
if we need to let's go ahead and just
push this to a 100 offset hit apply see
how that goes and it's it's not survived
to that so we found the limit already
which is about where the 1080 should be
limited because of its voltage concern
or the voltage limitations by on video
speed BIOS and the drivers do
automatically recover which is pretty
cool this is new with the new generation
so we don't actually have to restart to
just start testing again I'm gonna
launch this let it get started again and
then we're gonna just back off that
clock rate I should probably do that
before it's loaded in here back off that
clock rate to the 75 offset which seemed
pretty stable one thing GT X 1080 the
founders edition when we tested that it
required 25 mega Hertz offsets for the
clock rate so we're just gonna stick to
that here I'm not sure if this can
accept smaller offsets than 25 mega
Hertz at a time I'm not gonna try and
figure that out as a trade show either
so let's let's do the fan speed first we
got people playing on the case behind me
so I'm gonna try not to hurt their
fingers to a 72% fan speed just for
safety and got the 75 mega Hertz offset
core and watch this is loaded we'll go
ahead and do the memory overclock and
see just how far we can push that I want
to review we were able to push memory to
a 900 megahertz offset when using fir
mark but that is not a real-world
application so it's not really great
look at things and the only way I could
do that was by playing away around with
the overclock on the core and reducing
it to allow the extra voltage to memory
let's start with a again a conservative
300 offset so there's 300 megahertz you
can see we're still running here fire
strike in the background it's not oh oh
there's our instability so we found the
limits again this instability by the way
generally you want to burn in for about
at least an hour to make sure it's good
and ideally maybe overnight but we're
just doing it all live here so obviously
there's someone to take
let's let me back off of this a little
bit make it a little less intensive just
to see it see if there's any difference
here some of this may be SLI and I can
disable that if that's part of the issue
now we're back I was not able to
successfully disable SLI just as a demo
rig a lot of stuffs locked down cuz
right a trade show I've already screwed
up a lot of the stuff here so we're just
gonna do as much as we can with what
we've got because I don't have to
rebuild the whole system so it's do
another custom run graphics to loop
windowed let's drop that to 2560 by 1440
run then this I'm going to back down to
a zero offset on the memory fan speeds
we're gonna set to auto just for safety
because I'm not sure what was causing
the instability these are unreleased
cards after all so we don't really have
the best idea of how they perform in a
real environment but we've reset
everything to pretty much stock one
hundred seven percent power limit we've
got the core clock it's offset
seventy-five megahertz that's going to
put us in a little over two thousand I
think for the overclock it's pretty good
overclock although the founders edition
could get pretty close to that and in
our case did exceed the 2088 alright so
there we go we're at twenty eighty eight
megahertz right now and that is
exceeding well what we had for our
founders edition and Tesla's canceled by
the user it says it's just something
something's not working here because of
the sli setup I think all right so we're
back again here's our fire strike window
I'm gonna look at the overclock one more
time see if we can get something to work
here so we're offsetting this
I'm keeping at 103 percent on the power
limit just see how that goes
try not to stress out the car too much
50 megahertz offset on the core let's
keep this 250 and just see if it
survives if not then we know it's an SLI
issue with afterburner trying to keep
them locked or something so here we've
got the 50/50 it is applying about 20-25
boosted clock rate with a 5103 memory so
it is actually working you recall we
have 50/50 something before for the
memory and we were below 2000 in the
1900s actually for the the core clock so
this is functional now I'm going to
cautiously extend this to 105 percent
you see we're still alive back here and
now we're going to go ahead and increase
this to 75 which was functional
previously so hopefully wow functional
for the few seconds it was tested of
course show floor and all so hopefully
that's good
looks to be surviving we're at 20 37
still 50 103 and it's died so that's
that's I think the limit of what we're
gonna be able to do here at a trade show
I do with in theory have one of these
cards back at home base already and we
will be testing it more exclusively and
more extensively in our normal test
bench but it looks like what we're
hitting here is about 20 20 18 20 25 for
the core memory I'm not really able to
see how far we can push that just yet so
without SSL I should be a bit easier I
think that's part of the problem
that's our live overclocking experiment
and thank you for watching patreon like
the first all video if you want to learn
more links in the description below if
you want to read more about this card
but the takeaway here is that
overclocking at a trade show is hard
thanks for watching I'll see you all
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
