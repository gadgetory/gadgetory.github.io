of ask GN as always leave your questions
in the comment section below if you have
them for next episode next week we'll be
at CES in Las Vegas for the Consumer
Electronics Show so if we do one of
these it will be there but it might more
likely just be a bunch of news from the
show about PC hardware so getting into
the start of things we have a short male
segments this time I guess because I got
some I don't know I guess Christmas
presents from NZXT I got a fish I'm out
here so NZXT sent this haha over the
holidays
you may remember our review of the s340
Elite which is right here and things
that I said so NXT decided because of
how much we loved their cable management
rubber puck with magnets in it to send
me to more of that very same thing so I
guess this is our first ever unbox I'm
gonna make sure it's not a threat or
something like that oh it's a white one
okay I don't know they made this that's
like yeah there's her here's our present
from n NZXT
two more of these things and they sent a
family photo
I believe signed by Johnny the CEO today
and wishing you happy holidays on an
awesome 2017 you passive-aggressive
bastards it's that's not for that the
mail segment I just put that back in
there we might actually use those well
if I keep those around for props don't
worry they're not the big pieces of
rubber aren't being thrown out so that's
that's that CES is next week as I said
this episode is brought to you by our
patreon supporters if you want to help
us out and creating more content at the
frequency we've been doing it late which
is about a video a day almost then go to
patreon.com/scishow
soon in 2017 the first question I have
is one I have a live demo for it's not a
very complex one but live demo
nonetheless this is from a Christopher
Bjork in who says is it worth buying a
high-end power supply just because it's
higher quality and has a less chance of
blowing up so yeah there's a few things
that make higher-end power supply is
actually properly higher-end and the
probably most noticeable one between
something like a $20 no brand psu other
than cable supporting things like that
the biggest difference between something
like that or some really low on psu and
something that's at least half season
like most the stuff you'd find them that
sort of $70 range is the protection so
you get a lot of stuff like
short-circuit protection
OCP ovp for over current and over
voltage protections things of that
nature and those would be useful if you
don't know for an instance where either
through user error or through component
level failure your power supply will at
least to some degree attempt to protect
your system an example of this would be
if we hooked up a motherboard to a case
and there's something bridging contact
between an IC or something like that
some contacts on the motherboard and a
steel panel and that causes a direct
short it's not a good thing but normally
it's not gonna kill anything it's just
in theory it should just not turn on or
should shut down immediately another
example of something would be as we use
on our power supply PSA would be if you
plug in a non spectacled like and I
think in our example in that video we
had the Silverstone and EVGA power
supply if you took a power supply cable
from one of those plugged into the other
which you shouldn't do and the you end
up sending 12 volts down ground or
something like there down calm and or
something like that you could end up
with dead components at least
potentially sending current in the wrong
direction reverse polarity basically and
really hurting something so a good power
supply will protect you from that at
least somewhat and that's a good thing
now let's say you're like I'm not gonna
make a mistake so I'm not worried about
it
other things like things falling out
screws falling out of you know not screw
dendrite or computer get smooth Oh help
protect from some shorts driving from
that depending on where it falls not all
of them because that's pretty bad
problem other things that a good power
spy your efficiency of course improves a
lot of the time with the good PS use and
efficiency with a power supply you're
basically looking at how efficiently
does this unit convert the power from
the wall to the power used in the
computer and if I were to ask you what
is the power supplies purpose in a
computer it's not really to provide
power to supply power as its contain to
the name it's actually to convert power
so you end up with AC at the wall DC in
the computer the power supply converts
it you have loss of energy through heat
or other inefficiencies in the unit
depending on how low or high end it may
be so that's another obvious advantage
and that's pretty clear I say obvious
because eighty plus is everywhere and
they do a pretty good job of outlining
exactly what the requirements are for
each level of 80 plus so that's an
example also where you would gain some
benefit now will you make up for the
extra expense to buy something like 80
plus gold or platinum in your power
savings maybe not depends on how long
you have that power supply but minimally
you're using less power from the wall
and it's more efficient as conversion
and the heat should be lower and things
like that which is not a bad thing it's
just not something you necessarily need
in a computer if you're on a budget V
droop is another thing in voltage droop
if you have a good power supply you
should hopefully not have too much
voltage ripple down the rails and that
means that you could in theory maintain
a more stable overclock how much that
impacts kind of a casual overclocker I
would say not very much but it's another
one of the small many benefits that add
up with PS use and now one of the last
ones I wanted to mention there's plenty
more you can read Johnny gurus website
for far more depth on this he knows a
lot more than I do
that power supplies but one more thing
that's worth showing is if you have a
power supply that can do it and I'm only
using this one you
I have it not because it's product
placement if you have a power supply
that can do it you can actually gain
some benefit in a surge so if there's a
power surge and you very briefly lose
power then what happens with something
like this is it'll stay on a bit longer
this is a platinum axe PSU it's pretty
damn expensive stays on a bit longer
bigger capacitors things like that so
it'll get you through really short
surges and all I'm gonna do right now is
connect the black and the green to turn
it on
okay black and green yes let's just see
if this paperclip will work okay so when
I hold that there and flip the switch
okay we're gonna flip the switch and I'm
gonna put it there
okay power supply is on I think fans
should be spinning yes and now I am
going to kill power Oh kill power all
right and it is still spinning it'll
turn off eventually this one lasts about
10 seconds with nothing connected to it
it's not drawing any power so you can
see it's still on I flipped the the
power switch we can even unplug the
cable for good measure and it'll keep
spinning it's clearly no connection to
outside power right now and our fan will
eventually turn off and this would not
be you wouldn't get quite as long an
effect with this if you had components
connected without any components
connected or not drawing any power the
power supply as far as its concerned
this is effectively a surge scenario
you've lost power to the unit and yet
it's still on and just now something
like a 15 or so seconds later the fan
has turned off just a quick additional
note here on the fan it'll also partly
spin because it's try
to keep the fans spinning in the system
to lower temperature prior to shutdown
this is part of the features of this
power supply but it's a mix of basically
you get some level of surge protection
because it'll hold its power for a very
short period of time long enough
normally to survive a 1 second surge and
then the rest of it is just trying to
spin down the fans and keep the
temperatures low before shutting it down
completely and ideally in terms of
saving your data you would want to get
something like a UPS or a battery backup
rather than rely on your power supply
but an extra step in the chain certainly
doesn't hurt so that's another example
of something good from a high-end power
supply again it's another one of those
things where as a normal user who cares
maybe you lose some progress in a game
that would suck but this thing I don't
know the prices today but when I
originally got it I think it was like a
$200 power supply maybe more cuz a high
wattage one so something like this would
be really beneficial if you are doing
rendering or production we're losing
power means that you might lose all of
your progress on a render and that would
be not good so in that event something
like this is kind of making you money in
a business sense and that you're not
wasting it when you have a small surge
for a few seconds so that's that's a
that I'm more obvious like clear to show
example of power supply benefits again
not everyone needs something like that
but it's not like it's just marketing
there's actually a reason you would get
a high end PSEO voltage checkpoints are
another nice thing some of them have
them built in with LEDs so you can kind
of check on things as it's live without
needing to probe directly with a
multimeter next question is from wraps
up 100 is a regular wraps up says how do
you feel about Nvidia pushing g-force as
a platform and not just components I
asked in the cons for clarity on that
and he was basically asking about the
new $10 a month g-force elite
service so that was something that was
announced I think the day of our filming
of that Nvidia versus Andy
why are they so polarizing video we
filmed it maybe a week before we posted
it and after filming that it's kind of
like that would have been really useful
to have because we mentioned I mentioned
Red Team Plus and these program and this
g-force one kind of Ament reminds me of
that in some ways and the main one is
that it's designed to get people
involved in a way that tries to build
brand loyalty from that user toward the
company so in the case of this g-force
one let's kind of briefly look through
what was leaked because it was basically
basically a leaked job posting leaked I
think some of the basics were with the
$10 a month
g-force elite club I don't think NVIDIA
has officially announced this yet I
think this is all leaks so keep that in
mind but with that club if you pay 10
bucks a month they say you got a full
copy of an exclusive indie game once per
year you get free custom skins or
in-game items for a triple-a game once
per quarter and be honest who cares the
path had early beta access for Talos and
NVIDIA first party content exclusive
hardware discounts for gaming gear okay
so that's something I guess the the way
I feel about it is I okay let's let's go
through one by one exclusive indie game
I don't care about that I'm not gonna
pay $120 a year to get that so most
indie games are probably gonna be far
far less than that and I there's a good
chance you're not gonna play it anyway
let's let's be honest next one was
custom skin in-game item there's no
guarantee that it's for a game you play
I don't know how Nvidia is planning it
maybe they look at your game library
with GeForce experience that would
certainly make sense right because they
can see all the games you have that's
part of the program it's not a malicious
thing it's here's the games this user
has does the user want us to optimize
the settings for the hardware they have
yes or no easy enough now one other way
they could leverage that is okay based
on these games what can we give the user
to justify their $10 a month premium
payment once per quarter so that they
feel like they're getting some
rather than say if they give out a
one-size-fits-all dough to skin and
maybe half the people don't even play
DotA that would have no value for them
so that's that's a potential way it
could be leveraged that would make more
sense than what it sounds like just from
the bullet points that we see online I
still would not pay for that personally
speaking that's my opinion the next
question was early beta access for Talos
I just don't care about Talos principle
we benchmarked it a bit that's that's
what it's meant for and if you want to
play it as a game you can buy it as a
game exclusive hardware discount so
that's the last one that I've got some
thoughts on because I don't think if
Newegg or Amazon came to me and they
said we have a new service you can pay
us $10 per month and we will give you
coupons to buy things from us I think I
would I would say no and I would
probably write an article or do a video
about it because it does seem kind of
almost offensive from a retailer now
from a manufacturer it's a bit different
man Vidya it's not quite as offensive as
if a retailer came to me and said you
can pay us for the right to buy things
for cheaper which of course there are
clubs where you can do that in physical
retail but not something I like from a
from Nvidia standpoint it's you know I
just wouldn't recommend paying for a
discount one that kind of locks you in
because you feel like I'm paying a
hundred twenty bucks a year I really
better get my value out of this thing so
if you get a hundred bucks off this card
maybe not that much but you get some
amount of money off the upgrade then you
feel like it's justified that's the
point of the program right it's not a
malicious thing it's just these
companies of course they want you to
stay loyal to them and keep buying their
stuff that's the hardest part of any
money-making operation is you made the
sale okay make make them come back look
at GoPro for example of that so that's
that's kind of a thoughts on it now AMD
I don't think it's perfect either so
Andy's got red team plus which does the
whole tout the brand and get free stuff
and it's it's just not it's not a setup
I like for either vendor
it's it builds on the video we just
posted about the whole blind brand
loyalty and vitriol being spewed because
people have this incentive to do so
beyond the normal incentive of I've
spent money and have to defend my
purchase so that's my thoughts on it not
a fan of either overall but we'll see
how on videos actually comes into play
because it's not really finalized yet
they could potentially do interesting
things with it
maybe they'll hook in something like
whatever that program is called now they
used to be called grid I think it's
GeForce now these days something like
that would be more interesting that's
game streaming that would be a service
you could pay for discounts and
giveaways no next question sir Papa asks
question for the next sgn what is the
physical difference between free sync
and gsync why does juicing cost so much
could nvidia in theory is free sync with
and and e.g sync we have a whole article
on this that's pretty good it was
written by Michael Kern's and I believe
it is called the unproductive
relationship of G sync and free sync or
something like that we basically talk
about how the two of them existing don't
achieve the goals that we would like to
see which is a more universal standard
but we do in that article Michael goes
and lays out how each of the two
services works at a very top level give
you the basics and you can go to the
article from work so I don't want to
spend the whole video talk you know that
and it certainly could be done the main
points Jesus Inc has it does not have
the same variable refresh rate that
freesync has it's done in the range
doesn't exist on g-sync where with free
sync you have a variable refresh rate
range and the monitors somewhat define
that range and the top end max of course
is the maximum of the monitors refresh
rate she think doesn't do it that way
gyah sync physically because you asked
about what are the physical differences
the physical difference is that G sync
is a physical product whereas freezing
is not so g-sync
uses an FPGA board and that's a field
programmable gate array uses an FPGA
board which are pretty easy to produce
versus when you're looking at something
like
the way freesync rolled out initially
it's faster to roll out FPGA board that
cost money it's a physical component
that goes on the monitor and for some of
the older ACS very popular monitors you
could actually buy a kit to convert it
into a g-sync display so if you're
curious about what it looks like not in
a monitor you could look that up so
that's the main thing in terms of
physical differences freesync uses the V
blank attribute it was originally sort
of exploited from the embedded displays
DisplayPort spec so this this V blank
was in laptop displays and has been
supported and monitors to plays displays
for a few years now so that's how
freesync operated SCID operates on this
attribute v blank and from from the
display ports back and AMD has also
added their own HDMI sort of custom
integration so you can do it through
that interface as well not just
DisplayPort free sync and gsync they
have different costs g-sync cost a bit
more it's a physical component so of
course it's got a physical cost free
sync although it is an attribute in the
display and in that regard not as much
of physical components they'll realize
on the scaler even though it's
integrated that way there's still some
cost and we talked to Robert Halleck
about this about at CES maybe a year ago
or this year or something and the cost
of free sync is basically just
validation so you pay a bit more because
it's got to be validated but it's not
gonna be as much as g-sync that's not to
say either it's better or worse just to
say that free zinc will be cheaper but
it's also not free next part of this
that's worth going over g-sync can work
as low it can work that frame rate it's
like 20 FPS it doesn't have the same
low-end limit that freesync has of
course in 20 FPS range you're gonna be
getting basically a slideshow anyway so
the value is kind of debatable but it
does have a lower low end than AMD does
Andy uses rather than the FPGA and all
this other approach I just described for
free sync they rely on the a6 and the
display that's gonna be the scalars to
handle the
all the the freesync adaptive refresh
rate basically and Asics that
integration is not necessarily quite as
fast but once it's been rolled out like
it has been at this point now that all
these display vendors support it and
suppliers support free sync it's not as
big of a deal that it's slower to market
initially because it's out on the market
now see if there's any other points that
are done that are important to note free
sync doesn't work at least initially
outside of the monitors free sync range
still doesn't so monitors got a listed
range on it doesn't work outside of that
they do have some little framerate
compensation now that I haven't really
tested and written articles about but
that's something worth looking into
and then finally free sync uses variable
refresh rate over DisplayPort has custom
protocols for HDMI as I said G syncs
range is limited by the refresh rate of
the panel maximum refresh and our
thoughts in that article were basically
ideally the two companies work together
and make a more uniform standard with a
fixed frequency range something like 24
Hertz to the max refresh maybe 140 for
200 or whatever that would be best but
but I think that answers most of it
they're not going to use each other's
technologies though that's that's not
going to happen
next question super-good e says
hypothetically the rise in chipset comes
out and the prices of the Intel chips
drop well each tier of processor drop
equally to or dependent on tier so the
high range of Intel chips drops more
than the mid range and low range will
drop in price the least purely
hypothetical I do not think you will see
a change in price for Intel at most I
would expect 10 to 20 dollars but that
would be in step with their normal
generational stats on not because of
Andy and Rison it's more likely that
they would drop it because they or at
least retailers tend to always drop the
price of the i5 and i7 about 10 bucks
when the new one comes out maybe a few
months later you see that reduction but
I would not I would not Bank on a price
change for Intel based on Rison it's
just not something they've really ever
done
I don't think they feel enough pressure
to make that change if AMD started
really clawing back market share maybe
but until I think feels probably fairly
confident in the desktop market right
now and people are used to paying what
they pay for Intel processors I don't
know we'll see but I don't really maybe
I think I fives and I sevens in the core
family of processors will probably not
change in price but once you get into
the extreme serious stuff
maybe there's a price change because
it's a lot harder there to justify the
high thousand dollar-plus prices if
anthe can actually compete in that
segment that might make more sense but I
wouldn't say for the average gamer it
wouldn't matter last question wiseguy
says how are you still such a small
Channel that question got a lot of folks
probably because it's technical content
but please feel free to share as always
and I would tell you to like but I don't
know that it actually does anything I
will ask that you subscribe though
subscribe and share that that does
something likes and dislikes
I don't know comments are arranged and
totally haphazard order spin out if
you're logged in or not we see them in a
different order than you guys do if
we're logged in just realize that
recently so you're up votes do nothing
unless we open an incognito window and
look at it as a raw user so thank you
