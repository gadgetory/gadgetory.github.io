Nexus dotnet and today we're looking at
NZXT SH 440 mid tower ATX case I first
showed you this case back at CES 2014
where we had the tenacity to call it
quote an innovator and the most
promising case of 2014 I'll spoil this
review for you ahead of time and say
that it certainly did not disappoint so
what is the H 440 NZXT H 440 is part of
their H series of cases big surprise
like the H 230 and H 630 which flanked
the h4 40s price point and feature set
on either side of it the H series tends
to be tied to silent and discretion when
it comes to design and selling points
whereas the Phantom series tends to be a
bit more cooling or enthusiast focused
and a bit less discreet it has more of a
quote unquote gamer look to the outside
as a general rule the H Series cases and
phantom Series cases both have
respective styles in this regard that
persists throughout the products within
that line the paneling really does not
change other than size so first and
foremost this case comes with a power
supply shroud which is pretty cool this
traditionally has only been seen in
modded cases and very high-end
enthusiast cases like the antique 1900
and I think the Corsair 900 d I want to
say has some kind of shroud equivalent
but this is a shroud that it curves
really nicely with the case it has a
chiseled out NZXT period logo you can't
ever of course forget NZXT period and
that conceals the ugly power supply
cabling in such a way that even non
modular PSU cables can be contained one
other important thing to note the case
does not have any five and a quarter
inch external optical drive chambers so
you won't be able to put an optical
drive in here but that's not a big deal
just use usb to install your OS and
other than that the only thing you
really lose are the cool front panels
the shroud paneling continues up the
side of the drive scaffolding and
conceals all six drive bays to keep a
cleaner overall look so it's not quite
as ugly with the scaffolding visible
and aesthetically the age for 40 ships
in either black on white or red on black
options with white being glossy and
black being matte as the base base
colors surprisingly I noticed that NZXT
is white paint didn't tarnish and smudge
as easily as some of the other paint
materials that we've worked with it
might be that the case is using a
similar paint to what Corsair has
developed which would reduce the aging
effect of light on the white and reduce
some of the smudging it's got rather
plain paneling all around and grilled
vent intakes on the sides of the top and
front panels air can also be taken in
through the bottom of the front panel
and through the bottom PSU fan of course
which then gets spat out the back this
ties into their appeal to discretion
there's no direct front or direct top
intake or exhaust no mesh in those
places under all the thick metal and
plastic paneling hides a 3-1 20
millimeter front intake fans and 1 140
millimeter rear exhaust fan all four
installed stock the chassis will support
an additional 3 120 millimeter top fans
with no bottom fan support due to the
nature of the PSU shroud and if liquid
is more of your thin the h4 40 can mount
up to a 360 millimetre radiator in the
top and front positions by removing the
modular drive cages a couple of cases
support this right now but no one really
tops Thermaltake ste 81 + V 71 which
support upwards of 420 millimeter
radiator is pretty massive in the front
on top still those are a completely
different audience from the aged 440 so
it's not really it's not a direct
comparison the H 440 is still one of the
best of its size a mid tower ATX to fit
a 360 millimetre radiator especially at
the $120 price point beyond cooling ease
of installation features run rampant and
have made all the right tweaks to get me
excited about reviewing cases again
believe it or not if we look at a lot of
cases and I'm going to be honest guys
the phantom series I am so tired of
looking at because they all look the
same they perform pretty similarly the
good cases they're just not always
exciting to review so this one was
awesome to look at
plain and simple first of all NZXT has
eliminated their flimsy
raishin ducing drive sleds for something
more sturdy and metal e in that it is
made of metal and I've been complaining
about these since I reviewed the Phantom
8 20 years ago when I noticed the
welcome change at NZXT CES sweet I said
hey you got rid of the plastic sleds I
complained about in every review I ever
wrote to which they replied yeah you and
everyone else we listen to the feedback
so it's always good to hear that a
company isn't too full of themselves to
actually learn from others so that's
kind of promising from a company
standpoint anyway back to ease of
installation
they've also tacked on thumb screws that
don't actually remove all the way but
still release their tension it's silly
stuff but it's cool you don't need to
remove the screw all the way to get the
panel off so if you're like me and you
have thumb screws all over your house
this problem kind of is eliminated in
that regard other ease of installation
features include the cable management
pass-throughs on the power supply shroud
and in the board panel of course where
you can easily route your cables and
stuff the excess into the PSU
compartment I would recommend running
your video card power through the front
most PSU cut out your front panel you
end USB and HD audio through the back to
PSU cutouts and the rest through the
obvious spots on the motherboard
mounting panel pretty standard stuff
before getting to the benchmark I've
only got two worthwhile complaints to
mention first the case uses a 4-pin
molex power connector for either the fan
hub or the LEDs and I'd really prefer
that we move away from molex connectors
entirely and just replace them with SATA
headers in the future they're far more
convenient and I mean really what do you
use molex for other than stuff that's in
a case or the random fan controller that
isn't SATA so that's that's something I
do want to see go away but not a big not
a big dane to the score the other
complaint would be shallow cable
management depth on the rear side this
is pretty easily overlooked given the
huge amount of space within the power
supply shroud if you look at square
inches I'm sure it far and away exceeds
anything else out there
but that said my 24 pin cable was still
a bit too fat and required some serious
finagling to get the panel to close so
that
was another I mean a couple more
millimeters would have been awesome
neither of these doc any real points
from the case though let's jump into
benchmarks you can check the full review
linked in the description below for our
test methodology and bench specs in
terms of benchmark performance the H 440
is around average for CPU cooling and
dead last for GPU cooling performance
I was curious about these results and
reran the tests but was met with similar
results so I figure this is primarily
because of the thick paneling and focus
on silence and the damping material and
all that other stuff in addition to
these smaller intake ports for air so
performance was an awful it just wasn't
phenomenal it wouldn't stop me from
buying the case unless I were planning
to dump a 290x in there with a 220 watt
CPU or something but if you're doing
that you should be running liquid anyway
and taking advantage of that liquid
cooling support overall I'm actually
pretty stoked about the H 440 it's not
the best performing on the bench for
cooling but the one to two degrees it
lags behind I mean honestly it's a
couple degrees Delta across the entire
bench chart the couple degrees it lags
behind are easily made up for by its
quality build materials and it's top
tier ease of installation features and
the overall aesthetic and generally just
being a fun case to work with I was very
happy with it and at 120 bucks all day
long I picked that if you're in the
mid-range market the black and red
version is also available if you're not
much of a fan of this color so check
that out too
