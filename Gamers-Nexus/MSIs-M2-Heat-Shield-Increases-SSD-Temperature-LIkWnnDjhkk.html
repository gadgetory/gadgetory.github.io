of metal this heat shield as amasai
calls it that's the subject of our ire
for today MSI brandishes this little
shroud as a heat shield while
simultaneously claiming that it's sort
of a heat sink ignoring the fact that
the concepts are different opposites
really we decided to break this out of
the fall gaming Pro carbon Z 270 review
and analyze this one little piece of
MSI's engineering and marketing before
getting to that this coverage is brought
to you by catalyst energy Mintz Doug the
energy drink killer catalyst mints have
been endorsed by celebrities such as
t-pain did not know that and continued
to grow within the gaming industry use
code gamers nexus for 5% off at the link
in the description below the thing we
were most immediately interested in with
the MSI gaming Pro carbon Z 270
motherboard this one was its SSD shield
and that's what this is right here msi
says that this reduces the EMI or
interference basically not really much
of an issue with SSDs nonetheless if
this pose reduced EMI but more in our
ballpark of testing it's supposed to
help with thermals and they do that
apparently by using the world's thinnest
thermal pad on the inside of the heat
shield and again two different things
here heat sinks and shield we tested
this shield or sink or whatever it is
with MDOT - SSDs that we know to get
pretty hot like this HyperX predator SSD
that is loaded with thermal couples
right now that's the wiring coming off
of it so that was used test MC basically
does this thing help or hurt
temperatures because if you think about
it it's sitting there on the board sort
of in this area over an MDOT two device
and that's supposed to somehow help with
the heat so that was the specific
question is does it actually hurt
temperature more than it helps the full
motherboard review including vrm
discussion and analysis will be a
separate content piece so you'll get the
most steps possible but this is really
just a focus on the one item the full
testing methodology as always is
available in the article link the
description below that also contains
some additional
information on the motherboard layout
thermal testing things like that all
defines in the article is where as a
watch and read for the thermal analysis
if you're not sure how we do our testing
MSI's website claims that this is a
quote heat shield and that it also
quotes lowers temperature and prevents
thermal throttling so it's there's a few
problems here the language is one thing
we'll get to that in a moment but the
shield enshrouds just the top side of
the SSD so it's not a full coverage of
an MDOT to drive and a lot of these have
SMD components on either side of the
stick so that's important first of all
also the shield on their site is
advertised as being able to protect the
SSD from physical harm not sure what
kind of physical harm would befall your
MDOT to SSD as it's tucked away in the
middle of the board under a video card
and whatever else might be there but I
suppose it would be shielded from said
to harm so first of all again let's get
some language straight and then we'll go
into testing and see what the
differences are with and without the
same language they call it a heat shield
but they act like it's a heat sink the
difference is with a heat shield that
you're trying to keep the heat away from
something to this the idea of this as a
shield would be that perhaps you put it
here to cover the drive and then if you
have a GPU that's handing over it's like
if you're running multi GPU and the
second video card is sitting over top of
the m2 slot which of course would be
dumping heat into that drive directly
that's not ideal then it would be a heat
shield it would be hopefully protecting
or keeping some of that heat away from
touching things like the flash modules
directly as a heat sink what it's trying
to do and what it does by way of its
thermal pad however useless this one
maybe is trying to conduct heat or
energy in the form of heat away from the
SSD so for this one and most SSDs
actually you're going to end up with the
label on the top side that's connected
to that thermal pad not the most
effective set up in the world you
probably want to peel that label off for
the
efficacy although some do have built-in
thermal pads and things like that so you
end up hurting your performance also
with the heatsink as you'll see with any
heatsink that we filmed in the past
you'd want to think to conduct energy in
the form of heat again from the SMD s
but theoretically you'd want to further
dissipate it by either some sort of
cooling apparatus or just a thin array
and then hope that the ambient is strong
enough to dissipate through the thin
this has neither we can perhaps talk up
the shield and heatsink differences to a
potential language barrier between the
Taiwan based engineering team and
us-based marketing team but that's
giving an awful lot of slack as for
thermal properties it's an interesting
test subject by looking at the thing
that's got the top side of the SSD
covered but nothing on the bottom side
so we're soaking heat from one side of
em to stick and leaving the other bare
and in a hot air pocket of the shield's
own making
on the motherboard side of the stick
further the shield is just a passive
block with a thermal pad there's no way
to dissipate the heat once it's
accumulated and because MSI's doesn't
use actual fins here it's got really no
chance at all of ever shedding or even
distributing that heat without a side
panel case fan so the process for the
set up was to first use a thermal camera
to identify hot spots on the m2 SSD
accounting for emissivity pretty easily
since we're only measuring an all-black
surface and not dealing with any
reflective material huge note here like
we talked about in our previous thermal
camera PSA the point of the camera is
not to conduct the actual test because
one you really get nothing of value when
you point it at this thing and that's
not because it's bad it's because it's
shiny and it's not the surface of the
drive versus pointing it here that
doesn't tell us anything other than the
temperature of that surface and whatever
reflective properties that may have so
that's not why we use the camera use the
camera to rapidly prototype and figure
out on the bare drive where do these
thermocouples belong and in this case
there's one on the bottom side on the
flash module closest to the pin top side
closer to the pins because in testing
those areas were shown to have upwards
of 90 Celsius in their worst case
scenarios the SSD was burned in width
are doing the sequential 128kb rites for
60 minutes here's a chart of the results
this is in Delta T well gets the sort of
total results in a moment and that's
important because we're subtracting
ambient seconds second for the most
accurate results will show the other
numbers next without MSI's shields it
just using the bear drive but we're
seeing numbers that plot the HyperX
predator and to SSD at 22.1 5c for the
top flash module and that's idol and
61.3 to see for the load temperature
compared to the version with the
heatsink the top flash module is now
operating at an idle temperature of 22
to C so about two South via and a load
temperature of about 60.3 Celsius or
about 1c lower that's an improvement of
1c for the top of the end up to SSD and
because of how we're testing that's not
within margin of error that is
repeatable and approvable and we have
calibrated the thermocouples that said
let's look at the real secret here the
underside module temperature shows that
adding the shield means we have no
escape for the warm air generated
between the m2 device and the
motherboard further there's no shielding
contact in the SSD components on the
underside this means that we're seeing a
somewhat impressively bad for Celsius
temperature hike on the bottom side
cooling for both idle and load when we
add MSI's heat shield or heat sink or
whatever it is let's move over to the
other chart that's accounting for
ambience differently just to really
drive home how critical is for Celsius
it's Wayne is we see that we're hitting
at ninety 3.6 Celsius versus eighty 9.6
Alice's when under load that's enough to
start entering throttle territory for
some SSDs meaning that you potentially
lose some performance to keep the thin
under temperature control the controller
temperature and its internal sensor
placed by Kingston is measuring about
four Celsius higher idle and four to
five celcius hot here under load for the
heat shield versus no heat shield or
just a bear drive so we learn that the
only thing that this is shielding the
SSD from is proper cooling MSI should
either ditch it all together or they
should make it wrap around the entire
MDOT to stick so that it's actually
making full contact with every SMD
and hopefully there's some better
dissipation method but that seems like
it's asking a whole lot for something
that's really ultimately meant to be a
marketing gimmick and that's not
necessarily to degrade what it's trying
to do because motherboards by and large
are marketing gimmicks these days so
much is on the cpu now there's not a
whole lot less than manufacturers it's
got good intentions it's just really
poorly executed it was poorly designed I
don't know that it was even tested
because we're seeing worse results with
it than the one Celsius reduction on the
top side I guess and the improvement
there is definitely not worth it is
patently false that this is a heat sink
in a way that would actually benefit the
user in fact the claim is that this
would reduce the chance of thermal
throttling and from this it could
increase if we didn't necessarily see
any thermal throttling with this
particular drive if you use something
like faster stick than what we've got
here that's older now HyperX predator
this is a bit aged these days we use
something a bit faster than this that's
going to be under more duress when doing
intensive workloads it could start
entering that territory of throttling a
bit earlier than what we see here so
overall this motherboard will be doing
the full review separately as I said the
board itself is not bad it's actually a
bit better than the out of box gigabyte
gaming 7 that we reviewed though that
should now have the BIOS update which
would theoretically reverse that
statement but I'll be testing that soon
the board itself is pretty good at
overclocked well we were hitting 5.1
gigahertz on it and on weaker boards we
weren't able to do that with the 7700 K
the board layout it's good the feature
set overall pretty comprehensive it's
affordable in the price points $165 or
something but that doesn't excuse this
being if this shield were just useless
that's one thing but I don't want you to
buy the board and stick your m2 SSD
under this and lose performance without
knowing it or just increase the heat for
no reason without losing performance
because that's why would you do that
that's dumb especially when you're
inside of a case we tested all open air
inside of KCI
Kaizen a means of 30 to 40 Celsius as
we've shown with most vacations we've
reviewed and that means your temperature
increases substantially so that that's
another interesting test case that was
not looked at but the performance would
only worsen so I take away here is stick
around for the full review the board
might be worth buying for you for a d2
70 platform but if you do buy it
hopefully it's at a slightly reduced
price and just no end up to SSDs under
this that's that's all this is setting
out to say so thank you for watching as
always it click the patreon link in the
post roll video or go to

pathway to help us directly produce this
type of content it is fairly research
intensive and we use expensive
