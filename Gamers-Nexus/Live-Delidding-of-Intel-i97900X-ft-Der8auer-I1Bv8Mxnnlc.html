at Computex I am joined by is herb our
again it's our second video so the other
one might go up later but was an ex OC
video this one we're doing something
pretty interesting untimely which is a
skylake XD wedding right correct
ticket so we've got a deal in ER kit
from their Bower we're going to show the
process of deleting it and show the
inside under the IHS I think this will
be one of the first few videos out there
so you want to check that out before
getting to that discovered is brought to
you by EVGA and their 1080 TI sc2 card
got a link in the description below for
more information on that got the icx
sensors and the new dual fan design okay
so we're going to start the diluting
process now we've got the D letter here
and we have a what is that ten core chip
right yes because when we have a ten
core chip and this C litter will work
for skylake X and kbx is that correct
correct theoretically is also books from
quadrillion hastily but I cannot
recommend that I mean they were soldered
so kind of recommend to me
okay so I'm gonna go ahead and give this
a try I'm going to pass you the mic so
you can narrate and walk me through it
yeah alright let's see how it goes so
basically just grab the CPU and align
the triangle triangle there triangle
there yeah so that's very important
because if you place it the wrong side
there are SMDs underneath the IHS and
you would just remove all of them and
then this if you would have a problem
okay so iran should wrap the hex key and
then just start turning turning this yes
governor through until can feel some
reaction starts turning with a with a
hand as well and so this says let's talk
about how this works so this this
tightens obviously pushes this which is
why this is famous steel yes like thank
you so you have this you can see it
moving so this is the stainless steel
part this is all the stainless steel so
that's the reason why it's a little bit
more expensive but the force you need is
really massive so yeah this applies like
three times more force that's why we
have this lever here we try to do direct
push first like pushing directly from
this with us true and it didn't work you
need it so much pressure is just not
possible that's why we had to change the
design and make it with a lever so just
keep pushing until you can feel some
force and then you change
the other side of the key and then keep
turning until it comes off okay so this
is pushing down the other part right
here till we start smashing the IHS I
guess yeah you should not feel that you
need more and more pressure right right
you might have to switch yeah I clicked
it switch and fly pressure alone
what is it's like a five mil should be
yeah and what what what's the action
once we feel it is there like an audible
pop or anything shouldn't be the thing
is on the sky like the clue was for some
reason a little bit harder as on this
trip so you cannot really hear a correct
you can just see the IHS moving we feel
that you need less force once it's
coming off
can feel it it's quite la tarea yeah I
mean yeah it's definitely taking some
pressure now let's see how close are we
here so you can see nothing happened so
far you can tell by the space between
the IHS and a little cap in the corner
but you can see nothing happened so far
just just keep pushing okay there we
hear that sound
yeah something pop yes so just screw
back take out the CPU and now you should
be able to remove the IHS from the from
the PCB unite might need a little bit of
force as well just try to figure out
yeah do it more more MORE fine
very cool okay so there's our deleted
ten core so we can see they're using
thermal paste still and then we've got
yeah so what's really interesting is the
design of the the CPU itself it's very
similar to properly so you can see you
have to stack PCB stuff so you have a a
small piece of view on the bottom and
you have to stack PCB on top which
covers the die and you can also see all
the SMD parts around the die which make
the deleting itself quite complicated
and also risky so even with this the
litter I personally I would get there is
always a chance to remove some of theirs
indeed because sometimes I thought I saw
that some of the glue is already
touching the SMD so this is really risky
and considering that there will be like
18 4 CPUs which are like 2000 US dollar
right yeah and bigger probably yeah I
will try to make it as safe as possible
but yeah it's going to be risky anyway
so the the die size here we're not
really taking up the whole second PCB or
substrate but are the the larger CPUs
like the 18 cores you expect them to
take up more dice or more larger dies
for that yeah so the assumption is that
the 18 core or 16 and 14 and 12 for are
from a higher count die so might be
possible that the dice bigger than this
might also change the way we have to
delete this this is nothing that I have
confirmed yet but it's very likely that
this is going to happen now very cool
all right so that was the deal it in
process we've got a deal in hit 10 core
here this is the IHS a few things of
note I've won obviously this is still
thermal face installs been doing this
for a while I wish they would stop and
do solder because I mean they would I
guess it would make your D literate last
useful I mean I don't mind if they do it
but if the hid solder that'd be nice
and he started doing solder on the rise
and stuff so
come on itself but other than that the
once we kind of you know look closer at
the substrate for the chip and again
there's one of the ten core ones there's
a little
I don't know just like an icy in the
corner or something that is an RFID chip
it looks like so I don't know that we we
know if that actually does anything
right I mean my theory is that you can
store information on this so it's an
RFID chip I know that so theoretically
it should be possible to store
information on it like your personal
overclocking results maybe but it's just
a guess I mean I'm not really sure about
that but that could be very interesting
as well going back to the solder stuff I
would really like to know why into this
doing it I mean I'm pretty sure it's not
just to save money there there are
usually more things behind it for the
small dice there was this theory and
also the stuff that if you solder on
small dice the long time stability for
the solder is not that good because you
have this expansion and shrinking stuff
and eventually it might wreck the solder
and then lifespan is not as long you
don't have that issue for sure and
thermal paste like Colonel pays lifespan
is unlimited the thermal paste on this
one is I think now Corning it's not as
good performing as other paste but it's
the disabled so when people are hating
on the thermal place I can totally
understand that but you also have to
keep in mind that it's a very stable
thermal place so if you replace it with
a other conventional brand it's very
likely that the thermal like the
temperature will go down over time and
you have to repay so that's something
you would have to do in a stock into a
CPU but my advice is always to go for
liquid metal because liquid metal you
can save like many degrees Celsius it's
amazing you have any any particular
liquid metal you recommend personally I
always use compact a note because then
note it doesn't like harden over time
obviously you can go for any other brand
as well if you want to but might have to
consider that you have to alter replace
after a year or something but should all
we go yeah very cool so for more
information is always you can hit the
link in the description below for the
article and if you have a like a
webstore for this yet not yet it's not
yet for sale this is also only a
prototype I have to point it out so
there are a few small things that will
change so it's not that convenient yet
to take the CPU out and back in so also
it's missing the reviewing unit so there
will be something like a frame you put
our box so we can replace we glue the
IHS so that will be included as well I
have to still make it a little bit more
stable so people already asked me if
this is over-engineered because they
look so massive like saying this new
part aluminum parts and all this stuff
but the force you need to delete this
abuse is insane so even that after like
10 or 20 CPUs it's kind of giving up so
yeah we'll see so if you want to find
out more about this and what Roman
doesn't go to his channel which is their
Bower on YouTube just search for that
thank you for watching as always
