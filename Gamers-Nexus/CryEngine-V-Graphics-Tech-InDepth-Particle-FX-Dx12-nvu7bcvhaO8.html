dotnet we're here at GDC 2016 and I'm
joined by Crytek Frank Fitts who is a
creative director working on CryEngine
which is what we're talking about today
right
Brian gen5 yeah yeah and before we get
to that all this GDC 2016 coverage is
brought to you by raw Fury's a goner
platformer game you can check that out
links the description below so CryEngine
5 we saw this at a press conference
yesterday that's right can you give a
brief overview of technologically what's
sort of the interesting thing that
people can look forward to oh yeah we
CryEngine 5 was a new release for us in
many ways reset on a lot of technical
features there's a long list of
improvements we've done including
support for DX 12 that's probably the
highest on the list and we also have
completely rewritten the renderer
actually to do the proper job with DX 12
we refactored the whole front end and
the core renderer to support the X 12
properly and we're seeing some amazing
speed and performance improvements as a
result so that's pretty cool right so
this isn't just a wrapper then it's no
it's not it's a direct implementation
you know the the renderer is set up to
take advantage of DX well we're actually
going through it now step-by-step and
realizing where that power can pay off
but for the kind of games that CryEngine
is traditionally known for our large
open worlds with lots of foliage and you
know thousands of draw calls as they say
it we're seeing a substantial speed-up
and of course it's a really good for VR
as well because you have to sustain high
frame rates and in stereoscopic 3d yeah
the I guess the target minimum is what
90 FPS exactly and it's it's 90 FPS left
and right eye so it's effectively 180
frames per second so with DirectX 12
we're talking about sort of refactoring
an entire engine
why is why is that important why can't
you just do rappers well because the
rapper introduces overhead and there's a
cost they're just making a translation
through pointers and also what directx12
does is give you direct access and
literally to the GPU Hardware you know
direct x11 did a lot of lining up and
sequencing and scheduling of tasks
automatically and in you know for games
that are not bound by GPU requirements
it's okay but if you're trying to use
all the horsepower that's there in the
GPU having direct access and control to
those things yourself because you know
how your game works as a game developer
you can customize it much more easily
right so we were also talking about
particle effects oh yeah that's
obviously a big thing with CryEngine
what's new on particle effect with the
CryEngine 5 well we have something
called particle effects that's just our
internal name for the new particle
system which is actually includes a new
editor that allows you to create the
effects and author the shaders for them
but the shaders and the particle effects
and their dynamics are all now executing
on the GPU so that again gives you a a
massive speed-up we can do particles
that look more like fluid simulations
and we can do screen space collisions so
particles can look like they're not just
passing through the world they're
interacting with things so fluid
simulation is an interesting one yes
it's traditionally at least in our
experience sort of looking at games a
lot of it in the past has been done with
sprites or sort of 2d images that yeah
cheated so how is how is the interaction
in terms of particles with other
particles or well no you can't do too
much particle to particle interaction
because the truth that fluid simulation
would simulate it like a finite element
model or a mesh or there would actually
be each particle would be aware of all
the particles around it and that's too
expensive to do in real time we actually
can do that and then cache the results
and play them back but in
in most cases the it's not really a
fluid simulation but it looks like it
because we can have complicated
turbulence that allows them to flow like
they're like a liquid would right what
about things aside from particles so
obviously there's dx12 optimization
that's big anything else that people
should be aware of for new effects yeah
there's lots of other things we have we
have extended our audio translation
layer which is very cool the ATL as we
call it allows you to pick different
audio middleware we have STL mixer which
is our own internal mixing solution but
we also now support W wise and ethmoid
so people are creating games can pick
whichever toolset they're familiar with
and audio has always been a big
component of the power of Christ because
you can make the sounds follow the
objects and they fade off with distance
and Doppler effects things like that and
in VR it's really even more important
because you have this sense that the
world is all around you and have it
really feel like it's passing behind
your head it's not only hard to do but
it's really important if you don't do it
it doesn't feel like you're really there
gamers certainly experienced the
surround us or the spatial awareness yes
given by audio
why do developers have to do for us to
be able to appreciate that what's how
how manual is it how automated is it
yeah it's a it's an art form I probably
you know you have a limited number of
objects that you can do what we call
spatialization on which means it it
tracks where they are and how fast
they're moving toward you and whether
they're behind your head and we do all
kinds of fancy attenuation things with
them there's a limited number of objects
that's of like 32 maybe before it
becomes too extensive so you might think
of that you've got like the background
noise this the musical score and the
dialogue that's always in front of you
and then up to 32 different things like
ships going by or explosions that can be
placed in 3d space so it's a balancing
act you know
that's more of an art than a technology
so this did remind me though CPU
threading has always been big for
CryEngine in terms of actually being
able to use a lot of threads
what's the load like on CPUs these days
how does it spawn I previously spoke to
chris Roberts from Imperium games and he
was talking about how with the version
they were using it sort of spawns thread
for game logic for AI yeah how do things
work now
it's more or less the same we have some
ideas for advanced threading but
basically the classic way to do is to
sign one thread to the audio one to
physics one to the all the different
operations and then that's maybe not
ideal if one of them is underutilized
versus the others but I'm not really an
expert on threading so so CryEngine the
big news that we didn't talk about it to
pay what you want model now and that's I
believe the minimum is zero zero
we don't actually pay you to use it
there's no negative value so if you are
interested in playing around with it
just for fun or as a developer there's
it's it's linked in the article that is
in the description below so you can find
all of that yeah and then dx12 stuff
we've got a big news announcement coming
up from Nvidia today that we're posting
on the site and some of that is pretty
interesting as well that relates to a
lot of this stuff here oh yeah and also
it sounds like we're started wrapping up
here I don't want to let you get away
without mentioning that all of these new
features most of them are have a big
impact on VR of course and now we have
we have oculus rift support and
PlayStation VR HTC vive and OSD are all
all in there and we didn't even get into
the new user interface and how much easy
we completely rewrote the user interface
as well it's now QT base for people who
are interested and that's more modular
rearranged where the icons are to make
them the workflows more intuitive and
it's also user extensible you can
configure the interface the way you want
people find the
the vast array of things you can do with
CryEngine somewhat intimidating so being
able to organize it into a way that
makes it make more sense
we hope it's going to help everyone very
cool so big advancements for CryEngine
links in the description below yeah and
thank you again for joining me my
pleasure
we'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
