dudes it works what the heck get right
hey ron i'm steve from gamers nexus
Donna and I just wanted to show off more
of our set walls so you've seen this in
a few videos now but just to give an
idea of how it was made we're going to
talk about some of the basics here this
was a long time coming the set wall is
awesome because it lets me set up now
three lights so I've got one two three
and then one below me so four lights
that lights up the wall pretty evenly
I'm still playing with it trying to
figure the exposures out exactly Keegan
gallic our video editor is helping a lot
with that as well so it helps us set up
the lighting better doesn't eat all the
light like the gray sheet does from the
previous temporary set and it just gives
us something that's got more of a
professional look it's got sort of a
shop look to it which is what we're
going to rather than the modern ikea
look nothing wrong with that but it's
done a lot and we're going to add to
this as we go i have some pretty cool
ideas that I'm eager to explore with the
shop look so basic setup here we've got
some pretty hard to obtain weathered
wood at least hard to obtain at a price
that's not scary so that's the weathered
wood underneath it is a basic frame that
you would build for really any sort of
set wall and then we use a really
lightweight wood called blue on and that
is what we mount the weathered wood to
so the purpose of that is to make it
mobile that way if we move we can
actually move it and I'll just have to
throw it all away and then this has a
bit of a problem because it's big it
won't fit through normal doorway just
like this so we had to hinge it there's
actually a secret hinge in here where
the wall is to separate wall I think
it's right here but it's actually pretty
hard to tell especially from the camera
where you guys effectively are and that
is where the frame splits so it's two
frames we cloned it and in between
there's some hinges it bends over
or backwards and then we can pick it up
and move it really easily it's pretty
lightweight goes through doors all that
stuff so that is the wall just wanted to
show it off really basic stuff and then
I also bought two chairs you've seen at
least one of them now and the two chairs
are used for what I want to do in the
future anyway used for multi-person
videos so I'm hoping to get Keegan on
the on the camera here and we can talk
about games or get Patrick stone on
Cameron we can talk about Hardware
you've seen em before in the virtual
reality videos he's a very sharp guy
just hard to get a hold of for sit down
so we've got some fun content coming I'm
really trying to introduce other people
to the video is on a semi-regular basis
I'm still going to be here still going
to do it as many as ever but it'll add
some diversity to content and build some
personality for for the rest of the site
outside of just me doing all the videos
so that's what we're looking at going
forward I even bought a sort of silly
coffee time II nits it's a nice coffee
table but it's just for basically
holding a laptop and pins like that
you've seen it as own the videos and
product shots and consequently totally
unexpected it produces a really nice
photography set up for some of our
product photos because it reflects the
product I it's it's cool check out the g
633 view her photo is to see see how
that works so i guess there's no real
point to this video I'll I then look at
the cool stuff we're doing and it's
because of all the huge support from you
guys patreon obviously is important
we've gotten a lot of new backers on
patreon but that's that's not everything
just watching the videos is key the
videos are rising in popularity we have
a higher baseline of traffic than ever
before the websites doing really well
sharing the videos telling everyone
about the good content that we produce
that you like that they should know
posting it on reddit all that stuff is
hugely appreciated and this cool set and
all this it's it's because of the
viewership and I guess I should also say
that at a more personal level having
this set up to film really enables me
and abel's Keegan to just drop a tripod
through the
on it flip switches on the lights and go
and it's it's a fun environment to work
in it feels more real and professional
and it's it just makes things easier
faster to produce good content and I
have to work so hard trying to get
camera angles to get like background
pictures and dressers and stuff like
that out of the shot so it's it's just a
lot more fun to work with this
environment really excited about it and
of course the article content is as
strong as ever but we're doing a bit of
video and article split these days i'm
still doing a lot of everything but I've
got some help on the sides doing like
the video editing the filming all that
so it's going well and I am greatly
appreciative for your support and as
always check links on the poster all if
you're interested in finding out more
about the site patreon created videos
things like that tweet at us if you want
to talk at gamers Nexus and I'll see you
all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
