which came out in January of 2017 for
about three hundred and forty dollars us
the 7700 K was shortly followed by the
8700 K launching later in the same year
but with an additional two cores and
four threads but if you remember back to
that time not many 8700 KS were
available only a few motherboards were
available and all of them were Z 370 so
it was a rush to launch and it was
really just after the 7700 K so that was
a big gain and it was one which stacked
atop the 7700 K is already relatively
high overclocking potential for regular
4.9 - maybe 5.0 gigahertz overclocks
this revisit looks at how these 7700 K
compares to modern coffee like 8,000 and
9,000 CPUs alongside modern rise in CPUs
from the Zen plus generation before that
this video is brought to you by us and
the GN store one of the best ways to
support us and get something in return
is to grab an item from the GN store
like one of our blue beer glasses with a
gold halo featuring the popular teardown
logo or one of our critically acclaimed
mod mats with wiring diagrams and a GPU
tear down grid we also have a brand new
black and blue mousepad that many of you
requested now available on the store we
keep selling out of things thanks to you
all but we've been working hard to get
it back in stock go to store documents
access net to grab something today back
when we reviewed the 7700 K originally
it was one of those Intel launches where
it just wasn't that exciting and that
was sort of common at the time where I
mean it's four cores it's eight threads
and it's a little bit faster than the
previous one so compared to the 6700 K
if you already had a 67 100k really
wasn't worth upgrading and it was barely
worth upgrading from a 4790k or
something like that
so it wasn't the most exciting product
at launch but it did overclock fairly
well which has become a bit of a trend
with Intel CPUs lately
now the bigger difference is when the
8700 K launched thereafter because with
the 8700 K suddenly you've got a core
and thread increase and now Intel's
really starting to feel some some
competition from AMD
so that's where things got interesting
unfortunately for 7700 K owners who
purchased in around January of 2017 it
was about nine months
later than the 8700 k became available
even though it was limited in quantity
at the time you can't help but feel a
little bit burned by that it's it's just
a faster launch cycle then it's typical
we wanted to then go back to the 7700 K
and look at how does it do today if you
had waited a little bit longer how much
performance would you have gained
instead so as a refresher this is a four
core eight thread part it's hyper
threaded of course 4.2 gigahertz base
4.5 gigahertz boost and eight megabytes
of total cache so the cache has gone up
as well on modern CPUs about 340 bucks
for comparison the 9700 K which we just
reviewed although it'll either be on
just before just after this video on our
channel the 9700 K eight cores eight
threads instead and it's 3.6 gigahertz
base four point nine boost and then the
cache is up to 12 megabytes and it's
about four hundred to four hundred
twenty dollars depending on where you
buy it and when you buy it and we saw
some at as low as four hundred on new
egg and I think we bought ours for about
four hundred thirty depending on the
time you bought so it's a it's a price
increase it's still an i7 people felt a
bit weird about the 9700 K just because
it is a port that could be hyper
threaded but was obviously elected not
to be hyper threaded because you've got
the 9900 K above that so there's some
products I couldn't age from going on
there which is pretty normal it's just a
matter of is it really I mean what are
they what do you get for that product
segmentation is there any benefit it's
the consumer so we're gonna look at the
7700 K see how it compares to the 9700 k
the 9900 k and we've got all the rise in
numbers in there as well in case you're
considering to move to something like
the 2700 which would be a bit of a
lateral move in gaming but could be an
upgrade and something like blender for
product production or 3d title based
rendering workloads if you want to check
that out as well it is in this content
so let's get into testing f1 20:18 uses
the ego engine by Codemasters and places
the 77/100 case stock cpu at 241 FPS
average still a fully capable performer
in this type of game it is bottleneck in
our 28 eti evidently but performance is
still high enough to support most other
high on GPUs without stifling them too
much a 1080 TI would be a good fit
for instance this is highly dependent on
title so this positioning may change
with other games and the bottlenecking
factor of the high on GPU will also
fluctuate the stock 7700 K is flanked
primarily by the preceding Devil's
Canyon 4790k at 218 FPS average and by
the succeeding i7 8700 K at 248 FPS
average for the 8700 K and 7700 K the
differences are negligible it would be
difficult to notice 0.1 millisecond
difference in frame time if not
impossible Verizon comparisons the
closest would be the 2700 at 4.2
gigahertz which ranks at 212 FPS average
and nears the 4790k and performance a
frame time comparison would be apt here
as well enabling us to better look at
the performance of frame consistency or
as some people like to call it
smoothness the y-axis is frame to frame
interval or frame time measured in
milliseconds and the x-axis is the frame
count we want a consistent line with as
few deviations from the mean as possible
and when there is a deviation we want it
to be fewer than 8 to 12 milliseconds
change frame the frame as that tends to
be about the human perceptual range for
frame time consistency or inconsistency
as it were this plot gets busy fast but
staggering the line reveal helps a bit
the 7700 K ends up right around where
the 8700 K is when both are overclocked
to 5.1 and 5.0 gigahertz respectively
the result is a roughly equivalent frame
to frame interval with also roughly
equivalent frame time spikes when they
occur the spikes that never exceed 20
milliseconds for the 7700 K so while
there are a few that are noticeable in
play there aren't enough spikes really
Marv the experience meaningfully or at
least not meaningfully different from
the other CPUs every CPU AMD and Intel
seems to encounter these spikes in this
game making it more likely a function of
the engine itself at 1440p scaling
remains the same and the 77 higher K is
firmly planted between the 8700 cage
stock CPU and 86 hundred KS stock CPU
overclocking the 7700 K puts it just
below the 9600 K stock CPU showing
limitations of the KB lake architecture
and for core eight thread approach
Assassin's Creed origins gives us a look
at a Ubisoft title something that far
cry 5 will enable as well once we get to
it next with Assassin's Creed origins at
1080p medium the 7,700 case stock CPU
benchmarks at 100 FPS average which
places it just below the 8600 case TOC
CPUs 103 FPS average frame time
consistency between the two is
functionally the same and scales about
as you'd expect the overclocked 1700 at
3.9 gigahertz is also not too distant
from the 7700 K although 0.1% lowers
begin to dip a bit as for the 4790k just
for perspective that's at 86 FPS average
and around the performance of a stock
1,700 with the Intel i5 2600 K at 3 FPS
average when stock over clocked in at
7700 K puts it at 107 FPS average around
the performance of a 5 gigahertz 8600 K
generationally the 8700 K offers
meaningful uplifts to 113 FPS average
when stock as compared to 100 FPS
average on these stock 7700 K while the
9700 K pushes the bar to 127 FPS average
stock we can see that the 9900 K pushes
it to about 135 FPS average stock so
we've got a pretty staggered staffing
there far cry 5 is next and gives us
another Ubisoft title with a different
underlying engine at 1080p normal this
one place is the 7700 K is stock CPU at
115 FPS average or right above the r5
2601 set to 4.2 gigahertz the 7700 K at
five point one gigahertz lands it
between the 8600 case stock CPU and 8400
stock CPU so not that exciting overall
for the old 7700 K but still not bad for
hanging on at 1440p the stack is similar
the 7700 K at five point one gigahertz
is right around where the 7 960 X it's
ahead of the 4.2 gigahertz r5 2600 and
behind at the stock 8700 K it's somewhat
meaningful amount one note here with
regard to the I 5s though like the i-5
8400 and I 580 600 K we've seen issues
with i-5
specifically because of the thread
deficit not because there are fives in
far cry 5 is something we've talked
about in the past recently even
and something we need to still look into
more but the bigger thing here is that
even though there's a bit of a
performance lead in some instances for
the average the frame times might not be
better something that we can hopefully
put on the screen to show you a previous
frame time chart illustrating that with
one of the other i5 CPUs and that just
comes down to how many threads are
available for this game because it can
actually leverage eight threads if you
give them to it as we always note
civilization six and other Grand
Campaign games are all about turn
completion time or the time required for
AI players to figure out their next
moves with multiple AI players in the
game it can take minutes to get back to
your next play if on a slow processor
and that becomes annoying for gameplay
the i7 7700 K ends about twelve point
eight seconds stock placing it around
the same place as the r7 2700 at 4.2
gigahertz and just behind the 79 60 X at
stock speeds these two flanking CPUs
help illustrate that this game prefers
frequency to threads that we can still
make use of both as illustrated by these
79 ATX e at the top of the chart it's
just a matter of having enough frequency
with a relatively big overclock to five
point one gigahertz at least for the
7700 K the CPU ends up at twelve point
two seconds for a turn time reduction of
five percent of the stock 7700 K the
overclocked result puts it around the
8700 Kate stock CPU at twelve point five
seconds and not too distant from the
eighty six hundred K at five gigahertz
which benefits from a few additional
physical cores and some architectural
advancements the 9700 K performs
significantly faster than the stock 7700
K at eleven point seven seconds for its
turn time completion and posts a
reduction of eight point six percent for
perspective of the product stack shift
this generation the ninety nine hundred
K ends up at eleven point four seconds
when at five point two gigahertz a
noteworthy reduction over the 7700 K as
for how much you notice these changes
that will depend on how many AI players
are present and how complex the turns
get blender is last giving us a look at
production capabilities of the 7700 K as
compared to modern CPUs this is where
the 77 hard K starts to lose its
relative stay in power shown in other
applications like games because
tile-based renderers like blender
we'll leverage one thread per tile being
drawn the 7700 K stock see butanes 38
minutes to render the GN monkey heads or
47 minutes to render the GM logo intro
animation overclock and 7700 k to 5
gigahertz because 5.1 was unstable and
crashing plants it firmly at the
performance level of the r5 1600 were
close enough to be a fair comparison the
ad 600 K at 5 gigahertz holds the lead
over the 7700 K despite the two thread
deficit and the 9700 K provides a
significant time reduction from 38
minutes on the city 700 K stock to 29
minutes on the 9700 K a time reduction
of 25% is noticeable in rendering
workloads but Rison still does better
here at the same price category for an
example we can highlight the 2700 stock
CPU and a 26 minute monkeyhead render
time or the overclocked variant at 4.2
gigahertz with a 23 minute completion
time if you're using blender or other
renderers where a new tile is generated
for each thread this is where AMD cpus
come into play chances are that a 7700 K
owner bought their system before rising
came out so we wanted to highlight what
AMD has done well while you've been away
recapping all those charts
if you overclocked you're 7700 K you're
still doing pretty well it's held on ok
look at a game like f1 20:18 where it's
not the most intensive game in the world
considering we're in the hundreds of FPS
but it shows that with the right game
combination you're still doing fine with
a 7700 K so should you upgrade it still
feels a little bit early in a lot of
these titles to do so but if you really
want to spend 500 bucks or well I guess
you're buying a new motherboard you're
definitely spending 500 even if you go
with a 9700 K then you got a bit of a
boost yes absolutely it's just you
really have to evaluate how much does
that extra reduction in frame time
matter to you because for a lot of
people probably not so much not not $500
worth of importance and maybe waiting a
little bit longer or upgrading a GPU
would matter instead now if you're
getting the 2080 TI for example it would
be a good time to upgrade because you're
going to be bottlenecked by the cpu as
we saw in these charts anywhere in the
chart where the 77 hard K is
significantly or meaningfully lower than
the top item in that chart that is the
illustration of a CPU bottle
and that happens pretty much everywhere
as you move up and resolution the
frequency of that occurring goes down so
like 1440p suddenly it's not so bad but
I mean you all know how a bottleneck can
work so that's kind of where we look at
potential upgrade and of course it all
depends on what kind of framerate you
want as well some people are more picky
about that than others with regard to
something like 200 Hertz for example
either way though
somebody's about hardcase done decently
it hasn't held on and quite the same way
that the 2600 K has 2600 K is still a
really impressive part it's considered
when it came out it's a phenomenal
performer even today the 7700 K does
just fine and if you have an overclocked
it's probably a good time to consider
doing so if that's something you feel
comfortable with because it does give
you a decent hour performance in a lot
of these titles but is it worth
upgrading is it's kind of a weird
nebulous area to be because it's just
it's not that old January 2017 most
people are probably waiting about
another year before they upgrade on
average it's about a three-year upgrade
cycle for people in the industry so by
that point you'll have probably ice lake
or sunny Cove best CPUs available which
is when we probably push you towards
waiting on but if you really need an
upgrade today it's one of like always if
you feel like you're being held back by
your CPU if you make money with your
computer through work and it's holding
you back then absolutely upgrade because
it'll make you more money more return or
if you're just an enthusiast and you
can't stand not being the best well I
guess there's nothing we can tell you
but clearly there's been improvement and
the 9900 K is a bigger improvement than
most but it's also more expensive and so
for that we would probably look at
waiting maybe another at least six
months or so before you really consider
a serious upgrade so that's it for this
one let us know what you've over clogged
your 7700 K - you're just curious
five-point ones pretty good for hours
but I know there's a higher and lower
