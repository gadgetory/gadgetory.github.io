here we posted about this on the website
but the RX 480 is already around for
pre-order and it comes out on jun 29 at
which point we will have a review as
most other sites on the web will so
here's the thing the four gigabyte card
and eight gigabyte card together should
be priced between 200 to 230 ish maybe
240 maximally 250 but basically 202 240
is kind of the core range of prices for
the RX 284 both skews with the 4
gigabyte being closer to 200 so we've
seen pre-orders listed on some retailers
for two hundred eighty dollars for close
to three hundred dollars do not
pre-order these cards for that amount of
money just like I told you don't buy the
gtx 1080 for whatever absurd price it is
right now really like 800 to $1,500
we've seen do not buy this for close to
three hundred dollars and there's a few
reasons for that first of all this
should not have the same thing going on
the 1080 and 1070 did where there's
really limited launch availability and
the has thousands of these cards
shipping to the US market or the north
american market i should say in just for
launch just for day 1 of launch with
this jun 29 so you shouldn't have to
worry about availability and running out
of stock also even if you see pre-orders
for two hundred thirty dollars on
something like Newegg which they did
kind of have them really briefly i would
still suggest not pre-ordering just wait
for our review it'll be up day one you
can check the review you can aggregate
our data with everyone else's create a
map for your use cases and figure out if
you won't buy it or not and there should
still be cards in stock at least for the
first day i would think but that is
somewhat speculation it's somewhat based
on industry analysts say and there will
be thousands of these shipping to north
america on the kind of launch week but
just generally don't spend three hundred
dollars on these to pre-order and there
are a few retailers doing it and some of
them are larger but we won't name happen
here so as always patreon link the post
roll video helps out directly subscribe
because you won't want to miss the RX
480 review we've got one spoiler alert
sorry
here I will be looking at that this week
and everything will be online shortly so
thank you for watching I'll see you all
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
