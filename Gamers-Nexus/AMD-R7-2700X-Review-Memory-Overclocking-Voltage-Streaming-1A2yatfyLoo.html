reviewing the r7 2,700 x and showing
numbers for the r7 2,700 both of which
are refresh is on the existing AMD r7
1700 product line we acquired our CPUs
from third-party sources rather than
from AMD
but we've held and iterated on our data
over the past month which gives us some
interesting information just from going
through the whole process for that lawn
today is the day to walk through a small
portion of what we've found we're
releasing several videos surrounding
rise in 2000 split apart for
organization and time this one is your
review video recapping all the core
performance metrics before that this
video is brought to you by thermal
grizzly makers of the conductor not
liquid metal that we recently used to
drop 20 degrees off of our temperatures
thermal grizzly also makes traditional
thermal compounds we use on top of the
IHS like cryo not and hydro not pastes
learn more at the link below so again
we've had these Seabees for about a
month because we got them outside of
embargo normal restrictions and things
like that but we respect an embargo
anyway we have a ton of information as a
result including X 470 vertex 370 r5
2600 X and 2600 4 ones 2700 performance
we have more vrm thermal testing on the
new X 470 motherboards we have PCB
analysis from builds IDE we're splitting
all these into multiple videos because
otherwise they would be very long and
also subscribe immediately because at
least one other video will go up today
and you're gonna want to see that and
check back later today to catch that so
getting straight into it then we are
only overclocking one CPU in each family
so the r5 2600 r5 1600 whatever we're
only overclocking one of them only
overclocking one cv for the r7 2700 or
700 family because or one 7 X 1/8 X
whatever because it's the same thing
so our sevens are all the same and the
our fives are mostly all the same and
they are the same for the new series so
for that reason we're overclocking one
because 4.2 gigahertz on one equals four
points you get your heads on the other
one that stated we're gonna start with
talking about some overclocking numbers
rather than all the gaming stuff because
this is where it gets really interesting
Verizon 2000
the main differences for the new CPUs
actually come from the minimum voltage
required to maintain a target frequency
so at 4 gigahertz on Rison mm versus 4
gigahertz sunrise in 1,000
we are able to operate at a
significantly lower voltage and that is
where the primary advantages are derived
not from raw performance because in
terms of raw performance you're talking
hundreds of megahertz at most this isn't
a huge jump in terms of frequency or IPC
or anything like that we're sort of at
some level looking at Intel sized steps
in raw gaming performance you're talking
single digit percentages in some cases
low double digits and others so we're
not looking at big jumps it's kind of
like sixty seven hundred seventy seven
hundred K CPUs however we see big jumps
and things that aren't performance
numbers so what you need to pay
attention to is not just the raw game in
Florence because if that's all you pay
attention to when you watch other
reviews it's gonna be really boring but
if you pay attention to things like the
efficiency the voltage required to
sustain a fixed clock that is where it
gets interesting so let's start there we
found that at a given frequency of four
gigahertz our r7 2,700 x held stable at
one point one seven five volts input at
LLC level four on the ACS crosshair
seven hero also acquired separately
which equated to one point one six two
volts v core @ sv TFN the result was
stability in blender and prime95 with
torturous FFTs while measuring at about
129 watts power consumption in blender
measured at our current clamp for this
same test our seventeen hundred at four
gigahertz required a one point four to
five volt input at LLC level five
yielding a one point four to 5 V core a
two hundred one watt power draws so 70
watts higher and pushed thermal to 79
degrees TDI prime95 produced similar
results you can find those in the
article below but the takeaway is that
lower voltage for a given frequency also
means lower power consumption for the
same frequency again 70 Watts difference
in that one test to some extent this is
Bening but most of the large Delta seen
here is from improvement of the products
clock efficiency at the quote old high
clocks of 4 gigahertz
this is somewhat exponential so 4 4
gigahertz not a big deal
basically 1.2 volts and below on the
CPUs that we have and for 4.2 get your
Hertz that's where it changes quite a
lot to get 4.2 stable on our 2700 X our
2700 our 1600 X 2600 X rather all of
them for pointy stable required 1.4 2
volts and above in some cases with high
LLC's and max Allah sees in some cases
and we were not able to get 4.3 stable
on basically anything that we tried we
worked on it but close we got was
basically 4.25 sort of asterisk it
crashes sometimes so that's kind of the
takeaway here basically the overclocking
Headroom not exciting the Volt frequency
curve very interesting and job well done
Andy for improving that in very
significant ways so that's the takeaway
I wanted to highlight now again one last
thing here is that in order to step up
the frequency a couple hundred megahertz
it requires a ton more voltage that's
what I'm saying next thing to talk about
is memory overclocking also very
interesting and in height of discussion
with the rise in to rumors there were
some rumors w CCF tech that earlier said
something like 40 100 megahertz would be
achieve of Hall memory overclocking on
rise into 2000 series and to their
credit several months ago we heard from
vendors at some trade show that they
were expecting 4000 megahertz to be
doable not really this is what it turns
out to me so memory overclocking hasn't
changed much for Eisen plus and X 470
platforms initial reports again
suggested pretty high we found that both
of our platforms were capable of
handling 30 600 megahertz XMP for our
g.skill Trident z kit which is the one
that we took to 4000 mega Hertz with our
hashtag rip Ltd build so it can handle
more than 3600 and it's not a big deal
to boot at 3,600 cold but it's a bit
better than early rise and launch memory
training and things like that so it
required trainings get from 3600 to 3666
we could not boot 3666 cold
we the start at 3600 and then we could
not take the memory higher than 30 666
this
Samsung B died it's a really good Triton
Z kit that we are positive does 4000
megahertz plus so we know it's a good
kit this comes down to the board to some
extent to the CPU i am c binning to some
extent and just horizon so as from
memory scalability we did some testing
on that as well and this gets very
granular in that you need to be very
careful about controlling timings
because otherwise frequency looks like
there's a zero scaling whatsoever this
test was conducted with completely
controlled memory timings meaning we
controlled every single time and
presented in UEFI that includes sub
timings and tertiary timings not just
the first four or five when you control
x 100% and change only the memory
frequency plus whatever unpresentable
fied the result for x pi is what you see
on the screen now x pi is highly memory
sensitive and so it's a bit of an
extreme case we end up with 36 66
megahertz potting 9465 points and uplift
of 0.6% over 3600 megahertz which is 0.4
percent over 3466 Macker you get the
idea there is absolutely scaling here
but it's incremental at 3600 versus 3200
baggert Hertz we observed a 3.5 percent
difference given the price difference in
some regions you may as well stick with
3200 megahertz
the difference between 32 and 2400
megahertz is tremendous though marked at
12.5% that's with x 5 where memory is
sensitive here's where it gets
interesting with the crosshair 7 hero
turning the frequency down a bit will
result in an automatic tightening of sub
timings which results in increased
performance overall if you were to
manually in for 16 18 18 36 timings and
allow all other times to be auto which
most users do you'd have the results
we've had on the screen for a moment
here and that's if you set the frequency
manually we have everything else the
same you end up with this chart the
result is much tighter than we saw
previously we suddenly have a range of a
couple hundred points rather than 1400
points instead of 80 70 to 9,500 we're
at 90 100 to 90 300 that's because the
timings automatically tightened to a
point of improving beyond the frequency
improvement alone this is mostly asus is
doing and job well done aces for doing
that basically if you're serious about
getting everything out of performance
that you can you've got a lot of work to
do on tuning the times some other boards
like the Aces crosshair 7 hero
do a lot of that for you and that's
where the difference in motherboards
comes from that's why not all
motherboards are the same it's stuff
like that so job well done again on that
but this illustrates how testing can
also be completely invalidated if you
don't pay close attention for example if
you're not changing those buried
lower-level timings and only the top
ones you'd see a couple hundred points
difference
looks like there's zero scaling
difference at all that's what we started
with before looking at those timings
which are being automatically tuned so
what this does teach us though is that
if you go with a slower kit in frequency
but you can get tighter timings as a
result of being a slower frequency it
kind of evens out you really might as
well go with thirty-two hundred
megahertz with a tighter set of timings
than something like thirty six hundred
with looser times and there are
applications where maybe that's not the
case you hopefully know what they are if
that's true but for most people we'd
recommend thirty-two with good timings
you'll be fine you're not missing much
performance if anything at all and one
more thing times by is of course very
sensitive to this so here's an example
of fire strike which doesn't use the
same API as times by we observed nearly
zero scaling between memory frequencies
even we controlled for timings Cinebench
also demonstrated at nearly zero scaling
difference at least not until twenty
four hundred megahertz twelve into game
streaming benchmarks next we're
presently showing pub G gameplay at ten
megabits per second and faster on each
side of the screen
one is a 2700 X the other isn't 8700 K
neither is overclocked will reveal which
these are in a moment but we want to
hide them from you for now so that you
can view them without bias and then
maybe if you're on you'll see what bias
you have later these benchmarks will be
described in greater detail the test
methodology section that's linked in the
article in the description below as a
quick recap we're testing live streaming
over a gigabit fiber connection using
OBS logging for network dropouts which
there were none and x264 encoding our
baseline test for a good quality stream
is considered 10 megabits per second
upload with x264 faster enabled that's
what we use for our live streams are
close to it if all CP is past that we
stress them with the x264 medium and 12
megabit per second uploads our goal is
to upload 100% of frames to stream and
draw
zero ideally all near 16.7 millisecond
delivery times we also want to lose as
little FPS from baseline non streaming
gameplay as possible in other words we
care about the scaling of how each CPU
handle streaming for both the player the
streamer in this case and the viewer
our goal is efficiency in delivering a
60fps stream zero drops which would be
considered a perfect stream while also
maintaining a high player side fps so
that the streamer can have a good
experience too
we're starting with pub G and streamer
side FPS so this is what the streamer
the player would see not what the viewer
would see both are important parts of
the equation for the streamer we're
observing a baseline FPS of 132 FPS at
average for the r7 2,700 X when stock
which decays to 101 FPS average when
streaming at 10 megabits per second
faster h.264 the one percent lows are
relatively proportionate to 57 FPS
average at the bottom end at 12 megabits
per second and stress with a rather
unrealistic medium encode speed but used
as a synthetic test we fall to a still
fully playable 83 FPS average and 47 fps
1% lows the streamer is perfectly happy
in this instance the 87 hardcase
baseline no stream at all that's what
baseline means its baseline is hitting
the a frame rate cap and average is at
141 FPS average it'd be higher without
that ceiling we're at comparable low
values to the 2,700 X streaming at 10
megabits per second faster brings us to
124 FPS average or 107 fps for medium as
for which was which we can pop those
labels up now on the 8700 K and 2700 X
from the earlier footage technically
8700 K is in the lead for a streamer
side performance but that's only again
half the equation for viewer side things
change a lot and quickly first off both
the 8700 K and 2700 X stock CPUs deliver
100% of frames to the stream at our 10
megabyte per second faster preset with
98% 99.9% of frames delivered within our
sixteen point seven millisecond target
this is excellent performance for each
CPU and either is fully capable of
gameplay while streaming there's
functionally no downside to either for
this preset while streaming for the
viewer for the player there's a bit of a
difference yes notice however that the
8700
cake crumbles when pressed with h.264
medium and followed megabit per second
encoding we end up at thirty two point
four percent of all frames delivered
meaning that the stream drops 70% of
frames or there abouts will show those
videos side by side now we overclock the
8700 K to see if performance could meet
the stock 2700 X and found that it's
still under delivered at eighty four
point two percent of all frames this
disparity is partially a result of the
two fewer cores and partially a result
of scheduling where resources were spent
on the game than OBS with Intel this can
be rectified with manual affinity and
priority tuning for OBS you can correct
for that law somewhat but it's extra
work for the streamer it is not out of
box easy performance to configure here's
dota 2 and the player side performance
for dota 2 in terms of raw FPS the 8700
K easily chart topped as Intel often
does in this game this game is heavily
dependent on one to two threads and
that's why we see the frequency
advantage they are capped at one to two
threads pegged nearly a hundred percent
we're at 181 FPS average which is 149
FPS average with low is reasonably
comparable and within DotA's variants at
10 megabits per second those numbers are
138 and 108 FPS average 12 megabit per
second and medium puts a huge strain on
each CPU versus baseline producing large
losses from baseline as resources are
reallocated to the stream here are these
streaming results at the good quality
setting we're at 100% of frames encoded
on both the 8700 K and 2700 X with frame
time consistency both good at 12
megabits per second we lose 60% of our
frame delivery on the stock 8500 K at
about 7% of our delivery only 2700 X
here's a comparison of the 12 megabit
per second playback video on both Intel
and rise and put next to each other this
is again a thread and scheduling
advantage Rison has more threads to
throw it encoding and medium
configuration which matters far more
than frequency for this task where Andy
is behind an FPS streamer side it is far
ahead and viewable stream quality in
Dallas Kellan AMD and Raw framerate
streamer side definitely but they're
getting killed in viewer side playback
in this workload which is again somewhat
synthetics because it's so abusive the
viewer side playback matters no
overclocking intel helped tremendously
but not enough to come close to the 2700
X again tuning with priority and
affinity would largely help with this
but that's asking for a lot of extra
work and it doesn't perfectly fix the
problem the end of the day more threads
is more better provided a reasonably
similar frequency for this type of
workload
you could also cap game framerate to
further relieve and tells resources to
say 60 FPS but the point is that the
2700 X is natively more advantage than
Intel here we didn't need to overclock
the 2700 X to sustain reasonable quality
so we did it closing out the streaming
section here are 2 10 megabit per second
faster clips next to each other from the
8700 K and the 2700 X they're basically
the same so the takeaway here is that
yes both the 8700 K and the 2700 X are
perfectly capable of delivering a high
quality viewer experience and the 87
arcade does have an advantage in player
side experiences that said if you try to
increase the quality of your stream
beyond what you're seeing right now then
AMD holds an advantage for the viewer
which is easily arguable as the most
important aspect of streaming basically
with the 2700 X you have a bit more
headroom to increase your stream quality
over the 80 to 1 RK even though both can
do it just fine if you have the same
slightly lower quality for some
production benchmarking we're using
blender two point seven eight and two
point seven nine for in-house render
benchmarks the newer blender 2.7 9gn
monkeyhead render passes the r7 2700 X
towards the top of our charts requiring
23 minutes to render when stock using X
370 and basically the same amount of
time when using x4 70 in stock settings
running in 4.2 gigahertz all core
doesn't get as much considering how acts
of r2 works and pushes us to 22 minutes
again consider that this is functionally
pre overclocked anyway hence the limited
difference between manual overclocks for
comparison the threader for 1920 x stock
CPU completed its render in 17 minutes
about a 25% time reduction the i7 8700 K
at 4.9 gigahertz finishes its render in
24 minutes marking a stock 2700 acts as
4% reduced in time requirement a good
thing go into 5.0 gigahertz
almost ties the two with an overclock on
the 2700 X pulling it about a minute
ahead of the overclocked 87 hard K F
I've gigahertz when overclocked 8700 K
is punchy equal in performance stock
however the 8700 K ends up at twenty six
point five minutes allowing the 2700 X
stocks to reduce its time requirement by
12.5% the 2700 X stock CPU is also
approximately 13.5 percent reduced and
time requirement from the stock original
1700 X that we retested on the X 470
motherboard our GN logo rendered test is
the most abusive and stretched the 2700
overclocked to a point that we could not
achieve stability at 4.2 gigahertz and
it wasn't worth going to four point one
since that result in equivalent or worse
performance than stock with X of R 2 for
this one the 1920 exit leads the 2700 X
stock CPU on export 70 by about 28% time
reduction a substantial change for
anyone serious about CPU rendering lady
700k overclocked at 5 gigahertz lands at
twenty eight point six minutes allowing
the 2700 X 82% time reduction over the
high end Intel CPU of course note that
we don't have any intel h EDT parts on
here presently as those have been busy
with rip LT t streams and other ongoing
content for time spying other synthetics
check the link in the description below
for the full article moving on to game
benchmarks assassin's creed origins is
new to our test bench for this one the
AMD are seven twenty seven hundred x
stock cpu performs at 107 FPS average
with x4 70 or 112 FPS average when
overclocked to 4.2 gigahertz those are
reasonably tightly timed in the 80s for
1% and 70s from 0.1% want consistency of
frame x and we got that here the stock
r7 2700 performs at about 103 FPS
average
marking the stock 2700 X as 4.2 percent
ahead at 107 FPS average the art 720 700
X performs about 7.5% ahead of the r7
1700 X stock CPU on X 370 overclocked in
the r7 1700 to 4 gigahertz gets it to
106 FPS average with low as reasonably
behind this places it below the stock
2700 X with the overclocked 2700 X about
5.7 percent ahead
the 8700 K stock CPU operates at 120 FPS
average with lows at 91 and 80 thus
landing the 87 our DK about 11.6 percent
ahead of the stock 2700 X
the i-580 600k is also a bit ahead
including ruff equivalency and frame
time pacing and consistency of the lows
overclock in the 8700 k pushes our GPU
limits and hits a bottleneck landing us
at 125 FPS average or 12 percent ahead
of the 2,700 X overclocked for
comparison here's Assassin's Creed at
1440p most of the difference is vanished
thanks to the creation of a hard GPU
bottleneck that prohibits further
scallion on the cpu still the Intel CPUs
hold a bit of a lead averaging about 10
FPS or around 10% of a lead well hop
songs to at 1080p is next for this one
the 2700 x stock CPU and overclocked
2700 perform equivalently with thanks to
XF r2 is frequency boosting 2700 X stock
CPU ends up 6.5% ahead of the stock 2700
non ex but keep in mind that overclocked
in the 2700 that's the same performance
they're the same thing basically 2700
acts at one 11.8 fps also ends off about
10.4% ahead of the stock 1700 acts
although overclocking the original r7
CPUs closes that gap partially as
indicated by the r7 1700 at 4 gigahertz
the 8700 k stock cpu at 1:30 2.5 FPS
maintains a lead of 18.5% over the stock
2700 x at 111 FPS 0.8 the lows are also
advantage somewhat significantly on the
8700 k mark and its overall frame time
consistency has superior in this test
overclocking gives us extra performance
but not much at 1440p we observed
similar performance to what we saw in
Assassin's Creed origins our numbers
plot and these CPUs as limited to about
92 to 98 FPS average where Intel CPUs
are limited to about 1 or 2 to 1 or 6
FPS average project cards at 1080p no
it's the 2700 X stock CPU at 111 FPS
average with overclocking boosting to
114 IPs average this lends the 2700 X
stock CPU 10% ahead of the 2700 9 X
which overclocked to equivalent and
about 14.4% ahead of the r7 1700 X with
X 470 the fact that the 8600 K at 5
gigahertz passes the stock 8700 K but
comes close to the 5 gigahertz 8700 K
suggests that project cars favors
frequency to thread that beware our
rather sizable difference in data
emerges with the stock 87 hard K is 135
point eighty FPS average landing 22%
I'll be 2700 AK stock CPU overclocked we
end up at 152 FPS average 122 fps 1%
lows and so forth which is 34% ahead of
the overclocked 2700 X clearly there's
still something to be said for frequency
in some applications we have a couple of
other games we test it as well we'll
leave them the link below otherwise if
it'll be too long let's move on to power
testing next this is where we need to
put a note here Andy's version of TDP
isn't comparable to Intel's they've
measured them differently and so the
numbers are not something you can't say
95 watt TDP 8700 K is less than 105 watt
TDP I'm 2700 X Kent it doesn't work that
way
so not for just the power drawn anyway
that's not a power draw number it's
basically how much cooling is needed to
keep the CPU under a certain spec so
numbers are each in different ways for
AMD TDP is calculated by subtracting 42
from 60 1.8 and then dividing it by
0.189 those numbers if you're want
written are derived from what AMD claims
to be the optimal tks temperature 61
point eight degrees Celsius be what they
claimed to be optimal Inlet temperature
for the heat sink fan at 42 degrees
Celsius and then 0.189 basically degrees
per watt of the heat sink
so for power testing Cinebench
multi-threaded positions the 2700 x
stock cpu at 143 watts consumption when
left to full auto settings or 192 watts
when overclocked to 4.2 gigahertz at one
point 4 volts the 1700 x stock operated
at 1:13 at watts multi-threaded
single-threaded the 27 X operated at 46
watts on the export study board so we're
on the single thread chart now were 37
watts on the X 370 board these 1700 X
ran at 43 watts x4 1737 Watts X 370 you
get the idea for 3dmark physics we
measured 80 watts for the stock 1700 X
110 watts for the overclocked 17 hour
Dax and 102 106 for the stock 2700 X
overclocking pushed us to 130 watts on
the 2700 X and that's why I wanted to
point out the TDP difference because in
Cinebench again stock no changes just
acts of r2 we're approaching 150 watts
which is quite far from 105 watts that's
because it's not measuring the same
thing so when you're buying a heatsink
just make sure you're careful of what
you buy and that it can actually sustain
up to 140 150
it's for a stock 2700 acts basically
that's what you're looking for
so yeah conclusion we're working on some
major volt frequency content with
thermals you'll want to check back for
that that's going to be really cool and
we have a 2600 ax review coming up
momentarily as for what you should buy
it's like before except more stable
fewer blue screens almost zero now so
round of applause Andy that's actually a
really serious improvement to have
nearly zero blue screens as time quite
happy with it when we do get blue
screens that comes from timings on the
memory most of those have been fixed
with UEFI updates in the final hour here
so it's pretty stable at this point it's
nearly it's it's nearly perfectly stable
now overclocking doesn't get you much
don't bother in most cases X if r2 does
a fine job there's not much Headroom for
you until you exit ambient cooling and
then for the rest by the non ex versions
of the chips if you can overclock you
can spend five minutes of your time
that's where overclocking matters over
logging 2700 X 2600 X not exciting we're
talking at 2700 to become a 2700 X
that's where you get your money's worth
with overclocking so to be clear I'm not
contradicting myself by saying don't
overclock but overclock then don't
bother overclocking the x-series
overclock the 9x series save 30 bucks or
whatever it is and be happy that you did
if you absolutely can't overclock for
some reason I guess by the X trees now
as far as comparison to Intel we gave
you plenty of charts look over them
figure out what's best for you this
video is quite long

anthe versus Intel I can try and guide
you through it but I'm gonna do it in

more space to think about it so that's
it for now subscribe for more we have a
