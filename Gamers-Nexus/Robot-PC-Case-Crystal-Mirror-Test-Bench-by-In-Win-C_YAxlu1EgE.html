at copy tax 2017 looking at three of
their new cases including this new
Signature Series pace if you remember
last year the H Tower which we covered
at CES previously in numerous times
since then the H tower was the number
six Signature Series case it was sort of
a transformer type of thing this is
number seven it's the wind bot the wind
bot responds to motion gestures as you
can see behind me but before getting to
the rest of that coverage is brought to
you by the Corsair t1 at race gaming
chair you can find a link in the
description below for that is a gaming
style racing seat so talking about this
the outer shell is sort of it's a
plexiglass or polycarbonate so for the
window it's all Plexiglas internally
there's an aluminum shell and the
aluminum shell is what houses our system
components but that's all kind of
lowered here compared to the actual case
itself which has a built in camera so
that's what's doing the facial
recognition and gesture scanning you can
do kind of a left hand right hand to
make the case move side to side which is
what you're seeing here and then it also
syncs up with Amazon Alexa to do voice
recognition for other input we're not
100% clear on what all that is it's just
yet this will enter mass production at
some point probably it will be a limited
run at first just like the age tower was
so if you're interested in it we have no
idea what the price will be it'll be
high but that's kind of what n1 does so
that's the new wind bot we're going to
move over to the floating neck and then
talk about a more consumer targeted case
the 806 now we're in front of another
case the floating this is a concept case
so it might not come to market if you're
interested leave comments below along
with your bag of money so the floating
is a mirrored tempered glass case it's
got LEDs all on the sides and they
actually do take a bit of pride in these
their digital LEDs that synchronize with
the new a 2's motherboard the new am4
board which is mounted here and those
are behind the SSD behind the
motherboard tray the rad slot and also
if we rotate it there are some more and
we're going to get reflection of camera
things but there's some more right there
hidden as well so that's the the basics
of it now there are a couple other
things on this just on this case
including a display over here so there's
an LED signage basically that shows you
temperatures and taking readings from
the CPU socket on that well the backside
of CPU socket I believe it's got a VGA
temperature somewhere I don't know where
that sensor is and then they've got a
thermistor for the memory as well so
that reads out gives you some
functionality they've got a controller
here for the aura lighting and/or Aurora
yeah they call it Aurora then there's
ACS or touch buttons up here for fan
speed you've got a temperature dial or
readout and then the LED controls on the
other side of the case is the power
supply mounting so the power supply
mounted here there's no other slot there
and we rotate it finally to the back
side you've got the i/o Center stuff and
then this Boles often it's just attached
magnetically so all your cable
management happens inside of the chassis
which is kind of neat other than that
this case is standing on top of a
crystal glass base so that alone is
quite expensive but it looks good if you
want an open-air bench in your mansion
then this is something to look for but
we're going to move over now it's the
8:06 which is a more of a sort of
consumer targeted case at least for n1
and finally we're looking at this case
this is the 806 which obviously it has a
bit of a difference appeal to the front
panel so this is a wood panel we talked
a little bit about the tooling for this
because you can't just use the normal
tooling normally you go to a factory cut
out giant metal slabs and use that to
machine your steel paneling or aluminum
paneling here because it's wood they
have to actually do it a different
process I think this one might be
handmade but for mass production or MV
later they have a process where they'll
have to heat the wood and then bend it
along whatever they're using as the
template for the inner Bend and that
process takes about 20 minutes right
we're told at least today so it's a bit
time-consuming and that's important when
you're dealing with mass production
because every minute you're spending on
the machine is money being spent so keep
that in mind now they are curious what
you think the price of this will be so
pause now and leave what you think it
will be I'll give you what they're
targeting at the end of the video so
other than the wood paneling the case is
similar to an 805 in terms of the
chassis it has some new tooling
differences on the back panel especially
and then the paneling the
tempered glass paneling has a push
button on the back and you can pull it
down without having to use the screws
like most cases you so that's actually a
bit of a trend this year internally we
don't know how many fans it'll come with
just yet none of that is final however
anyone did add a bit of depth to the
spacing on the front panel and the
chassis and the top panel and chassis
which will help with airflow so that'll
be an improvement over the Infinity that
we tested previously which is a good
thing there's actually maybe about a
half an inch to 3/4 of an inch
space for breathing and then for type of
wood this one is sin wood and then
they're cubes styled case the mini ITX
box is a Cypress they've got another one
I think it's a 301 maybe is a maple wood
and I know nothing about wood so
hopefully that means something to some
of you but that's it for the 806 if you
did not pause the video yet now is the
time to do it but the price they're
targeting is 250 dollars so that's what
their that's what they're looking for it
doesn't mean it will be that price but
that's alright let them know if you
think that's reasonable otherwise as
