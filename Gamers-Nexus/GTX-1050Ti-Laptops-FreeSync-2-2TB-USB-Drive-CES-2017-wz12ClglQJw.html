officially starts tomorrow but today is
when a lot of the pre news briefings
happen we've got some news items for you
coming up on the GTX 1050 and 1050 Ti
and laptops freesync version two there's
some new peripherals from Logitech and
HyperX the Kingston division before
getting to that this coverage is brought
to you by Thermaltake and their core p1t
G Mini ITX chassis which is wall
mountable like the p3 click the link in
the description below for more
information
so at 9 a.m. yesterday while posting the
Intel KB Lake 7700 K and the z2 70
motherboard reviews and Vinnie decided
to push out hey before then
silent announcement on the 1050 and 1050
TI in notebooks this is one that we've
all been waiting for at this point
because it was clearly going to happen
and the 10-15-20 TI make a whole lot of
sense in a notebook obviously we'll have
to test it review it but on paper it
sounds good
so they announced this around the same
time intel's kb lake products left
embargo and NDA
and the main news here is that like the
previous desktop GPUs in a laptop these
are the same GPUs it's still GP 107 just
like in desktops the only difference
here is that there is an increase in
memory capacity so vram goes from two
gigabytes on the 1050 and desktops a
hard to gigabyte limit to 4 gigabytes
maximally on laptops can be 2 or 4 and
then the 1050 Ti is the same memory
capacity but has some differences in the
clock rate and that's primarily on the
TI version because it goes about 200
megahertz higher than the technical
reference clock of the 1050 Ti even
though there were no actual reference
cards to the 1050 TI clock goes up about
200 megahertz something like 1493 boost
or base rather and about 1620 boost for
the clock right on the 1050 Ti the 1050
is also 1493 push so it's a bit higher
not as impressive as a 1050 Ti but
that's what we know so far for the
Nvidia new GPUs and notebooks they will
be available in quarter one of 27 teens
is pretty soon and all the major vendors
are pushing them already we don't have
hard prices for individual notebooks yet
but we know that they should start
start big key phrase there for any
manufacturer at $700 now of course where
they actually will land maybe a bit more
than that but as far as laptops with a
modern Pascal GPU that's certainly the
cheapest out there right now
as for AMD news the biggest piece right
now is free sync version 2 will be
meeting with Andy this week a bit later
and at that point we'll be able to look
at the monitors in person see what the
real differences are hopefully talk
about some other subjects that may be
coming up during CES but for what I have
right now free sync version 2 basically
the GPU a radeon GPU as they've
specified it can handle the tone mapping
on behalf of the monitors rather than
this action occurring on the display and
creating some amount of latency it is
now pushed and deferred to the GPU which
is a bit faster at it because it's a GPU
and that's kind of what it does so you
reduce latency in theory we'll have to
try it in person to really know but tone
mapping is handled in that regard so
ultimately what's going on is the GP
talks the monitor gets the illuminance
the color space and things like that and
calculates it for it in storage News
Kingston's data traveler ultimate gt2
terabyte USB key has been announced so
this is not an SSD it is a USB key and
this is something that they did a year
or two ago with the one terabyte drive
made a lot of noise then so of course
they've doubled it other than that it's
not too exciting this is a USB 3.1 gen2
on spec and side note here technically
what we know as USB 3.0 does not really
exist anymore it's now being referred to
as USB 3.1 Jan 1 so this is not the 10
gigabit per second speed that you would
associate usually with USB 3.1 it's the
older speeds slower so it's closer to
five gigabits per second so nothing
special in terms of speed just capacity
2 terabytes somewhat special in its own
right it's a big block we don't know the
price I can tell you now that the one
terabyte model is selling on Newegg for
about 2 grand
and on Amazon for about $2,800 so this
will be a bit more than that while we're
on the topic of Kinston there HyperX
division or sort of a side company now
at this this point has announced the
pulse fire mouse they've got
an updated version of the alloy keyboard
that we saw a pact so that was the FPS
alloy then now there's the alloy RGB you
guessed it and it's got RGB LEDs so
that's the keyboard that's it's just got
LED isn't it the mouse will talk about
more once we see it in person the RAM is
kind of worth mentioning that's the
predator RGB memory again big surprise
but this one at least is communicating
with motherboards so that is somewhat
unique in that the predator RGB kit can
talk to Asus gigabyte and MSI RGB boards
so that would be things like the Auris
boards and the mystic lighting boards
from MSI and synchronize with those LEDs
which is worth mentioning because kits
like a vectors memory although cool and
function completely independently and
don't really synchronize with the LEDs
on the boards and finally Logitech just
today announced their g5 33 headset
which if you take the g6 33 and g9 33
that we've previously covered it's
basically the same thing they've made a
few changes but the core heart of the
headset remains the same it's the same
pro geez and same wireless functionality
as the g9 33 a few things here the g5 33
is a $150 MSRP so that puts its launch
MSRP 50 dollars below the g9 33 is
launched I'm at sarpy which sounds great
because it's $50 less 150 verse 200 but
if you look on any retailer right now
the g9 233 is available $450 and this is
a consistent problem with Logitech where
they take these products that are new
and maybe reimagined would be the best
word but they're older products which
are still perfectly fine are often
available for cheaper or at least the
same price we saw this with the prodigy
series headsets where the G 400 series
headsets were available for about $20
less than the prodigy version of those
headsets what then does the g5 33 change
well where most companies are taking
products shoving RGB LEDs into them and
calling them new products Logitech's
gone the other way with the g9 33 they
took the LEDs out and they created the
g5 33 so it is an LED list headset we
have now gone full
circle and to the same sort of end
there's a few other features removed
there's buttons so that have been taken
off of the 533 from the 933 it's been
simplified overall in terms of the
chassis and all the stuff that's on it
that you can interact with and they now
have rechargeable and swappable
batteries which is probably the most
significant item of difference between
the two and other than that there's not
a whole lot of difference between the
533 in the 933 price is the same
Wireless range should be more or less
the same the chassis looks a little bit
different as well but we'll have to get
hands-on to really figure out if that's
relevant and if it's resolved some of
the headset sliding forward issues that
we had originally when reviewing the g6
33 so that pretty much covers the basics
that's the Logitech news and all the
other stuff before it if you have any
questions about how this what's going on
