thought in that and we're here at the
total war suite for GDC 2016 coverage
looking at some new stuff i'm joined by
al Bickham who and before we get started
all this coverage is brought to you by
raw Furies a goner that's a new indie
platformer check that out link in
description below for more information
so total war the war hammer part
specifically is a pretty cool fusion
yeah yeah and we've seen some coverage
so far but tell us about the new stuff
today so today we're showing off the
vampire counts in earnest and today is
the day for those of you watching a bit
further down the line when the trailer
came out so we're kind of rolling all
this into one so yeah today we've
actually got people playing our preview
code which lets you play as the vampire
counts from a start of a campaign and
we're just in how far people can get
without you know seeing how far is the
campaign they get so so yeah it's really
exciting they are vastly different to
the you know 280 total war faction in
any other game even in in the confines
of the single game of total war
warhammer itself they are totally unique
they've got a bunch of unique mechanics
they could raise dead in battle they can
raise dead on the campaign map as a
recruitment tool as well so and they
have access to some really interesting
kick-ass units and they have no ranged
units which is you know completely
unusual for any total war faction yeah
so if they were no arranged units how do
they what's the balance there how do
they compete so from a kind of top-line
perspective I would say that it kind of
comes down to balance and the way we've
approached that in the game because
because Warhammer the tabletop been
naturally has this sort of asymmetrical
design where certain races have certain
things other races don't have anything
like that they have completely different
stuff so everybody has their own stuff
going on you know it's not like a
previous total war game where everybody
gets at least some cavalry whether good
or bad and some ranged units and you
know some grades of heavy light medium
infantry you know vampire counts for
example do not have any raised units and
we weren't going to change that just to
fit in with the total way of things
because that's how they're on the
tabletop game we want to be really
faithful to that so instead they have a
range of other things at their disposal
so they can raise dead for example so
you know if your if your front lines
engaged with your enemy's front line you
can you
if your if your Lord or spellcaster on
the on the field has access to that
spell he can summon a unit of skeletons
and zombies to appear behind the enemy
lines and attack them in the rear and
stuff like that so they also have a
crumble mechanic which is you know which
is kind of modeled on or at least in you
know in flavor if not if not specific
mechanics in its modeled on the sort of
crumble mechanics the instability the
undead units get in the tabletop game so
basically when a when an undead unit is
suffering all the same things that would
normally cause morale penalties and make
them run away they don't run away
they're unbreakable they're Undead they
they're already dead they don't then oh
don't scare they're not scared of dying
they're already dead right so basically
they don't they don't flee their
unbreakable instead they have this
crumble mechanic which means when
they're suffering all those kind of what
would normally be negative morale
modifiers because they're surrounded
they're being tacked in the rear they're
being attacked by particularly
terrifying unit or something like that
they start crumbling because they're
unstable little bits will fall off them
the unit will start falling apart quite
quickly you know more models more
entities in that unit will die more
quickly than they normally would so what
that unbalanced kind of what that means
is your your armies as a series of units
you know viewed as a series of units
will maintain its cohesion more solidly
throughout the course of battle but each
unit is individually more prone to
collapsing on itself right you know if
it's particularly surrounded all being
you know being hit with always negative
modifiers so it's kind of you know it's
kind of swings and swings and
roundabouts but also the vampire is
something the word go they get supplying
units to get fell bats which are awesome
for kind of snooping around the
battlefields and going artillery hunting
or like chasing down fleeing units like
you've got unit vultures fleeing off the
table you know they're probably going to
come back so send your bats in super
fast zip across the sky and pick away at
them you know as they they work like
super fast cavalry basically one thing
we were talking about before was sort of
the almost of physics mechanic where if
you've got a big heavy unit at lansdowne
it does can you talk about that son yeah
so actually we've done a lot of work on
the kind of the effective mass in the
system so in the total battle system so
now we've got super heavy units heavier
them
hadn't you know other total war games
because you've got things like dragons
and when I dragon drops down out the sky
and bumps into a unit of 120 goblins
he's going to send a bunch of them
flying obviously oh she's going to cause
terror or fear whatever they cause as
well and you know basically they have
this they have this big physical
presence on the battlefield and you can
you can see shape different shades of
that working so if you get say I'm
thinking of a light cavalry in it like
goblin wolf riders for example the very
light they're very fast-moving the very
kind of light cavalry now when they hit
you know a heavy a heavily armored heavy
infantry unit maybe like a mid or high
to super tough super armored
well-shielded you know they're kind of
going to crash against it like a wave
off the rocks you know but if you
conversely if you get a unit of sort of
savage org boys riding on borz they're
really tough you know big heavy high
mass units so if they hit a lighter unit
they'll interpenetrate them not guys
flying and so you get you know just
feels more real you get this you get a
sense of things actually interacting
physically on the battlefield in a way
that in a way that we haven't really you
know chief before so and that's a lot of
math and calculations and things like
that but we're also yeah i'll talk about
other kinds of calculations here so AI
specifically okay an AI has been a big
thing for a total war ii the very old
game aspect to shogun medieval yeah
pretty easy to exploit some of the AI
yeah but it's gotten harder as time has
gone on so how about now with the new
game with total war war hammer so we but
you know especially with the the open
field AI you know we've built on where
we were in a pretty good with place
place with the tiller so Attila I think
you know provided a nice challenge
provide you know the AI was doing all
the copyright stuff and we've made some
changes to it for warhammer specifically
in in the areas so reserves is one area
in which the AR looks more closely at
the other units it's got and it won't
commit everything if he thinks it's
going to win the engagements it's got
involved in and in the battlefield it'll
hold some units back and it will feed
those units into those flash points as
its as it you know as as it feels it's
appropriate to win those to win those
individual conflicts so you know it's
it's it's much better you know holding
units in reserve
committing them wisely rather than
throwing everything in and losing a
whole you know so it reads up you know
we've completely redesigned the way
cities work in in cjs for example on you
know when you go into a big siege battle
we've made the city's much more readable
both for the player and for the AI right
it understands better how to navigate
around that city so you know it's going
to make it's going to make nice
efficient pathways to the city when it's
aiming to say get to a capture point and
stuff like that and when it comes and
supports you if you all say you're
attacking a city and you're trying to
knock some walls down or you've got a
big monster smashing away at the gates
it's going to go right you okay those
guys are going to get in the gate
there's no point in me trying to send
something in smash the gates down
because you're already doing it so we'll
wait to see what you're doing and then
it will commit its troops accordingly so
you'll get this better soft sense of
support you know as an AI a lie a lie on
your side it's you know you just get
this great sense of support with it as
well so so yeah we've been working away
and you know do some nice things and it
feels really good so let's let's talk
about the vampire counts for a little
bit here before closing out so can you
tell us some about the Lord's that have
been shown for this one yeah sure so so
the kind of arch vampire for the vampire
counts is Manfred von Kahr Stein who is
not only powerful warrior he's a dual
caster so he has access to the lure of
vampires in the law of death as well as
he's a dual caster right Scott you can
you know when you scale them up you can
throw points into more and more of those
you know unlock a load of a load of
spells across but both those effectively
eventually he can be upgraded to fly
around on a zombie dragon as well so he
announced this killer zombie dragon the
air so he's he's going to be flying
around on this this this decrepit
rotting horror in the sky throwing
spells around left right and center but
also getting you know getting down and
dirty and getting into melee as well
with that big dragon fighting you know
these fighting from so so he's pretty
cool we're hungry kemmler as the second
he's a he's a sort of arch necromancer
the vampire counts and you know these
guys are they're not like generals from
previous total war time they are like
generals but only insofar as they lead
armies around the campaign
and of a combination of agents and
generals right yeah totally but with
vastly deeper skill trees loads and
especially with Manfred because he's got
to spell laws he's got so in his if you
can visualize his skills tree it's like
he's got personal combat skills you can
throw skill points into he's got his
army command skills which improved his
abilities to you know he gives buffs to
the units at various unit types in his
army like Boston Mary attack mal a
defense shield you know all that kind of
stuff he's got a campaign skill tree
which improves you know he's moving on
the campaign map various other aspects
of his management style on the campaign
map you know officer buffs off here and
there and then he's got to individual
spell trees as well that you can three
points into and of course he's got all
his unique quest chains the unlocks as
he goes through the campaign as well so
you know this so much gameplay bound up
in these guys and you can push their
development in very specific directions
if you want you can make them incredibly
capable leaders in battle you know you
can give them give them all these skills
which bring loads and loads of buffs you
know and a lot of these skills stack as
well so you know you can you can upgrade
melee damage for certain units in your
army but maybe you can upgrade that
three times you know to give them a
really a really strong boost so you can
totally just focus on that with Lords if
you want and actually it's a really
valid tactic in the campaign game to
create specific Lords to do specific
things you know so you get green skin to
a good example because they have they
have all these skills in their campaign
skill tree which enable you to make more
money from raiding and looting and
sacking you know because that's that is
an important that's a kind of
fundamental form of income for that for
the greenskins right they're not really
good at trading and I don't know you
know exactly having having a having a
conflict into infrastructure and you
know marketplaces and they don't do all
that so they just bash stuff till money
falls have it so so sprouts on self so
so yeah there you know so it's so you
might want to build Lords for your
greenskin armies that really are there
just to make money for you on the
campaign and pretty improve your entire
campaign in car so specialization is
totally something you can do in a way
that you know
else doing a nother ballgame sake very
cool how about that that's tough yeah
yeah looks like it yeah how about
release date target stuff like that real
estate is 24th of May i'm going to say
i'm a bit jet-lagged so forgive me if
that's where i'm pretty sure i was
twenty fourth mate yeah we just actually
announced a sip so we slipped by about a
month which is given us a bit more
polish time which is great you know it
just means we're going to be even more
solid and stable and launch and I mean
just play the code today and I think
you'll agree like we're in a really good
place it's going to you know we're
aiming for a really you know a really
kind of solid launch effectively so and
we're really happy with where the games
at so far you know it's loads of fun
it's got you know bucket loads of
variety in it between all the different
races and stuff so yeah I'm sure people
going to have fun with it it looks like
it's so for more coverage on total war
