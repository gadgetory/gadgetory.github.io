nexus dotnet and we are back with some
dungeon dashers this game was covered in
one of our earlier episodes of green
light spotlight so that means it is on
steams greenlight service and needs a
vote to to make it steam so what we have
here are four characters that you can
use to play in this classic dungeon
crawling styled adventure it is 2d and
is currently single player but has
multiplayer being added so you can take
turns with these four characters in in
future games with your friends so let's
see what we have here is some pretty
sweet music I must say those look like
traps I haven't gonna step on them ok
they're not detonating yet oh oh sweet
ok so uh if you have not been able to
tell so far this is my first playthrough
of dungeon dashers I stepped on the the
teleporting thing and my guys teleported
so there you have it see what we got
here ok so first of all in the bottom
right you'll see that we have our
movement indicator and health of course
I have 10 more moves left basically
until the next person goes which looks
like is a goblin if I'm reading this
chart properly so what I want to do is
see what I feel like these squares might
send the spikes up so I'm not going to
step on them quite yet let's use one of
the one of the powers here oops totally
stepped on it hopefully I didn't kill
have my guys and let's just uh stabby
stabby alright so we got some angry
goblins with bows and my leet sauce
rogue here just dodging like a monster
of course and by dodging like a monster
I mean taking an arrow to the knee and
taking 12 damage hopefully he survives
I'm not sure I don't have high hopes for
this guy now we got our what is this
this is our Archer oh I did Spanish
traps on my guys uh uh totally
intentional by the way because that
shows the goblins that you are not
afraid of a little bit of pain they now
know that I am nothing to be fought or
feared wait I I mean I am something to
be feared and at just nevermind let's
just kill them
then there we go that seems like a good
start as good as start as any I'll hit
enter to go to my next guy which is the
mage ow oh he's not even gonna make it
through these spikes is he oh there we
go three health that's what I'm talking
about what does this do I probably
shouldn't be messing with those anymore
should have fireball over here yeah
that's what I'm talking about now we got
our monstrous warrior who who's not
afraid of a tiny spikes I don't i'm
pretty sure i can't go yeah i can't go
through that well that's the Warriors
turn very inconsequential back to our
rogue I can't remember exactly what
these abilities do I don't think they're
labeled within the game they're actually
labeled in a text file right now because
this is an early build let's try let's
try the second one I guess I pushed to
for that yep I don't know if I worked or
not but I'm gonna stab him to death or
or get shot to death one or the other
you know as a lot of something hi I'm
just trying to keep the game flow in
here I'm I'm all for a little bit of
damage on both sides let's try this
headshot icon to it that does oh ok I
think it makes her more accurate or
something if i recall correctly shoot
that guy BAM oh that is what I'm talking
about explodes into giblets and blood
and all kinds of stuff you could make a
milkshake out of that let's move to to
the wizard again oops okay we're gonna
try the ice one this time uh BAM sweet I
love that very satisfying kills in this
game and looks like there are some chess
at the bottom so I'm gonna send the
wizard to step on these and see if
there's stupid spikes turn off nope
looks like I'm gonna have 200 a lever
that's that's convenient are they off
now nope they sure are not well I'll
pick up the gold and uh and be happy
with what I get I suppose okay so my
team is basically dead and I don't know
how to heal them or if it's even
possible I'm feeling I'm feeling pretty
good about the left door because
like there's nothing in there so let's
uh oh oh um how do I close the door
since there is there a way to close the
door please please respond uh I feel
like the warrior should go first here
but they're just gonna shoot whoever's
in front to ribbons so the Rogues gonna
go cat I mean hide cower hide I mean no
he's gonna encourage them he's
encouraging the warrior that's what he's
doing I I misspoke there so this one is
luckily an archer that looks like a
human I'm not sure if I'm supposed to
kill that but let's do it anyway okay
she gets another turn apparently what is
number to do let's see what to does am
flaming arrow with it looks like a of
effect damage that is some sweetness
right there and I will pass try n turn
here nope I will pass the turn right
there and hopefully send the Minotaur
charging towards the warrior yep i'm not
sure if they can walk through the
warrior or not i really hope they can't
because if they do the rest of my team
dies and they have some big stuff right
now so let's see if this fireball does
area effects how do i go to the next end
Oh tab reveals health that's good is
there a way to skip to the next enemy
let's just shoot this guy sweet looks
good okay Minotaur is frozen hopefully
they can't walk through him but I feel
like they can let's do let's do too
because it looks like something that
will actually hurt them oh man I looks
good I will that to cleave I think
that's a cleave sweet I think I'm gonna
try and slip in here and stab a guy and
then slip out that's my that's my plan
uh stab stab run away okay good enough
for the road ouch that's a only nine
damage against he does have any health
or something like that so I'm going to
move her back up hit number 4 to do that
accuracy or whatever it is the I think
was extra damage and we're gonna try
number three this time just because I
feel like it's gonna snare them yet it
does indeed snare them and I'm gonna
need all the help I can get with keeping
these guys where they are so I am quite
happy with a tener that sucks apparently
they can move through their own and
snared enemies or allies whatever they
are so do keep that in mind if you play
this game let's freeze him and kind of
take him out of commission for a turn
that way I don't have to worry about my
warrior dine just yet now I don't have
any any yet Oh before I say that let's
try three let's see what three does that
looks like a one I don't know I'm
assuming it did damage to both of them
and or something along those lines
anyway I was saying something about oh
yes I'm not particularly attached to any
of these characters so I have quite fine
with them dying although I will try my
best to show the game in a real
environment and not let them die quite
as often as I might normally let's go
ahead and try and snipe this guy out of
existence you can do this come on there
we go let's open the door with the with
the warrior I can hit enter to switch
through the turns let's get this I don't
know if that even does anything I pushed
one to do the armor thing but I think it
just baked some standard place hey big
surprise some bad guys appeared so I'm
gonna hit one and see if that makes them
stronger or something I feel like it
does for
not really sure what for does but let's
uh let's just stab him in the face oh
wow that was effective surprisingly and
run away brave sir robin brave whatever
he is Sir sir Rogan and now now for some
more sniping siphons always good I think
that number 2 i'm pretty sure it was
area of effect but i don't see anything
to area of effect allies so we're just
gonna go with the normal sniping and
move back a bit and that's the turn for
her so now we're up to the wizard i'm
gonna go for the free spell it has been
one of the better ones because it does
decommission an enemy entirely which is
good when I have a combined total of
maybe 50 health between all my guys so
the goal here for the game now that I am
I will take a break from commentating
for a second the goal of the game is to
kill everything in the dungeon get some
loot oh this looks bad get some loot and
not die so just like in grapple your
goal is to not die that seems like a
pretty common goal in games but one that
I am nonetheless not very good at
achieving time to run away with the
Rokia he's I think my Archer is the one
who should maybe be in the front and
take some damage for a second because
she's the one with the highest health
right now oh yes that is awesome area of
effect for the win please don't kill
anyone please please don't kill anyone I
need those things he has loved the
wizard such a sweet the I mean that the
game looks simple right but it's really
like everything feels really satisfying
when you do stuff so really at the end
of the day it's about feel of the game
and this game has very good feel for a
it's definitely still a work in progress
as the developer has mentioned several
times however I am quite happy with the
way the attacks feel and the way the
the abilities work even though I've had
to kind of figure them out on my own it
is pretty fun so far so I have high
hopes for this game and of course
collecting treasure to get loot is our
goal if I can survive this onslaught I
don't think I can but I'm going to try
if only for you YouTube you are my
inspiration here let's go into armor
mode still not entirely sure what this
guy stuff does ok you can shadow step
into the middle of them that seems bad
so I'm gonna try I think three bakes him
go like stealth mode but because of my
low health I'm actually gonna do it
anyway wait did he just take damage from
that I don't know what just happened um
backstab mode ? oh oh no oh rip update
rogue is dead did not mean to end the
turn there but alas I did and the rogue
is probably not going to survive that
although it looks like he's in a stealth
mode right now so I have as much hope as
I can possibly place in that I suppose
without knowing exactly what that mode
is or what it's doing that looks bad
that looks like a lich or something I'm
gonna fireball it and it has been fire
bald apparently has 90 health because it
only took a 30 damage and it's one third
down oh they spawn things oh no no I
know a stealth mode was not stealth mode
or I misunderstood it but that's the fun
of playing a game blindly so looks like
our warrior is holding strong ish i'm
gonna try number three again that seems
to work yes i like that and our armor
mode and let's use this archers explodey
arrow to explode ethan's there we go got
some stuff exploded new verb by the way
and time to retreat a little bit past
the turn and hopefully not die
immediately if they are indeed going to
keep spawning things and i met to health
in the front here so he's dead yes he is
so dead mark my words
next hit dead dead game uh-oh next hit
hit after this hit ah that's in cleve
quite like I wanted to uh oh not a
faction fights it took a chance and I'm
gonna die for it well I guess I might as
well hit as much as I can before he dies
oh man and that was that was quite a
good potentially last blow from him not
sure which to click not sure I feel like
playing a meanie miney moe or something
eenie meenie miney moe catch a zombie by
the toe if he hollers cut his head off
frozen that seems good to me poor wizard
man that poor wizard what did he ever do
to deserve this other than be a wizard
in a dungeon that that's always a bad
first step in your career who wakes up
and says I want to be squishy for a
living so I've got a choice here of
running and not getting too far or
picking up that gold pile to the right
and then dying immediately I'm gonna run
I'm gonna run like the the heroine she
is I wonder if I could use those spikes
to my advantage maybe I can run down
there and then hit that intentionally
trigger the spikes while their pet oh
that plan might not work out after all I
did I really sincerely did not think
they would make it all the way up to her
because the skeletons have seemed slow
thus far so what I'm gonna do set the
spikes off and then just blast them as
they come through the wizard if he makes
it that far down if I don't make it to
this then oh it sounds like they went
off excellent that is good news for me
yes they went off hopefully the
skeletons died just walking through them
I don't think they're smart enough to
not walk through them so we will see if
metagaming has Gansey oh oh I see it
just straight up close the door that's
not what I wanted to do huh that's
interesting
I can't even reach goodbye cruel dungeon
quest failed seems like as good a start
as any at least given our track record
on UTV or mine I should say so that is
the gist of dungeon dashers as it stands
now it is quite simple because it is
still in full development go support the
developers search for actually just
visit description below click on all the
links that you want to click on if you
like this game it is pretty sweet as far
as the gameplay goes I'm very happy with
mechanics multiplayer is also coming
soon so hopefully we can really really
get some enjoyment out of this game with
up to four friends I believe is the
promise although again full development
and all of that so disclaimers as
necessary it looks like there are
different load outs here so do keep that
in mind you can actually get some load
outs I believe currently anyone who buys
the game will get access to this game
that I am playing right now so do check
it out if you like it and if not we do
have more games coming soon so keep an
eye open on the channel and with that I
will see you guys next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
