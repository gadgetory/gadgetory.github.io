this is the 2003 designed NZXT guardian
just for sort of a reference point
that's the phantom next with design much
later so this is the Guardian this case
has a included top-mounted 400 watt
power supply which actually now with TDP
being lower it is a good amount of
wattage and for fan spec it's all I
think 80 millimeters so 80 millimeter on
the side and then two in the back and a
weird sort of purple thin that mounts to
the back of the case not really sure
what it does or if it's effective but
that was how they were mounted back in
the day and if you look at the purple
colors in this case the guardian it does
kind of look like the purple that NZXT
has just switched to so kind of an
interesting side note there for things
that you might not know the Guardian is
actually signed on the inside let me see
if I can show this off so this is the
front panel obviously you kind of remove
it like that and it's got johnny the
CEOs signature inside back before NZXT
was the force that it is today so that
sign of david has 2003 and then
internally this particular model despite
what it looks like did pass quality
control back in 2005 but it's been a few
years since then so we have to be
careful with it the front has this
super-awesome reflective i guess like 10
or aluminum coded into something shiny
for I guess and I we need to light off
of and then there's these hidden trap
doors for your two USB ports I don't
know if that's maybe USB one maybe two
and then 23.5 over here so that's the
Guardian I'm not going to close that
because a little stuck it's an old case
it's I guess the the main point the NZXT
made with this case the statement that
NZXT made when it was mostly just Johnny
kind of running things is that it had a
side window so that was kind of new and
then it wasn't beige also new an antec
is another company to look at in that
space of kind of revolutionizing the
case market antec I believe from thought
my head was the first company to do a
cardboard box for a case that wasn't
just brown so there's two things you
didn't know about the case market when
it was older and check back soon for
more an txt coverage because we have
stuff coming out pretty shortly and some
of that will include the air RGB fans
that we've already talked about thanks
for watching as always patreon like the
personal video subscribe for more I'll
see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
