this is mm redesigned NZXT guardian just
for sort of her reference point that's
the phantom next to it design much later
so this is the Guardian this case has a
included top mounted 400 watt power
supply which actually now with TDP being
lower it is a good amount of wattage and
for fan spec it's all I think 80
millimeters so 80 millimeter on the side
and then two in the back and a weird
sort of purple thin that mounts to the
back of the case not really sure what it
does or if it's effective but that was
how they were mounted back in the day
and if you look at the purple colors in
this case the Guardian it does kind of
look like the purple that NZXT has just
switched to so kind of an interesting
side note there for things that you
might not know the guardian is actually
signed on the inside let me see if I can
show this off so this is the front panel
obviously you can kind of remove it like
that and it's got Johnny the CEOs
signature inside back before NZXT was
the force that it is today so that sign
of David has 2003 and then internally
this particular model despite what it
looks like did pass quality control back
in 2005 but it's been a few years since
then so we have to be careful with it
the front has this super awesome
reflective I guess like 10 or
aluminum-coated into something shiny for
I guess and I only need to light off of
and then there's these hidden trap doors
for your two USB ports I don't know if
that's maybe USB one maybe two and then
23.5 over here so that's the Guardian
I'm not gonna close that because a
little stuck it's an old case it's I
guess the the main point that NZXT made
with this case the statement that NZXT
made when it was mostly just Johnny kind
of running things is that it had a side
window so that was kind of new and then
it wasn't beige also new an antic is
another company to look at in that
phase of kind of revolutionising the
case market antic I believe from the top
my head was the first company to do a
cardboard box for a case that wasn't
just brown so there's two things you
didn't know about the case market when
it was older and check back soon for
more and EXT coverage because we have
stuff coming out pretty shortly and some
of that will include the air RGB fans
that we've already talked about thanks
for watching as always patreon like the
personal video subscribe for more I'll
see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
