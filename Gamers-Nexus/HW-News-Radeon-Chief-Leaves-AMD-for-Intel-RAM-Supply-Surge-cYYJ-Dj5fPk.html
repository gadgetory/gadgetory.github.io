has an extra screw I guess they just
included it in the box so it's just
laying around after done rebuilding the
thing so this is our hardware news recap
for the week we have the big of course
Intel and AMD combo item news and some
still pending stories about rajasah
Dory's potential departure from AMD be
talking about Backblaze reliability
testing on their drives as they release
annually at this point and then some
news from the DRAM side of the industry
where samsung has apparently caught wind
that oh actually there is limited memory
supply right now so they're gonna start
making more memory so that took a little
while but that's what we've got this
week before we get into that this
content is brought to you by the
Thermaltake flow RGB closed-loop liquid
cooler which is a three hundred sixty
millimeter radiator plus three 120 fans
that are RGB illuminated the if then
we'll take it rain fans at that this is
a 4.5 done a detect pump which is one of
the faster pumps you can learn more at
the link in the description below so
first one is recapping a news story that
we published on the website a few days
ago this is Intel and Andy working
together to build a new mobile chip so
as the title of the article said when we
published it in other news hell has
frozen over so Antonio they are actually
working together this is legitimate news
at this point they both threw these
press releases and basically what's
going to happen is they're working on a
new ultra-thin product so this should
maybe kind of look at the specs the
power requirements things like that it
should be able to outdo just about
anything
Nvidia can do at the same form factor so
if it comes together the pen how many
ciues are in the GPU element that Andy
is providing it could be a pretty
powerful chip now this is an addition to
Andy's rise in mobile announcement where
they already are sort of vying for more
mobile and portable market share so
Intel and AMD working together it's
going to be using the Intel 8j
Coffee like CPU for the foundation and
then we don't know exactly what Radeon
graphics solution is in there yet but we
do know it is a Radeon graphics solution
and we do know it's using HP AM - we
just don't know what the Cu count is at
this point the GPU is still technically
discrete but it is integrated in a
different way so there will still be the
IGP from Intel and that'll still be on
the coffee like thigh however there's
also going to be the Radeon discrete GPU
sort of that's connected by email which
we'll go over in a moment and this will
allow toggling between the two GPUs so
for low load video encode decode
watching YouTube at 4k things like that
you use the IGP from Intel and then for
anything more taxing you use the AMD
radeon GPU which should help with power
consumption concerns but also still
provide a pretty hefty GPU compute
capability that theoretically will be
competitive with int with nvidia
primarily at the form factor so that's
what we're looking at for the new
collaboration between AMD and Intel so
then the new chip package will again be
part of the eighth generation lineup and
it's going to combine a core h-series
processor with a custom and the Radeon
graphics solution with stacked HBM to
the silicon will be housed on one
package or substrate and we'll use
Intel's e mabh or embedded multi die
interconnect bridge to share a power and
communication framework anytime there
are multiple chips or dyes on one
package there's an issue of managing
power bandwidth coms between them and
this is an issue that Andy's already
pretty much solved at their infinity
fabric and it's unlikely that sharing
proprietary technology is within the
purview of this arrangement essentially
email will allow for heterogeneous
pieces of silicon to communicate back
and forth so this does a few major
things one is it eliminates the need to
use an inner poser
which you would need to do for for
example Vega uses an inner poser that's
the bit that the HB on of the corset on
top of or the GPU die so it eliminates
that which means that your
in cost and it simplifies the packaging
process well there's there's new
challenges in packaging but it removes
one step from the manufacturing process
because interposer yield is also a
concern so that's eliminated and emmab
also reduces concerns of running into
the radical limit when you're dealing
with large monolithic dyes so it's sort
of modular eyeses and pieces out the
different components of the cpu or
whatever the component may be rather
than making a gigantic monolithic die
where you the larger you go with the die
the more you have issues with yield so
your yields go down which means your
costs a consumer goes up because your
cost to make it goes up you're throwing
away more chips as a result of the lower
yields and also there are just
technological lithographic limitations
to how large dye can actually be when
it's coming out of the fab based on the
radical limit so that's a problem and
that's also resolved by taking this
approach it's very similar to some other
things we've seen Intel has been doing
this with FPGA boards for a little while
now and Andy of course famously has
introduced the multi die solution to a
product with Rison and theoretically
with Navi in the future this looks to be
the way of the future
NVIDIA has released its own white papers
on multi chip modules and using them to
resolve for lithographic limitations
reduced size of the individual die
components then yields not as big of a
problem and you can somewhat modularize
the design so you pick and choose the
parts you want based on what the
customer is who the customer is so it's
really interesting this Intel and Andy
combo I think we'll see how it shapes
out but right now it definitely looks
pretty competitive for the ultra thin
market to the point where they're going
to be able to reduce the size of the
motherboard within the laptop which
changes a whole lot of parameters one of
which is the size of the laptop
of course and it reduces about 2.9
square inches and that means that you
could either use that space for other
things we get rid of it and reduce the
size laptop as a whole it's a really
cool stuff something to pay attention to
we have an article on it on the website
and then I'll give a shout to an attack
who have their own article on it that's
also pretty good and worth checking out
if you are interested in learning more
this next story is still technically
unofficial so subject to change
depending on this may become official or
may be debunked by the time we publish
but looks pretty legitimate so hexxus
reports that it has allegedly obtained
an internal letter from radion
technologies group head roger Kaduri
and the letter allegedly states that
roger will be moving on from AMD with an
indeterminate future in the industry we
don't know what he's doing next we've
previously worked with roger Kaduri so
we have I think to interview videos with
him shot in there Sunnyvale California
offices where Kaduri talks about the
future of big graphic solutions in
general including large scale much
higher resolution VR which was less a
point about VR and more a point about
achieving very high resolution graphics
that are ultra realistic so we talked
with him about things like that about
the time scale for making those things
rajae basically said to me that his goal
was I want to be able to play I figure
out the resolution was but I want to be
able to play ultra realistic VR before
I'm dead or retired that was his goal so
it's a very ambitious goal and if he
leaves AMD and leaves RTG it's
definitely a big impact to the the face
of the that part of the company at least
to the RTG the Radeon technologies group
Raja is a smart guy the interviews with
him if you haven't seen them they're
worth going back and checking on our
channel just search for probably Raja
Kaduri and you'll find them but until
we've got more confirmed here there's
not much else to say but it does sound
like Raja will be leaving
in the company if not if he hasn't left
already and this follows the 40 days
sabbatical that he took previously which
I think that number 40 that he he uses
or it sounds like he's trying to use
symbolically in the letter I think that
is the same number he gave me when we
were talking about the future of VR or
the future of super high-resolution
graphics I think we were talking about
40 years in the future or something like
that so he's got he's got a an
interesting fixation on the number 40
that if you watch some of the previous
discussions we had with him it does sort
of come together so yeah interesting
news we'll see if it turns out to be
true or not in our next story back play
is an online data backup and storage
service has reported their reliability
numbers for the last quarter and at
Backblaze is responsible for backing up
your files business files things like
that they buy thousands of hard drives
and they take careful note of who made
said failed drive so that they can not
buy those again in the future
so the newest study shows that it
primarily focuses on large drives
including 10 and 12 terabyte drives the
first time they looking at things that
large as a report for a quarter 3 of
2017 as at most other cloud storage
enterprises they are moving to
high-capacity drives like these and so
far they've deployed 1220 10 terabyte
drives and 2012 terabyte drives smaller
sample size there of these drives none
have failed yet with the combines I
guess they're actually getting towards
13,000 Drive days in operation for those
higher capacity drives so they've had no
failures with those just yet
the report does also suggest that
there's a narrow gap between enterprise
and consumer drives in terms of
reliability Backblaze found a difference
of 0.1 percent between the two I don't
know what their error margins are but
generally speaking that's pretty much
within them so one point one at one
point two percent failure globally
across all the tribes between enterprise
and consumer and then this is 2013 the
2017 cumulative data here now
for drive failure rates put annualized
there at five percent total for three
terabyte drives regardless of make and
brand two percent failure for four
terabyte drives 1.9 percent failure for
six terabyte drives and 10.1 percent
failure for eight terabyte drive so
going down for the higher capacity
drives as we move forward the next news
item is a thread refer block this is
water cool heat killer block and it's
supposed to be a dedicated block for the
thread Ripper TR for socket specifically
and it was originally targeted for
September release but they were delayed
for so far unknown reasons the heat
killer for thread Ripper block will come
in a few different SKUs including one
that has pre-installed RGB LEDs
compatible with x3 99 motherboards and
as we've shown in previous content full
coverage blocks on thread Ripper matter
the most it's the most important thing
is to cover that whole IHS and get the
heat away from it so pay attention to
that if you are buying thread River so
the next one this one had been asked
about a lot Lian Li announced an alpha
550 case when we were at combi tags and
we showed it we haven't seen it since
Computex but that is finally ready for
market it's basically all steel and
glass it's not aluminum for once really
only they don't only do peasant
materials like steel but they've done it
this time so that people can actually
buy it and this is a bit of a departure
from their styling because of that it
has four tempered glass panels enclosing
the steel chassis and then it comes with
three 120 millimeter RGB fans for the
front with the alpha 550 also
accommodating vertical GD orientation
via riser cables also a big trend now
and offering the radiator support in the
front and the top at 360 and for 20
millimeters respectively and it's also
supposed to come in black and white
finishes and will sell for around $240
which is very cheap for Lian Li but
still pretty expensive we're gonna try
and look at that one I don't have a
contact active contact with Liang Li I
don't think
we'll try and get it next once Amazon
sews Amazon is set to increase DRAM
production they say according to a
report published by Electronic Times
Samsung is currently unhappy with the
DRAM market at present
apparently Samsung has been gearing up
to bolsters over there somebody conduct
their lines since early October with
mass production in mind for first
quarter 2018
Samsung is the biggest memory maker in
the world and assuming the reports are
true it could mean that Samsung the
increased output could disrupt the tight
supply and finally dilute RAM prices a
bit
samsung's current plan would increase
DRAM supply by more than 20 percent from
their lines and hopefully that actually
happens because right now it Paul has a
video about this that's very popular for
good reason right now building pcs kind
of sucks in some ways this is why one of
the earliest backbones of the site if
gamers access net before the YouTube
channel was posting PC builds sometimes
weekly always at least monthly and those
are pretty much stopped for the last
several months
that's because memory prices are so high
a GPU prices have been all over the
place so if we could just get one of
those components back to normal that
would be great
that'd make it a lot more feasible to
build a new system as opposed to try and
part stuff out used last news item of
the week is the Titan XP collector's
edition Star Wars video cards so some of
you asked what I thought of the Titan XP
collector's edition earlier this week
when it was a 12 second teaser video and
I basically said I have no thoughts
until they reveal more well they've
basically revealed that their Star Wars
Edition cards so if you're a major Star
Wars fan I guess the cards have that
look to them they're $1200 so
technically they're the same price as
the Titan XP when it launched that
doesn't change the fact that the 1080 Ti
is a way better buy for 98 percent of
our audience because if your gaming just
get the 1080i and honestly if you're
doing that anyway
you're spending seven to eight hundred
dollars on a 1080i you could probably
spend less than the difference to the
Titan XP and have some mod it for you
and do a pretty good job but yeah I I
don't really have any thoughts on this
I guess this probably partly comes down
to limited competition because it's just
like what else is nvidia gonna do they
can they can rebadge the card and sell
it for the same amount or more or
whatever and there's no reason for them
not to as far as they're concerned so
what was that Star Wars quote
so I guess if you like Star Wars it's
worth it
I'm sorry but no not really no that's
all for the news a quick note on Xbox
content we're working on so we have some
FPS benchmarks that are probably done by
the time this goes live it's the first
time we've ever done the FPS benchmarks
for a console we've got software for it
that we developed in the house pretty
excited about it definitely check back
for that shortly within the next day or
so if not sooner and we also have
thermals and power testing for the Xbox
during the same workloads some errata
for the Xbox content we published
already the frequency the GPU frequency
is actually 1172 megahertz not 1720 and
the memory frequency effective or actual
memory frequency is 1700 megahertz so
some original information disseminated
by by Luke that was seventeen hundred
megahertz but yeah it's it's actually
eleven seventy two so just wanted to
point that out because I said 1700 as
well because I source from them because
we don't have a contact on Microsoft so
correction there but still Polaris still
for TCU's at eleven seventy two
megahertz it's not too far off from 480
reference clocks but it is it is
definitely not higher than it so a note
on that but we'll have benchmarks for
this pretty soon so check back and as
