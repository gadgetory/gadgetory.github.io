and now at the be quiet booth there's a
couple things to look at today including
the white edition of the dark based Pro
900 which we talked about a copy text
last year and behind me there's a CLC
that we'll be talking out it's a 360
millimetre rad starting to go through
that and there's a new smaller ish form
factor air cooler as well before getting
to that this coverage is brought to you
by Corsair and their new t1 race gaming
chair which is a bucket style gaming
seat and that chair cost $350 you can
find a link in the description below for
more information the dark base pro 900
it's the same thing we saw last year
except white that's the basis of it
however I want to go through a few
things we didn't get to go through last
year because we have the chance to
really dig into the noise a bit more in
terms of noise output and omission
obviously be quiet given their name
cares quite a bit about noise so part of
what they've done as we said last year
is that all the noise damping foam that
includes the front panel and the side
panel on the back side and this sides
obviously just tempered glass to no
damping there but the things to point
out here that we didn't really know last
year those smaller dots in the foam
paneling on the back side of the case
and on the front side of the case helped
to break up the noise wave so I'm
speaking of some of the PM's here
basically the way it works is as we've
talked about in our previous content
you've got two different things you care
about with noise testing one is just the
actual output either in a DBA or some
other measurement but that doesn't tell
the whole story just like framerate
doesn't tell the whole story when you're
talking frame time the other part of the
story is the type of noise that's going
to be frequency and for that you would
do something like a frequency spectrum
analysis which we don't normally do but
we've done in the past so with that in
mind just testing straight noise with a
foam case like this one doesn't
necessarily tell you a whole lot of all
you're looking at is DBA
what you can learn though is if it's
damping the type of frequency you want
to damp better with a case like this
normally you're looking at something
like a higher frequency damping because
the handling is going to be thinner than
something that's not a case something
that's much larger where you have the
rooms use a thicker material thicker
materials that work better with the
wavelengths that are produced for the
lower frequency noises in the event of
these they're trying to isolate the
higher frequency noise that you get with
something like coil wine or pomp wine or
I rpm fans like some of the GPUs we've
tested lately so that's that's kind of
how it works at a top level
we're hoping to do some testing on this
when it comes out the availability on
this one is looking like about September
somewhere in that range August September
us and it will be a limited run to the
white edition they're doing 2,000 models
at first there will be a plate up here
with the number on it and then after
that depending on the band how quickly
it sells out things like that
be quiet might produce more so let them
know if you want more you don't get the
first round now being limited edition we
were worried about price of course you
see n1 and what they price their things
at so 2,000 run but it's going to be
about 10 dollars more than the actual
black edition that exists now so you're
looking at something like $260 10 buck
increase and other than that it's all
the same specs it's just white and
they've done some color matching so the
white on the metal and on the plastic is
actually pretty close it's not something
we normally see and we'll have more
information on this on the website as
well but moving on to the coolers
there's two to talk right here this is
the air cooler this is the shadow rock
tf2 and then there's also the closed
loop which is a three sixty millimeter
radiator silent loop is the name of it
the supplier for this one is alpha cool
so the pump is alpha cool it's not a
detect for once that's not something we
say a whole lot being that that is the
case this isn't something you're going
to find in the US I know a lot of you in
our audience are not in the US this will
be available to you it's $160 units
we're still hoping to test it so if you
like our testing noise and thermals and
otherwise we'll have some benchmarks for
you but the US should expect to be able
to buy it so three sixty millimeter rad
there are three of the pure wings two
fans on it which are be quiet fans that
we've tested in the past that in terms
of other core features the radiator core
is copper and also if you look down the
side you can see the fins are also
copper so that's kind of interesting and
it's an alpha cool thing to do if you
look at the rad you can tell a topical
because of the way the tank the liquid
tank at the top is split that's a pretty
easy identifier for how they make their
radiators versus or they supply the
raters anyway versus other people other
than that some coil on here on the
tubing which is really just prevent
kinking things like that we don't know
the material for the tubing I've asked
so I'm not sure if it's
or the plastic line teflon inner coating
or if it's the rubber does however feel
more like a rubber plastic similar to
again other alpha cool units or a
synthetic unit things like that
so that's the cooler $160 I think we're
looking at a September launch for this
one and then the air cooler is
immediately is a $60 unit and it's kind
of small form-factor but not quite it's
about 100 1112 millimeters tall bottom
to top and on here is a 135 millimeter
fan so it's a bit bigger which gives you
hopefully some more controlled noise
particularly the frequency Department
more in the DBA Department so it will be
a it won't won't be as high frequency of
some of the smaller fans and really
that's there's not a whole lot to say
about it then you've got five key pipes
there are six mil pipes copper of course
I don't know if they're compositor since
it or what and then that's that's pretty
much it you get some airflow under the
bottom and some clearance but that's the
cooler so that rounds out the stuff
we're going to talk about in the video
there will be an article as well on the
website link in description below that
will have some more information about
the other stuff at the booth there's
some new power supplies including that
FX form factor power supply so check
that out and as always if you like
