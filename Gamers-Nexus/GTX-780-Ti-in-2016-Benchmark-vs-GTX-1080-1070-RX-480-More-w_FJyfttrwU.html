performance in the modern era landing it
on charts with this year's major
releases from both AMD and NVIDIA a
couple of the benchmarks also contained
Maxwell and 300 series cards for further
scaling analysis and just recently we
did this same test with the GTX 770 to
show upgrade pathways for three to four
year old hardware and we'll be looking
next at AMD cards for the 200 series so
stay subscribed for that before getting

discount we're not going to completely
review this card it is a bit hold at
this point we'll be looking at power and
thermals but we'll be looking at gaming
performance and the 780 Ti runs on
NVIDIA zat Kepler architecture this
preceeds
maxwell and obviously Pascal the most
recent architecture and that means a
couple of important points that we have
to sort of remind everyone of one this
uses GPU boost 2.0 functions a bit
differently than 3.0 this is a reference
card as well that we've got on the table
and that's when we benchmarked it
operates at a boost clock of 928 mega
Hertz again because 2.0 a bit different
and in terms of other core specs the
core count is 2880 cuda cores but the
very important thing to hear here to
note is that kepler cores are quite a
bit different than the later generation
cores and that's generally true between
all architectures for recent years
anyway so verses later cores that the
architecture that came out more recently
Kepler was something like 40% less
efficient per watt depending on which
architecture you looking at Pascal or
Maxwell and that means that on these
older cards you'll see a higher core
count then maybe the performance looks
like it makes sense
at least versus the modern benchmark so
note that and then things like data path
optimization clock gating Delta memory
compression color compression all these
technologies that improve the
performance per watt the changes there
really do make a huge difference for the
modern architectures on both AMD
and NVIDIA other specs for the 780ti
include a seven gigabit per second
memory clock a bit slower than modern
devices and it's also running three
gigabytes of gddr5 memory on a 384 bit
memory interface the TDP of the
reference card is 250 watts a fair bit
higher than today is significantly more
powerful GTX 1080 and it's 180 watts EDP
a lot of gaming power savings are in
lower voltage process too so moving to
FinFET from planar gets you down to
about 0.8 volts at the low end rather
than 1 volt gddr5 X on the GTX 1080 and
Titan XP also reduce the voltage
requirement and compressing colors and
memory reduces the power consumed per
bit transacted the 780ti had a launch
price of about $700 putting it sort of
close to the gtx 1080 for today and that
means if you owned one when it came out
in November of 2013 you were pretty much
the king of the graphics market so for
today we're revisiting the gaming
performance I'm sure a lot of folks
still have these and might be looking to
upgrade in the next year or two if not
immediately we're not looking at
production workloads so the way the
older architecture was built does mean
that the performance scaling in some
production workloads may actually better
than what we're looking at for gaming
scaling but that's out of scope for
today so we're looking at FPS only and
we'll start off with battlefield 1 a
couple of the newer games if you have
curiosities about some of the older
titles including shadow of Mordor we
also tested the recent Mirror's Edge
catalyst you can hit the link in the
description below for the article and
the full benchmark with a couple of
extra charts and the full testing
methodology including all the drivers
used for the devices and other notes
that may be important we only tested
battlefield 1 using DirectX 11 since
dx12 has generally shown poor
performance in frame times in our
previous tests look at doom 4 Vulcan
though so stick around for that the
reference 780ti performs at about 58 FPS
average at 1080p ultra and battlefield 1
that's where the low is reasonably close
at 40 7.7 fps and 40 5.3 fps although
NVIDIA has improved its frame time
consistency generationally everything
since Kepler has still been pretty
tightly time than we're seeing that
reflected in these 780ti comparatively
this performance puts us adjacent to the
GTX
960 SSC from Maxwell and that's of
course a pre overclocked card a
reasonably heavily pre over talked card
and about tied with this generations GTX
1050 Ti we're above the rx 460 by about
15 fps and that's some meaningful gap
and below the RX 470 by about 15 fps
right in between the two strictly
looking at same brand generational
jeonse the 142 $160 1050 t is offer
effectively equivalent gaming
performance in battlefield one to the
one skin 780ti being that the 780 Ti was
a $700 card a modern price equivalent
shy anyway of the 1080 Ti which doesn't
exist yet would be the GTX 1080 and that
lands us at such high frame rate that we
really should look at the next chart for
a better idea at 1440p ultra with
battlefield 1 we see the GTX 1080
landing at around 116 FPS average
compared to the 780 Ti Kepler card at
38.7 average high resolution gameplay
has changed significantly in the last
two generations even for mid-range
$200 cars if you see the 1016 480 and
the RX 4 80 for instance blows the 780ti
high away in 1440p performance gtx 1060
is right there with it nearly doubling
the 780 Ti in 1440p with ultra settings
moving on to doom we'll look at both
OpenGL and Vulcan performance on the GTX
780 Ti at 1080p ultra with OpenGL we're
seeing a performance output of
approximately 64 FPS average on the 780
Ti still plenty playable for 1080p
gaming but comparatively not so
impressive 780 Ti sits between the 1050
and 1050 Ti and is well below the rx 470
480 and GTX 1060 with Vulcan
our averages negatively scale on the 780
Ti fps goes from about 64 average to 53
average and although they're not shown
in this OpenGL and Vulcan comparison the
lows for the 780 Ti fall to about 33 and
25.6 fps not particularly impressive
1440p Ultra is more of the same the 780
Ti operates an average frame rate of 45
FPS at 1440p with OpenGL with lows
around 31 FPS and 25 a7 FP
this plant says just under the rh4 70s
average and about 20 FPS below the gtx
1060 and rx 480
the GTX 970 SSC also does well here with
a 70 FPS average jump into the modern
price equivalent of the 780 Ti
performance goes up to around 125 to 130
FPS average or about 3x the 780 Ti is
performance when we look at the GTX 1080
Vulcan mostly post similar scaling to
the last chart with an average FPS about
40 and low at 27 and 25 really you're
better off with OpenGL in this
particular title with this card call of
duty black ops 3 is next operating at
1080p and 1440p with high settings at
1080p we're seeing an average frame rate
of about 90 FPS with lows at 59 1% and
49.1%
this lens the 780ti about 10 FPS ahead
of the 1050 Ti and below the 970 SSE and
even the 380 X if that sounds odd keep
in mind that black ops 3 has favored AMD
for its entire lifespan we've shown that
consistently over the last year so this
is not abnormal behavior for this
particular title when looking at AMD and
NVIDIA 1440p it has the same stack up
for the 780 Ti the GTX 1080 operates at
around 143 FPS average 980ti is at 103
and a 780ti is at 56
that's nearly a 3x difference between
Kepler and Pascal or about 2 X between
Kepler and Maxwell
we're throwing back now to Metro last
light for a game that's been around for
ages was optimized eons ago and hasn't
seen many changes in drivers or game
performance since that time at 1080p
with very high quality and high
tessellation natural last light gives us
a good look at 780ti scaling over the
years on older titles which it was built
for its operating at 79 FPS average just
between the RX 484 gigabyte and 1063
gigabyte the 980 TI for reference
operates at around 109 average with the
GTX 1080 at around 135 average 1440p
with Metro is mostly the same hierarchy
unsurprisingly 780 Ti sits now at 56 FPS
average and still pretty reasonable but
feels a bit limp compared to the equally
the GTX 1063 gigabyte card same memory
capacity and the our X 480 gaming x8
gigabyte card does quite well
comparatively operating at around 57 FPS
average GTA 5 is a 2015 title that
remains relevant through this year and
offers us a mid step between the brand
new games and the old guard like Metro
the 780ti pushes 74 FPS average with
lows in the 50s when playing GTA 5 at
1080p with very high and ultra quality
settings effectively maxed out other
than the advanced graphics tab this
lands the card ahead of the 380 X and
the 1050 Ti which is a bit different
from our very first results just because
of how GTA 5 is optimized the 780 Ti
ends up a bit below the 1060 again and
the RX 470 again it is consistent in
this regard and effectively always tied
or behind the gtx 1060 this is
particularly true with 1440p we haven't
retested every device yet at 1440p with
GTA 5 but our limited list of results
shows the 1064 70 and 480 performing
against the 780 Ti and the 1016 480
outperform the 780 Ti and these results
it's been almost exactly three years
since the GTX 780 Ti came out and the
card hasn't aged so well if we look at
other GPUs this seems pretty expected
really at the 770 was further proof of
this they really just as technology
advances and as even the console
generations mature and the developers
mature their process for developing
games on those current gen consoles
because that does sort of dictate a lot
of the gaming today the development of
games today these cards have not done
too well to scale the performance now
the 780 Ti is still a damn good card it
does 1080p just fine it's still hitting
high frame rates in all of these tests
for 1080p it's only when you start
pushing higher resolutions that the card
struggles and that's sort of where the
new trend is the trend for this year has
been supporting things like 1440p with
$200 video cards that's new
$250 gets you a card that can pretty
reasonably perform about 60fps depending
on the game with the gtx 1060 RX for 80
something like that and run 1440p with
ultra high graphics the 780 Ti just
can't do it you could lower your
graphics settings of course and still
play the high resolution
but for enthusiasts who still want that
bleeding-edge higher resolution higher
quality technology obviously it's about
time to upgrade now there's still a bit
more life left in the 780ti you could
easily get another year and still be
playing out pretty high settings high
very high ultra as the sort of three
categories you would be in while at
1080p but if looking to upgrade
resolutions then the card is next in
terms of upgrades it doesn't make a ton
of sense to move to something like an RX
480 or gtx 1060 they do outperform the
780 Ti but they feel sort of like
lateral upgrades and although I haven't
tested it you might lose some
performance in production workloads
where the additional cores although less
efficient would be favored the 1070
would be a more worthwhile gain and of
course the new year should yield Vega
products which will undoubtedly be
targeting the high-end market likely
caused some price wars but between
what's out now 1070 1080 are the obvious
only choices really I would not
necessarily recommend an Rx 480 or GTX
1060 as your upgrade things look out for
would be how do the prices change for
the 10 eighties they've settled down a
bit so if you remember launch they were
all pretty much over the low end MSRP
that's kind of calmed down it's easier
to justify a purchase now 1080 TI will
come out at some point so if you really
need that TI branding to feel relevant
then I guess wait around for it but
otherwise you've got the only two cards
to look at other than waiting for things
like Vega and the 1080 TI so that is all
