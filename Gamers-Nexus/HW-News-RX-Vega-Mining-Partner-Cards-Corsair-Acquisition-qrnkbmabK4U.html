recap talking about industry and
hardware news for last week
this one has a lot of AMD topics in it
rx beta and Red River were a focus of
attention as we traveled out to
California for a and DS event but
they're also some other interesting
Moving's in the industry like Corsair
and their partial acquisition the AMD
quarter 2 financials the biggest chip
maker changing over to Samsung a couple
of other news topics for the week before
getting to that this content is brought
to you by the Thermaltake flow RGB
closed-loop liquid cooler which is a 360
millimeter
radiator plus 3 120 fans that are RGB
illuminated the thern will take it ring
fans at that this is a 4.5 done a stack
pump which is one of the faster pumps
you can learn more at the link in the
description below let's start out with
some quick less formal news this is
stuff that we've either kind of thought
about release Lee mentioned but haven't
formally put out in a video the first
one is our X Vega and it's mining
capacity we independently confirm some
of the rumors that were going on haven't
tested it mind you but from what we've
heard from our sources in the industry
it does sound like in fact our X Vega
I'm not clear on if it's 56 or 64 will
be confirmed that somewhere around 70
mega hashes per second for mining now I
think that's about 2x what the RX 500
series does cap side out with the 580 we
are not mining experts feel free to
discuss it below if you want to talk
about the implications of that but I
thought I'd put it out there that in the
very least that's what we've heard from
sources haven't confirmed it in testing
ourselves but that's what we've heard so
that does sound like it is accurate if
you saw those rumors earlier another
note here a be partner cards for Vega 64
should be available in September or very
late August but it does look like
September for most of them with
reference cards of course shipping much
sooner
August 14th I believe is the officially
confirmed release date that's at least
the one we've seen talked about online
publicly so look at my goggles 14th
reference and then September for a IV
partner models for the 64 and then our
Vega 56 reference and therefore a IV
partner models will be shipping in
September as well so 56 comes a bit
later and probably won't be in the first
review cycle that we're not clear on
that yet
finally on the road two more notes here
one is the Vega many we didn't mention
this in any of our coverage because it
was shown surprise last minute at the
AMD staged event at their California
gathering but the RX Vega many was given
to Tim Sweeney the epic game CEO and
it's basically it was a single fan looks
like 90 to 100 millimeter Vega card and
we're not sure if it was even real or
who was a prop but either way it was a
reference or an allusion to and these
plans for rx Vega in the future which
would theoretically include a mini model
but we haven't heard anything actually
definitive on if there is a functional
one if it's coming out with the
September launches or what the deal is
but there will be one it seems like so
thought we'd let you know final note
here coin mining so back to the opening
topic Rajic dory at the event said on
stage to two media she said many of you
asked why we're so good at coin mining
it resides in the sort of brackets here
the way we are open this is not
something that we planned
it's what the open software approach
does referring to how the drivers are
designed and firmware it's designed and
things like that later discussion at
follow-up meetings revolved around the
packs there's bundle packs and how
they're trying to limit purchases from
miners and get some more cards into
hands with gamers now the challenge here
is there's no reason that you as a miner
couldn't just still buy the standalone
card and screw the pack what do you care
but the way to bypass that would be
allocating a specific amount of cards to
the packs or the bundles so if Andy has
the leverage to go to New Ager Amazon or
whomever and say you must allocate 20%
50% whatever of your RX Vega allocation
to these bundles meaning that that
amount has to be sold alongside the
discount packages at the marked up price
of $100 price premium
so the challenge here again is one what
miners don't seem well if if they're
really going to be that good at mining
it doesn't seem like miners would care
about buying for an extra hundred
dollars and just not using the discounts
like what do they care this you're not
forced to buy other hardware with those
discounts they're just discount you pay
$100 for them so you're paying an extra
hundred dollars to get $100 off of
specific to find that rise in seven 1700
X 1800 X and specific X 370 motherboards
and you're paying that extra hundred
dollars same amount to get the two
hundred dollar discount on samsung
displays but there's nothing that says
you have to use them so I don't know
that it'll stop miners who $100 to them
is like compared to there's a 2x mark up
they're paying on 500 G's cards that
really doesn't seem like such a bad deal
just overpay by a hundred bucks so I
don't know if it'll work it's not really
sure back in general I'm not really sure
if they'll work they have a lot of
limitations that make them kind of odd
but it seems like Andy's trying at least
that's what they told us and other media
that they do want more gamers to get
their hands on the Vega cards then
Polaris has been the past few months so
we'll see if they can find a way to do
that really doesn't seem like good
solution other than retailers doing
something like saying limited one or two
per customer at which point I don't know
I don't really believe that someone like
Newegg would necessarily do that unless
they're forced to because new AG seems
like the type that they just be like we
just need to sell the cards we don't
care who they go to and why would they
they're just retailing so I don't know
it's a really difficult challenge Andy
is in a difficult spot with Vega
launching ignoring performance entirely
the mining aspect of things really
throws a wrench in what we know from
traditional GP launches this isn't
normally going on in the middle of
something like a launch with a card that
is somewhat confirmed to be a good mind
device so very interesting but I will
have to wait and see for the rest anyway
moving on to industry news so
there's big one coarser confirmed its
acquisition at least partial acquisition
by Eagle tree capital who paid five
hundred twenty five million dollars to
buy out the stake that Francisco
Partners previously held we talked about
this in one of the previous news
episodes which it was a rumor at the
time but now obviously confirmed so
Francisco partners and minority
shareholders have been bought out for
five hundred plus million dollars and
appalled the founder and CEO and other
upper management will remain in place at
course they're from what the statements
have said and things should more or less
remain functioning as is at least that's
what they're saying right now this also
kind of loosely mirrors razors plans to
go public razor was trying to raise six
hundred million dollars to bid
aggressively on growth opportunities and
expansion so it looks like they're both
kind of doing this right now but the
corset rumor did actually become true
for the next one Andy revealed it's
quarter to 2017 fiscal results which
Rison was shown to help Andy get back
into profitability at least somewhat
last weekend the announced their second
quarter fiscal results the numbers are
hopeful overall Andy's revenue was up
nineteen percent year-over-year al Viet
net income suffered a loss of sixteen
million but that's a far improvement
over last quarter where ahem D saw loss
of seventy three million four quarter
three Andy's expected a 23 percent
increase compared to this quarter which
should help their bottom line overall
and so that is owed to the success of
Rison and AMD is now creeping back
towards being profitable again 16
million more is what we were seeing
previously quarter three should allow
the impact of thread Ripper epic and rx
Vega to soak a bit which round out
Andy's a sale on the market segments for
this year and then the SOC business is
still being bolstered by forthcoming
launches like the Xbox one X so and
you've got some room to move around
still plus we'll see how it looks when
the quarter three and four results are
posted and this one's kind of
interesting so Intel for the last twenty
or so years has been the single largest
silicon manufacturer on the planet and
now with Samsung continuing to grow with
the phone market booming the way it is
Samsung has actually overtaken Intel for
the first time in about 20 years
and they are now doing quarterly
earnings of fifteen point eight billion
against intel's fourteen point eight
billion for quarterly earnings and the
shot in the arms of samsung's coffers is
largely due to demand for nand which as
you all know pretty high right now given
the prices of SSDs and ram things like
that so the mad Fernand for DRAM and
phones computer still tablets laptops
basically everything medical devices
means that Samsung is growing rapidly
and they are doing well despite the
global supply constraints in those
markets so only serves to drive up
prices a bit in DRAM and SSD areas right
now hopefully comes down but doesn't
look like it's going to happen anytime
soon and ultimately looks like Intel is
going to be trailing Samsung for the
remainder of the year so Samsung getting
bigger if they weren't big enough
already
with selling the home appliances washers
dryers solid-state drives
phones everything else yeah so fifteen
point eight billion quarterly again ten
times fifteen billion praevia growth the
next one here fan tax has prob'ly
curtain on prices and availability
finally for the pair of cases that they
showed at Computex earlier this year
both are tall cases built with aluminum
and tempered glass the evolved and
evolved shift X will be available in
August for $110 and $160 respectively
also in case news here last week
silverstone announced their latest small
form-factor case the RBZ 0-3 which
resembles something akin to a console
it's loosely based on the previous rvz
0-1 the new chassis has updates to
styling and includes RGB lighting which
silverstone talked to us about at combi
tactically we weren't sure at the time
but i guess the man got the best of them
the RBZ 0-3 supports many DTX and ITX
motherboards and the ATX power supply
three 120-millimeter fans
two expansion slots a couple of other
things you'd expect and GV is up to 330
millimetres in length it's been offered
in Europe already u.s. prices and
availability will be coming soon the
final new product to talk about is the
OCZ TR 200 from Toshiba which is an
entry-level SSD and the company's first
two
use the BICS flash or bit cost scalable
flash based and and the new Sol replaced
the previous TR 150 comes in capacities
of 240 and 960 gigabytes of phone in
between the drivers come with a
three-year warranty and advertise a - 40
terabytes written in total endurance
rating that's all on a SATA 6 gigabits
per second interface
according to Toshiba the TR 200 series
will be aimed at entry level system
builders and first-time upgrades from
hard drives availability expected this
fall with no word on pricing yet the
last one here of no it is an VIII and
yesterday back there's a lot of an z
news this week given that they just did
their event but they're now offering
their race coolers to retail so that's
actually pretty interesting the race
cooler previously was only available in
bundles with the 1700 or 1800 act we
paid the extra money to get it and now
it will be shipping for $60 separately
through retailers and it's compatible
with AM 4 + 3 + + FM 2 motherboards when
the rates coolers originally shipped the
original original one from the FX series
we actually praised them for stepping
aside from what the usual stock cooler
performance was I eat bad and making
something that was pretty good usable
and didn't actually require replacing
now of course you could always do better
in a box cooler I'm going to charge you
so much after all but we liked the
original race on the FX series and it's
not been bad on the rise in series again
you do better but considering what the
performance is out of box it's a good
way to save money if you don't wanna buy
something extra the race itself though
is now available separately at $60 it's
kind of hard to say whether there's
actually value there versus buying an
aftermarket solution those will probably
be better but if you want the Andy
branding and I think they have an RGB
LED on there as well and you can grab
the Wraiths max so that's out there now
I think that pretty much wraps it for
this week there are a couple of other
small announcements like from Razer and
rocket with new headsets but we've got
all the big ones so as always you can
