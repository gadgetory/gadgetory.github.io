Jian as always it leave your questions
in the comment section below to be
considered for the next episodes of ask
GN we also have a bonus episode on
patreon.com slash gamers Nexus and we're
shooting three total videos for Astraea
and today two of which will be going
live on the main channel and one on the
patreon channel final note here before
we get started we also have a brand new
limited edition shirt once these are
sold that's it the gone are not making
any more so this is a foil print GN tear
down logo shirt we've made this shirt
design last year for our 10 year
anniversary in business I started the
site around 2007 working on it then and
have been working on it ever since so
that was our ten-year anniversary design
we still sell it but we're making a
special foil version which is just shiny
and kind of awesome in general has
completely custom measurements for all
the sleeving and everything else on the
shirt really high quality cotton all
that stuff anyway if you want to pick
one up you can pre-order it on store
like Aaron's Nexus dotnet once they're
gone they're gone or not making anymore
but we are trying to figure out
obviously how many of each size to make
so hence the P order be a little bit
till they're out because we do need to
figure out how many of you are ordering
which sizes anyway that's over there if
you want it and just consider this
section of me talking the ad for this
video because we won't place one
otherwise if you want any other items on
the store we are adding more and more
things there again to try and continue
distancing ourselves from manufacturer
advertisers for a focus on remaining
completely non biased and saying
whatever the hell I want to say on
camera so yeah we have cool stuff we
have the mod mat which is 4 feet by 2
feet modding surface anti-static really
high-quality materials has a print on it
for one awesome branding and two useful
features like wiring guides and stuff
like that grid 4gb tear downs and we
also have our new shirt design over
there and then the teardown and crystals
that we gave way as awards at Computex
so that's the that's the ad for this one
let's roll in three questions first one
I would have to try and keep my blood
pressure low on this is from nori Baja
blast to freeze chill on discord from
the patreon discord nori asks GN staff
thoughts on tech tuber business
practices being blasted over Twitter
so this is about something that was
going on actually the morning that I was
waking up early to get on a train to go
to the airport in Japan to come home and
sit on a plane for like 20 hours so that
day basically there was a tweet which
has since I don't know if it was removed
or what but definitely the user posted
public apologies to us specifically and
I think to a couple of other people but
there was a tweet saying that basically
youtubers are paid to visit the booths
at Computex all coverage you see is
basically fake they are all paid to do
it and that they learned this by seeing
actual invoices well there's a reason
they apologized to us and a couple of
other things happened behind the scenes
after we got involved with it because it
was but let's go over the
basics here first of all the original
tweet went up pretty early in the
morning in Japan when I was waking up so
we had no time to make a proper response
then and what we did was I spent 20
hours on planes figuring out what
happened what was said who said what and
contacting those individuals privately
and getting the matter mostly resolved
not entirely to my liking but we'll talk
about that in a moment there again was a
public apology posted to us and anyway
what happened was this basically an
individual who is now formerly employed
as I understand it at a PR company
spread outright lies about gamers Nexus
and other media outlets to an individual
on Twitter who then shared that stuff I
believe the individual from the PR
company also shared this with video
cards and maybe other rumor mill sites
but not sure who precisely was the
messenger there versus the messenger
versus who was just passing on
information they heard secondhand or
whatever anyway formerly employed at PR
company and the things they said were
extremely offensive for a number of
reasons so we've seen the private
conversations and basically what it
boils down to is this individual have
their feelings hurt because I did not go
to their party at Computex so let's talk
about how gamers next is
just briefly talk about how we make
money and some of the ways we do how we
specifically and explicitly do not make
money because I find it offensively
unethical and also talk about my stance
on parties in the industry
first of all industry parties are a
complete waste of my time and I don't go
so there's a reason I didn't go to this
individuals party had contacts because I
hate them and I find them a waste of
time because when we go to an event I am
not there especially if it's in another
country to go hang out with people in
the industry and drink alcohol or eat or
whatever they want to do I might go to
dinner every now and then I might go
hang out with like Paul or Kyle or
people I find agreeable but the
companies we meet with them at their
booth or their suite unpaid I don't
charge for that because I find that
unethical we meet them at their booth or
their suite and they we talk to them
there we cover the product and that's
really the end of the transaction I
don't do extra events or extracurricular
activities if I can avoid it because I'm
there to work and when we're there first
of all my team doesn't care about those
either so let me give you an example of
how the day works at a convention wake
up at like 6:00 or 7:00 a.m. start
working on yesterday's content or the
schedule for today go to the show from
basically 8:00 or so in the morning
maybe 9:00 until like five or six and
then we'll break for food we often skip
lunch bring it with us break for food at
that point go back to the room and spend
the entire rest of the night editing
obviously if my team members want to go
somewhere get out escape for a little
bit I'm fine with that but certainly no
one wants to waste their time at a loud
venue with people that frankly yeah I
like a lot of people I work with in the
industry but I really I don't want to go
to a bar and hang out with you after
we've just spent 12 hours on a
convention floor shooting videos I
really don't and it's not personal it's
just that we're there to work and a lot
of the work is editing all the content
so we spent 12 hours shooting it during
the day better go back and produce it in
the suite afterwards otherwise what the
hell are we doing there so that's my
stance on party
now it stands on charging for booths we
do not do it I don't really have an
opinion on other people who do but I'm
speaking for games Nexus we do not
charge to visit a booth I have several
conversations including conversations
with this company and this individual
where we say we don't charge to visit a
booth we will sell standard advertising
so you see these in videos we didn't
have one for this one because I
advertise this but typically it's within
the first minute or so I'll say this
video is brought to you by the company
it's very clearly disclosed as an ad and
we advertise their product and I try
also to not advertise so that's
another we have pretty high standards
for advertisements we've turned down a
whole hell of a lot of them this year
SCD keys all those types of places I
bounced those almost daily and I'm not
afraid to tell them you know let me know
when you have something that's not
garbage or a scam and we'll consider
advertising it so very high standards
that's why I found it so offensive that
this individuals seem to really
specifically hate us but it seemed like
it was a personal thing from what I
learned so anyway the individual the
company employee further stated that
youtubers quote discussed him and that
the person former employee quote just
wants people to be honest so let me be
honest then with you if you want me to
visit your booth stop representing
shitty products and maybe don't be an
asshole because here's the thing if you
have something worth seeing
we will go out of our way to cover it
normally the first two days I booked
them solid we can't escape very little
time on the schedule to do anything else
but at Computex I have two teams of two
we split up sometimes and one of the
teams jobs is the other team is to be a
recon group come back at the end of the
day one to whatever
tell me what's cool and we'll go out of
our way and cover it as soon as we
possibly can and that's the whole thing
with being an outlet that prides itself
on reporting and on facts and on
journalism is that we go out of our way
to cover things that are really cool or
maybe need to be covered because they
are unethical or something like that
like the 28 core demo that I rather
publicly talked against turning copy
tags so that's all that it takes have
something that's worth seen if you feel
like you have to pay people to go to the
booth there's a serious problem with the
products you're representing and
unfortunately for you we don't accept
money to go to booths so even that's not
enough even though this person seems to
think that's what we require the amount
of booths I'll just point out that we
saw at combi tax if we charge to get
others I have so much money but we don't
and we actually operate on pretty slim
margins overall there's a reason we're
in my house right now
so that's kind of how I look at a lot of
this stuff I mean you know we've
contacted the PR agency we have demanded
a public apology for their employees
egregious actions and gross and
confidence in my opinion the company has
privately and profusely apologized but
they have shown cowardice every time
we've asked for a public apology and so
they've backed out of it out of pure
respect I am NOT going to name the
company its owner or the employee
involved but I can say that we found
their actions incredibly offensive
we will never be working with that
company again and we will not work with
at with any of their active clients or
future clients and that's just how it's
gonna be if you're gonna you know this
the individual acting under the company
although apparently in a private
conversation clearly had it out for me
and other youtubers and they completely
spread lies they had no idea what they
were talking about
they just really seemed upset that
people didn't go visit their booth
represent whoever they're representing
or go to their party which was a waste
of time for anyone not just that person
all of them are a waste of my time
because I'm there to make cool videos
for you guys to watch not to go waste
three hours somewhere else with people I
already saw all day for videos so anyway
ironically the company representative
even suggested that we'd all make more
money if we just let this go and move on
and don't ask for public apology you
know
same things like media are all shells
and require money to visit booths
paraphrased and then hiding behind a
promise of everyone just making more
money if we let it go where do you see
the disconnect do you see the irony I'm
not in it for the money I'd make a lot
more of it if I had a normal job working
for someone else I'll tell you that
right now so anyway my thoughts on it
Noorie thank you for the question are
that the business practices being
discussed particularly regarding gamers
Nexus because that's I'm only speak on
behalf of myself I don't know what the
other guys really do but our business
practices are simple make cool stuff and
we'll come see your booth if you want to
be an advertiser we welcome it please
have a good product to advertise we'd be
happy to run ads for you but we never
charge to visit booths and that's the
way it is and also for the record two of
our advertisers during Computex we did
not even visit I think at least one of
them if not both didn't even have a
booth at the show so those were ads sold
for like the month of June and they were
placed in the month of June and that's
how it worked anyway also combi tags
cost a hell of a lot of money more than
more than more than you can imagine so
next question real question time premium
let I just I kind of wanted to just get
that off my chest has been bothering me
and I've been trying to work with the
company privately and saying like you
know you should make this right and post
an apology but they won't do it so I'll
give you that much publicly and if they
give me further problems I guess I don't
know maybe we'll talk again but whatever
it's kind of water under the bridge at
this point I just J did a video linus
minuses team talked out on lan show we
were travelling when all this was going
down and I thought well now that I've
had time to talk to everyone give them a
chance privately we'll talk about it a
bit publicly and just make it very clear
how GN makes money because it's
important and also other modes we make
money a significant amount of our money
is from patreon patreon our comms up
gamers Nexus a very large amount is from
our store now at store dat game is
excess net the reason for those two
avenues is so that I can reduce reliance
on vendors for advertising money and we
target people like Dollar Shave
for example who don't make products we
review because it actually makes a lot
of sense as an advertiser to review
things that don't give you ad money of
course so anyway it's we've got a
strategy to move away from that kind of
stuff we still obviously depend on it a
bit but we're very careful about who we
choose as our advertisers what they're
giving us money for and and of course
trying to create a wall between the
editorial side and the advertising side
I've got a guy on our team because all
the ad reporting for us and that
isolates me from it so that I don't have
any of that in my mind when I'm
reviewing a product as made obvious
because we have advertisers whom we've
also reviewed negatively for their
products recently okay premium lag says
okay this might be a stupid question but
I need to ask it I'm I'm actually really
excited for this after the last question
why is it that GPU drivers have to
optimize for game surely the drivers are
there for developers to access the
hardware and not for the hardware to
support the game I don't understand this
is a fantastic question premium lag and
allow me to elaborate so drivers are
really interesting they are incredibly
complex pieces of solve for that
interface between the GPU and the game
and I think I'm particularly excited
about this question because it's
actually Hardware topic and not
drama in the industry so with drivers
the cool thing is that for DirectX 11 in
particular basically all of the
optimization stuff before game comes out
a lot of that falls on AMD and NVIDIA
may be to some extent Intel but very
very little so amnion Nvidia have
experts at their companies for building
drivers around how a game works and
they'll actually have to build for
shaders individually for game to execute
the shaders and the game's graphics in a
way that worked well on their hardware
and the our Nvidia hardware and this is
because they have the most the lowest
level access to the device the GPU
through the drivers has close to the
metal as we say as you can get it's as
close to that piece of silicon as you
can get the game developer is sitting
behind a giant wall it's called an
abstraction layer and that abstraction
layer is the API DirectX 12 and Vulcan
allow the developers to get way closer
to the metal
to the silicon then DirectX 11 does and
so in modern scenarios with properly
executed DirectX 12 Vulkan API is the
developers actually bear the
responsibility that the driver vendors
used to bear and that is really
difficult for developers to take on
along with all their other
responsibilities which is why you see so
little proper Vulcan adoption takes very
technical people and it takes extra team
members who aren't under the same crunch
to just get the game done because
optimizations not first of all it takes
years to make a game optimizations not
necessarily in the forefront of
everyone's mind and doing it especially
for an API when they can just use
DirectX 11 or wrap it with DX 12 isn't
that is that seems like a much more
agreeable approach if you have time or
financial constraints so why then do GPU
drivers have to optimize for the game
while directing seven that is the
closest you can get to the GPU silicon
because the developers just they have
that barrier between them and the GPU
and so the driver has to pick up all the
slack to answer that question
now as for DirectX 12 or Vulcan the
drivers are still important but less so
so now the what used to be done by
driver teams is hopefully going to be
done by engine teams going forward and
Nvidia AMD dispatch engineers two major
companies to help them optimize their
games now for DirectX 12 and Vulcan
because of this difference and the
dichotomy of where development is
happening these days with modern API is
more or less requiring more softer side
game specific or engine specific
optimizations rather than driver
specific things so every game behaves
differently developers programmed them
differently the GPS from Nvidia AMD are
very different as well in a lot of ways
and they're similar in others but their
architectures are different and so the
way shaders execute are or the way
shaders are processed I should say on
each device are going to vary game to
game depending on how its programmed and
so the dry render just have to fix it a
lot of time because the game developers
might not have that insight they don't
make the hardware they don't know but
also they're under huge time constraints
so you get a product done a game and get
out the door and if you're now asking
them to do what driver developers just
have decades of experience
I mean that's a lot that's that's a
whole lot of extra burden so I hope that
answers your question decently but
basically it's a matter of where is the
wall between these software developer
and the hardware and then who picks up
the slack from there hopefully that
answers it great question though if any
of you have more questions like that
please ask them I love those types of
technical questions next one si Sdn says
hey si for the i90 deleted what were the
non-conductive clear nail polishes that
you found what method did you use to
find out they were non-conductive set up
a circuit with a voltmeter input an
anode and cathode in the nail polish and
look for a current blow actually no
that's a brilliant idea
my approach was apply the nail polish
and see if it dies it was short
something and so that worked for me now
this is what I use I actually don't know
what it is what is it called argan oil
formula color therapy something like
that so the thing is I don't just assume
this is always going to be good because
I am positive these formulas change all
the time based on price of chemicals and
stuff so who knows this the next round
of this could actually be detrimental
but let me read to you something I've
read in the past this is from VSG of
thermal bench who explained to me once
why certain nail polishes work as a
protection from short circuiting versus
liquid metal and others don't
so VSG previously said nail polish
typically has nitrocellulose or another
functionalized cellulose in it which
forms a thin stable film without a gap
over items such as fingernails or the
capacitors you used it over and alkyl
acetate helps move it into place and
then promptly evaporates leaving behind
just the thin film some nail polish
formulations have benzene derivates and
excuse my pronunciation here toluene
told totally when I don't know tol you e
and E is a prime candidate used by some
companies which does a similar job as
nitrocellulose look at the composition
before buying or using these as the
toluene isn't nice to play with even at
lower concentrations so if you need some
guidelines that's it it's got some
you know just play that back it's got
some information on chemicals that are
unfavorable for deleted components also
there are more professional products you
could use but I mean I just I took that
because it was around already so if
you've got someone who uses a nail
polish in this house kind of makes it a
bit easier next one is Brad who says
what kind of effect do your mod matte
product placement pieces have on hot
matte sales do you see a big spike
versus episodes that don't do anything
for them so this question would be a
great example of that
actually so it's a yes a bit there's a
reason that I try to mention them
because I mean they're really expensive
to make and I like to keep moving them
obviously the people who the the
customers have loved these things and as
we've gotten better at manufacturing
them we've started making more and so
whenever I mention it I do try to
monitor the sales performance as you're
asking and there is an impact some days
some episodes may we'll see one or two
extra sales and solve them we see a lot
more it just depends on to what extent
the mod map was discussed there's on
store documents Nexus not net if you
want to pick it up for a building
service that's really ultra high quality
we think it's the best on the market for
a mod matte anyway it depends but yes
the the product sales are becoming a
part of our business that we're very
proud of because we are starting to
focus more and more on functional
products things outside of cool shirts
although we do those two stuff outside
of sticking a logo on things because I
think we can provide a great service and
we can make cool products and it will
allow us to continue to do what we do
with less dependence again on sort of
the first party providers of the
products we review so yeah it does
impact sales sometimes it's it's very
modest not a big deal other times it can
actually be extremely helpful so it all
just depends on kind of the context next
one Chris Lee Bayer 92 good morning
finally found time to join support with
all the Nvidia rumors flying around I
thought I'd have a question about water
cooling cards basically this question is
if your water cooling a card on an open
loop and aftermarket harbors
addition is there a reasonable
difference in performance and PCBs can
be different
the VRMs can be different between them
let's assume you find something
compatible for the aftermarket card
you're looking at as long as you have
compatibility references easiest to work
with there are a lot of them they sort
of one size fits all but if you find
compatibility on a really good PCB like
a gaming X or something like that then
potential advantages might be although
not always potentially lower vrm
thermals under a heavier overclock with
VR arms better spreads heat over a wider
area potentially stay more stable
frequency at a very high-end overclock
but ultimately you know with Nvidia
cards you're pretty restricted on
voltage so you can't push that much and
the silicon quality itself is more of a
distinction between performance than
anything else so we could take a
founders edition card and like a gaming
X that I have over here just by
coincidence and I've got a nice just
wonderfully to but take either one of
these cards versus the founders edition
and it's possible that the more
expensive aftermarket card actually
overclocks worse or it's possible the
reference card overclocks worse and that
just comes down to how good is the
particular piece of silicon on that card
and unfortunately for as good as these
aftermarket designs are a lot of the
time the GPU quality itself is what
dictates performance so it doesn't
matter a whole lot
once your liquid cooling it you've taken
care of pretty much everything that
these advanced coolers do which is
perform quiet and cool under heavier
loads where the reference cards really
struggle with that but if your liquid
clean it you've solved that so it can
matter but because we're limited on
voltage and bios mods and stuff like
that the extent to which it matters is
is limited let me kind of limit this
here too while we're at it
so tell more quickly Noorie baja blast
freeze Jill says how come you guys
didn't stream on Twitch don't stream on
Twitch hate twitching YouTube at the
same time so you have expanded platform
coverage we're considering it very
strongly it's a good move for
diversifying our viewership and revenue
in case something happens to one of the
two platforms so we are certainly
considering it and Noorie also asked
after your travels to Tokyo attack
what is something that Tokyo has that
you wish you had back home I think I can
speak for our whole team when I say for
six of whatever store we were in in
Akihabara cuz it just had all kinds of
like floor two was filled with
technology the prices were not good but
it's so cool just to see that stuff in
prison because sometimes you know you
work on this stuff sometimes you just
want to go spend an hour and bum around
in a store and look at things which is
why stores go out of business because
one bhai honey thing at least in the US
but floor six have this amazing
selection of just kind of nerdy toys and
things felt like I was a kid again so
I'd love to have something like that
back home that's it for this one it's
probably a bit long because the first
question but I'm glad that I got to say
all that now thank you for watching as
