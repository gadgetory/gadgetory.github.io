hardware at a in a technical sense those
might be useful some of you patreon.com
slash gamers Nexus to grab that episode
this one I'm gonna be talking about
third-party players in the market for
GPUs and CPUs so competition for Intel
and AMD and NVIDIA for example before
that this video is brought to you by
Thermal Grizzlies high-end thermal paste
and liquid metal thermal Grizzlies cryo
knot is an affordable high quality
thermal compound that doesn't face some
of the aging limitations of other pastes
on the market cryo knot has a thermal
conductivity of 12.5 watts per meter
Kelvin focuses on endurance is easy to
spread and isn't electrically conductive
making it safe to use on GPU dies
thermal grizzly also makes conductor not
liquid metal which we've used to drop 20
degrees off some temperatures than our
dee-lighted test by a tube at the link
in the description below
quick note just like it did in the other
one these shirts are finally back in
stock they were out of stock for a
couple weeks it's the teal version of
our teardown logo shirt we have them in
cotton and in a very comfortable try
blend if you prefer the sporty or
lighter weight feel so store it on
cameras Nexus Donna if you want to pick
one up there in stock and shipping now
first question is from the heartfelt kid
who said how long before you think we'll
see a third party in the GPU and CPU
market not necessarily a nasty in
question but it is a great one so the
interesting thing here to me was that
you're saying how long before there have
been third-party comput computer Zin
these markets ages ago and they all died
so first thing I want to point out is
anyone who's interested in the history
of the industry the hardware industry I
would really encourage you to look up
SGI what was it Silicon Graphics I think
Silicon Graphics incorporated maybe it
was it I don't remember the exact but it
was SGI is the point and a Jensen the
founder and CEO of Nvidia came from
there and SGI is a really interesting
company because they were they more or
less indirectly birthed
Vidia which later was a contributor to
SGI dying
and so there were other parties at one
point before nvidia and AMD and intel
not so much before intel in a huge sense
but there were IBM but so yeah look up
the history of SGI it's really
interesting some of the problems they
had were like SGI for example believes
that consumer gps would just never be a
thing they just thought consumers would
never want GPUs they're too expensive
and really what do you need to do with
them so SGI was just just dead set on
making corporate grade graphics products
and making stuff for companies and b2b
and enterprise and stuff like that and
that was a huge misstep for them because
out of that refusal to really push
consumer and try and make it successful
even though it seemed too expensive and
it might not Jeff's refusal top
management yes to some extent but also
on the engineering side it was difficult
to make them affordable but that that
sort of disconnect with the interest of
the market is why NVIDIA was so
successful and ati to the extent that
ati was successful back before they were
purchased by andy other third-party
players you had matt rocks at one point
with zero percent market share these
days you had via which is theoretically
they're doing something now from some of
the stuff we've seen but i don't know if
it'll happen
IBM still makes the power cpus so ibm's
not a competitor in x86 and a competitor
at least not in anything that we do with
enthusiasts desktop or consumer
electronics they just don't exist
anymore but IBM makes the power cpus
which are in the brand-new summit
supercomputer which i think is the i
want to say best supercomputer in the
world right now it just put the u.s.
back on the top china was on top for i
think several years and the u.s. just
knocked it out and that was with IBM
power cpus so there are other
competitors it's just not kind of in our
space but i know what you mean
see ryx by the way i don't know
or however you say the name aside Rex
earrings they were another one that's
basically dead now voodoo Buddha
graphics made some of the best graphics
cards they were more or less killed as
well by Nvidia's dominance in the market
not I mean that it's tough market it's
really so here's the problem getting to
your question you said how long before
so that's implying you think there might
be some in the future and that's great I
hope so too so how long before things we
know we know intel is working on the GPU
actively they hired Roger Kaduri he's
the former chief architect and head of
the Radeon technologies group at AMD he
was largely responsible for he worked on
Polaris Vega and I think Fiji
so Rajic stories had Intel now heading
up or at least engineering the Intel GPU
and that Intel's going for some poll in
probably machine learning and deep
learning which is great because Nvidia's
largely dominate in that market right
now Google is doing a lot of work in
that market it's a huge growing market
gaming by the way still like sixty
percent though of Nvidia's revenue and
I'm using that Nvidia as an example cuz
they're huge so 60 percent 50-plus of
their more than half of the company's
revenue in gaming which means there is
money in gaming and Intel as we
understand it is looking at potentially
doing a consumer GPU it's not a hundred
percent confirmed I don't think at least
we don't know it to like what sort of
performance level we should expect but
they're looking at doing it and Intel
has been making integrated graphics for
a while now they've gotten better
they're still like rape they're better
than they were I used to call the Intel
graphics decelerated I don't call that
anymore though I still don't generally
use it so there how long before Intel
probably within the next several years
it takes a long time to make a GPU or
CPU you're talking years of architecting
they could be five years probably now
before there's anything that's actually
remotely competitive and who knows if
that's going to be enterprise or
consumer if they'll even bring it to
consumer the first iteration so that's a
problem if you're looking at consumer
but the fact that Intel is even
considering this is pretty big news I'm
not saying that like go in tell her
anything like that what I'm saying is it
takes a company at about Intel
with a market cap of what between I
don't know what it is anymore but
between 150 and 200 billion or something
like that gigantic company surpassed
only recently by Samsung I think in
silicon fabrication takes a company of
their size to do this because if you
want to own the fabrication plans you're
talking multiple billions of dollars
otherwise you're working with Global
Foundries and tsmc and companies like
that who'll do this silicon production
for you which is fine they do a good job
too and video names they both use them
but it takes big money and those fabs to
get on their list it's also very
expensive because you have to outbid
everyone else to get your processors
made so to answer your question with
into I think Intel's the first we're
likely to see if there are even any
others the industry kind of encourages
actually our society in general sort of
encourages things like duopoly x' when
you're talking about these multi-billion
dollar investments to make a product so
i don't know that we're gonna see a huge
shift but until might do something who
knows maybe that means other things
we're seeing in China for example the
dianna CPUs that we mentioned in our
hardware news video those are getting
made lice it's a company that's 51%
owned by AMD so they can get the x86
cross-licensing over to them so that's
the other big thing CPUs to see
competition on the CPU space and only
requires a ton of money and a ton of
talent and a lot of time which also
requires money but also requires
licensing so x86 the basically the what
all modern gaming desktop computers are
built on is and there's a common
misconception that x86 is like solely
windows 32-bit or something but now you
need x86 processors to run anything that
you're doing on Windows gaming and stuff
like that x86 is an Intel thing they
license out Andy has x64 they cross
license each other it's a symbiotic
agreement but for both of those to be
licensed to another company requires
tricky things like 51% ownership by AMD
which yeah how much is it really a
competitor
at that point so those are some of the
things consider intellectual property is
a big hurdle money is a huge hurdle
billions of dollars to make your own
fabs or otherwise just just start
engineering something that's competitive
and then find a fab to make it so yeah
stuff to think about IBM power still out
there though and it's useful in
supercomputing and very least I'm sure
there's other processors I'm overlooking
posting below give people something to
look at and research but you know we we
kind of know what exists in the consumer
market pray didn't answer your question
the previous SPN will air that otherwise
there was about nvme SSDs nvme and that
to SSDs excuse me that was a really good
question that I had it on here twice for
some reasons but check the other ass gen
for that it's about heat sinks and
whether or not they are BS for nvme I'm
about to us as these trucker nerds said
sgn safe voltage for 24/7 OCS running an
8700 K at five point three gigahertz all
core with one point three five volts
that is really good that's like what
we're doing on our 8086 k you must have
gotten one of the the good 87
your 8700 k would have been bend as an
ad 86 k if they were bending them at the
time that it was made so i is anything
below 1.4 to say for three to five years
i can't give you a year estimate but or
is it better to run lower than max
obtainable frequency in favor of lower
voltage so 1.35 is fine
I'm not I wouldn't worry about that so
even for a long term use 24/7 use don't
worry about it but I want to be at one
point three five is like is crazy you
got one of the best 87 or case that's
out there it's a gold sample if you
wanted to run I don't know let's say you
can do 5.2 at one point to five volts
I'd probably do that just because it's a
lot lower heat it's a lot lower power
consumption and your gaming performance
or even production performance is
basically unchanged by 100 megahertz
difference so I yeah I would not worry
about one point three five one point
forty plus is is definitely kind of the
the barrier for comfort for a long term
use be most careful about your si system
agent voltage don't push that too high
definitely not one point
four volts ideally 1.3 below and then
VSO CNA and these different stories but
same idea for that one next questions
from quantum braced or actually
statement CCIE 4.0 will greatly help
with m2 SSD speeds and Thunderbolt II
GPUs this is in reference to the last
ask G and where I talked about PCIe 4.0
and I was talking specifically about
graphics but quantum braced and two or
three others of you who commented on
this and one of our one of our friends
at a company who contacted me you all
have a really good point which is I did
not talk about PCIe 4.0 or 5.0 is
usefulness for i/o I didn't really think
about it at the time for graphics is
what I was focused on that all that
stuff still applies if you have PCIe 4.0
questions for graphics but for IO 4.0 it
makes a lot of sense because you can
accomplish the same amount of throughput
with half the lanes so that's a great
point thank you for pointing it out if
you have two times the throughput per
Lane then yeah for things like nvme SSD
is where you're already kind of
potentially bump it bumping up against
four lane limitations on gen 3 then it's
going to help because suddenly four
lanes will achieve the twice of what
they did previously with 3.0 another
thing to consider is the PCH so Intel
when PCH is connected via DMI and that
interfaces four lanes as well so with a
newer PCIe if they if they're going to
stick to DMI the way it is now they keep
going across PCIe having a newer
generation PCIe with more bandwidth or
throughput potential there's it's going
to be helpful for all attached i/o
devices to CCH so a great point think
you were pointed out next one Jeff brisk
says this may seem like a silly question
but as super is it super unusual to be
able to overclock the memory on a gtx
1080 to 1,000 megahertz offset an
afterburner my friend just bought an MSI
gaming X 1080 this weekend and I helped
him OC it got around plus 150 on the
core clock
I was pretty astounded by the results
runs totally stay at what that OC I have
seen it before a lot of the time it's
sort of tricking you so one of the
things to consider this is something
that I that
was taught to me during the mining stuff
so when all the mining craze was going
on some of you I think did some Chiefy
mining and commented about some of the
things that I said in other videos and
one of the things I learned was that
mining because I guess it's pretty
memory intensive you can get these plus
1000 offsets to the GPU memory but in
reality if you check the what the hash
rate I guess you'll see that there are a
lot of invalid hashes or something to
that effect because it looks like plus
1000 but it's actually either
encountering memory errors or just
inaccuracies or is unstable but it looks
stable so plus 1000 depending on the
application is potentially a misnomer or
misleading it might be throwing memory
errors you might not see it reflected in
games but you know depends on what
you're doing so to answer the question
it is unusual to actually do that kind
of memory overclock in with legitimacy
like actually stable unless you're maybe
using like like bins down memory that
was supposed to be 9 gigabits per second
but they just called it 8 because they
needed to fill market demand or
something to that extent
so it's pretty unusual yes whether or
not it's it's actually stable as the
bigger question so you might want to
find some GPU memory benchmarks run it
through them and just see if it throws
any memory errors and also check check
and see like look at gpu-z and
cross-reference it with afterburner and
cross-reference that with EGA precision
so use 2 tools for the overclock see if
you can get the same offset and see if
1,000 in afterburner and precision give
you the same numbers in GPU Z because if
they don't sometimes have had things and
I don't know if if this is happening
here it depends on what version you're
using we've had issues with afterburner
in the past and precision where it'll
interpret some of the inputs it'll
accept the input but the output will
actually not correspond with the input
that I type meaning that you'd be able
to type in a higher number than it was
reality so you can use those
applications cross-check next one is
from oh and you'll typically see reduced
performance rest
if it is unstable so it sounds like
you're not seeing those though that's
not a good one look or next one I'll be
frank I'm leery about using mine the ham
says is thirty two hundred Hertz castex
cast 14 still the sweet spot for ddr4
ram or to state it differently does the
looser timing of say thirty 866 cass 18
the gate
most of the speed benefits leaving me
with more expensive ram for no
noticeable improvement our live stream
with 8086 k spent like two hours doing
memory stuff it's easy to get
diminishing returns with ram let's just
assume you're running something that can
actually do thirty two hundred and
thirty eight hundred plus because that's
the bigger thing as it can the IMC do it
can the motherboard do it can the
architecture support it so let's assume
that those are all supported in that
scenario running something like CL 14
3200 I would say is a definitely a sweet
spot in the very least for affordability
3200 CL 14 is pretty affordable and
highly performance will use that made-up
word
whereas 3600 if you can afford it is
more of the real sweet spot because if
you do 3600 at CL 16 or 14 depending on
the quality of the die then that's
really where you kind of cap out and at
that point you're diminishing returns
territory for a lot of architectures
with any kind of workloads that we
benchmark there are there are things I'm
sure that would do more with higher
speeds or something as far as frequency
versus tines yes some applications fire
strikes a great example if you run CL 11
or 12 on fire track with slower
frequencies it's gonna get you a lot
further then if you're on a higher
frequency with CL 14 or 16 so yes there
are diminishing returns the point I
would say it where you encounter those
is going to be like 3600 or thereabouts
or 3400 somewhere in that territory you
kind of get a black hole and there's
some between 30 to 36 but stuff to think
about next one is from celerity who says
do stator veins increase static pressure
on fans if so why don't more companies
use them I'm gonna keep this short but I
asked NOK to about this economy tax so
stator veins idea here is that you're
putting a guide between the radiator and
the
fan and the idea there is that it
distances the fan hub from the radiator
so the fan hub is kind of a dead zone if
you put a fan right up against something
you want to cool the middle of the fans
not gonna do anything and so whatever's
behind the middle of the fan won't get
cooled so idea of a stator vane is that
you're creating a gap so that the air
has some chance to sort of form around
the hub and cover the whole surface area
of fans rather than have a dead spot
talking to naktu and others about this I
think an octopus said actually spoke
with another company as well but one of
the three companies I spoke to said
they've looked into it and that
oftentimes the radiators have enough of
a bump like a gap between the radiator
housing and the fins that they don't
need a vein and they're separately to
allow more airflow so that's something
we might test in the future I've
considered it if there's interest I'll
look into it you know super behind right
now no promise is on a timeline but from
what the companies that have looked into
it have told me it's just that there's
kind of a point of diminishing returns
you really increase how fat that whole
radiator fan combo is which is a big
problem for usability and I guess the
gains were not worth that usability hit
and I guess some of the from what I
understand so on the better radiators
that space the fans a bit farther from
the fins do fine anyway great question
though something I'm also curious that
last one RC asks how do you define a
gaming router in quotes today actually
offer benefits are they basically just
gimmicks made to entice people into
buying a fancy-looking the router that
basically does the same job as regular
router i define a gaming router as 99%
utter BS that is my definition of a
gaming router they might have some extra
features honestly a lot of time it's
just tacking the work just like with
gaming chairs attacking their gaming on
it to a target market that might not
know a whole lot about the component and
they just know they're using it for
gaming so dammit that thing's called
gaming router it probably won't do what
I want it might have a better interface
you don't really need the port for word
games anymore but maybe that's maybe
easier some of the ones that I've worked
on in the past
we don't do much with them really have
like zero feature difference at all they
just look like a fortress or something
instead of a router personally speaking
I prefer to buy more office focused
things for office tasks like high-speed
Internet
even if I'm using it for gaming just
because I'm going to trust that I'm not
overpaying for the word game and the
title of it so no they don't offer a ton
of features that are actually going to
be legitimately useful to you they might
have some things but I question whether
those things they have or anything you
can't do on your own with a normal
router so that's it for this one as
