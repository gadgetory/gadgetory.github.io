SG n we're shooting three this week
technically two of them are for public
release and then one of them is for
patreon release as always leave your
questions in the comment section below
for the next episode or episodes what
we're doing right now is we're gonna do
a trial here we're doing a pilot the
plan is to air to ask you answered this
week maybe next and they're gonna be
about 12 hours apart so we're not
removing a video slot from the
production cycle we're adding one so
we'll be trying eight videos per week if
it performs well if people like it we'll
keep doing that if not then we'll go
back to one sgn per week max and then
the patreon bonus version if you go to
patreon.com/scishow tiers get the
behind-the-scenes stuff we just shot a
behind the scenes video of our fantastic
setup for example and today we'll be
shooting one of our power supply testing
so before that this video is brought to
you by EVGA and the X 299 dark
motherboard for the Intel high-end
desktop CPUs the X 299 dark is one of
the only motherboards on the market with
proper vrm cooling we've tested this and
found significant performance increase
over those without active cooling on the
BRMS this board was used in our recent
attempts to set a top-10 record in fire
strike and you can learn more about the
X tonight on dark at the link in the
description below first question for
this week is kind of a tricky one or
actually the first two questions are
kind of tricky
it's from RB who says with the GBP gone
now do you think am the or do you think
board partners excuse me it like Asus
will revert back to their original
branding like ROG Strix for AMD cards or
do you think the damage is done and
NVIDIA has still won the first ever to
say does only keep it real here and and
say from a consumer perspective I think
like most slights against anybody in
this industry anyway I think that the
whole GPP thing will be forgotten for
better for worse pretty quickly I mean
look at look at what happened Kyle from
hardo CPU not bit wit broke the story
and then we covered it quite a few times
but mostly to the effect of
we're looking into it before I finally
released recently the thing that talked
about what we found a couple other
people covered it but eventually as
Kyle's leads went silent and everyone
else's went silent you didn't hear about
gvv anymore so it was still there in the
back of the minds of everybody we were
still talking to be people we obviously
released that video talking about what
we found the point is though that was
when GPP was still a thing and when
there were still some bits of
information that people could release
now that it's basically at least claimed
to be dead by an videos blog post I
honestly think that this is going to be
something that is just forgotten by
consumers the gtx970 for example is
probably the the most tangible instance
where n vide has done something that
they've been slapped on the wrist for
publicly and it was a settlement I
suppose I don't think they ever admitted
wrongdoing I think it was a they just
settled for a class action and that's
pretty much forgotten at this point as
well and to some extent that's okay I
think if the companies have righted the
wrongs or in this case paid out a
settlement and they don't do it again
I think it's okay to to forgive and
forget or at least forget but also at
the same time consumers as a an
amorphous mass of people do have a
really short memory and attention span
part of that I think is outrage culture
where everyone wants to find something
to be outraged at every single week or
day even whether it's actually worthy of
outrage or not and some of it is just
because there's so much going on and
that people have lives and it's
unreasonable to expect anyone look at
like outside the image look at
Volkswagen they're doing just fine and
and they had a pretty serious scandal
with the whole emissions thing so I
think in general consumers and and the
culture we live in does lend itself to
forgetting about things like GPP and the
Volkswagen thing as the example outside
the industry is a bit more serious than
GPP in terms of like actual world impact
so I do think that
people will forget about it now as for
your question forgetting it's not really
the question the question is do you
think it will have impact so do I think
I think I would I mean obviously if it's
not clear I don't actually know an
answer to this because it's kind of
impossible for anyone to know an answer
to this but I can give you the best kind
of guesses educated guesses to my
knowledge based on talking with the
partners at manufacturers so the first
part of the question do you think
companies like Asus will revert back to
original branding from what I understand
the ROG branding I don't think was ever
going to be an nvidia brand I think it
was going to be the sub brands of our G
like Strix like you pointed out that
we're going to be caught at by Nvidia
away from AMD I don't know I have not
spoken with Asus about this there are
I'm not spoken with any of the companies
specifically well I don't have answers I
can share because a lot of them won't
share with me what's happening next but
we'll be at Computex soon and I suspect
they'll get more information there
people tend to be more willing to talk
in person if you are in the industry
hello and you're one of those people
who's willing to talk to me about what's
going to happen next off-the-record pull
me aside at Computex and tell me what
you want to tell me and then if I can
publish it as an anonymous source and I
would love to do that
but consider this a a petition for
information when I meet with you at
Computex but otherwise I I do think that
this was killed pretty early GPP and I
know that it's been a discussion for a
while some of the products that people
talked about not having gaming brands
attached to them as a result of GPP like
that gigabyte box or some that MSI's
cards that were discussed some of that
stuff's been in flight for a while now
like a year so the question is well has
GV been something behind the scenes for
a year that we've never known about and
those companies have been working to
remove their gaming brands from those
aim of the products for a year
or have they act did they actually just
genuinely decide not to brand them as
the gaming brands a year ago and then GP
came out and it looks like a coincidence
I don't know I don't think what I'm most
curious about is what's going to happen
to the new AMD brands that emerged after
TVP where Andy was like you know there's
this whole that Nvidia gtp thing and
we're gonna make our own brands for AMD
cards I don't know what'll happen to
there is I think I think that comes away
the most questionable because it's like
AMD announces they're gonna have special
brands for the cards then anybody was
like their ride we're walking away from
it so I don't know what's gonna happen
there I kind of feel like nothing's
really gonna change to be honest with
you I I'm I'm genuinely not sure but my
suspicion presently is that unless
Nvidia is still pulling some strings
behind the scenes that we don't know
about I honestly believe that if GBP is
dead and there's not something silent we
don't know about that's replacing it
that that brands like ROG Strix will
remain attachable to AMD cards that's
kind of what I think right now but I
don't know and I hope to talk to some
people at Computex and find out and I'm
sorry I don't have a really good answer
for you but hopefully that's given you
some of my questions for you to think
about and then what I would ask of you
all is if you hear more about GBP and
what's going on or if you this is kind
of like either be careful here because I
want to say if you see something say on
the next cards launch from AMD or
whatever if you see there's no strict
branding there's no ARS branding stuff
like that
please let me know but also please be
careful of jumping to conclusions just
let me know in a neutral fashion Twitter
and comments are great especially as GM
comments because I read more of those
than any other video and then we will do
our best to look into it at that time
but at this time it's really hard for me
to say what's going to happen however I
primarily picked this question to
include two one give you some insight as
the stuff I did know like the timelines
for everything in it and some thoughts
on how consumers forget everything
instantly and that
okay sometimes they're not always and
then a B P is another great example of a
company that probably shouldn't have
been forgiven but and then a third point
here is to just put out a public note
that if you're in the industry get in
touch with me my email is on the website
under the contact page get in touch with
me let's talk or meet at Computex
whatever and if you have stuff you can
share off record that we can publish
that'd be fantastic and that's really
the main reason for including this next
one talus right house recreational news
says Steve Kyle from heart osep said
that his website is basically done and
over thanks to his journalism on GPP by
running stories I put on video in
harmony light do you think the impact on
G n will be as severe or will GN fare
better because yen didn't break the
story I am not worried at all I don't
know what Kyle situation is I don't know
I don't really know him I don't know if
we've even met
it or if we did it was a long time ago I
don't know much about hard osep for the
GM side of this I'm not worried like we
this is kind of what we do is is beat
companies up over things and I didn't
break the GBP story so certainly that
does have a relationship like there's
there's a difference in how much your
relationship with the company is
affected by breaking a story versus by
following up with a story when everyone
else does and also we didn't have any
information at all on the GPB thing so I
I think well Kyle openly said that and
the float of the story to him and they
never talked to us about it because I
think they were still pissed at us for
what we said about them with the
threader for stuff regarding embargoes
so we never even heard about the thing
until Kyle published it when all of you
heard about it so that certainly has an
impact but also I guess that the only
reason I bring this one up is because
I'd like to say with any company that
this is not an Nvidia specific thing
with any company I'm not really too
worried about pissing them off because
we've got a couple things so kind of
public disclosure of some of our
strategy
if you haven't figured it out we're
pushing patreon we're pushing product
sales like the GN mod mats which I'll
plug right now it's on the table these
3d teardown crystal things are pretty
cool the merch store has them it's a big
glass object with a laser engraved logo
in it we're making more products to the
point is by by splitting ourselves to do
some product manufacturing patreon
direct support we're working with a lot
of companies in the industry in terms of
like I mean I work with case makers
power supply makers now with our new
test setup fan makers now motherboard
vendors video card vendors all this
stuff so even if we piss off all the
video card makers we'll be okay because
we have enough support from the
community through merch sales through
patreon through other avenues like just
straight Adsense on YouTube even is okay
these days we have enough support and
I've I've specifically diversified our
revenue streams heavily enough that if
we piss companies off it's fine we don't
need their direct product sampling if it
means that I have to kiss their ass I'd
rather buy it myself and so I've
established ourselves in a position
where we can do that now and you know if
they make a good product great I'm happy
to review it positively if they make a
bad one that's fine too I'm not really
afraid to review things negatively that
said obviously there's always a
relationship juggle where you kind of
have a certain amount of social capital
you can burn with these companies where
you kind of make a decision like this
products absolute garbage this thing
they're doing is bad do I want to burn
both these things at once or do I want
to space them out a bit to give some
time to heal because if you do too much
at once yeah you definitely incinerate
that bridge instantly with the wrong
type of headquarters in charge a lot of
the PR people in tech marketing people
do end up on our side of things and
they'll advocate for us internally
because a lot of time I find that they
they understand things pretty well
they're very level-headed PR and tech
marketing especially are the closest to
enthusiast users that you'll get with a
lot of these companies and
they tend to advocate for us so that's
great but headquarters can put their
foot down and say stop sampling them
they just burned us twice back-to-back
we need to stop this and that's fine
we're not entitled to product I'll buy
it but but the point is I can buy it now
because we have all the support from you
all which is really important because if
the only audience I have to please is
the viewers then we're in good shape
because that's what I'm not here to like
I would rather be an attachment of the
audience of the consumers in terms of
like being an arm attached to consumers
that you can use to hit things way as
opposed to being attached to the
company's off over here where we just
market stuff so if all I have to do is
focus on what you all want that's where
I want to be and and if we have your
support and we're selling things like
products real products and merchandise
and whatever and we have other avenues
other streams of revenue Adsense just
straight Adsense stuff like that we'll
be ok obviously advertising money making
makes things complicated but the whole
point of what we're doing the reason you
see me pushing this mod map so much and
I'm sure it's kind of annoying sometimes
but I'm sorry the reason I do it is
because this stuff allows us to distance
ourselves from manufacturers as
advertisers as sources of revenue which
means that I don't even have to worry if
I piss them off so yeah I mean it's it's
a strategy to do what we're doing and
it's working pretty well so don't worry
about me don't worry about GN we're not
going anywhere we're in a good position
right now and I think it allows us to
kind of do whatever we want to do so
we're in good shape
next question buff Mick Oh actually I
should mention one more thing the last
thing I wanna mention is I made fun of
that vacuum thing a while ago right and
even though I made fun of it and it was
stupid for a lot of a lot of reasons
there's one thing I want to mention
which is non manufacturer sponsors we
ran ads for a couple of them recently
people who don't make computer
components
that our sponsors are the best
advertisers you really could ask for as
viewers because even okay the vacuum
thing notwithstanding because everyone
released a video same day it was like
the stupidest most see-through thing you
could do as a marketing company but
let's just say one youtuber put out a
vacuum video or put out
I kind of hate sponsored content so
let's say an ad within a video for a
vacuum that's okay with me
sponsored content I hate but the point
I'm getting at is if you run ads for
Dyson if we sold an ad to I don't know
let's say like Dollar Shave Club we've
sold ads to them running an ad in in our
ad spot for Dollar Shave Club or for the
GM store even is the kind of ideal place
you want to be because the more non
manufacturer ad partners you can
establish like Linus has done for
example as an extreme example the more
distant you are from any concern of bias
or anything like that whether it's it's
sort of subconscious bias or whether
it's viewer perceived bias you're
farther away from it by working with non
manufacturer advertisers so that that's
also something you want to keep an eye
out for in terms of our future is how to
and that's that's how we're showing
ourselves up so we can continue doing
whatever the hell I want and saying
whatever I want about products because I
like saying when a product is not
deserving of praise and I'm going to
keep it that way otherwise I wouldn't be
doing this job next question buff make
large huge second attempt hey Steve if
one were to build a streaming PC capable
of outputting to 1080p 60 streams with
reasonable bitrate settings at the same
time how many cores would be necessary
great question I was planning on using
threader for nineteen fifty X I'm not
sure if that's enough course or it's
definitely enough cores your question of
if it's overkill is kind of a different
one but first example we did dual
streaming test with the seventy nine
hundred X and later with thread rep
right I'm yeah we did it with thread
referred and so if you look up our
thread or review we should have a
streaming benchmarks page that I
think we did a dual stream where we
output to both twitch and YouTube
simultaneously I think at 1080p 60
actually I think twitch was 6 megabits
per second I think YouTube might have
been 10 and thread Ripper to the best of
my memory does perfectly fine in those
scenarios so definitely it's enough to
sustain you is it overkill it depends on
your streaming settings I I pipe if I
wanted to do a dual stream and not use
restream or something like that just a
raw dual stream out of my system I
probably would want thread Ripper or an
h EDT Intel CPU either one by which I
mean like 12/14 core area it may be 10
core but 12 or 14 kind of makes me most
comfortable I think with either of those
setups I know with with thread Ripper
right I am positive that you can do dual
stream I can't remember what speed
settings we used for h.264 encoding
check the review for the 1950 extra here
for that I want to say it was probably
faster though and faster puts out pretty
good quality so h.264 softer encoding at
faster with effectively 60 megabits per
second if your internet cannot sustain
at that point it's pretty good and you
can always drop it down to fastest or
something getting below that you do lose
some quality getting above it you can
enter placebo territory so yeah I'd be
perfectly happy to recommend a 1950 X or
like what is the Saudi 940 or one of
those CPUs would be good for that task
ID that'll be fine recommending either
of those from Intel or AMD and you
should be pretty happy with it
just um watch out for your internet for
your upload speed that's probably
biggest potential bottleneck next
question and Mike Ludwig says how do you
feel about Google's new sponsor button
it's now in beta for non gaming channels
it seems to be similar to twitch for $5
a month you support your favorite
channel and in return you get perks like
exclusive badges emojis for live streams
access the sponsor only posts on a
community tab do you think it's possible
solution for channels that are being
demonetized is this something you would
consider doing I I do not if if I were
concerned about YouTube
d monetizing me I would not then put my
faith in the sponsor button owned by
YouTube we start there I presently have
no plans to start using the sponsor
button on YouTube
I actually I feel like YouTube got on
the boat a bit late here I think I think
they killed the channel thing that Kyle
was doing bit with Kyle this time when
he's bit with Ultra on YouTube they
killed that stuff and then they saw how
much money was going to patreon and I
think YouTube was like wait a minute
that should be our money so I think they
got on the boat a bit late and the
problem I have with the sponsor button
right now with patreon we can take I
don't know I don't remember what the
minimum is but I know our lowest here is
$2 so with patreon we can take $2 we can
take $100 and even though $2 the average
is less than 5 I'm pretty sure our
average is I don't know it's like it's
between like three and four dollars or
something average is less than five so
yeah it's lower on average than the
sponsor button
however with patreon we take like ninety
five percent of the money with a sponsor
out and we would take seventy thirty
percent of your money's going to youtube
with patreon I can allow people who
don't have five dollars a month to
support us and get access to things like
our primarily our discord where you can
basically talk with our team or with our
members in the community so my view of
it really right now is I would rather be
more inclusive and have a if patreon
allowed it I'd have a floor of a penny
but I don't I think they're minimums
like a dollar these days it might be too
but I think it's a dollar so I'd rather
have a floor of one or two dollars and
allow people who can't afford five to
join like if you're in a country with a
weaker currency than US currency and you
maybe just don't have a lot of money but
you can afford two bucks
I'd rather allow that then create a wall
like to me it's your wall should
basically be do you pay or not not how
much do you pay and obviously there's
some things for which you do require
more money by which I mean I require
more money like if I'm sending you a
shirt of course I'm gonna require like
20 bucks at which point internationally
might even lose
that's fine because idea is its patreon
and maybe you'll continue giving two
dollars the months after that and it'll
make up for it but if it's just like
digital access to discord I'm fine with
the $2 donation and I'd rather be
inclusive of our community there has to
be some kind of wall there I just spent
a few minutes talking about how patreon
supports us so obviously I have to have
like if I'm gonna be on discord talking
to people it can't be to 10,000 people
it's got to be to the people who support
on patreon so there does have to be some
kind of wall I just I think fives too
high and I also think that it YouTube
should it's also too low at the same
time like someone wants to give me 20
bucks and make up for all the people
giving me too
then I'd obviously like to support that
as well I'd love to send them a shirt or
whatever and patreon makes that a bit
easier for us so patreon does absolutely
have problems and I do have problems
with it but I think it's a better
solution than a sponsor button presently
and I like its flexibility in that you
can kind of set rates let people hear
what they want for the most part I like
that a lot about it and they also let us
keep more of the money super chat takes
like I think 30% also it's a lot so does
YouTube for the sponsor button and it's
one thing if Adsense takes 45% it's
another thing if people giving you money
takes 30% like that's kind of that's
kind of heavy-handed I think the service
isn't as big a provision as ads not like
for Adsense YouTube is allowing us to
use their platform for which I am
tremendously grateful and they are
allowing us to upload tons of data to
their servers a lot of people who get
like 5 views on their videos they take
in a huge amount of data on so I
completely agree with the cut they take
for Adsense I don't know that I agree
with the cut they take for donations
that seems a bit extreme
but no I don't really plan on using
right now that could change if there's
if a lot of you really want it let me
know I guess but if you do if we let me
know as well so that I can I can keep
doing what we're doing next once your
Axl says I've been told that one
laughing a CPU do it oh yeah on a
horizontal glass service ie glass coffee
tables this would be more smooth in
addition to smoother than the ordinary
bench top or CGI
first thing first of all the mod mat is
a hard surface I saw people who liked
that thing that will give way under the
sanding no Iran you don't have one
you're talking about it's pretty hard
service secondly I have a we put
pressure contact paper on the IHS and
it's pretty much smooth so all the
comments that were like you should have
done it on a glass table I'm sorry
the contact paper suggests otherwise the
the surface is basically perfectly flat
and we can take a shot of it a photo or
something to include it but the bigger
point I also want to make is people
seems to not pick up or maybe got edited
out in editing I don't know I think it
was in there though
I said how the corners were getting
sanded at a different rate than the
center that's because the corner is on
an AMD IHS are a different height than
the rest of the AMD IHS that's why it's
not because I was applying different
pressure it's because and I probably was
but also the contact paper at the end of
it after we did polishing and everything
else off camera because it's super
boring contact paper suggested it was
perfectly flat flatter than the original
so either way it was better than the
original could I have done it better
yeah sure I could have sanded it a bit
better we could have put it on a flatter
surface although this is pretty flat and
it could have been improved sure I'm not
saying that there's no truth to that but
the pressure paper suggests that it was
basically flat and absolutely better
than the original that's really the only
thing I need to know was it better than
the original the answer is yes
so I'm sorry laughing just doesn't have
a big impact on something of that kind
of TDP maybe something a higher wattage
wouldn't matter more but you know I'm
but the thing again that AMD IHS is not
perfectly level so that seemed to be
something that was missed
IHS is can be concave or convex
depending on which year they were made
what what manufacturer they are and then
they can also have the edges at a
different height than the rest of it as
in the case of AMD CPUs and I'll grab
that contact paper and we can take a
photo of it
ever included in here hopefully so hey
editors representing this throw that in
next one scooby-dooby what's your
opinion on how certain consumers
anthropomorphize national corporate
multinational corporations like Intel
AMD Nvidia eg using terms like good and
evil personally boggles my mind yes so
mmm-hmm I think it's kind of crazy that
anyone would attribute human
characteristics to these huge
corporations for the most part because
like the thing is if you if you look at
AMD Intel or Nvidia and you say they're
a good company or they make good things
I would disagree in all three of those
instances the way I look at it is I try
to look at this stuff at a product level
so is the product good and if so then
that's all that I need to know if the if
they may if I don't know even if you
have a company that it's made a strain
of really bad products I still wouldn't
say they make bad things I'd probably
just try to say this chain of products
is horrible don't buy it because it's
always possible that company can make
something good or something bad
and these doing pretty well arising
right now it's still possible they put
out a bad cpu intel same thing
Nvidia same thing so if they're doing
well with their products right now it
doesn't mean they are a good company
they make good things it means that
product is a good thing so I I think
it's very dangerous to attribute a
sweeping characteristic to a company
like they are good or their products are
good when they can burn you even without
intent just by slipping up and making a
bad one because I mean yeah companies to
some of its people of course but I still
wouldn't anthropomorphize it to use your
word that it seems kind of dangerous to
go that route so yeah I I would say just
be careful of it company doesn't really
some of them care more about consumers
than others but you still just want to
look at everything at a product level if
you can go
you have to look out for yourself too if
you want to buy the best thing then look
at it product wise pick the best product
if you have strong moral or other
considerations that's great I respect
that
but it's not something that I personally
consider as a review or I don't really
consider it my job to be like a moral or
an ethics reviewer in addition to a
product review or I'm looking the
product if the company has done terrible
things
okay we'll probably mention it but I'm
still looking at the product at the end
of the day and and I see that as more of
my job you know I'm like not really
qualified to do a character judgment at
the same time as a product judgment and
I fully respect that it matters but I
will leave it to the individuals buying
it because I think that that stuff gets
into the more subjective territory I
don't feel comfortable going there but I
also just answer your question no don't
I would not attribute characteristics to
an entire company even though it is a
song that's employees yeah so that's it
for this point I think that's all me
questions we're gonna try the pilot pain
with two SG NS I don't know 1215 hours
apart something like that let us know
what you think we'll look at the view
numbers and see if it warrants doing it
continually and as always help us out
directly on patreon.com such gamers axis
that's a thousand times that word this
video or store that cameras next has
done that if you want to pick up one of
our mod mats or if you need something
cheaper but you really like it then
these are pretty damn cool they're just
trying to ask crystals in the case of
this one it's like three pounds so pick
one of those up to help us out directly
that way if you prefer thanks for
watching I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
