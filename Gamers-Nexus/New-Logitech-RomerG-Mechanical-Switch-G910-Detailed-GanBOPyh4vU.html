nexus net and we are here with logitech
i'm joined by a Vincent Tucker director
of gaming and today we're talking about
a new type of switch and that is the
roamer G switch can you give us a top
level overview of this keyboard switch
of course so we worked long and hard on
developing this unique switch and really
what we were trying to do is you're
trying to focus on how to make gamers
lives better so with this romaji switch
we've reduced the travel distance by
twenty five percent to increase the
speed so it's in the actuation distance
is shorter so as you can get more action
out faster on your spell's of the stuff
we also increase the durability of the
key switch so it goes up to 70 million
cycles and on top of that you know
everybody loves lighting in a gaming
keyboard so it's RGB lit and each Key
has the RGB LED right in the center so
you get nice even distribution of the
light and it has a lens on it that
distributes it evenly across the top
surface of the key and one of the things
we were looking at earlier with the with
the keyboard was that the switch itself
stays out of the way of the lens so I'm
sure you probably won't speak too much
to competitors but for viewers cherries
cherries switches tend to be rated
around 50 million click scale is 40 or
50 million and the switch itself sits
above the LED normally depending on if
you look at other switch types so that's
that's the aesthetics and the LEDs the
actuation depth it sounds like was a big
focus absolutely and did you work with
any any pro gamers or anything on this
yeah actually we interacted with cloud
nine with TSM we interacted with the
Alliance out of Europe and we're always
doing outreach we have about 10 e sports
teams around the world that we interact
with to help develop our products and in
terms of software can we talk about
software at all for programming the
lighting yeah of course so the software
itself is it's quite robust you could
you could program a
Stan actions you can program based on
profiles each key is individually
configurable so you as a user or a game
developer can utilize our SDK or just
individually go in as a user can go in
and set up the keyboard in any way you
want you can make make it look like
anything that you that you want it to
look like and when you integrate any
kind of scripting support and software
it would be really cool if you could
have things like keys change color based
on cooldown in MMOs and mobile cool down
since the right yeah so that's a really
good idea and a little bit of that is up
to you know the game developers of
course right but I could imagine you
know say you're playing some game that
has a global cooldown you hit the button
in it and it goes red to tell you that
it's it's been used and maybe amber when
it's about halfway back to then goes
green or something at the top when it's
ready to be used again that would be a
fantastic feature that what that would
be a fantastic feature yeah so ha romaji
switches the keyboard can use the full
name of the one that's that's coming out
yeah it's the g nine ten orion spark and
do we have an MSRP target on that yeah
it'll be at 199 US dollars and it'll be
adjusted based on the region that
they're in okay so there you have it
check the link in the description below
for the full article coverage and a
review as it comes out we're filming
this far ahead of launch so I'm sure
that'll be nice and awkward on you two
check check the link it'll be somewhere
on the website and thank you again we'll
see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
