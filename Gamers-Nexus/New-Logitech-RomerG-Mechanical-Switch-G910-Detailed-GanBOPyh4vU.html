Nexus dotnet and we are here with
Logitech I'm joined by Vincent Tucker
director of gaming and today we're
talking about a new type of switch and
that is the roamer g switch can you give
us a top level overview of this keyboard
switch yeah of course so we worked long
and hard on developing this unique
switch and really what we were trying to
do is you're trying to focus on how to
make gamers lives better
so with this romaji switch we've reduced
the travel distance by 25% to increase
the speed so it's the actuation distance
is shorter so you can get more action
out faster on your spells and stuff we
also increase the durability of the key
switch so it goes up to 70 million
cycles and on top of that you know
everybody loves lighting in a gaming
keyboard so it's RGB lit and each key
has the RGB LED right in the center so
you get nice even distribution of the
light and it has a lens on it that
distributes it evenly across the top
surface of the key and one of the things
we were looking at earlier with the with
the keyboard was that the switch itself
stays out of the way of the lens so I'm
sure you probably won't speak too much
to competitors but for viewers cherry is
cherry switches tend to be rated around
50 million click scale is 40 or 50
million and the switch itself sits above
the LED normally depending on if you
look at other switch types so that's
that's the aesthetics and the LEDs the
actuation depth
it sounds like was a big focus and did
you work with any any pro gamers or
anything on this yeah actually we
interacted with cloud9 with TSM we
interacted with the Alliance out of
Europe and we're always doing outreach
we have about 10 eSports teams around
the world that we interact with to help
develop our products and in terms of
software can we talk about software at
all for programming the lighting yeah of
course so the software itself is it's
it's quite robust you could you could
program it
actions you could program based on
profiles each key is individually
configurable so you as a user or a game
developer can utilize our SDK or just
individually go in as a user can go in
and set up the keyboard in any way you
want you can make make it look like
anything that you that you want it to
look like and when you integrate any
kind of scripting support and software
it would be really cool if you could
have things like keys change color based
on cooldown and MMOs and yeah so that's
a really good idea and a little bit of
that is up to you know the game
developers of course right but I can
imagine you know say you're playing some
game that has a global cooldown you hit
the button in it and it goes red to tell
you that it's it's been used and maybe
amber when it's about halfway back to
then goes green or something at the top
when it's ready to be used again that
would be a fantastic feature that would
be a fantastic feature yeah so romaji
switches the keyboard can you use the
full name of the one that's that's
coming out yeah it's the g9 1000 ryan
spark and do we have an MSRP target on
that yeah it'll be at 199 US Dollars and
it'll be adjusted based on the region
that they're in okay so there you have
it check the link in the description
below for the full article coverage and
review as it comes out we're filming
this far ahead of launch so I'm sure
that'll be nice and awkward on YouTube
check check the link it'll be somewhere
on the website and thank you again we'll
see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
