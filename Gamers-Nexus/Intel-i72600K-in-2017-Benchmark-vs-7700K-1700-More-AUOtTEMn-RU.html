received a lot of requests to produce a
similar revisit for the i7 2670 bridge
cpu from 2011 that was intel's then
flagship core series cpu in this revisit
we'll be testing the 2600 k for stock
performance and overclocked performance
in games on the bench alongside some
synthetic tests and a blender test pass
before that so this coverage is brought
to you by the Computex conference which
runs from May 30th to June 3rd in Taipei
Taiwan this year Computex is the biggest
event of the year for PC hardware and
technology where we preview the newest
prototypes before they come to market
you can recommend attending or following
this event online for pros and
enthusiasts in the market learn more at
the link of the description below for a
donor who saw our rising revisit from
two days ago at this point you know that
there are some fairly important updates
to total war Warhammer and battlefield 1
that impact the results of Rison testing
after the updates you can check that
content for the full detail so note here
that we have not fully retested
everything with those two games yet the
rise in CP is that were retested were
the 700x primarily there was some 1700
retesting but not a whole lot and intel
has not been rerun through those two
games either
so this content was tested written and
more or less produced during the same
week as the rise in revisit content with
the exception of running those tests
because we had already conducted them
previously so we will do further updates
with the r5 review is coming soon but
for today we have not included the full
retest suite of Intel CPUs with those
games there may be changes going forward
we will see the i7 2670 narrow bench
though along with some synthetics so we
do have a pretty damn good idea of where
the CPU stands today as demonstrated it
with the 2500 K old case q Sandy Bridge
CPUs were able to overclock upwards of
four point five to four point eight
gigahertz with reasonable cooling but
the stock i7 2604 m--
our 4.5 gigahertz 2500 K
synthetic benchmarks and in threat
intensive games like watchdogs -
although we ended the 2500 K revisit
with a conclusion that now is a good
time to start thinking about an upgrade
to cable a core Rison i7 CPUs are
conceived as more future proof today
we'll be testing that conception to see
how it holds up to reality some 5 or 6
years later with our 5s around the
corner now is a good time to start
building on this data and of course
we'll iterate once of the review embargo
lifts for those CPUs just to remind
everyone of the specs the i7 $2,600
it was it shipped with a base frequency
of 3.4 gigahertz and boosted to 3.8
gigahertz out of the box the CPU also is
part of Intel's long-standing i7 core
architecture for the enthusiast lineup
meaning that it runs 4 cores in 8
threads with the help of hyper threading
and points of interest here Sandy Bridge
was interesting for two main reasons
that we should talk about today and one
of those is the dies were soldered to
the IHS in most cases and that something
intel has not done for a number of years
now they do help compound or Tim for the
most part for their modern CPUs and the
other interesting point is that Sandy
Bridge had some challenges with hyper
threading that we haven't talked about
in a very long time because it hasn't
really been a modern part to review so
the challenge is there were there
generally was no appreciable improvement
in frame rates with the games out when
the the CPU launched and even in
follow-up testing years later like with
Metro last light
the only benefit was really in some of
the frame times so that wasn't something
that people were paying attention to at
that time this is kind of before the
tech report and PC per frame time
revolution so it's interesting to look
back at it now now that we have more
tools and we have a new test approach
and when I say we I mean the industry as
a whole in general not just gamers Nexus
so frame times will be interesting to
look at here because they were never
really a focus when this chip came out
we in the old days saw something like a
1 to 2 percent performance hit at times
of hyper threading on or off on the
original hyper threaded chips and that
was an overhead thing these days that's
more or less gone in fact if you disable
hyper threading on
7,700 kay you'll see a pretty big
performance hit as a bad thing
so it's performing as it should be these
days for full testing methodology check
the link to the description below for
Patrick's article we talked about the
CPUs tested how they were tested and
things like that in the article we will
not be approaching some of the topics
here today like thermals and power
testing because that stuff is going to
be the same as it was when the chip
launched so it's not really a relevant
factor in what we're looking at which is
gaming performance and synthetic or
render performance thermals haven't
changed power hasn't changed other than
potentially the difference in modern
coolers being much better than they were
then so that's all down there we've
added kV Lake 1750 k CP use FX 83-70
CPUs and rise in CPUs to these charts
which were not present on the 2500 K
revisit that may be interesting and the
updates have not fully cascaded through
all of our CPUs as stated earlier so
that means total war and battlefield
needs be rerun on the 2600 K and
everything else in the most part but
this is still good data to provide a
foundation of how its aged today
especially because those updates most
likely impacted rising more than the
other chips but we'll soon see if that's
the case we're starting with blender and
then some synthetic benchmarks and we'll
move on to gaming after that at stock
frequency the 2600 K took 72 point nine
minutes to render our blender scene
which was made in the house for a
comparison that's about 74 percent
slower than the modern i7 that's the
7700 K which finished in 42.4 minutes a
4.7 gigahertz overclock on the 2600 K
proved a little unstable with blender
initially as usual as this is the
longest-running CP test we execute but
stabilized after further increasing the
V core we were at about one point three
five volts maybe a little more at time
the 4.7 gigahertz OC allowed the render
to complete in fifty four point five
minutes which is just behind the i7
4790k stock and just ahead of the i-5
7600 k overclocked and this regard the
older i7 is showing its threat advantage
over even the newest i5 k be like CPU
given that blender doesn't care much
about anything other than pure thread
count of course clock helps a bit but
not that much
Josie decreases render time by 26%
compared to the stock 2,600 K the 7700 K
itself only reduced its render time by
nine point seven percent through
overclocking so this is a pretty big
gain for the Sandy Bridge CPU for owners
of the 2600 K who bought the chip
originally for a cheap hedge between
gaming and TV production workloads now
it's not a bad time to upgrade if you've
become unsatisfied with performance of
course if you're happy with it don't
bother but if you need more out of it
the r7 1700 completes the same render
tasks in 33 minutes without an overclock
for a time reduction of 40% over the
overclocked to 2600 K that said if you
only care about gaming the needs and
recommendations change we'll get to that
shortly in the gaming section moving on
to Cinebench we're on another
multi-threaded test that favors at raw
thread-count overclocked speeds so it's
not bad to have both the overclocked
2600 case chordate 30.5 much higher than
its original score of 622 without the
overclock but also much lower than any
modern eight thread CPU a more
reasonable comparison to modern i5s
reveals how well the 2600 K has held on
comparatively by 5 7600 K a 4 core
processor released in 2017 actually
scored 5 percent lower thanks to its
lack of hyper threading our highest
scoring 4 core i7 with a thread the 7700
K at 5.1 gigahertz did exceed the 2600 K
by 35% for a total score of 11 22 and
the r7 1700 at 4 gigahertz with 29 33
megahertz memory scored 1764 in this
test though with a lower single core
performance than the overclocked 2600 K
on to fire strike the 2600 k's original
score and fire strikes demanding physics
test was 9033 sandwich in it between the
newer I 5s and our results although it
managed to cling on and outperform the
stock I 560 600 K the stock I 570 600 K
finally surpassed to the Sandy Bridge i7
once overclocked though the score jumped
to 12,000 57 just shy of the i7 4790k
stock performance and higher than every
i5 tested overclocked or not looking at
these metrics as FPS numbers rather than
or is it the 2600 K at 4.7 gigahertz it
lands at 38.3 FPS for the physics CPU
test whereas the stock 2600 EK x @ 28.7
FPS between them by 5 7600 K and it's
overclocked variant land in the 30s with
the 4790k just above the overclock 2600
K cr7 1700 stock with 26:56 measures
memory performs around 53 FPS with the
newest gen I 7 at 46 FPS times pi
benchmark results we published on the
website in the article again linked
below if you want to see those but for
now we're going to move into the gaming
benchmarks performance and watchdogs 2
is one of the things that necessitated
this article in the first place in our
2500 K revisit the overclocked to 2500 K
only managed to eke out 67 FPS average
while the 2600 case stock hit nearly 74
with no overclock at all at 4.7
gigahertz the 2600 K moves from the 70
3.7 average with lows at 54 and 48 to 89
up 3 FPS average with lows at 64 and 52
this is higher than the r7 1800 axis
overclocked peak both with comparable
lows and it's higher than any non hyper
threaded Intel CPU including the 7700 K
with hyper-threading disabled the over
car 2600 K is performing right around
where the overclocked 70 nodded performs
or about 21% behind the 7700 K stock
watchdogs 2 is really a best-case
scenario since it takes advantage of the
available threads more than most of the
other games will as far as watchdogs 2
goes upgrading would involve buying a
modern i7 a 4790k or newer that is or
finding an especially robust r7 none of
these seem particularly worth it alone
that be from intel or AMD but if you're
also upgrading for other reasons like
modernized IO and chipsets or other
games then there's more to consider and
will obviously continue going through -
look at those numbers improvements were
slightly less impressive in total war
Warhammer when compared to watchdogs -
but a 15% increase in average FPS with
overclocking really isn't bad
particularly when looking at the 1% Leo
boon 1 30 FPS still isn't exactly
competitive when compared to the newest
chips on the market and it lags behind
even the overclocked I 373 50 K it seems
that as we saw in our initial rise in
reviews total war or hammer
necessarily fully leveraging the number
of threads available to it that said and
this is really important
there's since been an update to total or
warhammer that we found to improve
rising performance in an important way
and you can find that in our previous
rise in coverage just from a few days
ago this might also hold true for the i7
2670 EPS in total war Warhammer and will
update in time for the r5 reviews
probably very shortly
GTA 5 also ran at about 130 FPS average
this time improving from 104 FPS GTA has
engine constraints that exhibit
themselves with the i5 CPUs as we've
discussed a few times in the past so the
2600 K is stuck with comparisons only to
r7 and i7 is due to issues with the i5 s
and probably other CPUs in the near
future but that is an engine constraint
not a CPU issue and it's something we've
talked about in the past of you're
curious to learn more it affects both
and the end Intel when four cores or a
similar core account is available we see
the overclocked to 2600 K performing it
below the stock 4790k at 141 FPS average
and 99 FPS 1% to lows
that's ahead of the r7 family of CPUs
there are seven 1700 X with a 34 66
megahertz memory overclock and 3.9
gigahertz core overclock is able to
outperform the 2600 K and average
framerate though and if you are curious
about those numbers again the previous
content talks about how we were able to
push the r7 to that point Metro last
light follows the same trend as other
titles and is an interesting one to
include because it came out about two
years after this CPU was released so
that really puts into perspective how
old the 2600 K is at this point
it offers a moderate improvement again
to about 130 fps and that means beating
the i5 CPUs and even the r7 but the 2600
K still can't quite approach the 4790k
this could be due to something of a
memory ceiling being that were limited
to 21 33 megahertz but regardless it's
quite an achievement for the CPU given
again the age of the chip and the dates
of Metro last light Sandy Bridge CPUs
are an interesting thing to study
because of how they've held on first of
all advanced
modern technology particularly on these
storage runs like USB updates again 3 is
a new thing with the chips compared to
Sandy Bridge the USB 3.1 gen2 m dot 2
device is nvme as a protocol these
updates to io have made the Sandy Bridge
series increasingly obsolete if that's
something you care about but at the same
time it's held on reasonably when you
consider things like modern coolers
being pretty damn affordable
comparatively especially in the liquid
market where CL CS are now really fairly
ubiquitous the affordability of those
coolers and the ease of access to
overclocking thanks to dozens of guides
all over the net because this is an old
chip now mean that you can overclock
this thing pretty easily so if you own a
22 kind of K and you're not ready to
upgrade yet there's two things to think
about 1 are you happy with how it's
performing today maybe you are if that's
the case who cares keep waiting until it
is dissatisfying to use the chip the
second question is are you willing to
overclock it to get it on par with
something like a modern i-5 or even just
under something like 14 790 K in terms
of the Intel comparative charts if you
are it takes maybe an hour of work maybe
two to get a fairly stable high
overclock on the 2600 K chips we were
pushing 4.7 the range seems to be about
4.5 and higher I know back in the day
some people were hitting 5 gigahertz I'm
liquid but definitely 4.5 is fairly
reasonable to assume possible with some
effort into the tuning and you can find
all kinds of guides to help with that so
if you can do that you're looking at
gains that are definitely something that
can actually help push performance to
again modern i-5 levels in terms of
upgrades if you are on an i7 2670
2 back then you're probably looking at
something like an i7 7700 K or an r7
chip maybe the 1700 those would be kind
of the two similar options in terms of
price for what you're getting now this
goes back to our 1700 review and then
you should look at our revisit from a
few days ago as well if you're looking
at Rison
basically if you're doing pure gaming
and nothing else it's not a bad upgrade
to go to something like a 7700 K from a
2600 K especially great overclock the
7700 K to get that kind of gain back
from where you were overclock on the
2600 K now there are seven chips come
into play when you're looking at
something like blender where the
difference in blender or other CPU based
rendering tasks if you perform those
would be larger between the seventy
seven hundred and the 1700 well when
overclocked especially then perhaps the
difference with gaming in some games but
for pure gaming especially at higher
refresh rates the 7700 K is what we'd
push you toward if you're doing those
mixed workloads or more production heavy
stuff consider eyes and we've got plenty
of coverage for you on that if you're
curious about Rison and are out of the
game or having built something and since
you built the 2600 k system overall it's
held on pretty damn well keep an eye out
for our r5 CPP reviews those will be
coming out very shortly if you're in an
upgrade cycle and in a holding pattern
it's not going to hurt you to wait
another week we'd suggest checking those
out thanks for watching as always
