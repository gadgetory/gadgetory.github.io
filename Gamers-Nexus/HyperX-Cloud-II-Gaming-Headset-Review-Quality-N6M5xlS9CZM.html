gamers nexus donna and today we're
looking at a headset this is the HyperX
cloud 2 headset made by kingston and
their hyper x division this is a
continuation on the hybrid cloud one
headset go figure and the cloud one and
cloud two are effectively identical
except for one thing and that is this
this is an inline DSP or digital signal
processor and it is responsible of one
thing all it does is switch between 7.1
audio and normal stereo audio so it will
digitally simulate 7.1 channels meaning
it's only got two drivers so it's not a
physical 7.1 setup like some headsets as
two drivers are 53 millimeters each
pretty large for a headset driver most
on 10 be 40 or 50 millimeters and in 7.1
mode it'll just process the signal so
that in your games you can tell sort of
diagonally or even just up down left and
right where your enemies are so
counter-strike is a good example of
testing this and that is done with 7.1
the headset is eighty dollars MSRP
available on Amazon other sites for 80
bucks it is competing most directly with
the gamecom 780 or 788 by plantronics
which we're big fans of at the site the
headset includes a separate set of ear
cups if you're unhappy with the ones on
the headphones by default and these are
pretty insulating so they eliminate a
lot of the outside sound non digitally
and they do get a bit warm because
they're leather or leatherette and then
the alternative cups are more like the
ones on the 788 or 780 or basically any
other headset on the market in that they
are foam their memory foam they breathe
a bit better and they let in more
outside noise so depending on your
preferences you'll want to switch those
ear cups out this headset is pretty
tight when it's new but it wears out
after a couple weeks and gets a bit more
loose so it actually fits properly on
your head or hair and then other than
that it's really all pretty
straightforward branding they have them
broidered hyperx logo they've got
leatherette everywhere else so it's
fairly comfortable unfortunately headset
does not Bend outwards so you can't
twist it out if you have it on your
shoulders which is something I would
actually like on this headset unlike
most other ones because this is very
travel friendly it includes a bag that
you can keep it pretty protected it is a
padded bag and it's got a single plug on
the end
your phone so that is a single Mike and
output plug and you can just plug that
into your phony up both and speaking of
Mike's the microphone is detachable it
is not currently attached the mic
quality is very poor on this headset
unfortunately and that is a sort of
deciding factor for you so I will not be
using this for gaming I love for travel
and for music off my phone but not for
gaming for that one reason and that's
because I do a lot of microphone based
gameplay if you don't use a mic it's a
good headset especially with the 7.1 set
up which is actually a bit better at
simulating positional audio than the
gamecom 780 in terms of comfort I do
prefer the 780 because it's a bit
lighter on the ears it doesn't feel as
pressured but this one is a good
insulating device if you want more
insulated sound so there's your trade
off you need to decide between one place
you will not want to use this headset is
for music with this 7.1 enabled it's
perfectly fine if you're just using a
stereo obviously you would want
something like audio technica if you're
using it strictly for music but if
you're using gaming on music in a hybrid
environment then you'll want to disable
7.14 music because it just muddies it
and sounds pretty bad in games you end
up with a somewhat bolstered and fuller
sounding gunshot or footsteps sound in
the correct ear cups so you can tell
where the enemy is and it's not as
invasive as with music so that is the
HyperX cloud 2 overall I'm very happy
with the portability and how easy it is
to transport and keep it protected I'm
happy with the fact that it is using a
3.5 millimeter jack I really don't like
USB but if you plug it into the DSP then
it switches to USB because it is now
processing all the audio on the DSP and
doing 7.1 conversion so if you're gaming
this is pretty good for counter-strike
for battlefield for Skyrim things like
that but you really will want a better
or an aftermarket microphone because the
quality is pretty poor it's good enough
to get you through a game not good
enough for streaming and youtubing so if
you are one of those people do not use
the microphone on this for your
streaming ventures because it will sound
pretty bad a t-box direct competitor the
gamecom 780 or 788 look into that so
that is sort of where you need to be
looking if you're considering buying
this headset overall pretty good product
just had some shortcomings to keep those
in mind and I will see you all next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
