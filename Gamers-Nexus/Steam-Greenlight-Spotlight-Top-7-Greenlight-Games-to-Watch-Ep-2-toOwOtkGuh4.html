nexus donna and this is our second
episode of green light spotlight our
series which highlights upcoming steam
game candidates with all of your
recommendations we received in the
comments of the first video and on the
reddits we've worked in seven stellar
looking games for this episode let us
know below what you want to be featured
in episode 3 moving on in slot number
seven of this week's spotlighted games
we find dream a beautifully rendered
first-person exploration game set within
a classic three-act narrative that has
our character exploring his dreams with
a feel similar to dear esther dreamcast
us into a nonlinear 3d environment with
multiple possible game endings and each
act we find ourselves exploring our
characters dreams nightmares and
attempting to solve puzzles and unveil
secrets to progress through this story
driven adventure in slot number six we
have dungeon dashers which is a
fast-paced cooperative dungeon crawling
game based in of course dungeons this
turn-based dungeon delving game has
quote handcrafted dungeon experiences
each riddled with traps and varied
monster configurations the game features
a completely original chiptune
soundtrack retro pixel art a crafting
system and a huge focus on epic loot as
is important in these types of games the
game has online co-op and single player
and focuses on a party of four
characters each of the classic class
archetypes routine makes slot number 5
this survival horror game places players
in an open world styled abandoned space
station or as open as a space station
gets I suppose and is centered around
floppy disks actually it's a heavy story
focus that provides multiple outcomes
and intriguing secrets behind these
stations decay routines gameplay and
notable mechanics are its full body
awareness lack of HUD and health system
and pressure to hide and survive its
trailer feels like a mix of amnesia dead
space and the 80s version of our future
number for this week is Inquisitor a
baldur's gate esque classic RPG that
reports over 100
hours of gameplay 90 monsters a hundred
and eighty NPCs and quite unbelievably
5,000 pages of text that is around
according to the developers 1.5 million
words which is quite a few words if you
were not aware and in this game the
world crumbles as heretics run rampant
chanting infernal incantations and
bringing death upon the town's folk is
your team's job to interrogate these
heretics find out what's behind the
rising of all these demons and when
necessary kill them changing pace from
the dark confines of Inquisitor we look
to octodad the deadliest catch the first
octodad received at worldwide renowned
in the indie scene for a silly story and
fluid mechanics but the eight-legged
father masquerading as a human has
returned in the deadliest catch you work
desperately to conceal your tentacles as
a family trip to the aquarium turns
fishy and you find yourself longing for
a life at sea the third person mechanics
are centered around subterfuge and
destruction with a hint of fatherhood
simulation thrown in as the developers
have told us you must work to conceal
your true identity from your family as
you struggle to pick up objects and
travel to apparently this aquarium
project zomboid is next and it is
already available through the developer
but is seeking to come to steam the devs
put it best project zomboid is an
open-ended zombie-infested sandbox as
they say and it is not a matter of how
you'll survive but rather how you'll
inevitably die yes they have that much
faith in us lay defenses collect
essentials and fight off hordes of
zombies as you battle through this
isometric survival game and the world is
a reportedly an ever-expanding sandbox
and laced with stories and other
elements of survival play providing a
bit of something for everyone and almost
feeling like the original fallout from
my own experiences in this game
Black Mesa takes number one this week
years in development and just as many
years of seclusion Black Mesa has
finally come to a point of playability
to the public this reconstruction of the
original half-life has us playing
through the Black Mesa research facility
where the original game has been
expanded to include deeper mechanical
interaction and a completely
restructured story around what the
modders have envisioned half-life should
have felt like this source mod has
broken completely into the category of
full game with its new music dialogue
voice acting thousands of new models and
visual effects and many more features
Black Mesa will be available for free
starting on sep tember 14th provided you
have the source engine down downloaded
but it needs your vote to make it the
steam so with that go vote for all the
games that you want to see make it to
steam and that's it for this week's
episode of green light spotlight comment
