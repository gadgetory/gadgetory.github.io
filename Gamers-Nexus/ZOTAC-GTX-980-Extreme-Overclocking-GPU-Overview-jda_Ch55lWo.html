Texas dotnet and today we were playing
with razor blades we're doing an
unboxing and overview video but some
news oh tech video cards using the new
GM 204 GPU on and videos gtx 980 skew
now technically I have a few 970 s here
and a few high and 80s here already
we're doing some pretty cool testing
with that coming up shortly but today we
are specifically looking at the extreme
series 980 that is in zou tax new amp
lineup and the reason we're doing that
is because I spoke about them at game 24
there's another video check the sidebar
or the channel or one of these buttons
on YouTube and we talked about the Omega
970 and briefly overview the Xtreme nine
seven nine seventy when I did that video
at games twenty four we did not yet have
an extreme series card in person and in
theory that is what is in this box
almost this is a huge joke being played
on me I have already test superclocked
versus non super clock with EVGA it is
on the channel it was not impressive so
we're gonna go for a trial number two
and see if and see if a pre overclocked
card is actually worth the money over
the stock card over the reference cooler
over the reference clock provided by
Nvidia to these manufacturers so we've
got two of these I'm just gonna take one
out because this is heavy and nerd arms
were not built for lifting but despite
all of the Don's it's no means that
you've all constantly make in all the
videos so this is the 980 extreme
biotech and a quick overview it is in it
is a twelve ninety eight megahertz clock
I believe looking at the back of the box
here I think it's twelve ninety eight
megahertz for the core clock and that is
over the stock reference clock by Nvidia
of about eleven hundred twenty six
megahertz for the gtx 980 so that's
somewhere in the 165 to 170 megahertz
range for an OC not bad really that's
that's pretty good you can definitely do
more
as an end-user I'm not sure if these are
Bend out better or not
I'll ask though attack and we'll talk
about that in the full review coming up
shortly but it's about 170 megahertz
overclock will that impact your gaming
well with EVGA and super clocking for
the 750 Ti and 750 ti SC all other specs
identical not a big difference but this
is a much different game with a GPU like
this it's tremendously more powerful
than the 750 Ti so an overclock could
potentially have nonlinear gain over
what we saw with the 750 Ti which was
the earliest possible Maxwell GPU and
was quite different in architecture than
the ones used in the 980 in the 970 so
that's what we've got let me just pull
this out of the box here and we'll wrap
up the video this card
hole this is heavy this card is it uses
a different cooler it's got three fans
on the central fan is for intake and
differently from what I have seen before
we're seeing regularly before the outer
tube fans are for exhaust so pretty nice
box there very fancy if you are a fan of
boxes I have a lot of them we have
cropped them out of the shot
typical pack probably CD and warranty
information yep I didn't actually look
but that is definitely what's in there
and then we've got the video card which
the only thing that any of us I actually
care about pull that out here and this
thing is a monster I believe it takes
two and a half slots it is a big video
card you're gonna potentially have
trouble SLI in it do keep that in mind
I'll mention that the full review and
let you know if you can do it or not so
we've got a backplate here as per
Nvidia's design standard issue now but
it's modified everything is modified
this is a non reference port I should
also mention that this video card in
particular has two 8 pin pin outs on the
board whereas the standard design
suggests only two six pin pin outs
because stock it is about 165 Watts TDP
stock meeting and
is reference design and with zou tax it
was approaching 180 watts getting up
there anyway so that's why they have
these extra pins so you can actually
power that and so you can overclock more
heavily if overclocking is your thing
after I test it in theory this would be
able to provide the power required for
that the 980 extreme also has an LED up
here that turns red or green based on
use you will see that in my next video
red being more intensive use normally 3d
gaming green being sort of idle and
things like that now normally your video
card mounts like this with the LED
facing down this was something pointed
out by Nick Blackwell who is an awesome
case monitor you should check them out
if you have not and he's a friend of
mine he pointed out that the LED is
facing down and suggested that the LED
in the future perhaps be installed in
the back plate now that would be pretty
cool I'd love to see it
but not today but what I can tell you
just by looking at this without taking
it apart that we've got as I said intake
fan exhaust exhaust what happens here is
ZOTAC is expecting and I noticed because
the EVGA has had issues with this in the
past
they're expecting that if you have all
these intake it's not really gonna do a
whole lot more because you're gonna run
into issues with the air sort of getting
trapped in there and having no way out
so this pushes it in with one fan
centrally hits the GPU I believe the vrm
is over here and so is the DRAM DRAM
somewhere in this area where the card
sticks up a bit more so what's happening
air goes in here it gets pulled by both
of these fans and then spit out all
sides of the card and out the back of
course at the back of the case and that
should exhaust hot air faster we will
see and testing and how well that works
the whole card has kind of a carbon
fiber gunmetal look to it which is sort
of cool definitely then we got a bit of
a 1980s cartoon robot look which is what
I will say for the t-word so I don't
have to say it because it might have
some kind of YouTube infringement
attached to it so 1980s cartoon robot
look that's what we've got going on here
I'm not sure if I'm a fan of it
but it doesn't really matter because if
you're buying the card it's up to you so
you take a look you decided you're a fan
um you know in the comments below what
you think of the aesthetic so that's the
video card power-boost on here is based
these are just caps on top of solid
capacitors these are just branding caps
and yeah they'll tell you that they'll
help keep the capacitors cool is that
for reals I don't really know it's
that's probably a non-issue in general
but they do use solid caps I know that
for sure
so should get a bit more life out of it
the OC plus tool is actually a sort of
cool
micro USB just like you would use for
your phone connector you plug that into
your motherboard using a micro USB to
USB connector which they provide and
then you can look directly through
though tags what they call fire strike
software and see your OC performance
check your voltage levels and all that
in real time in theory a bit more
directly and accurately than if you use
in something like hardware monitor
afterburner things like that so that is
no tax at new 980 extreme video card in
the amp series it's about 160 570
megahertz overclock on the core clock
it's 177 megahertz overclock on boost
has a standard issue 4 gigabytes of
video RAM on board here gddr5 of course
with the 256-bit memory interface as
issued with the GPU by nvidia none of
that's really change just the clocks I
should mention it has a 190 megahertz
memory clock OC so it's going from 70 10
megahertz effective to 7,200 megahertz
pretty big jump so between the core OC
boost OC and memory OC we've got some
testing to do I'll have fun overclocking
this will let you know how it works
please comment and tell me what you
think of the design because I'm curious
and we will see you all next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
