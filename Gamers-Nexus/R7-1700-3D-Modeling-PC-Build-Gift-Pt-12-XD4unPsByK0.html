project this is a risin build for a
community member of ours zdg is the
lucky recipients of this build the video
will go up after he receives the system
because it's a surprise so the plan here
zdg is one of those very interesting
characters you run into in life he has
the most insane mad scientist electrical
engineering projects that he post to our
patreon discord he found us on patreon
through the discord community and then
other members of that community have put
together an effort to purchase some of
the parts in front of me to build zdg a
better system before that this video is
brought to you by thermal Grizzly makers
of the conductor hot liquid metal that
we recently used to drop 20 degrees off
of our coffee lake temperatures
thermal grizzly also makes traditional
thermal compounds we use on top of the
IHS like cryo not and hydro not pastes
learn more at the link below I'm not I
can't recall exactly what he's using I
want to say it's an FX series CPU but
either way it doesn't really matter
because it's it's pretty aged zdg puts a
lot of abuse on his components and what
he does is basically just a lot of 3d
modeling and animation posing work and
things like that using a very specific
piece of software called Daz studio I
think it's it's one of the kind of like
different ones we never really hear
about I don't know a lot about it except
that it really likes threads and so
we're gonna build him horizons he system
with a I think in r7 1700 the community
members bought the CPU I've provided
through gigabyte contacts the
motherboard gigabyte sent us an ax 370
gaming 5 we have an EVGA CLC that'll go
on I'm not sure yet if it'll be a 240 or
360 depends on what will fit in this
case which the case here so all the
parts were either collected by the other
patreon community members who wanted to
help zdg out because he's always
complaining about being stuck on
rendering scenes for days at a time so
they picked the parts out and then I
basically went to manufacturers who make
parts I like and solicited them
to send more so this isn't like they
wanted to sponsor us it was a hey I
would like to include you in this video
because I actually liked the fame that
you make so pretty interesting stuff it
should be a fun build I will note that
zdg the reason a large part of the
reason he's getting this is because he's
always very supportive of the community
so his EEG has bought every shirt we
make and multiple quantities he has
helped build Zoid directly through
contributions in patreon who of course
works with us and he's donated to
several of the community members in our
patreon group who are streamers and
things like that so this is the
community's way of giving back I
basically said hey I'll get the parts
you guys can't afford and then I'll
assemble it we'll make a video out of it
and and hopefully have one pretty happy
page however so ports like I said X 370
board
I think it's arisin 770 hundred will
find out in a moment I don't know what
they bought the community also bought a
kit of trident z ddr4 memory this is
3,200 megahertz and I think it's 6 16
gigabytes times 200 is it a 32 gig kit
there's maybe a 30 that's a really big
purchase for the community they pulled
some money on this so I think we've got
a 32 gig kit and looks like it yes so
this is 32 gigabytes and this uh this is
almost a bit of a joke at CDG's expense
but it obviously benefits him quite well
so this should be interesting for people
who have watched the Rison coverage
since the beginning at the very
beginning when rise and launch it really
didn't have great memory support as a
lot of you remember and that's more or
less been resolved but one of the
questions that zeg constantly posts in
chat is can rise in support 32 gigabytes
at to the higher frequencies so we're
gonna find out I think the answer is yes
but where you'll find out for sure
although we've already kind of done that
to some extent with our own testing we
have a 960 Evo provided by another one
of the community members and all the
list of everyone on the side somewhere
gtx 1070 purchased I believe secondhand
by the community hard drive shipped out
by someone I'm gonna clear the drive and
I'm gonna clear the SSD before we go any
further with them just for security and
what else oh pretty nice power supply
actually from silverstone the
silverstone sent out the case and the
power supply i asked for the case
specifically this is the primary PM zero
one we use this for our render machine
and showed it in our render machine
overhaul series which there's a couple
parts to now and we've liked it a lot
because it has really good ventilation
and air flow unlike another case we
reviewed recently this one actually has
crazy good air flow so despite having
this mesh in the front it's got I think
three front intake fans and they keep
everything pretty cool and that mesh
front actually does a great job at
keeping dust out to the point where when
we did a GN render rig update video
recently I pulled it all apart having
not dusted it for several months there's
no dust internally it was all in the
filter so I actually genuinely liked
this case personally so we're gonna use
that for GGG because I know he's a
function over form a guy and then this I
don't have experience with this is a 550
watt Strider 80 plus with platinum PSU
so quite a mix of parts the parts
provided by companies through our
contacts were power supply case and
motherboard and cooler then the rest is
the community so let's get to building
and we'll start with the X 370 board
socketing this is a 1700 so we'll start
there okay so I haven't done actually
like a proper full system build for a
little while because I mostly work on
test benches collecting all that data
that you all are familiar with so this
should be a fun project for me to
a lot of our benches are similar to this
set up we've been working with rising
for a while now had its ups and downs
but it's mostly up at this point but
it's still a few downs but it's it is
mostly better
we'll get it yeah I've got a tool for
this okay so I've extracted the i/o
cover just use as a cutting tool for a
second don't need subpar cooler but
Steve the stock boys with Verizon are
actually pretty good no one cares
we have better ones we can work a lot
better
the guy is in like insane ambient
temperatures he talks about being in
like 30 to 40 c a.b and he's in the US I
think he's talked about 40 at the high
end so we're going with like actually
good tooling not an exciting stock
cooling okay we should we get there this
one you can just sock them pretty much
wherever you want but I didn't need to
check the manual I want everyone to know
that Google search is a an Intel shell
so Hudson gigabyte X 370 and it
autocorrected it to Z 370 or suggested I
should say is e 370 okay it doesn't
matter
so we'll just go with the one that's a
bit further away from the socket so
we've got a black and red kit which is
good that'll go with our black and red
on the case but knowing zdg he might
disable the LEDs because I don't think
he likes those let's see what next I
guess that's really it I'm waiting on
the CPU coolers running some tests right
now so we're gonna build all this
without the cooler I'll put that in last
and it might go on the top we'll see not
sure yet that is some design did you
guys know this is a power supply
silverstone man you guys you genuinely
make some really good stuff but i don't
understand my marketing i would bet a
lot of people my audience probably
haven't even heard of this case it is
one of the better ones on the market
right now right it just they just don't
get as much attention as other brands
and it's not as much marketing in
western markets as a lot of the
competing brands so you don't hear about
them a whole lot yeah I should probably
connect oh I see the problem
all right okay so Silverstone when I was
talking about making a quality product
there is such a thing as going too far I
don't know that's that's the tightest
now I've ever had to remove should be
good to go in out of the huh just for
purposes of editing because we're not
gonna leave that whole segment thin that
was like a good 5 to 10 minutes of
wrenching on the panel to try and get it
out as clearly like I don't know if the
paint kind of dry it or sealed it in a
certain way I'm not really sure what
happened there
that fits might need the other one no
that's right okay there's our drive this
should probably get enough airflow with
all this front fans I could do it
they're all pad between the SSD and the
motherboard but I don't think I have one
thick enough for that it would help and
you don't want to cool a flash on these
but you want to cool the controllers
anyway syncing the PCB wouldn't be bad
though we're just gonna go with that
there's this is pretty elevated off the
board and it's like a quarter inch off
the board so it's not gonna trap heat in
there from the multipacks chips but the
kind of crosswind coming from the front
should be enough anyway okay so they
bought a an MSI one frozen card is it a
gaming X yes it's a gaming X video cards
as you all know are pretty hard to get
right now this one was he used I think
and I believe is ADA the community
member who bought this already tested
the card so I think it's known to be
working but I'm gonna do a validation
pass on everything once it's built I do
a full benchmark and all that stuff
make sure it's all functional and I'll
even check the i/o which I don't
normally do just to make sure that SSD
is good I want to say I think is ADA got
this for like I don't know 400 380 is
something like that it was actually
pretty reasonable considering the price
is at least at the time everyone was
looking cool
okay so cabling and cable management any
other components left here other than
that cooler obviously not sure the
cooler is gonna go in the front or the
top this case has this door in the front
over here that it's just kind of a dust
cover you can close it traps a bit of
the air into the power supply shroud if
it really is just to give me clearance
for like a 360 I think we're gonna go
with it 240 but I'm not again I'm not
positive yet I'll find out after our
testing that is done with the other
stuff it's an EVGA CLC cool I just don't
know if it's a 240 or a 360 at this
point we'll decide but everything else
looks good to go oh and I forgot to plug
in the sense pen silverstone includes a
sense pin for the 24 pin power on power
supplies so I don't have to do that too
okay so all right we got all the main
stuff kind of weird doing the cable end
without the cooler in there this is all
the crap I never plug in to anything but
builds not for me so I guess we'll go
ahead and do that USB three headers hit
everything about them I'm glad they're
going away this should have never
existed
they break they are angled and stupid
ways that are bulky and never the right
length all right I think it's as much
the way there they got to manage the
backside now you know I will say I don't
really plug things into the front panel
controller a lot anymore working mostly
on test benches but it's the most insane
part of like computer building like I've
talked with case manufacturers about
this where this thing should just be
standardized because the motherboards
had different layouts normally they
should be standardized yes it's one
universal layout for all the different
pins and then it comes down to the case
manufacturer to create a single like USB
three sized header that you just sock it
into it and you're done but the industry
can't agree on what should be where so
there's no standardization so you get
some really dumb things like that that
are genuinely very archaic
to get all three fans there plus the
back one there and I have a hard time
closing this panel I think the cooler is
done with the testing it was doing so
I'm gonna install this EVGA cooler I
have to find an AMD bracket for it but
we're gonna install the EVGA CLC 240 in
there which we've reviewed it should be
online by the time this videos up and
I'm trying to figure out where I want to
put this so because I know this EDG is
gonna be using CPU rendering for the
most part that means it's gonna be a lot
of heat coming in if I front mount this
so it would be better for the CPU but
GPUs are way more sensitive to an extra
5 degrees Celsius than CPUs are and
there's so much cleaning take in this
case anyway that we can get away with
mounting this in the top and it'll
probably it'll be better for everything
like it'll be acceptable for sure for
the CPU and it'll be way better for the
GPU this is not gonna get a hot air
blown into it for intake my only concern
is clearance with the fans on here so I
might end up mounting this inside of the
top area I'm not sure if there's room
for that but we're gonna check I think
we can probably well the tubes are gonna
be a problem though we can try a top
mounted and see if there's enough
clearance for the vrm in the memory it's
gonna be pretty close
oh man that is very close unfortunately
the pan of the ass is that the fan
headers here are never gonna be
accessible again but we'll just plug
these fans into those and that'll be
fine it is gonna be like millimeters
away from not clearing but it will clear
that I'm within I am four brackets yes
okay good
is this gonna reach yes there we go
maybe J is upside down like hey hey
okay four for matching cap screws we can
just manually spread it and we should be
good to go from here okay that looks
like it's gonna be good all right cool
so now I guess I'll plug in the RGB
thing so the upside to this one this
cooler is that if you don't like the
cable the extra cable in here that I
just installed you can set it once and
then it'll save the firmware and then
you can just remove it after that
so if CDG wants to turn the LED is off
or on or whatever you can do it and then
just open up the case remove that cable
if he if he launched you think I wrap
this under instead of over
yeah yeah so install on OS do some
benchmarks we'll do that for a part - I
mean the OS install won't be in there
but I'll do some benchmarks and then
we'll send it out to them think you got
everything so at this point I already
got the I shouldn't touch the glass to
set this flat okay all right all right
so that's the build for now I need to
install Windows do some tests on it and
I think that will wrap it up so we'll
have the test and part two which will be
a little bit more limited but it's just
gonna be some quick benchmarks power
testing maybe a thermal test stuff like
that we should be good to go on
everything though so yeah check back for
part two otherwise by the time you see
the CDG you should hopefully have the
system and hopefully it serves you well
for whatever that program was called
that I mentioned at the beginning of
this video all right thank you for
watching subscribe for more you go to
patreon.com/scishow and axis if you'd
like to join the discord community that
put this together and that's all I'll
see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
