our bench this past week tested in both
the MSI Z 270 gaming Pro carbon and
gigabyte Z 270 m7 motherboards the i7
7700 K runs a base clock of 4.2
gigahertz with turbo up to 4.5 while
running on similar architecture to
skylake the results is that gains are
primarily derived from frequency but
changes to speed shift cross point and
low-level overclocked tuning it means
there's a lot to consider this Intel i7
7700 K review is brought to you by
thermal takes p3 case a $100 enclosure
that can be leveraged as a wall-mounted
test bench p3 is easy to work on for
enthusiasts who regularly change
components click the link below for more
information before an architecture
overview let's quickly go over the
seventh-generation kb Lake SKUs for the
new family there are 40 of them in total
that includes the why u H and s Series
CPUs the most relevant ones of course
are the i7 7700 km 9k the i-5 so d 600 K
and the i3 70 through 50 K which is a KS
q i3 that we'll be looking at hopefully
late January and in total the TDP for
all 40 SKUs ranges from 4.5 to 91 watts
so it is a pretty big range and the most
popular SKUs are those three that I
mentioned the case use respectively the
1000 unit pricing for those CPUs will be
$340 for the eye 7077 100k 242 for the
7600 k and 168 for the 7350 KB 7700 9 k
will be three hundred three dollars and
the cheapest i-5 will be 65 watt TDP i5
2400 at 182 dollars the cheapest
relevant I 3 is the i3 sony 100 at 117
1k you we've put the three case Q CPUs
into a specs table here with focus on
the 7700 K that's on reviewing today
that's a traditional 4 core 8 thread CPU
but with a higher frequency than
previously this is at least partly
achievable by refinement of the 14
nanometer process something that Intel
is now calling 14 nanometer plus the
physical changes are almost entirely at
the Finn level with Intel widening the
gate pitch and making fins taller and
this allows for increased frequency
and higher overclocking potential
somewhere around an extra 200 megahertz
minimally for the stock shipping clock
rates are upwards of about 400 megahertz
one of the most critical aspects of the
KB Lake architecture is that the Intel
CPUs are now leveraging speed shift in a
more effective capacity and that's
primarily by increasing the frequency at
which the clock rate can change in a
given second and it's up to a thousand
Hertz now a thousand times per second
the KB Lake CPUs can switch their
frequency to a lower or higher value as
needed depending on the workload this
means a few things one of course is that
you improve battery life in notebooks
and things like that when you don't need
to be running a higher clock rate for
trivial tasks for the CPU to handle the
other is that you can get boosted
performance when there are those really
bursty high requirement periods of an
increased clock to handle more
instructions and although we've asked
into what the minimum granularity is for
the clock switching at that 1,000 Hertz
interval I haven't heard back yet but it
does change out a thousand times per
second and that's bigger news for speed
shift just like everyone else these days
intel is now moving to better be CLK
awareness by providing a volt frequency
curve that doesn't mean the motherboard
manufacturers are leveraging that to the
full potential but they are adding a
volt frequency curve so voltage and
frequency will adjust in step with one
another this is a step toward resolving
some issues with the higher voltages
than what's required but motherboards
are still dictating a large part of that
especially with BIOS on things like the
gigabyte board that we'll be reviewing
shortly the KB Lake boards we've tested
so far do have large differences in
thermal performance from one to the next
with the same CPU and the same clock
rate just because the BIOS modifies what
the running voltage is for more
architecture discussion of that interest
you check the link in the description
below to our full written review which
has all the block diagrams for the new
chipsets including the Z and H and B
series chipsets and some additional
information on how the architecture has
changed with KB Lake and a lot of that
is kind of a recap with skylake but you
can learn more there let's get into the
testing now so first of all a huge note
because we're doing a CPU review it
means that we're changing CPUs which of
course means we're changing it platforms
for a lot of those as we change
platforms there might be
to change things like memory or the
memory clock especially as we get into
older generations like Sandy Bridge for
all the platforms and test benches again
link in the description below if you're
curious what memory frequency was used
or what motherboard was used things like
that and while we do want to add the i-5
and the i3 and of course the Xen CPUs at
some point when they are available for
benchmarking today we're focusing on the
ice evans frankly that was enough work
to do for now with CES around the corner
the i5 and i3 will be added shortly
thereafter for this truncated version of
our thermal benchmarks for the i7 7700 K
we're looking primarily at the
performance difference that voltage can
make we tested using both the MSI gaming
Pro carbon and gigabyte RGB version of
the m7 boards each of which has a
different auto configuration for voltage
and then we also threw in manual voltage
tuning for a better understanding of the
7700 k's temperatures compared to
manually tune to 6700 K CPUs these tests
use the kraken X 62 cooler which was
chosen so that we could monitor the
temperature Delta between the liquid the
actual cooling liquid in the tubes and
the CPU package note that all these
tests use the same settings a is T is
off turbo is off frequency is set to 4.5
gigahertz fixed on all CPUs and C states
are off fan and pump speeds are at max
settings so 1800 rpm on to 140
millimeter fans with a max pump rpm for
the first test we're looking at the
Gigabyte motherboard being tortured with
Fourier transforms for half an hour and
the i7 7700 K is constantly in the 90 C
range occasionally hitting 90 for
ambient was 21 to 22 C for all these
tests so you can do that calculation
yourself if you want at our temperature
range is plus or minus 1 C this was the
first board we tested so the concern
initially was that kb lake would run way
too hot because the same stock
configuration on the board made a be
quiet cooler a 50-dollar be quiet cooler
operate at about a hundred C with the
CPU now further investigation revealed
that it was less of an issue with kb
lake and more of an issue with the
motherboard which is what we'll talk
about in our other board reviews this
week the board was pushing voltages as
high as 1 point 4 volts at times which
is wholly unnecessary that maasai
motherboard meanwhile
produce an auto configured voltage of
about one point two eight to one point
three two volts with a corresponding
temperature range of eighty to eighty to
see max about ten C lower this is with a
package power that's reduced around
twenty seven Watts from gigabytes but
with exactly the same frequency
performance we then dropped the gigabyte
board down to one point two thousand
five volts manually giving it a range of
one point one eight eight to one point
two seven five volts as controlled by
the motherboard though with our manual
guidelines this broad temperature down
from ninety four C with the auto out of
box configuration this is straight from
the factory although with an updated
BIOS prior to release and brought it
down of 94 C to a seventy C Max massive
difference the next question is whether
this is any better or worse than the
previous generation and so enters these
6700 K with the same setup same
configuration same frequency all that
stuff and using the MSI gaming m7
motherboard with a z1 so V chip set
these 6700 K is producing a temperature
of about 70 to see on the package with
the Auto V core out of box and the V
Corps was about 1.3 to with this
configuration this is already cooler
than the comparable MSI gaming Pro
carbon benchmarks despite running a
higher reported wattage in fact when
custom tuning these 6700 K to operate at
exactly the same voltage as our manually
tuned 7700 K we're seeing a difference
of approximately six to seven Celsius
this is potentially because these 7700 K
samples we have two of them are having
trouble transferring heat to the IHS
which of course would mean that your
liquid cooler is less effective but it
will require more testing to validate
now one thing keep in mind that a lot of
this is on the motherboard vendor and
that's something we'll talk about more
but basically you should check your
voltages when you buy boards for this
platform because it will drastically
impact your temperatures aside from
thermals the blender benchmarks were
some of the most exciting to conduct our
resident video producer and 3d animator
Andrew Coleman built a custom blender
scene for gns render benchmarks and it's
got a mix of motion blur different
materials and material properties
ray-tracing things like that so it's not
an easy scene to render relying on the
CPU for crunching the scene the intel i7
lineup dating back to Sandy Bridge
though skipping Ivy Bridge shows the
march of progress from 2011 to
17 we see significant scaling compared
to 2011 si7 2600 kcp you resulting in
render time differences of upwards of 32
minutes if it's your job to render
animations and you're using an older CPU
to do so it's probably time to upgrade
to nearly anything else of course this
is ignoring the fact that CUDA and
OpenCL exist skipping the Ivy Bridge we
see the devil's canyon 4790k rendering
the same scene in about 49 minutes this
has improved upon by the 6700 K skylake
CPU which does the work in about 45 to
46 minutes and that's an improvement
around three minutes per frame from
Devil's Canyon sky lake moving to the
7700 K at its stock clocks that time has
cut another three minutes to 42 23
seconds or about 7% shorter in total
render time this scaling has been fairly
linear for three generations now
obviously with a big jump between the
Sandy Bridge CPU and what follows out of
curiosity we ran the same render
benchmark with hyper-threading disabled
on the 7700 K resulting in a render
completion time of 60 minutes worse than
the 4790k blender takes advantage of the
additional threads here and is a
real-world demonstration of what gamers
often miss out on which is job
management engines that more properly
task out all the threads in the system
overclocking the 7700 K to 5.1 gigahertz
which is trivial work on this platform
speeds up our render times by an
additional three minutes over the stock
configuration Cinebench is the next in
our line of tests this one is a
synthetic benchmark but is similar in
its objective to our custom-made blender
animation it's still rendering it uses
more Universal scoring though that
allows for better comparison between
Hardware we're seeing a performance
output of 988 points using the full
stock configuration of the 7700 K with
hyper-threading
a single core receives a score of 196
for an MP ratio 5.05 disabling
hyper-threading drops us pretty heavily
down to 767 points and a fairly trivial
overclock to five point one gigahertz
with hyper-threading enabled and a 1.3
7v core on the msi gaming Pro carbon
results in an 1122 CPU score the single
core performance for the same overclock
is at 222 and the MP ratio remains 5.05
last generation 6700 K performs at 9:41
points or 185 single core the 4790k two
generations old receives 8 9
eight points or 180 for single core
performance finally the Sandy Bridge i7
2622 score with a 130 point score for
single core performance we're moving on
to 3d mark next another synthetic test
then we'll get into game benchmarks 3d
mark tests use the new time spy and the
1080p version of fire strike just a
quick note here 3d mark results do you
have some variants in them we see as
much as 50 points of variance from one
past the next so this system gets more
accurate as the performance between two
devices gets farther apart the stack up
is about what you'd expect based on
previous tests the stock 7700 K receives
a score of 18,000 685 points with
physics score entirely CPU base and
probably the most important at 14 four
seven eight points overclock in the 7700
K to five point one gigahertz results in
a score of 19 five one eight points or
sixteen for three one for physics
benchmarking so to recap the two
important numbers here 14 4 7 8 for the
stock 7700 K physics score and 16 for 3
1
when using the overclocked version to
put some perspective in the benchmarks
we can speak strictly to the synthetic
test performance improvement and that's
approximately 13% in the physics testing
or 4.5% the total score the 6700 K posts
a score of 13 64 8 for physics or about
5.7 percent slower than the 7700 K at
stock clocks and real-world terms the
physics performance of the 7700 K posts
an FPS about 46 with the overclocked
version at 52 and the 60 to 100 K at 43
fps this is of course ignoring things
like frame times we'll get into with the
game benchmarks 4790k is at 40 fps and
moving onto times by our cpu score is
5852 on the stock 7700 K or 6371
overclocked to 5.1 the 6700 K rests at
55 oh nine points and the 4790k at four
eight five eight and then the 2600 K is
at 32 42 points so we can see some of
the disparity but need more perspective
from games to get a better idea
that's enough synthetic testing for now
blender gave us a real world look at
performance for rendering and now we
need one for gaming the main way to do
CPU tests for gaming workloads is to run
game benchmarks that are more
cpu-bound rather than GPU bound of
course because you want to root out
those differences however because so
many games are mixed workload or GPU
heavy we've thrown a couple of those in
here as well like watchdogs too just to
give a better more realistic idea of how
a high-end single GPU will scale or
limited scaling when working with even
an i5 and i7 based on how the game is
optimized but of course we've got the
CPU heavy stuff as well just for a more
hard numbers look at the differences
battlefield 1 has received several
patches since our initial Battlefield 1
cpu benchmark and we're also using new
components for the testing so the
numbers are not comparable using DirectX
11 only here because DX 12 still has
some problems in bf 1 we're testing our
suite of i7 CPUs with 1080p ultra
settings and a 96 degree horizontal fov
with these settings we're seeing the
7700 K KB like CPU operate at 141 FPS
average stock with the GT X 1080 FTW
followed by 115 fps or 1% lows and 104
fps 0.1% lows overall the CPU allows for
consistent frame times at the low end
while enabling the 1080 FTW to operate
effectively to its full potential
disabling hyper threading keeps our
average the same but brings the frame
times down measurably the 1% lows are
now 102 0.1% now 84 and then the 6700 K
pushes 147 FPS average effectively the
same with lows at 105 and 87 no
perceptible difference here but
certainly a measurable one and more CPU
bound games will help illustrate the
differences further in theory to compare
it to a popular CPU from two generations
ago the 4790k operates at around 140 FPS
average 107 fps 1% lows and 94 0.1% lows
the marginally improved frame times are
slightly a result of higher turbo clocks
and this is something we saw in our
initial 67-yard k review as well you can
check that out if you're curious about
why it's happening
our 2600 K instantly eats performance
and creates a CPU bind where it was
previously more of a GPU bind we're at
118 FPS average 78 1% load in 65 0.1%
loes ashes of the singularity has a
built-in CPU benchmark when operating
DirectX 12 and provides more of a CPU
centric look at performance with 1080p
high settings
full resolution textures that we're
seeing a performance throughput of 41.5
FPS average 33 1% Lausanne 31 0.1% blows
disabling hyper-threading which is
obviously not something this is really
built for brings us down nearly 10 FPS
and averages overclocked we don't get
much additional performance certainly
not a noticeable amount the 6700 K it
stock settings operates about 1 FPS
lower than the 7700 K about 3% slower in
percentages if you prefer and the 4790k
pushes a 36 FPS average with about 85
FPS reduction in low framerate the 2600
K puts things into perspective a bit
better approaching two times slower than
the overclocked to 7700 K moving on to
GTA 5 the chart is expectedly topped by
the OC dat 7700 K at a 151 FPS average
with low sustained near 100 FPS there's
a few FPS reduction and performance to
the stock 77 honored K with nearly equal
performance with a 67 RK with this
configuration the 4790k posts a drop of
about 7 to 8 FPS from the 7700 K or 5.2
percent slower in averages the 2600 K
pulls our GPU performance down quite a
bit - 104 FPS average with 0.1% low
values now at 65 FPS nearly a 50 FPS
reduction in performance thanks to
2011's Sandy Bridge our second-to-last
title is Metro last light just for
something a bit known and because we've
seen reasonable differences in CP
performance in the past we're seeing an
average FPS of 145 on the kb lake ksq
cpu with stock settings with lows at 108
fps and 101 FPS disabling
hyper-threading as we've always seen
with Metro last light kills performance
but it's also not a standard use of an
i7 and it's probably not developed for
moving to the 6700 K we see about a 2%
reduction from the 7700 k's results the
4790k falls to about 137 FPS average
that's a performance loss of about 6%
from the 7700 K and a 2600 K it drags it
all down to about 111 FPS average with
lows now in the 70s
watchdogs tube provides a look at a
modern mixed workload title the game has
some scaling between CPUs but is also
pretty abusive on the GPU this means
that you're getting a fuller picture at
gain limits when changing CPUs as
dictated by the games
selves but also seeing that a
multi-generational jump will still
greatly improve performance let's Shawn
most obviously when referencing the i7
2670 4 with lows at 54 and 48 even just
skipping Ivy Bridge and jump into
Devil's Canyon we see more than a 20 FPS
gain jump in another generation we land
on these 6700 K is 1 10 FPS average with
lows at 83 and 67 fps 0.1% lows these
7700 case stock CPU provides performance
throughput of 112 that's 7 FPS average
with lows at about 88 and 76 this gain
isn't something you'll notice as a user
between the 60 770 700k CPUs but it's
noteworthy nonetheless we're still
looking at a jaunt to about 2.5% before
either hitting other barriers or running
out of the overhead provided by the
higher clock rate overclocking gets us
another one FPS or thereabouts but
that's it in the immediate future once
CES is over and that's this week we'll
be revisiting the i-5 the i3 and adding
FX and Zen CPUs to the benchmarks so
definitely stay tuned for that and we're
hoping to add a few more games as well
like Total War which is absolutely
cpu-bound that'll be in there for those
benchmarks and maybe some more unique
things as we roll but for now blender
and these games have us covered for the
7700 K which proves to be an incredibly
easy overclock or that much is for sure
it's hitting 5.1 gigahertz easily on the
gaming pro carbon with about a 1.3 7
voltage if you let it auto control but I
could definitely get it lower at least a
bit by doing manual control and we'll
have more info on that and the
motherboard reviews which are going live
today and later this week performance
overall lands us around where we'd
expect from a new generation i7 out of
Intel and that's a couple percent in
games meaning that owners of last
generation the 6700 K should probably
just stick with that Intel crosspoint
obtain an h2 65 support I certainly
value ads with the new platforms but
unless you have a hard need for one of
those or these small improvements we've
shown it's best for the 6700 K owners
and maybe even
4790k owners to stick with what they've
got thermals are certainly a huge
challenge for the KB Lake 7700 kcp you
you'll want to check the motherboards
that you buy to make sure that BIOS
isn't unnecessarily blasting voltage
with the CPU like the gigabyte board we
tested which was pushing 1.3 to 1.4
volt jest with these stock configuration
totally unnecessary that was with Auto
voltage out-of-the-box the age of the
hyper 212 for something like an i7 as a
lazy cooler when not overclocking is
also over the case cues we tested two of
them even with voltages around 1.18
on the msi board we're still hitting
around 70 C with a crack in X 60 to 280
millimeter liquid cooler and that's with
the turbo clock fixed to 4.5 gigahertz
so we were operating at that clock rate
for the duration of the test it was a
heavy workload test yes but these CPUs
are definitely hotter than previous ones
and if you're planning to be an i7 owner
it's probably time to move on from the
$20.00 CPU coolers at least get
something that's a little bit better but
again there's a lot more thermal
discussion in the article link the
description below so if you want to see
how it performs in say blender
benchmarking which is a bit different
than prime95 with large F of T's you can
find that in the article and that will
give more of a real-world look at a high
workload scenario for temperature
performance and the sort of end-all here
is the same as with most of our Intel
flagship reviews for the last two
generations now which is basically if
you've got the previous generation or
even the generation before that in the
case in this case I'd be the 47 98 6700
K it's not really worth upgrading unless
you need one of those features that was
previously mentioned like obtain support
cross point things like that where you
really want something fun to overclock
because the 7700 K is a damn good
overclocker but not everyone wants it
for that reason for anyone on older
generations Sandy Bridge especially Ivy
Bridge although wasn't tested would fall
between Sandy and Haswell architectures
that we did test so we can extrapolate
the performance anyone using those to
sort of bridge platforms would probably
do well to upgrade at some point whether
that's to a 7700 K or Zen of course
we'll have to wait until the benchmark
then but for now the 7700 K is a big
gain over Sandy Bridge the 2600 K that
much is for sure for gaming that is
especially true but if you're looking at
something more recent
then gaming benchmarks are only given a
couple percentage points in performance
improvement before running into either
other walls or just running out of the
headroom provided by the higher clock
rate on this cpu versus the six
700k which is again a couple hundred
megahertz so that is all for this review
