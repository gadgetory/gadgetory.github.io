away their mini ITX Am for motherboard
at CES 2018 one of our camera operators
got there a bit early saw the board line
out and took some footage of it and I
was disappointed to see that it had
already been announced but we have
footage of it and they took it away
before anyone else get footage of it so
we'll show it anyway before that this
video is brought to you by thermal
Grizzly makers of the conductor hot
liquid metal that we recently used to
drop 20 degrees off of our coffee leak
temperatures
thermal grizzly also makes traditional
thermal compounds we use on top of the
IHS like cryo not and hydro not pastes
learn more at the link below the board
is the MSI be 350 I Pro a/c it's a mini
ITX a.m. for motherboard and it uses the
current gen chipsets as in not the x4 70
or be for whatever will come out later
that said it's still many ITX and
there's not a lot of those and it was
announced about six days ago at time of
filming so it's still pretty new
motherboard board features on it just
looking through the footage we have
before it was stolen from a spotlight
and then checking online for photos of
it because there's still photos online
and some reason they couldn't leave it
out to show but that's neither here nor
there it does have a set of two dims as
you'd expect and it's also got a fin
heat sink on the chipset the be 350
chipset that is other than that six plus
two plus one phase BRM AC wireless card
integrated with two antenna outs and
four SATA three ports there are also
four rear i/o AC wireless antenna HDMI
USB and ps2 with audio so pretty much
all the basic stuff other than that a
single PCIe by 16 slot and an 8 pin EPS
12 volt connector but in the very least
we can show you that mini ITX rise and
boards do exist I know there's a couple
out there but not many
so MSI is getting into it with B 350 I
pro AC and it presumably should hit the
market somewhat soon the Mini ITX boards
if you're wondering took a bit longer to
come to market for Rison because the
manufacturers had to add an extra
to their PCBs for trace routing because
I guess there was some sort of technical
challenge with the trace routing for
motherboards with Rison specifically in
mini ITX we've heard this from a few
manufacturers at this point don't have
the specifics yet but that's what caused
the long delay to get many ITX to market
and why it's still kind of slowly
rolling out either way that's the board
that we saw from MSI it's new as of this
week and it's worth checking out so if
you're interested in it keep an eye out
for the B through D I Pro AC otherwise
