the X 570 boards and I am joined by
Linus Linus after the roast I wanted to
offer this product to you
it's the expanders II it's our new male
enhancement pill
this totally solves everything you just
saved my computer and my marriage thank
you oh I'm so glad to be of service
before that this video is brought to you
by thermaltake C 360 DD C hard tubing
water cooling kit if you're ready to dip
your toes into the water and build your
first open-loop cooling system the
Thermaltake c 360 DD c hard tubing kit
comes with all the components you need
the kit includes a three sixty
millimeter radiator three 120 a RGB fans
a copper w-4 a RGB water block for the
CPU a pump and res DDC combo and all the
fittings needed to build a full CPU
open-loop
learn more at the link in the
description below so I guess that was
our intro that was Linus from Linus tech
tips will link him below if you want to
check them out and the roast is now live
on YouTube you should check that out or
you can just subscribe to floatplane and
get it there so the motherboards X 570
stuff leases to you as of the time this
goes up has just talked about and
announced the x5 somebody chipset for
Andy's new lineup of CPUs we have some
information on that we have some
information on the chipset power
consumption requirements the fans that
you're gonna see on basically every
motherboard with the new x5 so many
chipsets and then all the V RMS and
MOSFET information as we go down the
line
the first motherboard is MSI's X 570 got
like for the most part a messiah has
kept the same naming that they had for
the most recent motherboard launches so
God like a pro carbon and all the way
down creation kind of in a different
line on the end actually let's start
with the fans
so the chipset you'll notice all these
boards have small fans on them these are
45 millimeter fans and they have three
different profiles so there's balance
silent and boost and then just depending
on how much the noise bothers you you
can change that the thing is with these
because the new chipset is running at
around 11 watts when it's under load it
is significantly higher than the export
70 chipset which is about 5.8 watts so
going up to 11 watts active cooling is
not sure if we can say yet if it's a
necessity but it
certainly helpful the biggest concern I
think anybody in the comments will have
a preempted is about RMA and small fans
dying so a couple years ago fans were
pretty common on motherboards and the
most common point of failure on them was
dust clogging the fans and the Barons
overheating we'll see how that goes but
these are double ball-bearing they're
rated for 50 40 50 thousand hours 2000
hours and they're connected by a cable
not pin contact so if it were a problem
you'd send it to MSI but hopefully it's
just not an issue this is a resurgence
of fans on chipsets though and that's
one bring it up because it hasn't been
really an issue for quite a while now so
11 watts versus 5.8 the difference is
because of Gen 4 specifically PCI hn 4
for the lane allocation you're running
16 Gen 4 to the GPU which is standard
and then for additional to an SSD the
motherboards you'll want to check the
manual for which slot is assigned to the
CPU for m dot 2 because you you don't
just plug it into any of them sometime
do go to the chipset and in theory the
latency will be a little bit better if
it's direct CPU to 2m about two SSD
communication rather than through the
chipset so for the rest of it the
chipset is of course running PCIe Jun 4
as well this is entirely Gen 4 there's
no gen 3 on this and that is again the
the reason for the boost in the TDP the
the PCB on this particular board is
different from the rest
so the PCB is supposed to be server
grade which is I guess a 150 GS material
and we'll have builds I'd talked about
what he thinks of that what that means
as opposed to standard PCB material so
check our builds would be arm analysis
videos for those we will have those up
shortly he's gonna have photos of these
today the rest of it so this board is
set up with a VR M that's running a 14 +
4 + 1 B core the SOC and B dim and then
for the controller 235 201 we've seen a
lot of those for the the MOSFET it's an
IR 3 5 9 9 it's a 70 app MOSFET this is
an eighth layer PCB creations a 6 layer
PCB and then the others are other things
we'll talk about as we go through them
the launch date for this not sure right
now if Lisa sue is going
be announcing the launch date but if she
does we'll post it in the comment
section and pin it to the top a couple
other specs of note be o'clock so we've
got anonymous I in the past I be CLK and
having it higher than 100 point zero
zero zero zero zero zero zero and in the
past spent 100 point 5 108 which does
affect scores these are all going to be
100 flat which is fantastic so we're
really happy to see that the memory
stock frequencies should be 3204 to dim
and then 2067 for for dam obviously you
go through X and P or overclocking if
you want to change that and then all
these boards are daisy chain layout for
the memory so not T topology
it's daisy chains apology and that is
also something that we've talked about
in the past in PCB analysis videos if
you're curious about those memory
overclocking should have pretty good
potential this time I'll talk about this
more as the product of CPUs in your
launch but you should be I'm not gonna
give a number because I'm not sure how I
heard it is but it should be better
overclocking than previous generations
on the memory from every frequencies
there are no big BIOS changes by AMA
sorry for this generation and this board
we have a price haunts the godlike is
supposed to be oh wait I actually can't
say the prices so I guess you'll just
get the prices for everybody else
throughout the show and then Emma size
will not be listed but if we end up
being allowed to list a nice prices
we'll put them in the comment section
below
so unfortunately can't give you those
I'm sure it's a very lucky price though
because that would I mean that would
make sense anyway for the rest of the
boards there's the mega x57 tas the spec
on that one we've got vrm details as
well that's 12 plus 2 plus 1 at 60 and
power stage 3 5 201 once again and then
the MOSFET is three five five five
no OLED the other one has an OLED this
is the game in Pro carbon it's a 10 to 1
v core SOC and then memory for the vrm
this is a duel and MOSFET three one one
one we'll talk about that in PCB
analysis videos
gaming edge not going to talk too much
about this but eight to one on semi TBD
for the power stages and then the
creation down here is a six layer PCB
the signifier for creation is 10g LAN
and it's a fourteen to one vrm layout
with 16 power stages ir three five five
five
as for the rest the biggest question now
is power requirements and we don't have
great answers on those but there's a 16
core that's well documented out there
there's 12 core and there's other things
below that 6 and probably 8 the 16 core
we have heard it might approach
something like 300 watts went over
clocks with water and don't know what
voltages don't know what frequencies but
if that's the case then definitely more
towards that end of the line is what you
want for 16 core overclocking because as
you get down lower end these are really
not meant for the VR abs are not SPECT
for pushing a 16 core CPU to 300 plus
watts but again towards that half of the
line they'll be better suited so we'll
talk about that more in the more heart
details as we get them as always check
