at CES 2019 now they have a couple of
pretty cool products we'll have some
beer all of them like the TU on 50
follow up to an old Mini ITX case
there's also improvements to things like
the 11 dynamic of course you all likely
know this case the O 11 dynamic was made
by where's that assholes name before
that this video is brought to you by the
gigabyte z 390 ARS master motherboard
which comes equipped with one of the
more powerful z 390 BRS for heavier
overclocks on the new 9th Gen Intel CPUs
the ARS master is also one of the few
motherboards with a real heatsink this
generation featuring a mix of high
surface area fins and looks oriented
hover blocks oh and it's also got
updated RTV illumination learn more at
the link below so as I was saying dear
Bauer I didn't know he was he was there
but there Bauer who worked on the
original version of this case although
it looks like his name has been stripped
of it completely and replaced with the
Razer logo so let's move on other things
at the Leon Lee's suite this is pretty
cool this is a distro plate it's an EK
plate my understanding is originally
this plate for the the front panel of
the OLM dynamic which is targeted as a
water cooling case was what's created
for i guess the power spectrum Shai
think they were sold or are sold in
micro centers but hopefully this might
be coming to market as a standalone item
for those of you who purchased the 11
dynamic as a standalone case for DIY so
it's pretty cool it's got a pomp a flow
meter and when you look in through the
front it does kind of look like the
entire system is just filled with
mineral oil or something it's got the
aquarium effect so I know pricing I
don't have a product name I don't have a
release date this is very much a mamey
everything in this suite actually for
this show is concept which is really
cool because typically for CES you get
mostly finished products and in the case
where the company can't finish a product
fast enough like Coursera you end up
with a bunch of very boring things so
very cool to see concepts another
concept that leanly has here is a 240
millimeter CLC it's a pump integrated
into the radiator this isn't a new idea
but it's a good way to bypass a stacks
patent which they have successfully
stood companies for in the u.s. like
Coolermaster so pump is integrated in
the radiator that that does pose some
fitment challenges with other cases it
won't fit in every single 240 slot that
one with just a literal 240 would fit in
and also if you move the fans to the
other side that poses a bit of a
challenge but still kind of interesting
and a good way again to diversify the
market the bigger thing here and I'm
afraid to pull this magnet off is I
guess if you if you like RGB but you
look at this and you're like that's just
too much then you can hide 70% of it and
show the rest so anyway let me know what
you think of this because this is a
concept pricing is all TBD
it's it'll be rough to bring it down to
EVGA CLC to 40 levels or down to corsair
h 100 i levels because that's expensive
this is different it's not mass supply
from ASA Tech so cost will be a big
challenge and the biggest thing is just
gonna be do you like how it looks and
lightly only know in the comments and if
you have specific ideas what you would
rather see let them though because the
only way to really compete with
something where you're not going with
A's attack and can bring the the cost
down is going to be through looks so let
them know what you think we haven't
tested performance really dear bearer
does have a an overclock he pulled out
of his ass that he said on the system I
think it took them about 15 seconds so
it runs with the 5 gigahertz like 1
point 2 3 4 1 point 2 3 2 volts
that's all I can tell you if if it comes
to market and it probably will we'll
test it in our standardized test bench
and see how it does like I said
performance might be totally fine we've
seen what it looks like and the impeller
is is a it looks somewhat to the Dyna
Tron impeller that was used in the antic
cooler 1250 and not too dissimilar from
the a-stack Gen 6 which is cool but
again we'll need to see it more in the
field so interesting product total
concept let them know what you think we
don't need to talked about the Razer
branding and let's move on to the Mini
ITX case next so this one supposed to be
$100 it follows up an old case that we
have actually it's a really small I TX
box with a handle on it the old one
though was it was
it was just kind of like flappy and I
was always exposed so this one is a
stealth handle which is neat again
concept it needs to be strengthened
things like that the mechanism for
putting it back in bringing it back up
nice we've worked on but as a concept
we're liking what we've seen because it
does reinsert to be kind of out of the
way in discrete and then if we pull the
panel off and we have footage of this -
all the cabling for the system
integrates and hides under that top
panel which is a bi-product with the way
the handle is done so always cool to see
how a product feature can accidentally
enable another product feature and
that's what this is because since the
handle is sort of submersible the end
result is that all the cabling has a bit
of extra space to hide there in the top
panel the rest of the I don't know how
to how to put it back there's the rest
of the concept case that the t-150
should have two fans probably to 120s
not 100% final on that not a hundred
percent final on what type of fan but to
120 fans likely as the target and $100
for the price point if I didn't already
say that
weally state TBD the release date for
the cooler though if it does happen
because I forgot to mention it should be
about quarter to four this year so yeah
it's it's a small box still some changes
being made for example it might be
elevated a bit more from the bottom to
allow the GPUs to breathe better because
with r-tx all GPUs are pretty much two
point eight slots these days all video
cards and that poses an issue so might
have somewhere elevation there in the
final design otherwise for side
ventilation it is actually a significant
amount of space but again we'll see how
it finalizes so despite being closed off
in the front there's a good amount of
space on the side and then I think that
pretty much covers the Mini ITX case
semi portable though so cool to see that
one of the other prototypes here at the
Lian Li suite is the DK o for F and just
to read the card here the visibility of
the desk glass can be controlled to
become clear or froggy and the glass say
a button here so this is just kind of
again prototype status I think the plan
is to integrate the button into the desk
itself along with the other auto raising
and lowering buttons but you hit the
switch and then you just get a foggy
glass so Leon Lee has done desk systems
cases I'm hesitant to call them before
they're really cool it's a
niche market it's obviously expensive
because it's a small market and it's
gigantic
so this is like this is this let's just
get the price I the way 1200 bucks
probably about what you're looking at
but very interesting and unique and as
far as having like a I mean a gimmick on
your product goes that's a pretty cool
one so I think it's just an LCD
basically and then powers on or off
based on the status of the button or the
switch for other features of it though
of the keep wanting to say case and I'm
it's feels so weird to call it a case
there is plenty of ventilation on the
bottom we have shots of that so
ventilation on the bottom there's a
radiator mounted here presently blows
Eric sort of in this way the end results
were the end goal would be devout fans
here in the back and exhaust that air
presently the system's not fully
complete because the wiring you'll see
some of the wiring and the b-roll
that's not final that's just for
prototyping so that'll be cleaned up
later but fans can go on back there I
think there's a spot maybe for some
ventilation back here as well and then
they have a custom loop set up in here
but there's so much damn clear hands
from the motherboard to the glass I
guess you could put a small Tower cooler
and if you wanted to for some reason the
glass is seven millimeters thick it is
extremely heavy and it's got a small
steel plate or a plate between the
liquid crystal display or whatever the
memory and may be and the glass so
that's how it's supported to make sure
it's held in place otherwise it's just
it's a cool display piece and
unfortunately no my present
understanding is you cannot output your
display to the table but I did ask so
that's it for for this one let's move on
to the next product and the last one
will teleport here because it wasn't
here a second ago but this is a larger
version of the O 11 dynamic so an 11
dynamic Excel or double XL or something
currently 11 wgx ROG certified version 2
but whether or not that's final will see
again concept products here today so if
you know that all 11 dynamic you know
most of the idea of this case it is a
bit larger and most of that goes to
clearance on the bottom so the 11
dynamic from experience you have a
depend on motherboard with ATX boards in
a lot of cases you have pretty limited
room for fans in the bottom and upon the
fan might not fit at all but you
definitely have limited
for radiator and fans in the bottom this
will account for that and also just
because it is sort of annoying to add
fans to the bottom of the case since you
have to flip it over there's just a fan
bracket radiator bracket for the bottom
so you can install your fans that way
kind of a small nice feature small
iterative steps for this one the top is
another example of not really a
game-changing feature but there's a
latch back here and you push it and then
you can pull the panel off if you don't
want to use the screw but there's a
screw included if you would prefer the
security of a thumb screw that's still
an option so two small changes there
another small change the actually we
kind of flipped this towards the back
the back has a couple of plates that
pull out so there's this one here if you
end up doing a vertical GPU mount or
something like that you could pull that
out for passing your cables through
DisplayPort things like that so that
pulls off otherwise is installed stock
this pulls off where you can get access
to hard drives for really easy sort of
quick install there's not a SATA
connector in there so it's not really a
full hot swap but you can quickly get
them in and out and then the rest of the
features of this case are basically the
O 11 dynamic features so I think I guess
I'll point this out to on the side here
some hard drive sleds if you wanted to
mount some hard drive sleds then the
last feature for this one is a 120
millimeter back support so previously I
think it's about 80 or 93 or something
like that for the back fan it is it's
pretty small to a point where you have
to go to knock to us get an actually
good one so now 120 millimeters support
in the back which is a pretty big deal
just for getting air out of the case but
that covers the Lian Li suite for CES
2019 check back soon we should have a
video with dere Bower I think he's
watching me right now but I'm not sure
and I'm afraid to turn my head so
