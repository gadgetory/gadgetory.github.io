they did it there's mesh there's
actually a lot of changes to the new h
500 p mesh version other than the
obvious color changes to go in white
from the earlier gunmetal color there
are options for mesh panels now or will
be soon when it launches in the next few
months and there's also changes to the
structural integrity of the paneling
alongside changes to how the panel ena
mounts to the case so that's what we
gonna be talking about today before that
this video is brought to you by EVGA and
the X 299 dark motherboard for the Intel
high-end desktop CPUs the X 299 dark is
one of the only motherboards on the
market with proper vrm cooling we've
tested this and found significant
performance increase over those without
active cooling on the BRM and you can
learn more about the x2 9 and dark at
the link in the description below so for
the chord changes measures the obviously
obvious one but for the front panel this
now requires somewhat of a push on the
top it actually has a clip at the top of
it now right there and so when you push
down on the front panel that depresses
and you're able to pull it out normally
so if I just kind of like we did in the
original review the table is moving a
lot more than the case right now which
is good that's what you want so you
actually have to push down pretty hard
pop them both out so job well done
coolermaster the top panel also has a
screw added to the back which is
something that we've seen and liked on a
few cases not enough do it but cooler
masters added one to the top back of the
age 500 P mesh and there are updates
coming to the channel for the gunmetal H
five hundred P the original one
so as the existing H 500 P continues to
sell through its current volume on the
channel the changes for this aside from
the mesh obviously it'll keep the
acrylic will eventually populate so in
terms of the structural integrity
changes things like that that will come
to the acrylic gunmetal original version
as they sell through the existing
quantities on new egg and all the others
so yeah screw on the back can't really
just rip it off anymore that's well done
this glass panel no longer wobbles it's
now it's not flush but there is one that
has a flush glass panel which we'll talk
about
however
it no longer wobbles like it did in the
original review so also a good change
there's one final change I wanted to
point out and that's in the power supply
so now rather than removing both of the
power supply shroud components you can
leave them in there and just use a
bracket on the back mount the power
supply to the bracket and there's
clearance to push it in through the back
of the case similar to I think the SD 40
and the course are 600 C both do that so
if you are familiar with those cases
it's the same idea here those are the
main changes for this one I think that
pretty much covers them I suppose on the
structural integrity side and the
plastics the plastic itself isn't really
different but this is so because it's
not an acrylic panel now you're really
not concerned about visuals you can put
a bar right here to strengthen the panel
it doesn't flex anywhere near as much as
it used to
I remember the quote for the H 500 P we
said the plastic felt like a McDonald's
toy that's a bit better now so also a
good thing it doesn't creak anymore and
it stays pretty sturdy all of these are
good changes for the H 500 feet mesh and
one final thing on the mesh side there
are two options right now they're
considering one has a dust filter in it
and the other one does not
next we're going to look at the other
version of the aged 500 it's a slightly
higher end model so we'll take camera
over there and check that out
so this one is the other case it's a bit
more premium at $200 it's the aged 500 M
now the first thing you might be saying
is but Steve there's still glass in the
front yes
but they will be including a mesh option
so this should be something you can pop
out it's currently a prototype this
whole cases so we can't demo it for you
but the plan is to be able to pop out
the tempered glass in the front and add
in a mesh there are a few other changes
though the side here comes out a bit
more so the mesh is now coming out a bit
more forward over the 200 millimeter
fans and it seems like a steeper angle
not sure on that though the top panel
will have the same screw in the back
from the final version of the design and
there's a prototype power supply
nameplate right now that has a cooler
master logo that's illuminated on it
they're actually not sure how they're
going to finalize that so if you have
opinions on the power supply nameplate
leave a thought below so Coolermaster
can make their final decision other than
that the fans are a RGB so they are
addressable and as a dress wool for the
front 2 200 millimeter fans addressable
through the rear 140 all three of those
fans are in
in a 200-dollar case and there will be a
controller which is not finalized today
but there'll be a controller in the back
that handles all the addressable RGB
LEDs including being able to adjust to
what's on the screen and then finally
there's just an item of interest here
and that is the 200 millimeter radiator
so this is something cooler masters
working on where if you have a 200
millimeter fan and you have a liquid
cooler obviously you'd want a radiator
of the same size otherwise what are you
doing so there's a 200 millimeter
radiator in here that's also being
worked on we don't know the full details
of it none of this stuff is really fully
finalized but it should be coming to
market sometime relatively soon but yeah
that's the age 500m and the age 500 PS
of the case that we reviewed last year
