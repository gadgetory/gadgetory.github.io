hosted hours before this recording where
the company revealed new information on
Vega
thread Ripper the CPU mobile and data
center products and professional
versions of Vega which will be due out
in June potentially indicating further
delays for the gaming market the target
is firmly on the back of end videos P
100 chip for now and thread Ripper
meanwhile is working out public
demonstrations at Computex in a few
weeks and we'll be going over all of
that in a bit more in today's news video
before getting to that this is brought
to you by our patreon backers at
patreon.com slash gamers Nexus a big
thanks to those of you on patreon who
are in discord and were able to help us
with covering of this news story as rely
on a lot of you to grab screen jobs
during the livestream event let's start
with Vega as its of the greatest
interest lately
and these Vega video card bears the FE
badge so this is the first vega card
that was shown it was at their analyst
and financial day that was streamed
earlier today as of recording anyway and
the fe card not found as edition it is
the frontier edition so Vega frontier
Edition is the first one that we know
about the card is aimed at data
scientists it is not gaming targeted and
as such they were talking big numbers
primarily in things like deep learning
which is a big topic lately especially
with the v1 hundreds announcement just
recently so what we know thus far of the
Vega fe card is that it's got roughly a
two-to-one FP 16 ratio to FP 16 to 1 FP
32 we're at 25 teraflops FP 16 compute
power that puts us somewhere around 13
teraflops based on what AMD was saying
of FP 32 or single-precision computes FP
64 or double-precision was not revealed
at a time of the analyst meeting so we
don't know where that is today but they
did show us some slides of performance
using deep bench which is a Baidu
benchmark for testing neural network
capabilities of video cards and graphics
and computing hardware including Intel's
Knights landing and videos P 100 is on
the chart that P 100 accelerator and
then Andy put their own
Vega F II card on the charts as well
andy claims that Vega will outpace n
videos 2016 P 100 accelerated GPU and
using the deep
benchmark for machine learning
positioning at Vega at 88 milliseconds
completion time versus 133 milliseconds
completion time for the P 100 this is
the only test of its kinds at Andy
showcase thus far so we can't draw
definitive conclusions from the data but
it is the first real look at performance
we've been given for Vega outside of the
initial CES demos that were pretty
limited and just restricted to gaming at
60fps the V 100 of course isn't present
as it won't ship until quarter three and
also note that of this deep bench test
result rajma Kaduri said quote I'm not
declaring victory here over Nvidia or
anyone else this is basically stating
that Andy is finally on the chart a year
ago we would have taken as being on the
previous charge we are on the chart with
a fairly impressive number so that was
their goal is getting something out
there that can do deep learning or some
kind of machine at processing with
regard to gaming there were two tests
that Andy demonstrated at the event with
the Vega card they had they were doing a
VRAM thrashing scenario where it was
simulating exceeding vram capacity by
limiting the capacity on the vega card
so they took what would normally have a
16 gigabyte HBC of HB m2 memory on this
particular model of Vega GPU they were
showing and they restricted that to two
gigabytes then ran an HPC a/b test were
they disabled HPC or high bandwidth
cache in one test and they enable in
another if you don't know what HPC is we
talked about it in our CES news video
when we first heard about HPC and got
some more details on it but the idea was
to toggle it on versus off to see what
happens in a scenario where you've
exceeded the vram capacity of the video
card the other test was with Sniper
Elite for that song we're going to start
with Sniper Elite seems to be a bit of a
favorite benchmark for AMD lately it
shows an v cards performing pretty well
and at all of our tests like the recent
crossfire test we did where there's
almost 100% scaling in that particular
game and even the DX 12 test where we
look at g4 560 bottleneck you know GPUs
so they use that for this benchmark as
well benchmark was really just a
demonstration and it was the game
running 4k with undisclosed graphic
settings we don't know if it was ultra
or high or what so we can't really run
those tests on our own hardware and try
and guess at where Vega will be
and other than that we saw a range of 60
to 63 FPS on the screen with no further
information was about a 20-second long
demo if that where they walked on the
beach climbed a ladder and stabbed the
guy in the heart so that was the Vega
demo and in the latter climbing part of
the demo the FPS spiked over 70 briefly
62 63 FPS 4k undisclosed graphic
settings tested in a vacuum so we don't
really know where it compares to Nvidia
hardware or even other ante hardware
right now but based on what was
previously demonstrated at CES where
Andy showed Vega competing with the GTX
1080 in a 60fps locked scenario it would
be reasonable to assume that Vega is
probably still targeting something like
a GTX 1080 rather than a 1080 ti4
performance at least with regard to
where it's competing on the market but
that is entering the realm of
speculation so we'll go on to the next
test which was the demonstration using
HPC toggling and this test was the
simulation of VRAM thrashing by limiting
Vega at least the one on display at
ajust 2 gigabytes of its high bandwidth
cache which was done because games don't
use anything close to the total
allowance on Vega currently Andy toggle
the HPC on and off of the 2 gigabyte
limits showing the performance bumps
from roughly 56 FPS average to roughly
72 FPS average and rise of the Tomb
Raider specifically in this mirror I'm
thrashing scenario this was a simulation
it's not real world and it's a chosen
slide for an analyst meeting so we don't
have a whole lot of depth yet but this
gives an idea as to what the company is
hoping to do with its high bandwidth
cache and the theory is that HPC helps
in vram limited scenarios should one
present itself in a way that would speed
up performance because you get the extra
speed and the way that the storage
actually works at a little lower level
which is something we've discussed in
the past and we'll discuss again soon
once we have more white papers on Vega
4k 60fps is still the target that's the
target that was set two years ago that's
what they're hoping to do with Vega so
it looks like that's probably going to
be met and is something that was line it
up in competition with the GTX tena
idiot as Andy previously positioned the
card at the CES meeting most of the
presentation was focused on professional
applications that are both Verizon and
for Vega on the Vega side this means a
lot of talk about the new SSG which will
bear the
GPU on it and they also talked about
different deep learning capabilities
data center type stuff so what does this
mean for gaming well from what it looks
like right now the professional data
center targeted Vega card should begin
shipping sometime in June
that's what AMD was saying on stage so
with June as a target for the
professional audience that would be
again data center enterprise data
scientist and anyone doing heavy compute
stuff with that targeted in June it's
probably looking like gaming will hit in
July or August gaming tends to follow
professional deployments of new
architectures so that would be
reasonable to assume but again that's
speculation so just a note as far as the
SSG line we talked with Rajat Kaduri
previously about the Radeon SSG we sat
down with them at the A&amp;amp;E offices
probably late last year and talked about
that the new one is carrying Vega for
the GPU it is CAD targeted and will work
in other applications like CAD and the
idea is that it's basically got a two
terabyte SSD strapped to it and that
will store all the data for large
project files like massive CAD files
with a lot of individual moving parts so
you store that on the GPU it is
non-volatile memory it's just like an
SSD but it's very close to the GPU core
so it can access quickly and hopefully
load up those files faster so that's
something that has existed but now it's
got Vega on it as well and it's
something that they were showing at the
event with this demonstration
Andy was also showing an 8k video
premiere test or demonstration where
they basically had a premiere window
open Adobe Premiere that is and a live
timeline scrubbing test with 8k video
using the Radeon 2 terabyte SSD with
Vega and it was fairly smooth but we
don't have any actual numbers for you
other than to say things like fairly
smooth and maybe show some of the
footage that we captured of the event
but that's all we've got for now on Vega
other than Vega mobile
so Andy also discussed mobile
deployments of their rise in CPS at the
event which will be accompanied by Vega
integrated graphics chips in the near
future and he says that these integrated
Vega graphics cores will run a
generational improvement of about 40% of
the preview
I GP solution by Andy and claims a 50%
power reduction over the previous
generational version risin mobile will
include two and ones for folks
interested in that market and we'll get
a MD back into laptops in a bigger way
in theory and there was some quick
discussion on thread Ripper there's a
lot on epoch EP why see the other one
we'll talk about that moment thread
Ripper was briefly mentioned it's a 16
core 32 thread setup it is an h EDT
market solution so high-end desktop that
would be probably competing with Intel's
rumored I 9 lineup that we don't
obviously have confirmation yet
especially from Intel side of things but
that would probably be where it's
targeting because the current horizon
CPS already battle with Intel pretty
well in h EDT but thread Ripper will go
a bit beyond that it will be an
expensive CPU comparatively versus what
Andy is already shipped 16 cores 32
threads first live demos will be at
combi txt this year we will be there
recovering Computex in about two weeks
so if you haven't subscribed already do
it so you can see our Computex coverage
and will be covered in thread Ripper at
that point vague information on thread
Ripper that they gave at this event
where that thread Ripper will expand
memory bandwidth expand i/o bandwidth
and will focus on production level and
professional applications but that's
about the most we've got right now other
than all the other rumors that have been
out there for a while and the last piece
of news was on that epic CPU that I
mentioned so epic ep YC is the new name
for Naples Naples was the code name for
the server architecture that we first
learned about at the Rison events d4
aizen's launch naples is a 32 core 64
thread CPU and epic is the official name
of it
so the code names were as on the roadmap
Naples we learned today that the next
code name is Rome and then after that is
Milan so they're going with an Italian
influence there so Naples is coming out
soon in the form of epic they are
targeting Intel and their 95 percent
market share of x86 servers that's where
AMD hopes to compete they do have an x86
license they're one of the few people
who can actually compete in the server
division and takes on that market share
from Intel so that's where epic is
targeting they had some initial
demonstrations including
Linux in code and compile passes and the
compile paths that we saw in the live
demo with the analyst meeting position
dandy matched against intel's a five to
six nine nine a version for which is
important signifier that cpu the intel
one was at twenty two point five seconds
and the and the epic cpu for the linux
compile Sam test was fifteen point seven
seconds to complete so that's looking
good at least for that one test the
tests were done in dual socket
configurations for those particular
numbers so two and two and they also had
a later test with epic in a single
socket configuration versus a different
Intel CPU it was the e5 two sides two
six five zero version four thank you in
self making that easy
so it was burst his that in a dual
socket two of those versus one epic CPU
showing a complete compile time of
thirty three point seven seconds on the
and the epic CPU and thirty seven point
two seconds on the Intel i5 CPU final
notes here Andy is finally providing
some roadmap so again it is Rome and
Milan next those will be on Zen two and
Zen three respectively they will be on
seven nanometer and seven nanometer plus
respectively which is a nomenclature
we've seen lately from Intel as well as
Nvidia and now AMD and that's really
what it looks like for the whole roundup
that's Andy's whole the whole press
conference kind of or analysts and
financial conference recap quickly epic
will ship before end of June big is
looking like June for the professional
market and later probably for gaming
maybe July or August and other than that
discussion for the name epic and other
name is discussed here can commence
