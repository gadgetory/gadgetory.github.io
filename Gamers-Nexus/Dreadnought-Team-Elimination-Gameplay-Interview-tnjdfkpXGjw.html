accessed on that we were here at PAX
East 2015 currently at the dread-nots
booth and we saw a dry not a pack south
I wrote an article about a pretty cool
game it's a space game it's a lot of
space games right now I am trying to buy
the game director at Peter and we're
talking about jet not Peter can you give
us a quick overview of the dread-nots
and how it plays sure so treta has a
game about capital spaceships the idea
behind it is that basically everybody
has their own idea about what a
spaceship captain's like there's han
Solo with the real important is
everything up to like Adama with the
Galactica like sorry enterprise of
course and we wanted like there's not
that many games that actually cater to
those fantasies like playing those guys
but all this is really up close and
personal but cut quite action-heavy in
terms of capital spaceship battles what
what's the player count um currently
it's 5 p-5 like we found that 55
actually feels really good there's
already a lot going on because these
ships obviously have a lot of guns and
there's a lot of stuff happening on
screen potentially will scale it up its
many technical thing like do we want
this does it pretty good from a design
point of view we still have to check
that and in terms of game modes we've
written about and play team deathmatch
we just played another mode can you give
us a quick overview of that we now have
a game mode that's called team
elimination and with this we wanted to
make a bit more tactical and slower so
you kind of discuss strategy before you
actually go into battle in orbit with
your own fellow captains and it's your
ship so if this ship dies or if the ship
goes down then you it's basically gone
so you only have one life no respawn but
what it's about for us is we want you to
create this feeling of band of brothers
like you're going in this battle
together with your cap with your fellow
captains so if you're actually die we
don't want you to leave like we wanted
to be there for those guys so you can
actually respond but you can respawn
with a smaller package at so more
the idea okay you have to balance a
Galactica but there's also Apollo in
starbucks and they can't actually do
something like I mean you can like turn
the tide of battle and influence the
battle of it but obviously you also feel
that compared to those giant powerful
ships you are more and more or less
nothing so they start shooting at you
then you blow up and for target players
there a lot of space games like right
now like we said you sort of one over
how yours is a bit different who do you
think is really the the right type of
player for dreadknot players that don't
want to play a simulation like this is
this is a game where you can have fun
like it's you jump in you will feel at
home like it's WASD its left mouse
button for pilings right mouse button or
aiming 124 talk to your abilities energy
management is really quick and
accessible so you bring up an energy
menu you redirect all your energy to
weapons or shield or engine so it's not
about 30 2.5% energy to this and like 15
keys that we have to manage we try to
keep every element that actually
contributes to this idea of being a
captain and then made it make it as
quickly accessible as possible so it's
the fastest and most visceral up close
and personal version of capital
spaceships that you can get is there a
target release date yet we know it's
free to play any monetization plans um
so first on the release date a lot of
people keep asking us and obviously you
can believe us that we are just as eager
as you guys to actually put it out there
like we want to get it in front of
people we just don't don't want to get
it in front of people before we are
ready to like if it blows up then you
won't like it as well so um we're
currently in friends and family face so
we're testing it against a small amount
of people to get it right and then as
soon as we take all the boxes for this
face like we move into closed Peter and
like go to play trad not home sign up
for the newsletter and you and you will
know as soon as we know I promise that
yeah and monetization was the second
question right so yeah it is going to be
free to play so we really like the idea
for you to play because it's something
where you can't spend 20 million on
marketing to trick people into
the game and then it shit sorry I'm not
allowed to say that problem and that
it's not good but so you really have to
make a good game to keep people playing
and in return like you can actually keep
this game alive for a long time actually
if people spend money in the game and
they buy like cosmetic stuff like used
ship skins our version of hats which is
like 3 30 meter high figure heads and if
people do that they actually supporting
the game like they're supporting the
community that so they are doing it
almost like for the community so they
should be rewarded in terms of like a
dude really cool like I'm kept playing
this game I don't have the money right
now to actually spend it but it's really
cool that you do because then we can
play together and kind of fun so that's
that's that's more where we are coming
from so we would like to turn this
around that would be ideal so a good
explanation of how how the free-to-play
model can work without alienating the
community that is dread not check the
links in the description below for more
coverage and we will see you all next
time see you next time thanks s</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
