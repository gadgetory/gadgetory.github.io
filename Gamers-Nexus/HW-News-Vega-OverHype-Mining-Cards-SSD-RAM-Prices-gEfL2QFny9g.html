hardware news recap for the past week we
have a few interesting items this week
including more news on the DRAM and NAND
shortage as it continues to roll through
2018 it looks like news on new binding
specific cards from the board partners
of AMD at least maybe more time later
and then some discussion about updates
to Blender updates for power supplies
memory x $2.99 stuff and maybe a bit of
discussion on Vega hype as it stands
right now before getting to that this
coverage is brought to you by ifixit.com
and their pro tech tool kit which is a
64-bit toolkit that contains an
anti-static strap and all the tools
required to disassemble most PC hardware
as we've shown you can go to ifixit.com
slash gamers Nexus and use code gamers
Nexus at checkout for five dollars off
the first topic is just on Vega hype in
general so in the past week there's been
some more news some actual new coverage
coming out about Vega or specifically
the Vega at the eversion
and that has had attached to it a lot of
hype from the community a lot of this
will beat the Titan XP this will be the
1080i this will do all these things but
just a reminder wait just wait for
reviews wait till people can actually
test it hyping things up is only going
to do one thing and that is lead to
disappointment so we would recommend
just tone it down a little bit on the
hype and wait for proper coverage
because there are some pieces out there
PC world just posted one for example
that have had some level of hands-on
with Vega frontier Edition but the thing
is these are pre-release tests much like
CES is a pre-release
test in a sanctioned controlled
environment and all the vendors do this
it's not just AMD but they all do it and
there's a reason that at our outlet we
don't report on numbers when we don't
have an ability to actually test and
collect them properly for example at CES
when the vendors show their new GPU CPU
or whatever it is with two side-by-side
a game running and they lock the FPS the
vsync on
indicate that they both perform the same
that's not really a valid test all it
does is show that they both can achieve
60fps so we don't report on those types
of things other than to say maybe that
they did it but certainly not as like a
look this card is better than X because
it's it's not a controlled environment
that we tested so that's our approach to
that kind of stuff
now that said the tests that have been
shown lately have some promise it's okay
for them to be promising it's okay to be
excited about new hardware but with
regard to hype just always keep in mind
that pre-release tests are controlled
not by the independent reporters so that
means that they are going to have a
they're certainly not going to show you
a situation where the card is
underperforming so that's not to say
Vega will underperform is to say that
keep everything within the eye of
reality it will get to the reviews it's
an expensive card you probably don't
want to invest in something like that
without seeing them anyway and besides
Vega FP is not really a gaming GPU as
AMD themselves have said at least once
or twice now so rx Vega we do have our
eye on and we'll probably be testing it
whenever it comes out so we'll have
coverage for you eventually but just
that was just something I wanted to say
about the Vega hype before there's a
giant disappointment because people
build themselves up to believing it
would be better than 4 Way SLI whatever
at all kinds of tasks so next topic is
mining cards it's still a GPU topic this
is on sapphires front so they've got
mining Edition video cards now coming
out to address some of the mining
cryptocurrency mining craze now these
mining devices are coming out for a few
reasons one of them there's an
interesting discussion right now it's we
had about whether or not
GPUs selling out is actually a net
positive for the manufacturers for AMD
and NVIDIA on one front they're selling
out of the cards so how could they be
mad at that on the other front though
this is a situation where one person
buys 10 cards so you end up with one
person with 10 cards not gaming versus
10 gamers who become long-term customers
and who hopefully in the eyes of the
company build a relationship with that
company become brand loyal to this
loyalists or start investing in other
parts of the ecosystem like gee
and free sink and whatever other add-ons
those companies may offer may be
redeeming game codes and building MDF
with publishers for example so there's
two different ways to look at that
that's not what we're talking about here
though the mining cards are being made
by the AIB partners directly sapphire
seems to be one of the first they're AI
be mining cards are basically headless
GPUs for the most part and headless with
a video card means that it doesn't have
any display out so some of them have one
DVI out but a lot of them that we looked
at and I'm sure we'll have images of
them did not have any display outs that
means that they are useless as a gaming
device which is pretty interesting and
should only be used for non gaming tasks
where you're doing GPU crunch workloads
on it and you don't need display out so
then why would someone buy these types
of cards and the main thing here is that
they are meant for mining but the
interesting aspect is they lose a lot of
the resale value that these miners are
building their purchases on because you
can't turn around later and sell it to a
gamer who's building a PC if it has no
display out on it the only instance
where that would be feasible as if the
people are trying to do crossfire or
something where they already have a
primary card with display out and then a
secondary doesn't need the display but
that seems like a pretty limited use
case so kill some of the value for the
miners who are basing their purchases on
some level of breakeven plus profit
after you sell the card later but I
guess the target is probably more of the
the more enterprising people rather than
the casual home users so that's out the
RX 560 versions 170 bucks pretty
expensive RX for 70 mining in addition
$300 also very expensive very expensive
I think that's approaching 1070
territory before the whole mining grade
so not the best deal but they're not
meant for gaming they're meant for
theoretically making some form of money
back at some point in the future but
that's the mining update blender also
had an update and this was for a July
update coming out with a new denoiser
built in and then they also have some
open CL optimization
and other GPU optimizations blender
users have a lot to be excited for right
now version 2.7 9 is the one expected in
July and 2.80 is coming out after that
which will feature a new real-time
renderer called Eevee this is very
potentially useful for the type of
people who don't want to wait around
rendering pngs forever 2.80 will also
have better cloth simulation and physics
simulations like plasticity and then a
2.79 more immediately as I new denoiser
that uses scene information so that be
textures and model geometry that are
built into the scene it gathers info
from those and then will remove noise
during the render process hopefully
without losing any actual quality as for
OpenCL optimizations this is also pretty
interesting that he is basically ensure
that the GPU is kept at a hundred
percent load under all scenarios so tile
size should be less relevant or
irrelevant now for OpenGL rendering
because the GPU will always be utilized
at 100% which means that you don't need
to worry too much about optimizing tile
sizes
it also means that render times improve
up to 50 percent in the worst case 8x8
tile size scenarios blender also has new
shaders like the principled shader which
helps calculate the correct for now for
the roughness of a material this comes
alongside a metalness workflow which
helps determine whether an object is
dielectric non dielectric with more
accuracy also some clarification on X to
99 socket compatibility cryo rig
specifically came out to say that any of
their coolers supported on lgh 2011
version 3 are also supported on 2066 and
this is true for all of them so the
mounting mechanism mounting spacing for
the holes all of it is the same on LG a
20 66 X 299 as it was on X 99 so you had
coolers I worked for one they will work
for both so that was a clarification put
out by cry rig it's true for everyone if
you were looking into by next to 99 and
pairing it with a cooler that you
already had Silverstone is also
expanding its power supply line for the
Strider series largely looking into new
titanium certified power supplies this
includes PS use in eleven hundred watt
1300 watts and 1500 watt capacity is
part of the s
t-series so SP 1,100 - ti-ti meaning
titanium certification ST meaning
Strider series and all of the new models
are 80 plus titanium they are all fully
modular they all have a 135 millimeter
fan and they also all offer a semi
passive operation where the fan will
spin down when load is low on the power
supply standard projections come with
them five-year warranty we don't know
the price just yet but it'll probably be
high because they're high wattage power
supplies kilowatt plus and they are 80
plus titanium on the memory front
g.skill is rolling out new ddr4 kits
with higher capacities and tighter
timings aimed at Intel's new x-series
chipsets and the x2 99 shifts at
motherboards all of the kits will be
available under the Trident Z Triton's
er DV or Trident II black series of
product lines we have at least one of
those kits in now pricing and
availability are TBA but for the speeds
there should be that thirty six hundred
mega Hertz with CL 16 or 17 and a 1.25
voltage up to capacities of at sixteen
gigabyte sticks there will also be
speeds of 37 33 megahertz at CL 1730 800
megahertz CL 18 or 19 4000 megahertz CL
18 and 40 200 megahertz CL 19 at one
point four volts and that's available on
8x8 gigabyte tits asus is adding a new
added network card for gaming support
increased bandwidth and a better
leveraging nvme SSDs across networks
which has been a challenge up until
recently the XG c 102 c supports 10
gigabit ethernet as well as the latest
2.5 and five gigabit ethernet standards
further the card supports I Triple E 802
1p priority queuing and quality of
service or QoS technology which allows
users to prioritize game packets over
other network traffic and it's somewhat
competing with the likes of killer ACS
new Nick uses the action client
controller and thus requires four PCIe
lanes 10 Gigabit Ethernet if you're
wondering delivers around a thousand
megabits per second of it network
throughput so it's quite a bit of a jump
over 1 Gigabit Ethernet and helps
resolve the 100 megabyte per second wall
that we face with one gigabit and bad
news for DRM and
and the supply shortages we've been
covering this for a while now and the
goalpost keeps moving for when it's
supposed to be better so from new
reports that we saw last week one of the
main ones coming from Reuters it looks
like the DRAM and Nan shortage will
continue through 2017 as originally
supposed to start getting a little bit
better than second half but now it looks
like that data is moving towards 2018
part of that is because of the major
phone launch cycle coming up
particularly with the iPhone 8 and Apple
as potentially insignificant as a single
product launch seems in the face of an
entire industry making devices that use
DRAM and NAND Apple does command about
18% of the total supply and just in
general so when they push a phone it's a
big deal to the point where some of the
device makers who use DRAM and then had
to start buying supply months in advance
to make sure they don't run out now when
the iPhone 8 is really starting to ramp
production or finalize production so
because of that because of Internet of
Things devices because of new NAND
processing technology is being
researched and RD Labs
it looks like 2018 is when Ram prices
will start to fall again so as we said
in the past I'm sorry if you're a new
builder bad timing the RAM prices are
high right now and will remain I it
looks like for the foreseeable future
and finally gigabyte has I knew or is
1080p I I need to get the same right
water force WB extreme edition video
card and that is going to be an
open-loop ready card so it's got the
block pre installed water block that is
and it will connect with the fusion RGB
suite that gigabyte uses so it will
synchronize with their motherboards
which now have digital RGB LEDs that
shifts with a core clock of 1607
megahertz 1721 megahertz of booze and
the gddr5 acts vram is o'clock to 11
gigahertz oh it's got a bit of an OC on
it as well but not much of one no
pricing yet release date TBD this looks
like it'll probably one of the last
1080i is launching anyway because the
generation is getting a bit old at this
point even though the card just came out
a few months ago so that's it for this
time as always that links in the
