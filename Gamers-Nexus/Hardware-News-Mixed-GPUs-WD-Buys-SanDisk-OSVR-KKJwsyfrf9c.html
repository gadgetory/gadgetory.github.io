and we're doing a recap of this week's
news in the hardware and technology
industries the biggest news starting off
the top of the show is the WD
acquisition of sandisk for 19 billion
dollars making this one of the largest
tech industry purchases in recent
history but there are a couple of other
big ones that we'll talk about in a
moment so WD the hard drive manufacturer
or western digital as you all know has
had a long-standing foothold in their WD
blues WD green Reds all those drives
they've been in the hard drive sector
for quite a while but they've attempted
to enter the SSD and flash space with
minimal success this purchase of sandisk
which is an established and pretty well
functioning SSD and flash device
manufacturer the purchase should quoting
western digital double the addressable
market size by WDS current group so
that's quite a big business growth
opportunity for them and this follows on
with WDS somewhat recent purchase of
hgst which is a hitachi group hitachi
GST it was called that purchase of
hitachi's GST group allowed WD to
acquire some of the highest rated drives
when it comes to endurance this is
something that hgst has always been good
at so big news for the storage and flash
industry other recent acquisitions in
this industry would include the avago
Seagate acquisition of lsi and sandforce
other acquisitions include toshiba's by
of ocz which was effectively a dead
company and was resurrected by Toshiba
granting the flash manufacturer toshiba
actually makes its own and its own
venture through which it can dispense
storage devices and SSDs and things like
that in the world of computer graphics
the DirectX 12 update as everyone knows
at this point has been long spoken about
as potentially Herald in an era where
tandem graphics solutions are possible
meaning you could pair an AMD and an
Nvidia device together in a single
system for effectively an SLI or
crossfire equivalent setup now
this is made possible by the shift to
Direct X 12 the new API dx11 does not
allow this type of processing but the
x12 theoretically does that doesn't
however mean that it'll just work it
still requires driver support developers
support things like that to truly get
the most out of such a technology but
that doesn't mean that we shouldn't test
it either so a non-tech just posted
their tests using ashes of singularities
Direct X 12 benchmark to approve the AFR
or alternate frame rendering potential
of tandem GPUs from two different GPU
manufacturers the test showed somewhat
surprisingly that when pairing and r9
fury X with an nvidia gtx 980 TI the
performance delta was actually to the
tune of fifty-four percent greater than
a single gtx 980 I that is definitely
measurable and something that's worth
testing more in the future as more games
come out with DirectX 12 fully enabled
so very interesting news there and
something worth following more closely
as DirectX 12 continues to develop again
it's really important to understand that
just because DirectX 12 will
theoretically support an asymmetrical
GPU configuration does not mean you
should go out and build something like
that intentionally or with purpose if
you're falling into that situation sure
it's worth it but I wouldn't go by two
different GPUs from different
manufacturers just because AFR with
asymmetrical setup is now theoretically
possible and my reasoning for that is
because you still require stable driver
support and the game developers own
optimizations and the engine
optimizations all three things of which
will likely not take into account the
potential use case of asymmetrical GPU
setup so there's going to be less
optimization for those configurations in
theory but it's absolutely worth doing
more tests on and we'll be in that boat
pretty soon with a couple of other DX 12
games next up is razors OS VR technology
which is now shipping at three hundred
dollars for the hacker dev kit this osv
are set up or open-source virtual
reality is as the name indicates an open
source solution to virtual reality so
all the schematics for the device are
available online and you can actually
download and three
print your own OS vr headset should you
like to do that if you have the
electrical ability you could also
assemble the boards do all the PCBs all
that stuff because the schematics are
fully available and it's all licensed
under the apache two point O license
this is available at three hundred
dollars and that puts it pretty much
around where the oculus rift is supposed
to be when it's fully complete and
available and that means that they are
going to be head-to-head devices but at
the end of the day razor has told us in
meetings that Oh SVR hopes to
differentiate itself by creating an
ecosystem as they call it ecosystem of
open source software and hardware for
developers hackers users and communities
to build around another news item this
week that we've already covered is NZXT
s hue plus which is an RGB LED lighting
controller for use in cases or elsewhere
and hardware configurations and this
includes for sixty dollars for LED
strips but you can expand to eight and
those connect via magnet or adhesive
tape to your enclosure or whatever else
you want to attach them to and then
plugging into that or being plugged into
rather is the actual controller itself
which is a 2.5 inch SSD ish form factor
the issues there because it is slightly
taller in this way then an SSD would be
so you will have some restraints when it
comes to mounting it say on top of a psu
shroud where there might be a low PCIe
expansion slot in use still the hue plus
we reviewed it's on the channel and we
liked it pretty well overall the sixty
dollar price point is relatively fair
and if you just want to bling out your
PC with some LEDs it's worth a
consideration check out the video for
more information on that the final bit
of news comes from logitech logitech
just posted its best retail sales growth
since 2010 and the company if you
haven't been following too closely has
had a couple of rough years at least in
the gaming market on the gaming side of
things Logitech and they'll admit this
lost its way a little bit but they've
done a very heavy redirection of
marketing branding and
engineering efforts to produce new
headsets like the g 633 line up the g500
400 series mice like the Proteus core
and things like that and the company
overall is trying to correct its course
as it pertains to the gaming audience
but there's a lot more to Logitech than
that and they just posted their best
retail sales at 560 million of quarterly
revenue in quarter 2 and the biggest
growths were nine percent in North
America seven percent in emea and a
staggering twenty six percent sales
growth in the asia-pacific region that's
all for this news roundup we're going to
do these weekly along with our new game
news segment that was just posted
yesterday and let us know what you think
in the comments below if you have
anything you want to talk about and ask
GN or other video segments post that
below and I will get to it check out our
patreon link in the post roll video
it'll be down here great support from
all of you guys we've had a couple of
new patrons just in the last few days
here and as always very excited to see
that supports well and we've even opened
up a new skype channel for group chat
for those of you who are backing us and
would like to get in touch with the
creators of gamers Nexus talk to some of
our staff I have a couple of folks on
staff writers and otherwise or very
talented and we're all happy that answer
your tech and hardware questions so
that's all for this time I will see you
all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
