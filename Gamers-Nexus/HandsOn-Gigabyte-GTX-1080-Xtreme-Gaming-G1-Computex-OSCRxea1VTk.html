at computex 2016 and I have two of the
new cards these are both 1080s the first
one to talk about is this monster and
then we'll also be talking about the g1
gaming here in front of it before
getting to that all this coverage is
brought to you by msi in their new x99 a
broad well II gaming motherboards so
let's start off with a big card this has
a new cooler on it it's the wind for
stack fan and you'll see in the b-roll
that the center fan is stacked so it's
got two blades stacked atop each other
and I think they're about 100
millimeters for the flanking fans might
be 90 fairly large fans though and then
the heat sink itself as a five heat pipe
design they look to be about six
millimeters and then underneath sort of
the between the PCB and the GPU and the
heat sink itself is a giant copper plate
and that of course is used to dissipate
the heat from atop of the V around the
vram and the GPU itself so that's all
synced that way there are some thermal
pads in there that we can see as one
would expect there's a custom back plate
for the card and then over on the left
side of it or on my left side of it
there are two VR headers so if you had
an hmd you want to plug in vive rift
whatever it could plug in through the
front panel there's an accessory that
you would buy with this similar to the
EVGA 9980 tiv are similar to that plugs
in and then pipes through the front of
the video card so you don't have to go
around the back you got an extra foot or
two of cabling so that's most of what we
have for this this is the extreme gaming
version of the 1080 and in addition to
the other stuff it's got an extra eight
pin header we don't know the vrm phases
just yet so not sure on that has a
custom PCB has a custom v bios not sure
on the extra overvoltage if there is any
but we'll find out as it comes closer to
launch this card is priced somewhere in
these 676 $80 ish range not finalized
but that is cheaper than the founders
edition and I don't even need to test
its know that this cooler is going to be
better as you've seen in our thermal
test the founders edition cooler is
pretty limited so that will definitely
be a better cooler this is the g1 gaming
so this is a brand that's existed a bit
longer it is the new extreme gaming sort
of brand initiative has a single 8 pin
header so no difference there from what
you're used to it looks like it's got
three heat pipes might be eight
10 millimeters not really sure from here
about three heat pipes the g1 gaming
setup this is a more mid-range stack
card so it'll be in the 650 ish price
area a bit cheaper than this one this is
probably what more people would be
gravitating toward along with things
like the Twin Frozr competitors and the
EVGA SC those are all kind of price in
the same range so keep an eye out for
more coverage of these cards the big one
is the extreme gaming with the stack fan
cooler and then the g1 gaming as always
