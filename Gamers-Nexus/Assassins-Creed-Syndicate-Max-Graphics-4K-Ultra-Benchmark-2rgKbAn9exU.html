dotnet and this is our assassin's creed
syndicate benchmark course this course
shows the game at its maximum graphics
settings so you're looking at it now
we've rendered down to 1080p 60 but
you're looking at an original 4k image
that was down sampled so you're still
getting high quality it's just down
sampled for video purposes and this
shows the game at max graphics our
objective with the benchmark course was
to put all of our GPUs under a mixed
workload so this is a realistic scenario
that you would actually go through in a
C syndicate as a player it's not just an
abusive bench course as you'll find with
most games and the course that we chose
has a lot of geometric complexity toward
the end of it as you'll see and that's
in the form of buildings and the city
and just a lot of objects basically a
lot of meshes a lot of objects a lot of
polygons the rest of the bench course
does some bench in the form of lighting
there's some volumetric effects going on
there's some particle effects you see
the smoke in the distance from the
smokestacks so this course does a pretty
good mix of different graphics
technologies in terms of rendering them
and applying them to the GPU beating it
up a bit and benchmarking how they
perform check the website gamers Nexus
dotnet for the full Assassin's Creed
benchmark for syndicate and consequently
the r9 380 X ship today and that is on
the website as well so if you're curious
about how the 380 X performs check the
channel check the website you'll find
those benchmarks that is all for this
maximum graphics video and our benchmark
course for AC syndicates if you like
this kind of content or if you like the
other content we do which is a lot more
in-depth of course hit the subscribe

in the post roll video thanks a lot for
supporting us and watching and I'll see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
