was when I was making fun of an author
from motherboard vice.com who said it
was painful literally he said he
literally bled for his computer and
that's by the way I think a direct quote
we're very close to it and that it was
very difficult to build a computer so we
did a speed build in response basically
say look this is how quick easy and
literally painless it is although I did
stab myself and that video did pretty
well so today we're doing another speed
build it won't be as popular because I'm
not insulting anyone but this build we
filmed under the guise of I basically
said it was for a friend as a mining and
production machine and it actually is
for Andrew the man behind the camera and
the editing but he didn't know that
until the end so this bill this is for
him and it's going to be used for a 3d
animation modeling blender stuff like
that Unreal Engine 4 so it has actual
real use case we've got a 10-7 TTI
that's gonna go in it we already film
the build and now we're refilling the
intro and rise in 7 1700 cpu which are
both very good for these production
tasks and we'll get kind of a ground
floor established for later upgrades so
that's the plan it's still basically a
speed build though so you got two and
one it's one of those gift type build
videos and also see how fast it goes
together I'm gonna have to clean up a
few things later though so without
further ado here's the build actually I
lied one more further ado before that
this video is brought to you by thermal
Grizzly makers of the conductor hot
liquid metal that we recently use to
drop 20 degrees off of our coffee leak
temperatures thermal grizzly also makes
traditional thermal compounds we use on
top of the IHS like cryo not and hydro
not pastes learn more at the link below
to give you an idea of what we're
upgrading andrew from it's an old Lenovo
laptop with a 650 M in it and that's
been what's being used for rendering so
I'll have to do a comparison of how long
it takes to render something on that
versus this I think that's gone up like
a day at a time for some renders or more
so that's what we're coming from we
previously tore this laptop apart for
new thermal paste and they're all
and we'll leave that linked in the
description below if you want to see
that because it improved performance
significantly but now we're going to
improve it a few steps more by getting
off of a six at the M and a several
generation old i7 so let's get started
for the components we've got an r7 1700
CPU which is going to be useful for
production tasks we also have an ax 370
gaming 5 motherboard that we've had from
gigabyte for a while now repurposing
that we have an RM 850 X power supply
from Corsair Corsair also sent 32
gigabytes of memory and an MP 500 force
SSD so we are going to start with the
motherboard and we'll throw a timer up
on the screen as soon as this box begins
to open and then all cuts from here on
out will have an updated timer so we're
not going to cut the timer as we go
but we'll still cut the video down so oh
yeah I'm gonna get on the anti-static
wrist strap this this doesn't so the
adornment of the anti-static wrist strap
does not count against time this is a
well respected rule in speed building
everyone knows this rule for us ok so
the timer will begin in three two back
plates come off the back plate has come
off mr. bit wit Kyle just did one of
these and our speed build when we did it
was pretty fun I really liked the way he
did his most recent on which was
basically him burst the intern who had
never built a system before as I
understand it and Kyle was blindfolded
so Kyle if you're watching that was
brilliant well done
ok sack of cables power supply
get the cpu open there's a rise in CPU
oh that saw the stock cooler and that
was the sound of two pounds of
inefficiency hitting the floor we are
using a @h 115 eye cooler for this
because I had one around and they are
easy to install quite frankly so make
this even faster alright Rison goes in
I'm gonna need don't paste and I'm gonna
need case screws I forgot both of those
so the mat I'm building on if you
haven't heard us talk about it it is our
first real like from scratch product
design it's a an anti-static mod mat and
this has with it a couple of diagrams on
it for electrical wiring which we've
used for mods and things like that the
stick of memory has thrown paste on it
maybe I can scrape that off and use it
for the CPU it's also got a couple of
other it like a ruler and a screw
sorting tray for GPU teardown and stuff
like that okay so we've got that part
done thank you
I haven't worked with this case since
the end of year 2015 and see if it comes
apart in the way I remember yes this was
one of my favorite cases when we got it
in it's it is an inverted layout 602 C
and so the motherboards gonna go on
video card will be up here C be cooler
be probably bottom mounted I think and I
need screws these are technically all
motherboard screws but there's different
ones
okay so this is gonna go in like that
that's cool
and then this mind you we're losing some
time here just by nature of filming
stuff as we go got to move the lights
around and stuff like that so someone's
gonna count and be like you forgot the
i/o shield
I actually didn't so when we did that
motherboard response video
some people counted that and they
weren't really that serious to be fair
but I actually hate IO shield and make
it a personal vendetta to never use them
so we haven't forgotten it that said the
included IO shields are pretty smart I
like that manufacturers have done that
and I think it makes a lot of sense you
do pay a premium for it right now which
is unfortunate but that'll stop
eventually so I would like this to be
bottom mounted damn I'm gonna have to
flip those fans around if I do that and
if the bottom mounted okay that'll work
that's really the bottom mounted over
here this will give us some airflow over
the BRM that's that's why I want bottom
mounted right here so I'm gonna have to
flip these two intake that's very
annoying so I'm I'm uh doing a pit stop
pulling it team member Andrew from
behind the camera we before shooting
this we put the fans on because I was
trying to speed things up but I forgot
because we're doing this bottom mounted
we're gonna want the fans mounted I want
them as Pole not as push all right so
it's not the best way to mount it but I
think that's the way I'm gonna do it
oh it's the case and collide in with a
case component hey why isn't it gonna
work this time
oh the tank is wider they're pretty
serious Bend okay I might have to give
up on the cool
stop the clock wait okay so we've gone
back to this setup if we roll back the
timer there was a clearance issue with
the liquid cooler so this case is old
enough where two 80 millimeter coolers
don't play too nice with bottom mounting
the liquid tank was getting in the way
of the i/o the output panel basically
the i/o panel was being blocked by the
radiator and a big piece of metal that
sticks out of it so we've been in that
and we could go with 240 liquid but at
that point really might as well just use
air so we're just gonna use air this is
going to be easier to install
I chose liquid because last time it was
the fastest possible thing to install
last time I think we also did an Intel
system and it was in a different case so
we're gonna go with air for this and I
need to remount the SSD anyway so yeah
we're just gonna rewinds it before
trying the liquid cooler and finding out
that there was no way it was gonna work
in the exact position I wanted it to so
three two one go gonna resume the clock
now
now it will be much more interesting
than 20 minutes of trying to get a
couple screws into a cooler it really
did not want to fit in this bottom
position at all you sure that's the
orientation please be correct yes okay
good we're in business
okay that's a lot better get some
thermal grizzly crying out on there but
overkill
there's a 12-point something watt per
meter Kelvin paste
someone's gonna complain about thermal
compound application and to you I would
say you're wrong it's irrelevant what
what you think matters does not actually
matter okay just you know strictly based
on hundreds of hours of testing this
screwdriver is tiny you know side
benefit of screwing sense simultaneously
is that we're not gonna have better
distribution of their whole compound
it's gonna spend basically perfectly
evenly okay that's way better than where
we were with the liquid cooler and I
have a whole crate full of Noctua fans
that were working on testing so we can
even put some more in here to get some
front intake but we'll worry about that
later
you kind of got enough to worry about as
is so this gonna go up there and I'll
just take this opportunity to point out
the counts that are always like Steve
why are you so abusive to the components
why aren't you more gentle why why do
you try to hurt them by spinning them in
a circle on the table yeah I don't I
don't know why people think that these
components are so fragile but they can
really take a serious beating like
spinning them around on the table as I
do with motherboards seriously it's not
going to hurt the components even work
the work we do with video cards we
haven't killed one so I just like point
out that every one of these are a lot
stronger than people in the comments
seem to think ok enough screws are in
let's do vide power supply I typically
try to do power supply next but let's do
video cards I already picked it up it's
a cool thing about this case it's a bit
old now but because of the orientation
the video card is gonna get some help
from the power supply which will pull
air up and out while the video card is
using its open face design to move the
air around so that will help us out
there need some cables so this is the RM
850 X that course are sent over there
liquid cooler it's not gonna make it in
but power supply is plenty good and will
do exactly what we need
I don't think I need to say that right
now we don't have any SATA drives in
there that's kind of the benefit of of
MDOT - ok so that's gonna come off this
600 C has one of those power supply
mounting plates that NZXT debuted a
couple of years ago
there's a lot of dust up there this case
has been in the attic since we reviewed
it a couple years ago along with the H
500 P that recently tried to kill us
it became possessed Vega frontier
Edition actually possessed it and when
we attempted to get rid of the case we
got fancier dish and brought it back you
don't know what I'm talking about
watch our disappointment pills indie
film of the year
critics say critics say many people like
it I remember this
I remember criticizing this and they
actually said it was a really good point
and that they they being course they're
we're going to consider the changes for
the future can't really route the tables
because the hard drive of cages are in
the way so you have to basically take a
hard drive cage out sacrifice used to
one and that'll give you the best
cleanest management and you can do it
without doing that but you do get much
less clean tables 8-pin oh that's right
this is kind of I think about it for
this yeah motherboards inverted so eight
pins actually coming in down here
instead you got about that like gigabyte
why look flip is facing down and these
cables have capacitors in the end of the
cables so they're hard to contort that
way okay cool
it's done this I wanted to cut out here
to originally crush the cable I wanted
to cut out right there which they also
said was an interesting idea
we're going to be considering if there's
ever a Gentoo of this case but then you
could route this way cleaner up straight
out of the power supply shroud you know
this can come in cleaner too actually
now we're just wasting time on visuals
but we already got the whole bill done
that's really all there is left let's
just try out this one over here okay
this build is something that we were
doing for a friend recently and actually
the build is for Andrew that one is you
it's yours yeah so post building ran a
couple of quick benchmarks on the
completed desktop system versus the
laptop that andrew is using and on the
laptop with a GN logo intro screen
render we were seeing about over six
minutes on the CPU which is an i7 of
some old generation and about 11 minutes
are over on the GPU the GTX 650 our GT
650 M for the new system we're seeing
about a minute for the GPU for a 1070 TI
single card and that will improve once
we get a 960 in there just for some
backup and we saw about a minute and a
half for rise in stock for the 1700 and
overclock and we're working on we're
having some issues with the gigabyte
gaming 5 motherboard where it's
increasing the voltage to one point five
five volts allegedly software reported
which is obviously very high so we're
waiting to fix those issues but for now
these are the numbers we have stock and
once we fix them with an overclock that
should see similar improvements what we
saw in our CP reviews for the r7 1700
stock force overclocked which tends to
be a good couple of percent nearing
double digits so that's our quick
inverted PC build it's this case I liked
a lot when it came out and I hope
Corsair does some kind of follow up to
it because the the layout is really
interesting with a couple fans mounted
in the front we'll do some knock to us
or something they it really streamlines
the airflow straight through the CPU
cooler and the cooler is really close to
the front of the case so you're not
losing much pressure there on the
transit to the
and then the other one is straight in
line with the top the video card to open
face cards can breathe and the power
supply this is the interesting part and
this is all stuff I talked about like
two years ago on the review but the
power supply because the fan is on the
bottom facing the video card
it helps pull that hot air out from the
video card as it's being ejected the
video card any open face design is
basically spewing air everywhere so it's
coming out kind of all different areas
of the heatsink and that means some of
it will go out through the rear exhaust
that's mounted behind the CPU cooler
some of it will go through the power
supply some will go through the big
ventilated portion of the case right
here so all those things mean that
you're not dumping too much heat into
one component like the power supply also
the power supply can definitely take it
it's not that much warmer it's you're
talking 40 degrees amp in verses you
know 30 or something like that so you
might have a 10 C delta but that is the
quick speed build
to start us off for the year couple
things could be cleaned up but for a
speed build
pretty happy with it so we have plenty
of other coverage coming for the rest of
the week but quick note here we will be
at CES for all of next week
so make sure you're subscribed if you
are not that way you can catch all the
news for the hardware industry over the
next week as it comes out you go to
