iBUYPOWER suite looking at the final
version of the snowblind we've covered
this maybe two or three times now but
it's finally here and it will actually
be a shipping product so this is and
exiting the prototype phase before
getting to that this coverage is brought
to you by cyber power and there's cyber
exile gaming PC which has an invertible
motherboard tray check the link in the
description below for more information
so getting back to the case the
enclosure is based it's a Noctis 450 so
this is an N txt enclosure for the most
part it is unchanged other than this
custom side panel to catch everyone up
this is a display so it's actually an
LCD and when you you'll see in our
b-roll when we open it that it's
actually got the backlight super-bright
LEDs all around the perimeter in the
b-roll there will be kind of a tone
difference back here that'll be fixed
for production but if you look closely
the LEDs the display all hook into this
controller in the bottom that does not
connect to the PCB for the motherboard
but it does just connect into a normal
expansion slot in the case out of the
controller comes a display or a DVI
connection to the video card so this
video card routes into that and it's a
extended display just like you would do
through Windows normally so this is
functionally a desktop you wouldn't use
it as a desktop though it's not
perfectly opaque like a monitor is you
can kind of see through the point of the
white background with the intern
internal for the case the back of the
piece of the backplate for the video
card and even the pump and the radiator
which is new by the way and the tubes
which is new White's leaving the point
of all that is to give better contrast
so that the display is more clear when
you're looking at it and what's
different this time from previous
iterations is now rather than just
having a video playing on loop there's
also a rainmeter overlay so you can see
the CPU load this is all just through
rainmeter this is not any special
proprietary software anything like that
so CPU loads down here we've got a time
overlay a date and then whatever else
you can do with rainmeter you could
throw it on there it's pretty standard
functionality but it works here now and
because we've got this hard drive
scaffolding behind that's all just white
it's pretty easy to see
so that's the newest version of the
snowblind the biggest changes
functionally this is a much thicker
panel now so rather than being the
custom cut side panel that came out of
the factory previously it is now a
tempered glass panel it's quite thick
looks like maybe five millimeters or
something like that and the backside has
been kind of reinforced the cabling is
all concealed in the panel so that's no
longer visible and a mess like it wasn't
the very very first prototypes and the
price is bit lower than I thought it
would be so originally the cost to build
the early prototypes was was much higher
than would be sellable on market but
it's been brought down so the sale cost
of the case with the side panel should
be in the 200 to 250 range and it'll be
available in February so that's one
month from now so I think I think that
covers it the rest of the coverage from
before is still accurate it still got
the light guide in there to increase the
contrast it's still like a 5 by 4
display with a 12 1280 or 1024 1280 wide
by 1024 high a resolution and that helps
with the clarity actually better than
the smaller resolution where you get the
the high pixel density because that
messes with the contrast so if you're
interested in more information links in
the description below as always thank
you for watching I'll see you all next
