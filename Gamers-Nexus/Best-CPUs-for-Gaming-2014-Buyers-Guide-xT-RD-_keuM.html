istana and today we're talking about
CPUs this is a CPU buyers guide similar
to that video card buyer's guide I post
a couple days ago back before Black
Friday and for this one we're looking at
CPUs ranging from about seventy dollars
up to 500 plus dollars and obviously
there are much more expensive options if
you have the budget for it but that's
sort of out of the scope of this video
because the architecture changes so
vastly at that point so starting right
away with the low-end CPUs we generally
recommend AMD's 860 k at the budget
price point the sub 100 dollar range the
860 k is a brand new vary based and the
CPU it is similar to the a series AP use
except that has the igp the internal the
integrated graphics processor disabled
so it's just the cpu and that makes it
cheaper the 860 k is a quad-core 3.7
gigahertz CPU and it it'll overclock
pretty well if you've got a motherboard
that'll do it like an 88 board or
something like that it is an FM two plus
socket so it does use and these more
modern socket which we've we've stopped
recommending am3+ because frankly it's
really sort of a mess at this point with
all the aftermarket chips soldered to
the different boards FM two plus is fine
though and it works well pci III is
natively supported USB 3 is natively
supported so it's a step in the right
direction the 860 k is what you should
buy if you're looking to spend about
ninety dollars on a processor so this
would be for system builds that are in
the five hundred dollars at less price
range and that's basically you're on a
really tight budget and you're probably
throwing something like a 750 ti or a
260 x265 something like that in there
for the video card and it will play most
games pretty well it will run into
issues with games like Battlefield 4
that are very thread intensive and it
will definitely run into issues with
video production professional editing
technology Photoshop things like that so
you don't want this h-60 k for things
like photoshop and professional
productions now if you are either not a
fan of AMD or you can't quite you don't
want the 860 k for one reason or another
like
higher GDP which really it's not bad but
it's still higher than intel or you just
don't have the extra twenty dollars to
spend intel's g3 258 which is the
easiest to remember name in the industry
is a is a low TDP solution and it's
basically it's a pentium processor it
exists solely for the purpose of things
like htpc is really ultra budget gaming
computer builds and it works very well
it'll overclock thirty to fifty percent
pretty consistently in my tests you can
definitely get it thirty percent
overclocks and no problem ships stock at
about 3.2 gigahertz 2.1 3.2 and it is a
dual-core processor with no hyper
threading so you do lose some coors
there and yes intel and AMD have
different definitions of course but
still the AMD solution does perform a
bit better in games like Battlefield 4
it is twenty dollars more of course and
you might not want it because this will
be better for home theater pcs that are
less gaming intensive and the games they
play might be a little easier on the
graphics and on the CPU side of things
and this is a seventy dollar processor
so it's a bit cheaper lower TDP more
efficient but less powerful although it
is less powerful it will overclock well
so if you're willing to overclock grab a
Z series Z class board and clock it up
and then you'll get much better
performance even in multi-threaded
applications moving up to the mid-range
we have things like Intel's i5 4440 cpu
and this is sort of the 165 dollar price
range so if you're buying a little over
a hundred but you can't quite afford a
46 90 k for instance then this is where
you would be the 44 40 cpu runs stock at
3.1 gigahertz and it is a quad-core
solution so it's it's significantly
better than the g3 258 that we just
looked at and it's still low TDP it
still has well architecture so will
enable things like self shading smoke
and technologies like that which are
present in the grid racing game and the
44 40 is what you would buy if you have
zero interest or very limited interest
and overclocking because it is a lock to
CPU you won't be able to overclock it or
not much anyway and it's a
budget-friendly solution it will perform
just fine for really almost every game
out there
here and it's it'll be fine in some
limited production tasks Photoshop
really unless you're doing intensive
stuff and you know if you are it's not
going to be limited and things like that
for most average users the higher end
users will want to look in the next
price range though as for an AMD
solution at this price point there is
the a-10 7850 k which you would really
only by if you wanted a high-end IGP i
use as our 7 graphics integrated and
that is very good for a an htpc where
you dont have space or desire or budget
for video card so if you can't afford a
discrete card or you dont have space for
it or you've got thermal or wattage
issues grab the 78 50k performs pretty
well you will be stuck at low to medium
settings on most games it'll play things
like Skyrim just fine on medium and high
settings but it will definitely struggle
and be unplayable with some games like
Assassin's Creed unity or far cry 4 just
don't even really expect to play those
games on a 7850 k you need a discrete
GPU for that now you could run this only
a 50k with a GPU then you would be ok
but at that point you might as well buy
a better processor and you get a GP with
it because there's no reason to have the
igp in there if you're just off loading
it all to a discrete graphics card
because dual graphics is really not what
it needs to be right now to be
worthwhile moving up to the high end
we've got Intel's Devil's Canyon
processors this is the 46 90 k which is
about two hundred ten dollars right now
with the sales definitely worth it it's
a fork or four thread processor it is
not hyper threaded on like the i7
counterpart and it's fully unlocked for
overclocking so you can overclock be 46
90 k completely you have very few
restrictions do make sure you get the
correct is united seven motherboard with
it though because even within z97 boards
some of them will be more limited than
others for overclocking options so that
is something to note it will run you a
bit more because not only is the
processor more expensive but the boards
will be more expensive as well because
they need to sustain higher voltages and
things like that and be more stable on
the whole the 46 90 k is clocked at
three point five gigahertz natively and
it will overclock pretty easily you can
pretty much guarantee attend the
% overclock depending on what kind of
air-cool you're using if you're on
liquid than you know it'll go a little
higher don't expect too much intel
really push Devil's Canyon as being sort
of the end-all be-all overclocking
solution after as well but it's not
quite there it didn't do what everyone
expected it to so don't go into this
expecting you'll be hitting five
gigahertz on air because you probably
won't be just realistically still a very
good processor it will play every game
out there as long as you've got a good
GPU with it on high ultramax settings
really I've run it to no cpu throttling
on this for the most part if you're
running a multi-monitor higher
resolution set up like a fork a set up
then you might run into cpu throttling
depending on how many and how powerful
GPUs you've got your system so that is
something to know it in that case you'd
probably want to look a little higher
end but at that point you're spending so
much money on GPS anyway that it makes
sense you'd have a better processor as
for the rest of the high-end range
there's the i 747 mine DK which is
similar to the 46 90 k except it's for
its four cores eight threads so it is
hyperthreaded hyper threading has very
little impact on most modern games
battlefield 4 will mate will take more
advantage of it because it's a very
heavily multi-threaded application most
games will not exceed two to four
threads of efficient usage so don't buy
this thinking it's going to vastly
improve your gaming experience for most
games it will vastly improve your
experience for things like Adobe
Premiere and Photoshop which eat all the
threads that you make available to those
applications so that is where you would
be buying a 47 IDK it is priced at three
hundred dollars with sales right now
it's pretty good hit the links in the
description below for all the links to
these products and things like that at
the high end once you're spending 500
bucks there's the X class processors x99
in this instance haswell-e and those are
really for enthusiasts there for
production rigs that don't want Zeon's
for one reason or another the very good
processors but they're so expensive that
it's tough to justify for the vast
majority of gaming pcs which we
generally push toward the 46 90 k or on
the budget side the 860 k from AMD or
similar of course there's the 44 40 in
the middle but the 59 30
k processor is a three point five
gigahertz six core cpu it is it's insane
and the architecture is insane and it
uses quad-channel ddr4 memory so it's
vastly different from the rest of the
CPUs we've spoken about and for that
reason I'm going to cut the
recommendation there short because it's
so different do look into that if you're
looking to spend more than five hundred
dollars you're building some kind of
high-end production or enthusiast rig
and then there are one thousand dollars
EP of options as well if you'd prefer
those so that is all for this CP buyers
guide hit the link in the description
below for more information on the cpus
for links to where you can buy them and
please subscribe please like the video
helps us a lot and making more of these
and I will see you all next time peace
