going to be doing a rundown of the
various r-tx 20 atti PCBs well not
really a rundown just kind of I'm gonna
point out the ones that I think are
worth considering
so yeah because unfortunately the r-tx
20 atti PCBs they're very it's a lot of
the same thing over and over again as
far as I'm concerned which is why I've
gotten really tired of looking at our TX
2080 TI's relatively quickly because
it's just like the cards are like it's
basically just the same thing with
slight like layout differences there's
not really anything all that new or
interesting between any of the cards at
least the cards that you can like
regularly by this video is brought to
you by us and the disappointment PC
t-shirt a great way to support gamers
Nexus and to commemorate a year of
despair is to wear a constant reminder
of your disappointment the GN
disappointment t-shirt features release
dates from major milestones like spectra
and meltdown the cts labs report and RAM
prices accompanied by an artifact of
design that matches the infamous XD
failure mode on new video cards the
shirts are high-quality fabrics and
prints and are available in soft 100%
cotton for a comfortable fit or
available in a popular try blend visit
store gamers Nexus dotnet or click the
link below to grab one now starting at
$19.99
there is cards like the galaxy all of
Fame card which was really really cool
but unfortunately they made a hundred of
those which that's the extreme
overclocking version and they made only
a hundred of those I'm not sure if
there's like a cut-down consumer version
there probably is but it's cut down so
everything that made the extreme
overclocking version cool isn't on the
consumer version so it's just like oh
well that's not you know that that's
just boring as far as I'm concerned and
yeah on the on the other like the other
cards are just like the cards that are
currently available because there are
interesting cards coming out like
there's gonna be a 20 atti kingpin
Edition but ultimately I don't think
that ones
be a whole lot better on air cooling or
water cooling than just your other light
than any of the other cards is that ones
really geared for extreme overclocking
and then there's going to be a lightning
from MSI but I'm not sure what exactly
they plan to do with that historically a
lightning should be great for extreme
overclocking but considering how Nvidia
has just been like just like Nvidia is
just ruining extreme overclocking
support
I don't think MSI will be allowed to do
quite as much with lightning as they
would like to or if they like it might
be really half-hearted because that's
what I thought think what happened kind
of with the 1080 t I like it was a
lightning it just wasn't it didn't seem
to be on the same level as some of the
past lightnings that you know came
before the the 10 series so yeah so
those cards are like you know those are
cards that exist but unfortunately you
can't really buy them right now so we're
just gonna look at cards that are
available or at least PCBs that are
available don't the full cards I don't
know how the heatsinks perform you
should probably ask Steve about that not
me I just get sent pictures of PCBs so I
can figure out what components are all
in them and if said components are good
or not so then starting off with the
founders Edition PCB which is extremely
common okay like this is one of those
things like that's a founders Edition
card and that uses the founders Edition
PCB guess what this card uses you save a
lot of money if you buy this thing right
and I'm in the UK that's why this is in
pounds so this is still a Founders
Edition PCB this is also a Founders
Edition PCB that's a Founders Edition
that's also a Founders Edition also also
also not sure I think this is probably a
Founders Edition but with Asus I'm never
quite sure because even for like low-end
cards Asus for some reason makes custom
PCBs I'm not sure I guess they have I
guess they have more manufacturing
capacity than they know what to do with
fir for actual boards so they actually
just manufacture their custom cards even
for low-end even for their low-end GPUs
so I'm not a hundred percent certain
that this is a founders it
it probably is but I'm not gonna say it
definitely is because I don't know with
100% certainty next we have this thing
which is a founders edition another
founders edition ASIS card so I'm not
sure this is almost certainly yes
another founders edition and then we
have another Asus card where I'm not
sure now here we have the zotac amp
extreme which is like the first custom
card and the thing is it's like here's
the problem with the r-tx 20 atti custom
cards you basically all of them right
excluding the MSI gaming X is you get 16
power stages running in either 8 or 10
phase mode and this applies even to the
extreme overclocking cards though I'm
not sure about the kingpin Edition I'm
pretty sure and the Lightning though I
think the Lightning is a 16 phase I've
not managed to find like I'm pretty sure
the Lightning's of 16 phase I mean 16
power stage card because none of them
actually run doublers none of the phases
are out of phase with each other so
basically and that includes the founders
Edition the founders Edition runs an 8
phase voltage controller in 8 phase mode
and they basically have this weird
asymmetrical phase setup which which
works but and the reason why NVIDIA has
gone for it with the the 13 like in
videos reference card is 13 power stages
and the whole point of doing that is
that those 70 amp power stages hit peak
efficiency for the kind of current and
RT x 20 ATT I would put out while pull
stock settings if you have 13 of them so
basically the reference card is
optimized for peak efficiency at stock
settings and a little bit of
overclocking like it's not it doesn't
get significantly less efficient as you
overclock but definitely some of the
other cards out there have some
advantages the further like start
getting like getting bigger and bigger
advantages the higher you push your core
claw the higher you push your power
consumption so yeah that's that's kind
of that but ultimately everything's like
their most of the cards are eight phase
and the zotac card is no difference the
main difference with the zotac card is
that they have four phase memory power
but that's just like it's not going to
do
it's like I'm nor I well I know exactly
why ZOTAC did it so tak wants to be able
to claim that they have the most phases
out of any RT X 20 a DTI manufacturer
out there which they technically do but
that extra phase they tacked on is is on
the memory it doesn't do anything so and
and they don't have the most true phases
because they still use the U P 9512
voltage controller which runs in a phase
mode so yeah it's basically just like so
that's an eight plus four phase that
they have and they do run the 16 power
stages and then for power stages for the
memory power so you know it's ever so
slightly better memory like it's
slightly better v core vrm than the
referent than the founders edition
slightly better memory vrm than the
founders edition but not to an extent
that I would actually care right like
it's not gonna make a difference in your
data in overclocking on ambient it's
probably not even gonna make a
difference in overclocking on ln2 now
then moving on to a card that is
actually interesting as far as I'm
concerned we have the ROG Strix and
we're just gonna look at it on Asus is
own website so the reason why I like the
Strix and I was hoping for bigger
pictures yeah okay that's great but uh
the reason why I like the Strix PCV is
very very simple so you get a bios which
that which is in my opinion with an RT x
28 ET i that's like the most innovative
feature on any of these cards because
there's like two of them that i'm aware
of that have bios switches and so that's
the FTW three and the Strix now where
the Strix differs from the a lot of the
other cards is that the Strix actually
chooses to intentionally use the MP 2888
voltage controller and the threes Anaya
is that controller supports ten phases
and it's running in 10 phase mode so
this is one of the few like this and the
Galax holo fame are the only cards I'm
currently aware of that run ten phase
that have the vrm as a ten phase for V
core which is really really cool it
still has 16 power stages bought Asus
upgraded the power stages they're
actually 70 M power stages from Texas
Instruments not from Fairchild
Semiconductor and these are CSD 95 for 8
zeros and there
ever so they're well they're a bit more
efficient than the FDM f31 70s that
everybody else is using like literally
everybody else is using the the
Fairchild Semiconductor parts and so
essentially asus has a slightly more
efficient vrm they have slightly more
phases than ever they have like two
phases more than everybody else and also
they have much more output capacitance
than anybody else it is worth noting
that I don't think that actually makes a
difference like all of those advantages
that Asus has in their vrm in day to day
overclocking I don't think you'll notice
if you were on liquid nitrogen you might
but probably won't so yeah but
ultimately because of all the little
like it Asus like at least tried to do
something to make the PCB a bit better
and so I actually like because of that I
like the 20 atti
Strix PCB quite a lot because it has the
like it's not a huge difference but it
does have the best of erm and it has a
bios switch and that's kind of the end
of the story for why I like this PCB
next there's of course the like a lot of
people obviously want to know about the
MSI card because hey it has a 6 pin
everybody else only has 2 8 pins well
the thing is MSI is on a 14 power stage
setup 8 phase of erm so this is
basically as close to the founders
Edition as you can be in terms of your
VR in terms of your DRM as possible
without being a founders Edition like
they've added one phase to the V Corps I
mean not even one phase they added one
power stage there's 14 power stages
instead of 13 they still use a you p95
12 and yeah that's that's kinda the end
of that for the vrm now where the big
difference is between the the msi card
and the founders Edition are is that MSI
removed a whole bunch of current
balancing circuitry and I assume that's
because they have more power connectors
so they're not as power can strike this
basically like it's not an issue of the
power connector not handling the power
it's an issue of Nvidia's ridiculously
strict software power limits they just
won't let anybody make a card with an
800 watt power limit in the vials so if
you don't want the card power throttling
when you max out one
your power connectors you need to have
some power balancing circuitry but since
MSI has more power connectors than
everybody else they can cut back on the
power balancing circuitry because it's
less likely that you're gonna max out an
8 pin and another 8 pin and a 6 pin if
you still stay within like the regular
Nvidia power limits so that's kind of
what they opted for there they also have
fuses on the power connectors which I
don't think do a whole lot because
generally speak the the scenario where I
could really expect those fuses to blow
is if like one of your power stages
shorted like shorted like die have
failed closed where it shorts the 12
volts to the output of the vrm and the
thing is I doubt that that fuse is gonna
blow faster than the GPU core is gonna
die when exposed to steadily rising
voltage it really doesn't take a lot of
voltage to quickly kill a you know like
silicon like you you can basically just
brush against like if the core voltage
blips to say 2.5 volts for you know a
microsecond that chip is dead and if the
fuse doesn't blow up before that happens
the chip is dead and so I don't think
the fuses are all actually all that
useful and if anything if you were
trying to do extreme overclocking I
think they'd get in the way because you
might blow them up while just pushing
regular amounts of power so yeah that
that's kind of like that's basically why
I don't really like this this card where
it's just like like PCB wise I don't
like it I don't know about the cooler
the cooler might be great and if the
cooler is great then a good reason to
get it would be the cooler but as far as
the PCB goes it's basically a founders
Edition with an extra power connector oh
and some fuses that might not do a whole
lot if you actually like have a short
circuit on the card so yeah but that is
the gaming extra Oh next we have the
EVGA FTW three which what do you get
with an FTW three well you get a bios
switch and you get the same 16 power
stage eight phase-- vrm that you get on
like say this gigabyte card right here
so yeah basically everything I say VR my
is
about the FTW three is also true for the
extreme card here as well as the extreme
water force from gigabyte they do have a
version of the 2080 TI which comes with
a water block and that is just like it's
16 power stages runs an eight phase--
mode uses AUP 95 12 and what else is
there oh yeah they're the one minor
difference is that gigabyte uses much
smaller power inductors than everybody
else but I don't think that's actually
gonna make a difference unless you're
doing extreme overclocking and even
there I'm not sure because I don't know
the spec of the parts that gigabyte is
using they're just suspiciously small
not that that would be an issue on
ambient cooling it's just like if you
tried to push say 500 watts through the
I mean 500 amps through the VRM they
might be an issue might probably won't
be but could be because everybody else
is using larger parts and generally with
inductors the the size of them kind of
has a big role to play with how much
current think they can handle well yeah
so VR mo is the the FTW 3 basically
takes the or the FTW threes vrm actually
uses the same inductors as what you
would find on the founders Edition and
they basically tackle in three extra
power stages still running ain't phase
mode and they add a bios switch so
basically if you're gonna be buying a
card for sort of overclocking features
I'd say FTW three or Strix whichever one
is cheaper right if you just want the
bios which just by whichever one's
cheaper and if you want a card for like
water cooling just buy the cheapest
thing you can find that house the
founders edition PCB and probably you
might want to check with the
manufacturer of said card if they're
okay with you replacing the heatsink
right so when you swap it over to the
water block because some of them
apparently aren't okay with that but
yeah that is that is all the RT X xx
atti PCBs there's really not that much
to them I mean you know there's two
different voltage controllers that
you'll encounter across all the cards
except like the Hall of Fame that want
to have a special one but you can't buy
that card as far as I'm aware so it's
not relevant to the
to the the discussion here and yeah
Strix has the best like the RM out of
the cards that you can buy FTW three is
the next like the the other option to
the Strix just because it has the bios
which this doesn't like the extra six
pin in my opinion here doesn't make any
sense doesn't do a whole lot and if you
want water cooling get a founders
edition so yeah that is it for the video
