Astra and this is the third one we're
shooting for this series of them for
this week the bonus episode will be on
patreon.com slash gamers Nexus will have
another one on the main channel and
we're traveling internationally for the
Nvidia event and for Gamescom which is
all public at this point so I will be
traveling for that after that you can
expect a lot of news and other tests and
things like that as we finalize our move
into the new space so we should have
some actual benchmark content coming out
aside from the case reviews we've just
published but anyway as always leave
your questions for next episode in the
comment section below if you have them
we have a couple good ones for this week
so we'll get through those and hopefully
you can post some good ones maybe about
the gamescom announcements in the
comment section below for the next set
of episodes before that this video is
brought to you by the EVGA CLC 280
liquid cooler people ask me how I keep
cool during the summer with all this
hair well I've tried a lot of different
products and if you do exactly what I
need many of them cause tangles or worse
EVGA CLC 280 helps keep my core
temperatures lower they're in hot
benchmarking sessions the CLC 280 is
price competitive and focuses on
performance for value offering a 280
liquid cooler at an affordable price get
yours at the link in the description
below hair mounting kit sold separately
so first note before starting these are
back in stock the GN beer glass and
cobalt blue with a gold trim around the
edge it's on stored on cameras nexus net
if you wanted up in the first round and
they sold out because they did very
quickly we now have them back in stock
on the store as well as the mod mat
still a couple of them there if you want
to pick up a mod mat before the next
round
at which point we'll be waiting for the
shipment to come in so the first
question for this week is from GGC HB
dig GHP who says Steve how much does
corporate spine or a personnel buy and
happen in the hardware world can
struggling fabrics or manufacturers just
hire someone from a successful one and
get all the secret techniques that's a
big problem and a big concern and there
are a lot of very uninformed comments
and reply to this question so corporate
espionage in the PC world happens all
the time theft of trade secrets happens
all the time we talked about it in a
hardware new
episode kind of recently where I think
it was the Wall Street Journal had this
huge feature piece on corporate
espionage theft of trade secrets that's
the intellectual property between
fabrication plants specifically between
memory suppliers and memory
manufacturers so extremely common and as
far as can you just hire someone and get
all the secret techniques some of the
comments below yours talked about there
are NDA's well yeah there are but that
doesn't really stop anything ideally it
would but that's not how the world works
and of course you can also sue anyone
who you want anyone you want doesn't
mean that you're gonna be successful in
it in these instances because a lot of
this stuff is international it kind of
depends on where the different parties
are based of whether the lawsuits are
successful for inter actual property
theft and stuff like that so I want to
go through some of the stuff I talked
about in that hardware news episode just
in case you missed it be a bit of a
recap for those of you saw but one of
the things we talked about was there are
instances in the I think it was again
the Wall Street Journal article they
talked about instances where try to base
companies were stealing intellectual
property from Taiwan based counterparts
in the same industry and there have been
several recent lawsuits that actually
put people behind bars for stealing
information from one plant moving it to
another or from one manufacturer moving
it to another particularly in the
semiconductor space so very common and a
couple of these examples so there's
Shanghai Holly micro electronics
corporation which infiltrated TSMC or
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Company which many of you are likely
familiar with as they make a lot of the
parts that we use in our end of PC
hardware so the shanghai harley micro
electronics corp infiltrated TSMC and in
doing so they were able to illegally
access quote reams of trade secrets so
big problem there the employee was
implicated in this corporate espionage
was sentenced to a suspended 18-month
prison term for IP theft and recently
also microns been in the news for a lot
of the same stuff where micron had an
engineer who was recorded by UMC the
company the very same one that just had
a preliminary in
function placed upon it for plates on
micron in China and that engineer has
now been indicted on charges of trade
secret theft and as he moved from micron
to UMC taking those secrets with him so
very common UMC is a taiwan-based
competitor in this instance the
illegally taken documents were used to
design chips for a different company
which we talked about in the hardware
news episode and it's a Chinese
semiconductor company called Fujian
jinhua and that's a circuit company
Nonya which you may know for being the
smallest of the nand makers and dram
makers they make a lot of the cashing
chips that go on SSDs so Nadia recently
sued one of its engineers for supply and
manufacturing photographs to another
competing company and that one was one
that Wall Street Journal reported as
being China's at largest state-owned
chip maker so it's very common for IP
theft and and trade secret theft and
things like that to occur in this
industry and no NDA's don't just stop it
magically it's not really how people
generally try not to get caught and if
they don't catch you then an NDA doesn't
really matter so a very common great
question though and that uh that that
article that we talked about the
hardware news episode previously is a
very good read if you're curious about
that stuff it's very interesting very
interesting comment read through next
one Q Lamar clumb who says why did
cheaper motherboards often include
outdated connectors long gone from their
more expensive counterparts
for example the asrock 8320 md gsa
bottom-of-the-barrel motherboard has a
calm and a printer port it clearly costs
money to solder the connector yet it is
only included in the lower margin
cheaper motherboard being cheaper
doesn't mean it's lower margin
necessarily but so we've talked about
this before but when we last asked the
motherboard contacts we have about this
motherboard makers have in the past told
us that a lot of this depends on the
region they're targeting for the board
so legacy ports make a lot of sense on
boards that are being sold in
manufacturing heavy regions like China
and Taiwan where a lot of the machinery
that they use is still hooked up via
something like calm and they want that
port there so last time
we asked about this it was sort of a ton
in cheek like why is that there but it
was a good answer and it was because
their customers and other regions do
actually need those ports so that is a
big consideration a lot of the factories
still run on older i/o interfaces serial
comm are also very useful for debug and
sometimes it gets left on there I don't
know if it's just cheaper or what but
another example is in the rapid what is
it called pick-and-place machines those
I don't know if they sort of spool it up
for something and then they just keep
putting them on the boards because it's
cheaper to rearrange everything than it
is to pull the common serial stuff out
of there but either way it seems like
the region-specific stuff is more of the
consideration last time we asked that
anyway and that was a couple years ago
but same idea tobe Ricky said can too
many case fans actually make your PC
cooling worse yes definitely especially
if they're not configured in a good way
so this was a good example of this would
be something like even the half acts an
older case that was pretty airflow
focused putting fans on the top in the
wrong orientation should be intake or
exhaust will definitely hurt your
performance you start ending up with
vortexes forming sometimes where the
hotter air will recirculate so the
BitFenix and so is a good recent example
of this that we showed where because the
front panel is completely closed off the
fan actually the fan mounted to the
front because they can't get access to
air from outside it actually ends up
pulling air in from inside the case so
after the hairs been warmed up and
generally blown out of like the GPU or
the the back of the CPU cooler although
generally that more of a radiative heat
issue off the back of the video card
it's pulling air from there because it
can't get air anywhere else so all the
pressures just it's sucking air forward
through the case up into an intake fan
and getting pushed back into the case
and so having a fan to high up in that
area the front of the case and so did
end up with much worse thermals and
that's an example of where where that
can occur also if you end up doing
something like again top exhaust so
let's say you want to fill all your fan
boards
at least the ones on the top and you
have maybe three intake and three top
exhaust something like that the exhaust
towards the front of the case if it's a
tower air cooler will steal more air
from the front intake then it will help
with getting rid of warm air so if you
think of this as the front of the cases
as a top air comes in and gets pulled
out immediately as it enters so it never
makes it to the CPU tower cooler
typically for exhaust fans on the top if
you're gonna have them we like to have
them behind the CPU cooler because
that's where the warm air is not in
front of it because it doesn't actually
help unless you really need some
pressure to pull the area and maybe if
you have a bottom intake you'd some
pressure at the top to pull the air up
and through the cooler but otherwise
that's pretty uncommon scenario except
for like the rvs RV o - or something
like that definitely - many fans can
make cooling a lot worse next one nori
said what is the one downside as if
there's one of moving out of the GN
layer and into a commercial office
outside of Payne for a lease and moving
the Moving's actually been an upside
because it's allowed us to rearrange
things the way I want from scratch
rather than have to work within the
confines of stuff that's been there for
a decade
so that types you've been an upside so I
was doing inventory stuff like that so
we know what we have and give us some
more content ideas things like that have
had a lot of content ideas come out of
the move because I've seen all this
stuff where it's like oh yeah we have
that and that would be really cool to do
something with downsides probably
Internet's a bit of a downgrade it's not
that bad so well it's bad in terms of
price but it's not as bad in terms of
the upload download we can't get as much
upload download I've gigabit for
residential and that's significantly
more expensive for commercial so tight
bit of a downgrade there fortunately the
server side of things like YouTube does
bottleneck anyway so if residential is a
gigabit the most we ever got out of
YouTube was 300 megabits up which is a
lot but it would tend to average closer
to 200 or 250 so you don't you having a
gigabit unless you're pushing uploads to
multiple servers at once didn't really
matter all that much it's really a
couple hundred megabits you want ideally
so internets probably the biggest one
though and then David asked
there have been a few videos where you
said you were specifically not under NDA
any NDA and - has also said that in a
few instances of course you can only
speak for yourself but are there are you
actually honest about that or would you
say that exactly because the NDA doesn't
allow you to talk about it so when I say
we're not under an NDA it's honest
because there's no reason not to say for
know how to hurt an NDA there's no
obligation not to say that if you're an
under NDA you either don't address the
question or there's specific language in
the NDAA that says what you can and
can't talk about and it doesn't make any
sense if you're under one to say you're
not under one it makes more sense to
ignore the question or answer it in some
other way so yeah if I say I'm not under
an NDA it's that's accurate generally
we're probably under some kind of
embargo for something that most times
but you know if you're specific with the
question then if I'm not under one I'll
let you know
I think line of same thing for him based
on the times I've seen him talk about it
but I can't can't speak for him
obviously mod Z says what do you think
about Nvidia finally changing the GTX
branding on selects new models of GPUs 3
- GeForce RTX I feel we've been stuck on
GeForce GTX before so long I'm actually
really glad they're finally changing
things up as a note I really do hope
they at some point start read restart
the numbering system so we don't end up
with 5 digit skews one day and I hope
they bring back the ultra branding
yeah 8800 Ultra was a really good card
and the last time I remember seeing that
Brandon and I meaningful way five digits
cues aren't gonna happen I don't think
probably they'll restart the numbering
just like they have done several times
previously for all these companies so I
wouldn't worry about that GeForce r-tx
versus GTX is part of Nvidia's push to
make ray-tracing the next big thing
they've they've been talking about ray
tracing for decades at this point but
the company it's Nvidia specifically
brought up ray tracing I think in a 2012
or 2013 keynote that I covered where
Tony Tomas he still had on video today
did a keynote and talked about ray
tracing being on target for real-time
rendering real-time rendering of ray
tracing by 2015
miss the boat on that one but not too
far off so it looks more like 2018-2019
will have some form of real-time ray
tracing rendering it's just it's it kind
of depends on how many traces you're
taking and how many samples you're
taking they're doing stuff like
denoising to improve the performance so
depending our definition of real-time
ray tracing it's kind of here anyway RT
X is a further push by Nvidia to make
ray tracing the next big thing and ray
tracing can actually use tensor cores
like what the Titan V has so that's a
bit interesting because previously you
see tensor core you just assume it's
only for deep learning machine learning
nothing Iles
but it can be used for ray tracing so
might see some of those on the GTX
equivalent cards but not positive yet
we'll know more in the future
RT X is I think going to be a hard name
to get used to for me because I've been
calling on the GTX for so long GTX
sounds better but I guess RT X is what
we're gonna call it if it's Nvidia's new
ray tracing targeted whatever they're
trying to do with it I is all just
branding and the Nvidia is trying to
establish ray trace and as the thing to
be excited about because I guess you
always need something new to be excited
about with any new processor if it's
just it plays games better than I don't
know maybe that gets boring to them at
some point and then the last one
daemon met one says what are your
thoughts on the recent case labs
announcement that they are closing
permanently pretty sad we got in one of
their SMA eights like I don't know a
couple weeks before that was announced
so they probably knew that it was gonna
close at that point or we're getting
close to it anyway so we'll do something
with the case it'll it'll be more of a
post-mortem at this point but definitely
the case that was made high quality
stuff business model was a bit rough
everything is extremely expensive
it's meticulously made and it's just I
don't you can't have a giant audience
that I think they said they had 20,000
customers or something like that which
is pretty damn good
but sad to lose a smaller and innovative
company in the space it's just I think
it was kind of a mix of things like the
tariffs they claims really increase
their metal prices stuff like that I
believe it based on what we've seen so
tariffs didn't help them and then the
business model in general was targeted
to
pretty expensive stuff and so your
audience audience size will shrink over
time if there's not a really compelling
reason to buy that kind of thing because
the problem with making products that
lasts forever is that people don't buy
nuance
let's problem logitech used to have with
the g5 Mouse and if if it just lasts for
years and years and you don't need to
buy another case ever then the audience
for them is is going to be some somewhat
transient so that's it for this one
leave your questions in the comment
