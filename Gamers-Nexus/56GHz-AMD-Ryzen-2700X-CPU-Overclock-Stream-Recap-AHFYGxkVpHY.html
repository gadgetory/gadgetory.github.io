livestream I was here with Joseph on Zee
from periods of hardware and we did the
rise in 2700 X under liquid nitrogen so
we're going to recap the the end results
for that the Cinebench results frequency
the voltages and some of the challenges
we encountered with for example the
other chips you can see our preparation
video from before this one and this will
just be the purely the results from the
live stream before that this video is
brought to you by the gigabyte Zee 390 a
RS master motherboard which comes
equipped with one of the more powerful
z3 90 V RMS for heavier overclocks on
the new 9th gen Intel CPUs the ARS
master is also one of the few
motherboards with a really heatsink this
generation featuring a mix of high
surface area fins and looks oriented
cover blocks oh and it's also got
updated RGV illumination learn more at
the link below so other than the rise in
overclocking we also had some notable
overclockers join chat we had roman
their bauer join up and Joe and I cooked
a lot of fun at him because he is a
slacker and still hasn't accepted our
challenges so Roman joined chapter
Barrow was in there
talking trash with everybody we had 10
akx devs from EVGA and the OC lab he was
there and then we also had builds lloyd
actually hardcore overclocked and joined
chat so other than the overclocking
itself the people in chat made it a lot
of fun and hopefully someone will tune
in tomorrow as well we're expecting
hopefully some EVGA people and for the
kingpin card so definitely check back
just to hang out and chat with them
alright so Joe where where did we end up
with with that that was her best 2700 X
is that right yeah I'm three out of
three we're basically at what 55 50 so
five point five five zero gigahertz yeah
55 50 megahertz so yeah yeah almost 5.6
gigahertz on our clock and final
Cinebench scores 25 12 points yep and
then four points of reference the stocks
and a bench score was 18 48 points yep
so pretty decent if you consider roughly
35% I think
25:12 is a 36% increase in performance
so can't complain about that under air
what was that one doing and that one
that one I didn't test as much it was
some I think it was like a four - okay
at about one four to five that's good
pretty much the max I tested on the air
because I didn't seem like any of them
liked it any more than that this one so
for the five nearly five point six
gigahertz roof five point five five zero
yeah what was the voltage does he change
it a bit you're like we have I started
off with like one five five just from
playing around with a couple chips and
but the problem is that I think it would
it's doubled and about five four or five
point four seven five it basically
started dying off so I had to increase
the voltage from 155 to 160 I had to
increase to 165 for that just a quarter
of a megachurch yeah its torque I don't
even know how to explain this yeah yeah
so you can actually basically put it ups
in steps of quarters on the multipliers
which is weird and intel you don't have
that yeah so it's weird to explain to be
honest so uh 0.25 multiplier increase
yeah so just increasing that by one step
I needed to add point zero five to the
voltage yeah and then I added for the
next step of after that I had to add it
again so the final clock sigh I needed
up being at what one point eight five
yes volts so he had one point six 21.85
just for like what three quarters of a
it's just way too much great yeah the
bench is still set up so here it is we
showed this in the prep video but it's
got the t-rex pot on it with some frost
it's getting getting warm now it's only
- whatever about a - 100 C no I don't
see so yeah it's heating up heating up
and then we never had to break down so
that's good it wasn't didn't get filled
with water well from bitching here a
bunch of times yesterday we kind of I
figured out exactly kind of how to work
it so that way we can
live stream couple hours with it so
right so this is probably the best one
we've had yeah as far as setup wise and
I guess for another point of reference
on the Cinebench score so I said we were
at like 25 12 points or something
thread River 1950 X I just pulled this
result up from hot hardware in the
middle of the stream and they were at
about 3,000 for 1950 X the original
thread rate for high-end chip so that's
I mean considering cinah batches
entirely thread multi-core II oh yeah
that's really not bad it's amazing to
see that how the frequency jumps
compared to the metaphorce but of course
if you take thread ripper and we benched
that how much we'll push higher than
that yeah yeah it's so impressive to see
just between the two different products
right we still we're almost out of allen
to on this canister on this cylinder so
we're near the bottom and we did refill
the Dewar once so we use probably not
quite but nearing 30 liters during that
maybe 20 liters during the streams 2030
liters 20 liters and then and we talked
about Alan to during the stream about
like some water in there about how it
works and what it costs to set up stuff
like that so I run these that I bought
these after seeing you use them these
are just Stanley Cup they're just
thermoses yep Amazon or something you
couldn't drink coffee with them to
everyone yes
don't drink Alan too but you can't drink
coffee the hell nah yeah so these are
like less than 20 bucks each
and then you get the Alan teapot we
talked about this during the stream
already but you're using the t-rex from
kingpin yep and that's a couple of those
ours like three four hundred dollars
depending yep
maybe he has him well I don't know if he
has a couple models now but he is
obviously there was a range yeah so no
that's his newest and greatest latest
and greatest like yeah so and then uh
doers couple hundred dollars yeah
brand-new on 630 liters like this you
can get 10 liter if you want to do this
at home you could bring this over to
your local
Alan to supplier and have them fill it
up or something yeah some of the places
that you can go or like welding supply
so if maybe if you're you look up your
local welding supplies we're gonna find
yeah so anyway the yeah stream recap I
mean how do you feel about that
overclock cuz it's much better than it
used to be yeah so you're like with AMD
you'd get like a gigahertz and you'd get
no performance yeah yeah so like it's
kind of fascinating to see how much
improvement you have and if you really
compare it to Intel if you if you were
to take away Intel's clocks the amount
of performance that you're getting is
actually pretty good yeah I mean it's
still not there yet but it just shows
that there's room for improvement
alright it's pretty impressive yeah it's
actually kind of fun to overclock to be
honest yeah I went well and then we were
running at minus 196 like the whole time
yeah on the temperature so that on to
pot was I was about as cold as it can
possibly get yeah it was maxed out we
have the term called full pot which
means the whole pot was filled with
liquid nitrogen the whole time yeah it
was at that max you can get sometimes
the the meters or the temp ropes can't
fully recognize the minus 196 well yeah
it was pretty much there it's also
depends on where that pro is playing
yeah there's a lot of variables in there
yeah yeah but it's close enough so yeah
we're running on as cold as it can get I
guess let's talk about this too so the
2700 x goal to talk about this during
the stream this is that like Lisa soo
like signed by Machine Gold Edition one
Andy does not advertise this to be fair
to them as a binge chip they don't say
it's better you kind of hope it is
because you're paying more for it and
it's called scale but kind of my hope
but yeah I mind here but where did you
end up with this when we were bidding
them so in liquid nitrogen I had we had
three chips so two other chips and then
we had this chip so obviously you saw
the max of the the 55 50 the other one
did about 5500 just basically 55 and
then this wasn't it about four point
seven five so or five point four
thousand five so it wasn't even that 55
so yeah it was kind of disappointing it
was the worst chip out of all gives it
five point five gigahertz on on two and
on air I can get at the 4.2 gigahertz
yeah they I guess I you go it's kind of
interesting how you see
how they are on air because the other
two chips were better than that one up
oh yeah and so you kind of see like the
reference um you can kind of use air to
predict where they happy yeah it's just
in on Intel it's very similar to where
you can basically if if you have an
amazing chip on air then most likely
it's gonna be amazing chip on ellentube
very disappointed though on that cold
yeah I'm still huh
I was hoping it was gonna be a yeah yeah
but not so much no no so yeah we did end
up though with scores are pretty good I
think hardware numbers currently has the
number one scorer and Cinebench got a
good chip in is that like 5.7 something
that hurts and we can get that high but
we got you ready down top there yeah we
got up there and consistent to that was
the same max that I got the other day so
obviously we're doing I'm doing
something right yeah so that's the the
risin side of the stream thank you for
all those who watched and that's your
really quick recap for those who missed
the stream the next stream we still have
this entire tank Vallon to it hasn't
really leaked at all which is great
180 liters and that will be used i think
the stream going up tomorrow which well
i should just give a date i guess but
sunday the 12th of may that is going to
be this card so that kingpin 2080 TI and
we're just gonna run the CP on water
probably and it's going to be i guess
some ninety nine eighty XE with this 299
so that'll be our bench tomorrow this
will be the the card of the point of
focus and there's the ellentube pot we
showed that already and yeah I just got
to prep this now and that'll be the next
stream so Sunday May 12th at 1:00 p.m.
Eastern Time
so when it's 1:00 p.m. in New York City
that's when we will be streaming so yeah
that'll be the next one will it should
be more active right like from from what
you were saying I think this one will be
a bit more yeah it's gonna be much more
active a lot more pouring I can't just
pour it all on there we need to figure
it out so we're probably gonna be
venturing around the minus 130 range
yeah from there it's a lot it's a lot
more going on it's not gonna be where
I'm just pouring and it's done yeah so
it's just a temperature range of certain
components it's also
much higher wattage so the the chip gets
runs pretty hot and then on to pot
smaller will probably run into way more
issues to be honest yes so it should be
a more exciting the stream from that
perspective but this one was still
pretty exciting because over five point
five gigahertz on horizon is not
something you see every day yeah for
sure gives you perspective on where it
can go in the future but will not be
going you're not gonna get a five point
five gigahertz rise in trip from AMD
anytime soon so don't get your hopes too
high good luck
now can run like that on air yeah all
right that's it though thanks for
watching the recap think where we're
gonna start prepping this card so we can
be ready for the next one subscribe to
catch that you can find Joe on the
bearded hardware YouTube channel linked
in the description below or bearded
hardware calm and you know where to find
us
so check back for the next video we'll
see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
