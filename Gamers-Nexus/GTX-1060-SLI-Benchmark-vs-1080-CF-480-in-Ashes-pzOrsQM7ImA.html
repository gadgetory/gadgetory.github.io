the scalable link interface or SLI as
there's no SLI bridge here the GTX 1060
s do not have SLI fingers so that means
we can't connect them via the Nvidia
bridge instead we're using the PCIe bus
which is exposed through MDA or LD a
explicit accessible in ashes of the
singularity with DirectX 12 this is not
something that will work on every game
but just as a bit of fun I decided to
run it through the test before you get
into this benchmark this video is
brought to you by MSI and their new MSI
GTX 1060 gaming X video card which is
one of the two that we use in this video
so let me be clear up front in no way
when we recommend buying two gtx 1060 s
for use in a single system so this is
strictly for fun we're really just
looking at how it performs in the one
use case I know of where a form of SLI
will work even though it's not SLI its
MDA or LD a explicit and so this test is
just looking at that it's a curiosity
and it's within the realm of because we
can it doesn't mean you should go buy
this so with that out of the way let's
get to the benchmarks you can find our
our X 480 crossfire benchmark by the way
in another video on the channel for more
information on that specific setup for
this benchmark will be showing the our X
480 the RX 418 crossfire you can find
the full crossfire benchmark in a
separate video on the channel we'll also
be showing of course 1060 1060 in a form
of multi-gpu explicit multi-gpu with
ashes of the singularity we're running
the founders Edition and MSI gaming X
versions of the 1060 we'll also have the
1080 or a form of it and the 1070 just
for a reference point so the testing
methodology is the same as is defined in
our GTX 10 sixth review that's already
live if you want the full in-depth
review and methodology you can hit the
link below for that let's look at the
benchmarks here atras supports explicit
multi GPU which has been coded by the
developers to take advantage of DirectX
12 functionality this would also allow
cross brand of video cards to be paired
which we already did at the 917 390 X
and for this test we ran mostly at 1080p
and 4k with high settings that we've
done so
tests as well with both gtx 1060 s we're
hitting 70 5.9 1 FPS in explicit
multi-gpu that's the average FPS at
1080p high as opposed to 40 6.9 8 FPS
average on the founders edition gtx 1060
and 48 FPS on the msi variant from the
msi number that's a scaling of roughly
1.5 X and it's not bad for a
configuration that's never going to be
used anywhere and certainly better than
a lot of games have been for SLI in the
past when their post FX intensive anyway
but most interestingly as you've likely
already noticed the multi-gpu set up
actually outperforms the single GTX 10
70s and even the GTX 1080 gaming X also
by MSI this is pre overclocked at 1847
megahertz and set atop our bench results
until now at 4k we move from 35.4 FPS
average on the msi card and 34.1 FPS
average on the efi card 260 2.79 FPS
average on the dual cards that's pretty
massive scaling is 1.77
x here and that's enough to push us well
into the range of pretty fluid gameplay
again we're pushing past the 1080 game
in X and the crossfire Rx for 80s with
this setup frame times have also been
reduced at 1080 high we saw a reduction
from 21.3 milliseconds average frame
time latency to 13.1 7 milliseconds for
KC's a dip from 29.3 milliseconds
average frame time latency to 15.9 3
milliseconds so I guess if you really
wanted to GT x10 60s and you're the
world's only ashes of the singularity
player then you could go this route
there's also theoretical advantages in
some production applications that may
support multi GPU without SLI I know
some programs from Adobe will support
that though again it becomes a question
of is it better to just buy a higher-end
card which we haven't tested that for
that specific production use case and in
terms of full testing this isn't as
in-depth as our GTX 1060 review so do go
there for more on how these cards
perform individually this test does make
me legitimately curious as to the
potential performance of the GTX 10 60s
had SLI been supported but I'll spoil
things now and remind everyone that
we've
ever once at least in recent years
recommended sli or crossfire setups for
anyone playing a lot of different types
of games as the support is all over the
map for specific use cases and
implementations where multi-gpu is well
supported
it looks like the 1060 s could have made
a good choice that run cheaper than a
1080 even but again this is all
theoretical at this point also we didn't
find the crossfire rx for 80s or the sli
gtx 1070 s to be appealing for the vast
majority of gaming so this is pretty
much in step with what we've seen before
where there are a few specific use cases
that really make good sense and then a
lot of places where you'd actually
better off disabling the second card so
that puts us back to where we started
this was a test mostly just for fun and
curiosity don't read too far into the
results as always pay channeling the
postal video if you want helps out
directly you can hit the link the
description below for the full GTX 1060
review the video is already on the
channel thanks for watching I'll see you
all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
