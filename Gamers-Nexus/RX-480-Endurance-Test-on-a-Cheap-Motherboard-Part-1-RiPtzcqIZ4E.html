testing the nrx for 80 on a cheap
motherboard and she Paris why we filmed
this video before AMD released its 16.7
dot 1 driver update which appears to
resolve a lot of the power concerns
coming through the PCIe bus and so
that's really it's no longer an issue
from what it looks like for the consumer
because you can pull this driver and
basically all concern of over drawn the
PCIe bus are pretty much gone from what
we've seen still I want to run this
video because I am still really curious
about the results so we'll play it
through keep in mind again it was filmed
before the 16th out 7.1 drivers are
released or were released so as a user
you can pull those down and you won't
have this concern really but as a
curiosity we're still gonna run the
endurance tasks on the RX 480 and
without further ado I'll let you see how
we're setting up that endurance test for
the endurance test we're still going to
use 16.6 dot 2 just to see what the
original drivers looked like for
long-term use all right so we're gonna
put a rest to the RX 480 power draw
issue my plan here is to use some lower
end components to create somewhat of a
real-world practical analysis of power
draw on the 480 if we're running an RX
480 and a cheapo motherboard with sort
of cheap but kind of popular and decent
power supply will damage be caused to
the cheap motherboard
well the PCIe slots suffer any damage or
melt or anything like that so that's
what we're testing now the issue here
very briefly a couple of sites with
higher-end electrical testing equipment
Tom's Hardware PC perspective some
others have been able to test and find
that their samples of the our X 480 are
not only spiking above the recommended
75 watt PCIe specification which is
somewhat normal but they are also
maintaining an average higher than that
75 watt recommendation on the spec so
it's more than just spiking this is this
is a problem because the average is so
high on the power draw and it's more of
a problem with overclocking but we're
gonna test it out so here's what I've
got I bought this motherboard this is I
think I spent 40 or 50 bucks
this on Newegg it is probably a bit
lower end then maybe what the average
user would pair this card with but we
are trying to create somewhat of a of a
not worst-case scenario but a bad case
scenario this looks like it has a
four-phase vrm for the cpu is definitely
not a powerful board the power supply
I've got the CX 500
I think after Ebates these are commonly
twenty or thirty bucks it's a pretty
common power spot for a budget bill it's
like 50 bucks normally something like
that we've got the our X 480 this is a
retail model this is the exact same
reference card as the press sample the
only difference is gigabyte put their
name on it but it is a reference card
with the gigabyte sticker and that's a
that's the 240 dollar one with eight
gigabytes and we've sort of tested that
already so the test here I want to build
this bench in our test platform for 24/7
I will be running a 3d mark stress test
on this thing it will burn in and just
stress the hell out of the GPU and we're
gonna see if it can produce any failures
in that period so this will run for a
full week 24/7 I'll check on it every 12
hours I'm gonna be doing a lot of
logging here actively so first of all
before starting the stress test will
take some sort of normal use metrics
look at the power consumption of the
whole system with the power consumption
of the card through gpu-z
and we're also going to be looking at
the thermals pretty heavily so that's
something we specialize in I've got this
IR thermometer I'm going to use the spot
check a few things so we'll spot check
the vrm temperatures and things like
that on the motherboard spot check its
heatsink temperatures and see if any of
those electrical components or otherwise
begin to sort of destabilize and
increase their thermals more than they
should over the period of this burn and
as a result of the high power drawn a
high current high voltage stuff like
that this is a thermocouple reader we
use this in all of our case reviews and
plenty of other things as well it's got
what's called a k-type thermocouple on
the top of it we can mount two of these
to this particular one
it has login functions these I will have
one login ambience constantly we will
use the ambient to subtract the ambient
measurement to subtract that value from
absolute measurements to create a Delta
value this is all standard for our
testing the second k-type thermocouple I
will be mounting somewhere on the board
or the card I'm not sure yet where but
I'll detail that when I figure it out as
we get into the actual stress test cheap
multimeter but this is only to test a
few things it's just going to test the
power supply we're gonna see if the
rails look like they're drawing the
power they should outputting the power
they should be outputting make sure
everything looks stable on the power
supply at the end of the test
I will recheck it just to see how you
know how it's done if it's burned in
changed at all things like that in
account that in our and our results so
that's the test equipment for software I
will be using a 264 to log all the
temperatures on the whole board all the
power draw on the board the video card
the CPU everything fans all of that will
be logged we use gpu-z perform
additional logging on the video card and
what else we have here this will not be
overclocked if the card and the board
survived the first week I'm going to
sort of give it a second to cool down
analyze everything see if it's
performing at the same frame rate as it
used to the same power draw same voltage
all that stuff will be checked and then
I'm going to overclock it and run it for
another week and see if at that point we
can kill the PCIe slot because of the
increased PCIe bus power draw so that's
the test that is most of the methodology
the rest if there's more that changes
will be defined in articles as we get
into the actual benchmarking and as far
as building this thing let's just look
at the the components we got alright so
as I'm not grounded right now but it
really doesn't matter this is a 55
motherboard or something like that like
I said this may be a bit extreme for
someone buying an RX 480 I don't think
it's that far off of what you would buy
a couple with this card but we are
trying to have we just create some kind
of scenario where a failure is possible
if you use a higher-end board especially
one like
x99 classified that we used for our
original testing that's that's going to
tolerate the power draw current the
voltage of the card a lot better than
something cheap that has not invested in
good power design on the board so we've
got a four phase vrm for the CPU pretty
standard two slots I don't even I think
this is probably it was probably ddr4
but we have plenty of memory actually a
latest ddr4 so we got two slots from
memory one PCIe slot that will be used
this is x16 if we flip it over you can
see it as actually electrically
configured for x16 physically so we'll
use 16 lanes from the Intel CPU it's an
H 110 chipset pretty low-end stuff and
I'm hoping I'm hoping that this will
create a somewhat representative but not
too too extreme use case where we can
test the power draw there's an 8 pin EPS
12 volt header despite some of the other
boards in this range using 4 pins and
then we've got the 24 pin over here of
course we're going to keep an eye on the
24 pin and see if any of these traces
burn out in this area we've done that
before on boards and I'm sure that's
where a failure would manifest itself if
one were to occur with this card so
that's the board the card will of course
mount here and we need some memory power
supply stuff like that CPU okay so let's
choose the CPU of the cooler the memory
and all that stuff we've got the power
supply and the board already over here
so this is some of our stuff I've got it
kind of organized for you to see what we
have in the shop of parts and first I
want to choose an SSD because I already
know what I'm going to use these are
currently in use I've got some of them
labeled for other benches this one is
one I bought a while ago and tended to
use it for bench never did so we're
gonna use that for the SSD and for
memory let's go ahead and choose
something that's like kind of affordable
what is this is this is ddr4
kid of 4 so I've got two more sticks
somewhere we can all use two anyway
we've got this Ripjaws stuff this is
pretty common
Ripjaws axe I think is fairly cheap so
this is a ddr3 this is 2400 megahertz to
8 gigabyte sticks ddr4 let's use let's
use this stuff I think this might be
cheaper it's pretty close it doesn't
really matter CPU is obviously gonna be
Intel as the h1 10 board so I've got a
couple CPUs here these are last gen
those are 4,000 series these are 6000
series now the thing with any kind of
benchmarking test methodology tells you
you should only really use one part and
test that one card this would be the
motherboard in this case but I am trying
to do a practical test so as much as I
want to use something like a 6700 K with
a better power supply with better RAM
better everything just to see if we can
make the motherboard fail I'm gonna
stick with the idea of a semi reasonable
reasonable build so we're gonna use this
which is an i-5 6400 Intel CPU clocked
at 2.7 gigahertz so that's these are our
parts right here and assuming everything
goes well at this point we can build the
rest of the bench so we have to choose a
CPU cooler now this is maybe one place
where I'll use something higher end than
what would be found on a build like this
so instead of an air cooler I am going
to put a liquid cooler on there that's
just because I really want to try and
control the thermal values somewhat so
we can just focus the testing on one
thing in terms of thermals and that'll
be the video card and motherboard and
hopefully using a liquid cooler will
also reduce the chance of damaging a CPU
which I don't want to do this is the
supply model of one of those popular
coolers I know it's used for Corsair you
can see it's got no label on it
but this is basically a retail cooler
that's not been branded yet we've got
the thick radiator to 120 millimeter fan
with a fat radiator and then a normal
CPU style liquid cooling block without
the radius sort of machined into it so
first things first of course just gonna
get the
CPU in here and pop this thing out which
well hey Natsu now like I said this is
probably one of the higher-end
components in this build as just because
I really don't want to threaten the CPU
by torturing it for a week
okay
okay hi hi but the CPU cooler the
radiator right there against one of our
high-powered open bench fans video card
time okay I really don't like that
mounting mechanism but I guess I can't
complain it's not a good motherboard the
SSD house lied there's rails down here
yeah I'll probably put this in the rails
and wire it up later
power supply smells in there power
connects here fan is pointed up that's
longer we can breathe so pulls air in
down pushes out of course I'm going to
turn I'll talk about this in the final
methodology video but I need to figure
out which of these fans I want to turn
on for this test to create a sort of
real-world thing so we've got to 120s
here we have three up here I'll figure
out which ones we're gonna use during
the burnin and talked about in the next
video one thing here I don't want to I
don't want to put this in a normal case
because I want to access to be able to
probe this thing with like the
thermocouple reader an IR thermometer
and I want to really be able to see
what's happening and be able to interact
with it so that is one place we are
straying from what you would build in
the real world but it shouldn't really
matter to be honest so that's the setup
that's what we got I'm going to turn
this thing on and saw windows wire it up
to the power supply and see if we can
kill it over the course of a week so
check back this will be a multi-part
series as we check in on this thing and
perform sort of almost like checkups as
we go and see if anything's decayed or
performance is degrading I'll run FPS
tests every 12 to 24 hours and that
should pretty much sum it up so thank
