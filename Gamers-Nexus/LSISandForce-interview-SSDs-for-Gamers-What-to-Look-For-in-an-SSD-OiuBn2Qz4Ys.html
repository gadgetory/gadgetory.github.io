dotnet and we are here at the LSI
headquarters and i am with kent smith
today we're talking about SSDs and
controllers and Kent can you tell me a
little bit more about what our users
specifically gamers should be looking
for in SSDs especially when they're
looking at benchmarks you know there are
all these numbers published out there
what do they really care about what's
relevant to them ok that's a great
question there's a lot of reviews that
go into all sorts of details about the
SSD that you know in a lot of cases is
almost irrelevant for example a lot of
reviews will just look at pure synthetic
tests that don't tell you anything about
where the what's really happening in the
SSD when you're using it you know during
your gaming experience or whatever it is
you're doing and so it's it's important
that you look at more of the real world
benchmarking that puts the SSD in a
real-life situation it's making sure
it's got garbage collection operating
which is ninety-nine percent of the SSDs
life and so that real world benchmark is
going to be the the real evaluation and
the more the benchmark looks at a gaming
specific environment the better it's
going to be and it's you know it's
really that controller that you're
looking at you know a lot of people say
hey you know am I am i concerned about
the form factor am i concerned about the
color of the case you know if you are
that's great but most people aren't you
know I your game won't work any
different for those elements and so
what's really important is making sure
you understand what's the controller
inside of that SSD because the
controllers in charge of all the error
correction it's in charge of the flash
communication it's a it'll have a huge
impact on your right amplification it's
managing the over-provisioning you know
everything about your SSD is all managed
by that controller and so if you if you
are really concerned about what that SSE
is going to do you want to understand
what controller it's got okay well once
again here at LSI headquarters and this
is steve from gamers next
dotnet you can check out some links
below for more information on
controllers on all kinds of stuff write
amplification factor which we speak
speak about in another video that you'll
see after this and thanks again we'll
see you guys next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
