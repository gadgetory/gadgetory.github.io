at this point with the GTX 1660 and
during our trip the embargo for this
card will have list lifted so we'll
hopefully have a full review but in
addition to that we've got a tear down
of the first model we've seen which is
the EVGA gtx 1660 XC and this card
should be pretty straightforward so I
guess we'll just start with the
disassembly before that this video is
brought to you by the gigabyte ARS ad 27
QD gaming monitor the ad 27 qt is a
27-inch 1440p gaming display with 95% of
dcpip three color saturation for high
color accuracy accompanied by a one
millisecond response time 10 bit IPS
panel and display HDR visa certification
additional features include fluid
adjustment and slide RGB LEDs for
personal Flair and firmware features
like cooldown counters at reticles
and adaptive a noise reduction learn
more at the link below
typically on these you can just pull the
heatsink off separately without even
going through the smaller screws on the
back of the card but we'll see if those
need to come out for this one
it just depends on if there these are
often just connected to the base plate
and then the cooler itself might
separate but let's just try it first to
see if this can go easily I think we
might need to disconnect the rest of
those so let's go take out the smaller
screws on the outside so this card at
the time of filming this video I
actually have no idea how well it
performs but by the time the video goes
up we should have a review live in
theory which will have full benchmarks
versus the ti and whatever relevant AMD
cards are in the price point so this
card will be $250 and the reference card
will be 220 and then as far as a PCB
this should be a reference PCB with some
slight changes like the PCB length or
size then we need to get into the rest
to see details so this screw is just
held in with a nut on each side it's
gonna need a 5 mil hex for the DVI
alright there's our IO plate and IO this
should all separate I think all right so
there's the cooler this is actually
really similar to the 1660 Ti in some
ways the same cold plate where it's got
this sort of juts out at the edges same
koble as a 1660 ti we took apart still
three heat pipes that look like they are
ten millimeter heat pipes right through
the center where the GPU goes and let's
let's clean up the GPU a bit and see
what the labeling looks like tu 116 -
300 - a1 so just like with the tents or
the 20 60 and downward anybody has
gotten rid of that second demarcation
after the 300 and some of the cards
you'll see like a 300 a - a 1 the the a1
at the end here is just a revision
number but 300 a would have been used
for some of the higher end cards and
they've gotten rid of that where there's
a split between the GPU spec for the
high-end GPUs that have been a bit
higher many factions can pay more so
that's been gotten rid of for the lower
end cards and what we're looking at is
just the base plate and we can peel that
off at this point it's held on just by
thermal pads and by it looks like maybe
nope just thermal pads holding that in
the cooler expose the rest of the PCB so
there's the base plate this you know
it's got micron memory on it although
that may may vary and I think we have
some vrm specs as well but let me get
the rest of these thermal pads off just
so we can show it so there's your memory
if you are on up there at the top and
then for the vrm specs so it's a six
phase they're using 50 amp power stage
asleep there's NV VDD uses a UPI u p9 v
1 - R an NCP 3 0 to 155 which if I don't
know if we'll have build Zoid look at
these but if we do he'll talk about
those in more depth and then for I guess
we can talk about shrunk resistors
because we always do just to show if you
wanted to short them for some reason
it looks like there's just the one up
here then there should be one for PCIe
connector as well this is a very nice
one if you wanted to sort it although
it's probably not really worth it on
these low-end cards yes so that that
shunt resistor is going to go to the
PCIe cable thank you and then for the
rest we'll talk about other vrm specs if
we do any builds raid videos we can
cover it there but let us know in the
comments if you want one these low-end
cards sometimes we cover them sometimes
it's not really worth it because you
start getting into territory where a lot
of people just genuinely don't care
about the vrm quality if they're just
looking for more budget focused cards
but let us know if you're interested and
otherwise check the review for full
details again at time of filming I have
no idea what my opinion is on the 1660
as a GPU but we'll talk about it in the
review so thanks for watching as always
subscribe for more and I'll see you all
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
