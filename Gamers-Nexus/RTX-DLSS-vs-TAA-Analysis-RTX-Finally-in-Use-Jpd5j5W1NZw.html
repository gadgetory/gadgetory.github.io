first implementation of deep learn to
super sampling or DL SS but only in the
benchmark version not in the actual game
until just recently the last few days we
haven't been fond of the benchmark as a
standalone component because it is a bit
flawed ever since its release but the
game makes a much more sensible
comparison just recently the game
enabled DL SS an actual game play which
will leverage the RT X device tensor
cores and leverage some of that extra
technology that otherwise rests dormant
in common games today we're primarily
looking at DL s s versus taa
qualitatively comparing image fidelity
with some quantitative benchmarks for
performance numbers afterward because
the Final Fantasy 15 benchmark is
heavily controlled and flawed in other
ways and NVIDIA can also sample images
from a railroaded path its value is
limited and so now we turn toward real
gameplay for a better understanding of
what's happening before that this video
is brought to you by MSI's meg xiii 9d
ace motherboard which primarily offers
high frequency memory support for 40 500
megahertz kits and tight timings tuning
but also comes equipped with a 12 phase
V core vrm it ready for the 9900 K a
pre-installed IO shield and an infinity
mirror for RGB LEDs atop the left
heatsink
the RGB LED is synchronized with MSI's
mystic light to support RGB and rainbow
LED strips using the infinity mirror to
cascade lighting learn more at the link
in the description below the quick
version of what DL SS does is as follows
enabling DL SS and Final Fantasy 15
requires a 4k resolution which is
because it will render the game
effectively at 1440p then upscale it and
super sample it to reduce workload on
traditional shaders and migrate it to
the tensor cores instead and video uses
a supercomputer that works off of a
series of ground truth images from the
games developer all rendered at high
resolutions and with 64 samples per
pixel of anti-aliasing which is massive
the game then is used to deep learn what
the pixel values should be in each
scenario running through that
supercomputer the idea is brilliant to
strictly at a conceptual level as Nvidia
can then skip rendering some pixels on
the screen to instead infer their values
from neighboring pixels and base
upon that deep learned data it makes a
lot of sense if it can work because this
reduces the overall workload and allows
those shader units on the GPU to be used
for something else instead the actual
execution of this is still very new and
it's functionally in a beta phase
despite being available in a
commercially selling product finally
which would be Final Fantasy the LSS
will generally see easiest integration
into games that already supports
temporal anti-aliasing or taa and is
primarily marketed as a performance
uplift not necessarily as an image
quality uplift and on videos marketing
materials there's one paragraph that
suggests any kind of image quality
improvement with DL SS stating the
following using that basis for machine
learning we've created a new rendering
technique called deep learning super
sampling PLSS it boosts performance by a
significant degree can improve image
quality that's the key one here can
improve image quality and it's
anti-aliasing has better temporal
stability and image clarity compared to
commonly used taa techniques the
incorrect apostrophe at a possessive its
notwithstanding Nvidia says that DLS s
can improve image quality but keep in
mind that there are two forms of DL SS
so this is basically true just not
always there's DL SS as it's implemented
in Final Fantasy and then there's D LSS
2x which keeps the native render
resolution and then super samples
whereas the current implementation in
Final Fantasy is to reduce the render
resolution to 1440p from 4k and then
finish the rest of the processing our
opinion is that the more accurate naming
would be DLS 1/2 for Final Fantasy and
then DL SS for anything else it's
rendering at 1440p so it's it's not
exactly what you would expect regardless
the primarily marketed to use for the
technology is performance uplift by
reducing render resolution and migrating
anti-aliasing to auxilliary hardware
like tensor cores to free up shaders so
let's look at this from a qualitative
standpoint and see what the visual
differences are there are a few specific
areas in Final Fantasy 15 or DL SS is
most noticeable and those include
flickering and shimmering of thin
geometric elements at a distance one
example is
the fences in the background at the
starting gas station with DL SS on that
fence and it's thin bars flicker almost
as if the pixels are being translated as
we move and they even flicker when
standing still which is the most
noticeable pausing the game for instance
on a single frame still curiously
produces this flickering effect the
reason for this we think there are one
or two possible scenarios in one
scenario DL SS may be alternating at
which pixels it's skipping which becomes
noticeable when the camera stops moving
for a second or more in the other
scenario it could be that DL SS is using
a random seed generator for its solution
coming up with slightly different
answers to solve the pixel values each
time it calculates there is no real
necessarily definitive truth to what the
pixel value could be so this is a
possibility but we think that the former
is most likely as for the reason of why
this shimmering occurs to begin with
aside from potentially alternating the
sampling we can look toward text
resolution to better understand what's
happening on license plates and with
other objects that have text we see that
there's a slight blurring of the text
legibility and quality with DL SS
enabled the primary reason for this is
less to do with the resolution and more
to do with the available data from which
the tensor cores approximate the correct
values for missing pixels text has thin
lines and the surrounding colors of that
text like white in a license plate or
maybe black or blue on a sign background
are very important colors to ensuring
legibility and pop of the text in the
foreground in this instance some of
those thin blank spaces are being
misinterpreted by DL s s to be similar
colors to the text and its borders thus
producing a blurring effect that makes
the text appeared somewhat smeared
ultimately the importance of this side
effect will sort of depend on the games
you're playing and how you like to play
them for most games at blurring tacks on
something like a license plate really
isn't all that important although it is
an imperfection that is objectively
worst quality than the taa output at the
same resolution the value comes down to
performance what do you gain in exchange
for that and that's something we'll look
at at the end we'd be curious to hear
which of these two outcomes you prefer
in the comments below ignoring
performance how much does it matter to
you that the text is a little bit blurry
let us know hopefully it comes through
with YouTube's compression but we're not
sure how to look so you may need to see
it for yourself
telephone wires are another good point
of comparison for these taa nearly fully
erases the wires went in the far
distance leaving nothing there until the
player has closed in on the telephone
wires close up the wires with taa still
render and aren't too jagged when the
camera is it laterally still but side to
side or lateral movement will create a
hardened align until the camera
stabilizes on the horizontal axis D LSS
resolves the far distance telephone
wires as a flickering line with cables
darting in and out of existence
appearing jagged and heavily aliased the
LSS appears to make the wires jagged
when the players moving but smooths them
out pretty well when the player is still
this is contrary to other objects like
the light poles and fences in the gas
station parking lot you'll notice severe
flickering and the light fixture when
the camera is still but also that it
smooths out when moving the fence
flickers in a wave-like pattern when the
character is in motion and with taa the
fence does not flicker and the light
fixture presents the same both
stationary and in motion it there's
there's no flickering issue with taa
that's anywhere near what you're seeing
with the LSS both in motion and again
still this scene this next one is sort
of interesting we chose it because it's
complicated to render and it's a bit
different from the previous ones our
goal was to look at the shadows cast
upon the highway guide rails thinking
that the complexity of thin objects the
grass mixed with light and shadows of
thin objects would challenge up both taa
and D LSS both came out looking at
roughly the same which is good in a
performance bound scenario the solution
with the best performance went and
that's d LSS assuming the image quality
is the same and it is in this specific
scenario we do have to consider the
whole experience though because no one
really wants to toggle D LSS on and off
on a per scene basis seeing this image
equality between taa and D LSS is good
for the new technology although we did
notice one interesting difference and
that's the lights in the background if
you look in the back right you'll notice
the lights express more bloom with taa
than with DL SS we think that the bloom
would be applied after the super
sampling process in the post process
pipeline but it appears that the bloom
gets filtered out with DL SS enabled
you'll notice that the orange halo
around the lights disappears with DL SS
but looks more realistic and is bloom in
with taa whether or not that matters to
you again is going to be personal choice
one final example of small geometric
objects flickering includes the tent
ropes where DL SS produces observable
flicker for the most distant ropes in
the exact same way as in our other
examples before it this is because the
object isn't dense enough to sample and
accurately approximate the neighboring
pixel values thus producing some that
are the value of the background instead
of the value of the rope for taa we see
some slight flickering at the borders
but to a lesser degree than what was
seen with DL SS where you have some of
the rope just straight disappearing at
times for the most part the rest of the
scene looks about the same which is
important too perhaps more important
it'll come down to whether you can
overlook the flicker in favor of more
performance because the rest of the
scene is about identical character
models are probably the most important
thing to look at for this comparison
we're looking at a shopkeeper with taa
and with DL SS opposing one another
there are several changes within the
scene itself but let's first focus on
the shopkeepers face facial detail with
taa is higher with the face texture Cary
and more blemishes centered around the
cheekbones and the forehead
these small blemishes exist on the
texture and with DLS s they get smoothed
out and sampled over it's hard to see
but if you look closely and strictly at
the face you will see that some of those
finer details of skin color differing
for example do go away with the LS s we
end up removing all of that detail and
smoothing out the skin and the face to a
point of losing whole that extra realism
in the texture as before you have to
look pretty closely so whether or not
this matters is up to debate and it's
something that we'll have to let you
think about if you care about losing
this kind of detail as for the rest of
the background it looks like DL s s is
indirectly affecting the impact of
ambient
looking at the borders of objects in the
shade where ambient occlusion is the
most pronounced you'll see that DL SS
appears with reduced shadows overall
this is also true of the rivets behind
the shopkeeper where the shadows around
the edges diminished taa displays these
shadows more prominently and it's pretty
noticeable if you tab between them
quickly
another good quality comparison would be
character hair because it wouldn't be a
GN video without mentioning that this is
one area where D LSS and it's smoothing
effect actually helped with quality with
taa the hair models are more jagged and
missing some data you'll see some
flickering effect as the light pierces
through different parts of the hair
whereas D LSS moves everything out for a
better overall image this is where
NVIDIA statement of DL SS sometimes
being capable of higher quality proves
to be true for one more test with grass
and with turf FX enabled we noticed
minimal impact from enabling DL SS when
looking at the strands of grass overall
producing roughly similar experiences
between 4k taa and the LSS with distant
backgrounds like this shot of a hillside
a cliff and some trees we noticed that
taa had more detailed cliff face ain't
no with more defined faces on the
geometry while D LSS meanwhile appeared
to smear the output the trees atop the
hill also become muddy er with the LSS
when compared to taa
performance benchmarks come up next the
scenarios for quality are mixed some
show objective quality lost with DL SS
some are debatable and up to personal
preferences and one shows improvement
while many others are difficult to
detect we have to remain reasonable here
ultimately it is unlikely that you're
staring as closely as possible the
textures in the characters face we're
using a literal magnifying glass to see
differences without any upscaling
concerns in such situations the
qualitative comparison loses its value
as remember that people are actually
going to play this game not just look at
it and that noticing a lot of these
details is unlikely during play
flickering is the most noticeable issue
and the one that will most likely caused
frustration and be visible during real
game
and that's apparent in thin objects that
are prevalent in this game even the
entirety of a construction crane for
example was disappearing with DL SS and
for much the same reasons as the
powerlines work we have to turn to
performance to really call whether the
final detail differences like the NPC's
facial differences for example are worth
sacrificing for performance the
performance uplift could be more
noticeable than the loss of small detail
for instance we just ran the 2080 TI fe
for this one and we used an 88 e 6k at
five point one gigahertz for the CPU to
ensure the bottleneck is where it
belongs
it's our standardized GPU testbench you
can check previous videos and articles
for that we ran the highest settings
with all Nvidia's game works features
disabled except for turf works which we
used to render the tall grass and these
benchmarks we saw roughly a 21 percent
performance uplift with D LSS enabled at
4k which is again really a 1440p
upscaled and super sampled but if it
looks the same then well what's the
difference
we also ran taa at 1440p and saw
superior performance the D LSS and 4k
but we noticed that image quality was
measurably it worse in a side-by-side
comparison of a license plate for
example taa with 1440p resolution
produced a less legible plates than 4k
with TLS S which is 1440p up scaled so
you get why the comparisons there and
taa at 4k produced the most legible
outcome but had lower performance we
also measured roughly a 21 to 23 percent
performance uplift and built-in
benchmarks for final fantasy 15
tested with turf works disabled this
time putting gameplay in the benchmark
as scallion roughly equally with DLS s2
to each other so gameplay did actually
mirror the benchmark in this instance
which is good and videos DL SS is the
most promising aspect of our TX to date
although it still has some problems they
are not terrible
they don't ruin the technology
performance is improved yes but quality
does take a hit in several instances
flickering is the most egregious of the
offenses with the rest being sort of
subjective and a wash that comes down to
your own personal preferences and we
can't call those shots for you
to see flickery and resolve this nvidia
advances DLS s because that's the most
annoying out of all the changes as of
now we'd probably prefer to play Final
Fantasy with taa just to reduce that
flicker but the rest of the DL SS
execution isn't all that bad and is a
bit of a saving grace for RTX in its
initial implementation that's all for
