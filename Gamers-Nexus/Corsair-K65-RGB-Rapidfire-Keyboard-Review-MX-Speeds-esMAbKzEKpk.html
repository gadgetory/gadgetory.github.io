trend of 2016 following our Computex
coverage and it's pretty apparent there
everywhere you look now for better or
worse and course share was at the front
of this trend for peripherals back in
2014 at CES when they showcased their
first RGB LED switch for mechanical
keyboards and this was a timed exclusive
with cherry now cherry and Corsair have
teamed up to make the K 65
RGB rapid-fire keyboard which is just a
new MX speed switch so this is a brand
new switch type for mechanical keyboards
the keyboard the K 65 one specifically
is the one that we're reviewing today
there's also a new case 70 out also RGB
and then not to confuse things too much
for you but there's also Lux versions of
these keyboards so there's a K 65 Lux
which is also an RGB keyboard today
we're looking at the case 65 RGB
rapid-fire keyboard it is priced at $140
and the lux version which does not have
the MX speed switch but rather the sort
of normal Reds and other switches that
one is priced $10 cheaper so that's your
difference the rapid-fire one we're
looking at was reviewed by Michael
Kern's who works for the site you can
check out the review link in the
description below but we'll run through
the same stuff here so first of all
talking about switch types we've
actually made animations of the various
MX switch types you can see one here and
these just show how the Cherry MX and
sort of kale switch is work they're more
or less the same the new speed switch is
similar in all ways to the MX red switch
but has moved the actuation point and
changed actuation force the new MX speed
switch is exclusive to Corsair for about
six months and markets itself as a means
to enable competitive gamers the
actuation point is part of this as it is
one point two millimeters deep and
that's marginally different from a 2
millimeter depth of the MX Reds and is
exceedingly easy to press down as a
result and also as a result of its low
actuation force requirement combining
low actuation force and high actuation
depth
that the keys are pressed by axe and
almost constantly but we did eventually
get used to it and it's not so bad after
a few weeks just moving from one key to
the next though you are likely to graze
a neighboring key cap and gods input so
that can definitely be frustrating it's
not great for typing not great for
typists for article writers but it's
certainly similar to MX Reds in this
regard if you like MX Reds you might
like these if you dislike or hate MX
Reds the same is going to be true here
so there's all the speak of the MX speed
switches being better than MX Reds for
gaming coursers certainly pushing that
as an angle but what's the math behind
it we're talking point eight millimeters
here how much difference does that
realistically have for user input well
we can run through the math pretty
quickly let's take our two actuation
points MX Reds two millimeters and MX
speeds which is one point two
millimeters to determine the switch
input timing difference we've got to
make some assumptions let's start with
the assumption of a moving fingers speed
for gamers anyway and within any given
second we can assume that a gamer moves
their finger about 300 millimeters again
per second and that movement speed is
something we derive from Logitech's own
formulas when making assumptions and
doing testing so we are taking what
they've given us Logitech says they
asked me about 300 millimeters per
second that seems reasonable and is what
they used when doing math for the Romer
G switches so we're going to borrow that
assumption so 300 millimeters per second
that equates to 0.3 millimeters of
movement per millisecond if you divide 2
millimeters actuation depth by 0.3
millimeters per millisecond we come out
with 6.7 milliseconds to actuate a red
switch of course the millimeters cancel
out here in you're left with
milliseconds if you look at the speed
switch remember now we've got six point
seven milliseconds on the red speed
switch to 0.3 millimeters of movement
per millisecond so 1.2 actuation depth
divided by 0.3 both millimeters / or
percept per millisecond that equals
or milliseconds we've got a 2.7
millisecond difference at 300
millimeters per second the time to
actuate again 6.7 on the red switch then
4 speed switches so even with these
assumptions we've got a pretty good
number here but there's more to it still
than that other variables to consider
that muddy the advantage include
reaction times of the users so between
our staff Michael Kern's myself others
we've seen a reaction time of about 220
to 300 milliseconds on average depending
on the person and even assuming a
slightly better reaction time of 200
milliseconds that 2.7 millisecond
difference between the switches is
buried by human input variability that
doesn't even account for network delay
and other latency so I would wager
pretty fairly I think that almost all
users of this keyboard will not
realistically feel a difference between
the MX reds and the MX speed switches
that's not say there is no difference
certainly there is it is measurable it
exists is scientifically provable but
that doesn't mean you can feel it as a
user maybe as an eSports pro or some
high-level competitive player that's
certainly not me I'm not the right
person to talk about that but I would
say for the average to skilled player
you won't realistically feel the
difference between the two switches so
then the switches are a little squishy
like Red's they are easy to type with
and aren't ideal for folks doing a lot
of typing but might be fine for gaming
depending on the person let's talk about
key caps now the K 65 rapidfire uses the
same key caps as Corsairs strafe
keyboards which we previously reviewed
the font is a block here and more gamer
II and its aesthetic but this does have
some function as it allows more light to
bleed through from the LED backlight the
key caps are ABS plastic and form the
legend by a simple absence of paint
where the light should bleed through and
this is pretty standard courser includes
textured WASD key caps for users with
strong personal preferences for such
things but otherwise sticks to fairly
standard key caps in general now I say
in general
because there's one place that coarser
doesn't use standard key caps and it
drives me a little bit crazy because I'm
not sure why they don't sure there's
some kind of reason but I don't think
it's a great one so here's here's what's
going on the bottom row does not use
standard key cap sizes and this has been
true of previous Corsair keyboards like
the strafe and it's probably a pretty
uncommon thing but mechanical keyboards
are definitely a sort of enthusiast
collector market in some regard there's
a lot of really a lot of big drive
behind the technology and mechanical
keyboard is a lot of interest in it end
to that end it would make sense to stick
with some standards to enable these sort
of enthusiast functions and one of those
is replacing the key caps if you want
different keys or if something goes
wrong and you want to replace the key
caps totally legitimate for both of
those use cases bottom row is not
standard if you go on one of the
websites that sells custom key caps or
you want to customize your own key cap
set the standard bottom row will not
work on the case 65 RGB rapid-fire
keyboard the others will work fine the
bottom row you're out of luck so we pick
grudged course here for this in the past
it hasn't changed I don't know that it
will but this is one of the very few
points on this keyboard that I would
like to see some improvement and it's
really not that big of a change once
Corsair obviously starts working on
future products now it's not going to
change on this product line it's not
going to change on anything that uses
the same tooling as this product line
but it's not like some sort of low-level
technological change as was the case
with the sixteen point eight million
color fiasco from a while back which is
now resolved by the way but enough on
switches and key cabs let's talk
lighting
now that courser has resolved that
flickering issue with RGB lighting the K
65 rapid-fire enters the market as one
of the most customizable keyboards
available and we do not say that lightly
in fact it's got some of the most
customizable RGB LEDs we've seen
anywhere period and that's a good thing
for Corsair in this competitive market
there's even got a full csgo suite of
lighting to match different skins from
the games Gunz Asimov and others they've
got complete program ability and use
Corsair utility engine or queue to
enable that customization further
courser is able to front
this advanced lighting presence because
they don't store the lighting to the
keyboard like most other peripheral
makers do this means that you can't move
your profile from one system to another
simply by moving the keyboard
unfortunately but you can still export
the profile through queue and then
import it to a new system so there is
still profile management and movement if
necessary but it's not as simple as just
moving the board instead of supporting
that instant mobility courser has opted
for more intense software control local
file storage on the system and then that
applies profiles with pretty deep
customization options to the keyboard
and it looks really good when it's
working so we'd like to see Q improve in
a few ways one of those is by allowing
full keyboard profiles to apply to tkl
or ten keela's keyboard since all they'd
have to do is basically cut off some
keys but updates are still forthcoming
so maybe we'll see that in the future
build quality of the case xt 5 RGB
rapid-fire is good it is sturdy it's got
a metal backplate and no bezel up around
the keys like seen on for instance
Logitech keyboard so I like that look
and feel if you don't that's that's up
to you but in terms of the sturdiness it
is definitely a sturdy keyboard it's got
a pretty rigid backplate so when typing
there's absolutely no flex detected I
mean it's it's it's a sturdy keyboard
but it does lack in a few ways the
strafe was really somewhat of a
masterpiece when we looked at its
internals and the new K 65 rapid fire
does deter a little bit from that range
I wouldn't use that word for it it's
still good but there are some sloppy
solder points and things like that there
is a stray a surface mount diode that
was out of place where switch and was
connected with a thin wire to a nearby
trace so it's really it's not terrible
you're not going to see these things but
it is lower quality than we've seen from
cores in the past in some very specific
and nitpicky ways the board does use
that metal backplate at least though so
it is a sturdy board at its foundation
now here's another thing worth note
courser does that sort of push this idea
almost like a German carmaker would do
and I'm not going to name names but I'm
sure most do you know who I'm talking
about coarser pushes the same angle of
sort of quality over all else and this
idea of quality is it's a good marketing
approach but there it feels like there
needs to be more backing it up so when I
say that I mean the new keyboard it does
push that quality feel it's expensive
it's got this prestige about it but it's
got a 2 year warranty and competitors in
the market including thermaltake with
the really pretty cheap poseidon Zekey
board with kale switches they've got a 5
year warranty and yes I know that sort
of the response from Corsair may be well
it's cheaper so they can afford to do
that and it's probably going to break
anyway but in response to that I would
say of course there's really pushing
quality as one of its main selling
points and - they're using cherry
switches which are also pushed as this
sort of high quality component and in
that regard I would like to see a bit
more confidence behind the warranty but
it is what it is hopefully it just
doesn't break anyway I mean two years is
still reasonable for pretty much
everyone
so regardless the keyboard is good
overall it's $140 it's certainly steep
but it's not unfair it's competitive
within the market that it fights in the
MX speed switch version is 10 bucks more
than the lux RGB version with the normal
cherry switches the MX Reds and
what-have-you because they're all cherry
switches but so ten dollars more I would
not recommend spending that $10 for the
MX speed switches they are just they're
almost identifiably different in terms
of your actual in-game outputs or inputs
as it may be so I wouldn't buy on the
idea that the speed switches will make
you a better gamer I don't buy into that
for this particular device some devices
sure I would say buying a good Mouse
would make you a better gamer than a $5
Microsoft Mouse with a ball
this is not one of those instances it's
it's getting a little bit low level and
I don't think you'll really feel that
switch in your everyday use now that's
okay because if you really like this
keyboard the $10 cheaper version is the
same thing with a different switch that
performs more or less the same so that's
certainly an option now if you don't
like this or you want to look at your
alternatives I would recommend the look
into the Logitech G 9 10
that's the whatever they call it a Rhine
spark or whatever their silly naming is
now look into that one it's similarly
expensive but good and has a unique
switch in it
there's the g8 10 if you want something
smaller and less bulky and then outside
of Logitech and course here there's the
Razer chroma for an RGB keyboard it's
got sort of that mirrored finish and
then Corsair zone strafe keyboard we
liked a lot and I would really in some
ways I would recommend over this one but
it just it depends on what you're going
for so do keep that in mind now we like
the K 65 well enough the MX speed
switches I think are needlessly
aggressive on their marketing that they
push this competitive advantage when
really there's kind of not one unless
you're insanely serious gamer and if you
are more power to you buy it but those
are my thoughts that's more or less what
