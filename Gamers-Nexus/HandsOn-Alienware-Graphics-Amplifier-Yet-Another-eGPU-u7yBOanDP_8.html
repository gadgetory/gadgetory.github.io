nexus tonight here at CES 2015 we're at
intel's booth right now what we're
looking at is an external graphics card
enclosure similar to the msi gs-13
except a bit different in that it is
using a proprietary connector that goes
straight into alienware laptops this is
available on all of alien or laptops but
you will not be using it on other
laptops that don't use this proprietary
form factor it is a pci express box but
it does not use by 16 so you're not
getting the full bandwidth potential
that's okay because we're limited anyway
and in your point I can use it with most
modern video cards so this opens up in
the front it looks like we've got either
92 millimeter or 80 millimeter fan for
the cooling it pushes the air through
cools it's sort of like a wind tunnel
and hosts the video card fits full
length video cards 11 inches no problem
and it's got a power supply that's four
hundred and sixty watts so you can power
pretty much any video card on the market
right now including it overclocking and
definitely no problem with that so this
is called the graphics amplifier it is
by alienware it uses a proprietary
interface available for 299 300 dollars
for just the box and then with the
laptop it's it's a bit more expensive
obviously so the box is able to pipe the
graphics back to the laptop so for your
video card you can actually output to
the display natively on the laptop you
don't need the monitor as displayed here
though obviously if you're going through
this effort then why not so again that's
the illinois graphics amplifier check
the link in the description below for
MSI's GS 30 which is similar and we'll
see you all next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
