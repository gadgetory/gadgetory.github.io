hardware news recap this is probably one
of the the last news episodes we'll be
filming for the year but it's got some
pretty fun items for example if you're a
fan of Internet Service Providers which
everybody is shorter the company that
operates the spectrum just got slapped
with a 174 million dollar settlement so
that might be some good news for the end
of the year to make you a bit happy and
if that's not enough nann prices could
be going down by about 10 percent in
2019 which will affect as the steep
prices but there's not all good news and
these losing more talent and then RGB
software has opened attack vectors for
malware suitable before that this video
is brought to you by US and the gamers
access store you can go to store it on
cameras nexus net to pick up one of our
ceramic mugs critically acclaimed mod
mats or educational video card tear down
and PCB Anatomy posters that teach the
names and placements of all the key PCB
components learn more at store des
cameras XS net or click the link below
let's start with the good news and that
will move to the the really good news
which is the chartered fine or
settlement so the good news first
nande prices we've already seen sharp
decline in SSD prices for the latter
half of this year it's been pretty good
for the SSD market overall despite the
RAM market for most of the year being on
a sharp incline for price so SSDs if you
hadn't noticed around Black Friday they
were 120 850 bucks for a pretty decent
one terabyte SSD which up until this
year was more or less impossible to find
on something that was reliable that's
continuing though DRAM exchange which is
one of the most reliable predictors for
market prices and they have actual costs
pricing to not just consumer pricing but
cost to manufacturers DRAM exchange
predicts that prices could continue to
decline in early 2019 and that's thanks
to bit output being higher than
anticipated for 2018 manufacturers have
also seen a steady implementation of 64
layer yield or they've seen their yields
for 64 layer nand increase which is good
and there's been more sluggish demand
than expected in other segments of the
flash market which in this instance
benefits us because it drives down cost
typically with a dram you might see some
some kind of maybe artificial artificial
limitations of the supply but this all
has led to the market being an
oversupply currently and that oversupply
is expected to intensify in first
quarter 2019 so DRAM exchange expects
that client SSD markets will fall by as
much as 10% and this is as demand grows
more sluggish over time even among the
increase in SSD adoption rate for
desktop computers DRAM exchange also
cites the ongoing china-us trade
situation and the Intel CPU shortage and
then week notebook shipments along with
slow sales of the new iPhone all being
key areas that are affecting the NAND
pricing and output leading to oversupply
and pretty much all of those
aforementioned sectors so down news here
if you're if you're an Andy fan and he
continues to lose talent we've been
covering this sort of Andy brain drain
over the last couple weeks now but for
most of the year Andy's been cycling and
new people specifically into the RTG
team the Radeon graphics group and the
CPU side has been doing well overall
hasn't been too much turn over there and
rise ins obviously been a great change
for Andy but RTG has been struggling a
bit for for talent in the last year
just recently andy lost a former
reviewer damien trio leigh and lost him
to Intel they of last year around this
time lost Raja Kaduri to Intel Chris
hooked to Intel and so forth this time
it's Mike gray field buddy's not going
to Intel so Mike gray field announced
his retirement from the company Rayfield
served as the senior vice president and
general manager of RTG Rayfield also
headed up the group after Roger Kaduri
laughs for Intel and has been as
replacements since Andy released the
following statement saying mike is
retiring at the end of the year he made
the decision to spend more time with his
family and pursue personal passions
David Wayne will be the interim lead for
Radeon technologies group while we
finalized search for a new business
leader and unlike others it seems like
ray field hasn't been poached by Intel
although as a note Tom's Hardware
further reports
Rayfield is not actively seeking
employment so this is more of an
instance of just genuinely stepping out
but they're gonna replace him at some
point we'll try and keep you updated on
who that may be
does AMD needs to bring on some some
people on the GPU architecture side or
the SVP side charter this one's a
there's a good uplifting story so
Charter was slapped with a one hundred
and seventy four point two million
dollar settlement by New York and some
time back we reported on charter which
operates spectrum formerly Time Warner
Cable being booted out of the state of
New York for fraudulent activity so
fraudulent claims and poor customer
service were cited in the initial
lawsuit brought against charter by the
state of New York and the Attorney
General and this is an ongoing lawsuit
that was well it's originally when we
reported on this may be called months
ago this story was you're getting kicked
out of New York and that's evolved too
you're getting kicked out of New York
unless as we understand it you pay these
fines and implement these service
changes that are very significant and if
you haven't been paying attention to
this one spectrum or charter whatever
has agreed to pay a hundred seventy four
point two million dollars in settlement
and it's a record for any ISP in terms
of customer payouts which is good they
can still probably afford more but it's
a good first step so the settlement will
see charter pay 75 to 150 dollars each
and refunds to customers and which well
I guess you could take what you get at
this point and that's in addition to
customers receiving free premium
channels and streaming services for the
hooded Time Charter will also have to
reframe the way they market their
services and this is the bigger deal
here so marketing for example needs to
no longer be fraudulent and incorrect
has to actually be based in reality and
also marketing services now they are
required to say that they're wired for
the speeds that are wired and that
Wireless may be variable of course and
also have to perform routine speed tests
as an audit and report them back
attorney Jen
all barbara de Underwood had this to say
in a statement about the lawsuit quote
not only is this the largest ever
consumer payout by an Internet service
provider returning tens of millions of
dollars to New Yorkers who were ripped
off and provided an additional streaming
and premium channels as restitution but
also sets a new standard for how
internet providers should fairly market
their services and Charter was penalized
for a few things but the chief among
them was quote defrauding Internet
subscribers and they'll be paying out
sixty two point five million dollars
directly to customers as restitution
with the difference being split in two
mandated free services for customers
different kind of thoughts on that in a
moment
Charter was under requirement also to
bring higher speed internet to the state
of New York failed to deliver on that
promise and then fraudulently marketed
their services to promote things that
were never provided and that's where the
lawsuit started the Attorney General
stated quote fulfill your promises were
pay the price noting that this is a
quote wake-up call for ISPs the
restitution is listed on the AG's
website for customers and is required
for the following infractions one
leasing and inadequate modem two leasing
an inadequate wireless router three
subscribing to a Time Warner Cable
legacy speed plan of 100 megabits per
second or higher then they have a couple
of other infractions listed on that site
as well
so if you want something for to uplift
your spirits maybe you don't
particularly like Time Warner Cable or a
spectrum then I would encourage you to
read the AG's posting because it'll
probably probably leave you a bit happy
after that so spectrums gonna be paying
out now we'll see what happens
one issue that that we kind of have with
the free premium services is that some
of them are free channels for a month so
more free channels for three months
ultimately what's gonna happen is people
are gonna like that service that
something I subscribed to it so probably
like usual the ISPs going to end up in a
better situation than where they started
despite having to pay millions of
dollars and fines but it's a start so
we'll take it where we can get it and
you can check the AG website for more on
that next up TSMC to build a facility
for three nanometer semiconductor
manufacturing as Taiwan news reports
TSMC has been clear
through China's EPA to begin
construction on a new facility that will
primarily focus on three a nanometer
fabrication this is a nineteen billion
dollar project that is slated to begin
in 2022 at present and the three
nanometer fab will occupy the same
vicinity as TSM sees five nanometer site
and currently that is under construction
so they'll have a few projects going at
once the five nanometer site is expected
to be up and running in about a year at
this point maybe maybe a year and a half
and the the three nanometer site will be
in 2022 so allegedly in order to swing
the Chinese EPA on the project tsmc made
a few concessions and among those tsmc
vowed that the site will be renewable or
more renewable than most in terms of
energy tsmc stated that the new fab will
use 20 percent renewable energy and will
use 50 percent recycled water for its
silicon fabrication of water is a pretty
big cost in these fabrication facilities
and then finally this one well this is a
bit of an i-told-you-so moment about RGB
RGB software which we are of course
massive fans of as you've seen over the
years that's that's not true if you're
new here RGB software opening up attack
vectors if you remember spectra and melt
down and how profound those
vulnerabilities were the same team that
worked on discovering some of those
Google's project zero turned its
attention towards software for
peripherals it's a bit of a bit of a
step down in terms of achievements from
the biggest known exploit ever to affect
silicon but it's still an important one
because RGB is the next biggest
infectious disease that has affected the
industry so first reported by Google's
project zero there's a critical flaw in
Logitech options the software is called
that allows hackers to gain remote
access through the software by opening
an unauthorized WebSocket port and the
vulnerability was reported to logitech
back in September as part of Google's
security teams policies they reveal
these exploits to the companies first
and then publicly later logitech hasn't
well they just implemented a fix so they
hadn't until now and after the
vulnerability was made public is when he
saw that update so if you're using that
software you should download the update
because otherwise you're at risk of a
security vulnerability additionally
secure auth found vulnerabilities in
seven drivers affecting Asus and
gigabyte motherboards software the
vulnerability is according to secure
auth and their research will allow two
attackers to gain escalated permissions
they will allow them to take control of
the system and run non trusted code and
according to the report communication
with ACS and gigabyte has been less than
fruitful and many of the vulnerabilities
remain unaddressed can't say we're
surprised about that but if you think
about it though from a serious
standpoint RGB software by and large
already has access to Hardware it's got
permissions to do pretty much anything
that wants to do in your system at a low
level and so that is a very smart vector
to exploit as an attacker because it's
probably not that secure it's not like
it's windows or Intel and it's it's
probably widespread and it has access to
hardware so key loggers would be a good
example of something that might be a
concern there so anyway if you have any
of that software annoy them on Twitter
and see if maybe they'll fix it but
otherwise those are unaddressed and
Logitech has fixed it's a lot of options
so that's good to see
one last news item we're shoving in here
at last last minute here because it's in
the middle of working on the Titan RT
extra view when we got news that now a
PC perspective which recently lost
editor-in-chief and found a Ryan trout
to Intel now it looks like Alan mal
ventano and Ken Addison are leaving PC /
as well for Intel's work in Ryan's team
so just wanted to include that because
pc / has been one of the the leading
technical publications in the space that
has remained bound to primarily written
articles but they've had a podcast as
well and Alan is has been one of the
leading storage reviewers in the entire
industry as far as we're concerned he
was our primary go-to source for storage
questions
ssds or otherwise ken had taken over for
Ryan after Ryan departed from PC per
couple about a month or two ago so it's
interesting PC / will be now placing
sebastian peak as editor-in-chief were
not familiar with Sebastian's work to
the extent as the other folks who have
left PC / but we wish him luck there and
we just wanted to point out that it
looks like int Intel strategy of media
relations is just to hire the entire
organization but so yeah Ryan Allen and
Ken best of luck to all of you in your
new role at Intel new roles at Intel and
Sebastian best of luck to you at PC /
and for anyone who might be starting to
think I'm not going anywhere so don't
worry about that but that's it for this
one so as always you can go to Stuart I
can razaaq's at net to help us out
directly if you want to pick up
something like the shirt I'm wearing or
you can go to patreon.com/scishow and
Nexus tops out there as well subscribe
for more will have Titan reviews coming
up shortly that you were watching I'll
see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
