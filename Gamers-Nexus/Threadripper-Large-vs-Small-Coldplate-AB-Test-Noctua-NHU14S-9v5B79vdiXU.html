the rest we're just doing an a/b
comparison of cold plate size as it
applies to thread Ripper and thermal
testing on thread refer using two Noctua
n hu 14s coolers one of which is a TR
for addition with the full-coverage cold
plate and the other one has an LGA 11 5
X cold plate all were looking at is cold
plate size impact on thermal performance
before getting to that this video is
brought to you by synergy the software
that lets you share a keyboard and mouse
between multiple systems if you have
limited desk space and multiple
computers to command that synergy
removes the need for separate
peripherals or a KVM and works as over
the network software use our link below
to get 50% off the basic or pro version
this testing took some modding these are
both air coolers and they're also the
only coolers we presently have where
it's the same cooler at the heart of it
with only one difference being the cold
blade so we do a proper AV comparison so
the LGA 1150 xcolor the much smaller
cold plate size only really contacts the
middle it doesn't even contact all of
the dies all the way across this is
worse than the closed loop liquid cooler
coverage which at least those cover the
entire die exposure area if not the
entire i HS so you at least get heat
away from the dies on those but with
this one because it's not built for
thread ripper it obviously doesn't cover
the whole thing probably covers about
the middle to bottom corner of each of
the four modules two of which are active
and that's it so it's going to be hotter
but we are serious we want to see what
the impact was the full plate so
basically we took the mounting hardware
for this one the spreader pro on which
is pretty clear by that and took that
off of there moved it over here drilled
some holes so that the mounting hardware
would support screws going through into
the the cold plate of this one the LGA
one and we're able to get some screws
today to hold it in place also added
rubber dampers here to provide
opposition as it's being mounted and
make sure that there's enough mounting
force and once it's all said and done
and the coolers tightened down it
doesn't move at all it's got the same
mounting pressure as this thing does
because using the same mounting
kit and there's a rubber bumper there
that means that we're actually applying
downward force where it needs to be
applied everything's good
the only thing that's not good is the
cold blade size so that's what we're
testing we're looking at these results
with a it's Navy comparison the same
heatpipes same thin stack everything the
heat pipes are the same distance apart
that's one note about this cooler is
because they basically took an existing
design and added a bigger cold plate to
it you're looking at a situation where
it could certainly be optimized more but
to do that in time for launch was
probably not feasible and might have
cost too much for the volume they're
expecting to sell so Noctua has a heat
pipe design that's basically identical
to this one where the heat pipes don't
fully contact the entire cold plate of
this unit so it's not optimal but it
might still be good enough we're not
really here to review the cooler today
we are here to look at the cold plate
difference but that does help control
our variables of it so we've even got
the same heat pipe layout as this one
that's pretty interesting and it's not
contacting the entire cold plate so it's
not going to transfer as well so hence
the question of does it still do better
with just that cold plate change for
testing we're doing two prime95 was way
too abusive on the LGA 1150 x cooler
it was throttling like crazy so we just
didn't know what temperature would
actually be hitting the CPU that is with
prime running it was too much for this
candle and so you look at a difference
where you're hitting the thermal cap and
one not the other it's not really
realistic difference so we threw out
prime for this we end up using handbrake
and blender because those were less
intensive than prime still intensive in
real workloads handbrake ended up being
a bit better for the Swan blender was
still kind of getting into throttled
territory but handbrake was pretty free
and clear of that and that's what we're
testing the clock rate and voltages were
both fixed they were set manually so
there's no turbo boosting there's no
change of the voltage or anything like
that and we'll have those numbers
specifically in the article link of the
description below if you'd like to see
those numbers so let's get on with
results these charts are pretty simple
with handbrake transcoding one of our
videos for 30 minutes the CPU reaches
steady state and produces a temperature
delta of eleven saltiest between
to the tr4 cold blade is heavily
advantaged in this particular task
keeping to around 57 Celsius versus the
nearly throttling LGA 1150 xq ler
threader per throttle that 68 C T die or
95 c TC TL t control the idle Delta is
2.8 Celsius favoring the TR for cold
blade moving on to blender our load
delta is about 10.5 Celsius once again
producing a favorable results for the TR
for cooler might be a bigger temperature
difference here than we can see because
we were starting to clock throttle on
the LGA 1150 unit they could all be
different but interesting because
channel design could impact the
efficiency of a solution for example a
full-coverage liquid block here if you
pull an older design the channeling is
going to be optimized for a die in the
center of the IHS one die liquid flows
over that die through some gaskets and
out the other way whereas with this
setup because you've got two sets of
active dies in opposing corners a more
optimized channel layout may be
beneficial now once you're under liquid
does it really matter probably not a lot
for most users because again once you're
already under liquid like with the X 62
it's just kind of difficult to make the
thing heat up enough to be relevant even
with overclocking it really temperature
was not a concern with Red River but
there's still room to optimize all these
things those rooms optimize this because
again the heat pipes could come out some
more get some better spread over the
cold plate and the rest of the cooler
but it shuts the question up doesn't do
well enough as is so this is one a
review of this thing of the Nhu 14s I
think it's called yes TR for addition
not a review that we're not doing
comparative data versus other coolers
all we're doing is what's the cold blade
difference so the next thing to look at
would probably be added a cold plate TLC
design for the you're looking at the
kind of mid coverage ace attack design
versus the Apollo tech one coming out
from animatics we've got a full cold
plate but is the pump actually covering
that entire area is there actually are
there liquid channels through that
entire area or is just a white or a
copper footprint so what we looking at
that eventually just whenever they come
in I don't have them
