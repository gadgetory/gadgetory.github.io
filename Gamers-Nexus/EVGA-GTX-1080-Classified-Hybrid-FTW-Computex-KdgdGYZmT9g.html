EVGA suite and now we're looking at some
of the new 10 80s and 10 70s from EVGA
so we've got the classified which is
this massive one there's an FTW which is
off-screen actually an SC and then the
hybrid which I'm just gonna say we built
one of these but this one does look a
lot better so before we get into that
all this coverage is brought to you by
MSI and the new x99 motherboards for
Broadwell II so let's talk about the
classified first this one is the obvious
monster of the group it is priced to be
determined the power set up is to 8 pins
pretty crazy
and this actually plugs into the top of
it this is a power link and all this
does is power management or cable
management stuff so you plug that in the
top and then it routes the cables out
the side instead of at the top so if
you're crazy about cable management
that's really all that does power phases
it's a 14 plus 3 phase setup so it's
three phases for the memory 14 for the
core vrm and that makes it the most
extreme vrm we've looked at so far this
show power to 8 pins on the top gives
you somewhere the 250 300 range again
maybe a little more and there is a
custom v bios that we're not sure on the
voltage limitations right now we'll have
to attach that later classified again is
price TBD the ftw which is off screen
here is a 10 plus 2 face setup and is
actually basically the same card as in
this hybrid so when I talk about FTW in
hybrid they're pretty much the same spec
except for the liquid cooler which is
the important part of course and that's
a 10 plus 2 phase it's got an extra
power header on top as well just like
the classified does and that gives you
more room in theory for overclocking as
long as the voltage is more flexible
than reference and then the hybrid card
has the ACE attack cooler on it so it's
got a nice deck cooler down here on the
core cables route out through the top of
the shroud and the shroud is the updated
metal shroud from EVGA that shipped
after the initial launch of the 980ti
hybrid so that in terms of thermals we
have actually tested this I can talk
about it now we were seeing about an 18
degrees Celsius Delta ambient or Delta
versus ambient temperature for the
hybrid card on the 1080 and
as opposed to 50 something 53 I think
Celsius maybe 54 for the reference 1080
is a pretty big difference there and
definitely helps with the thermal
throttling we were seen on the clock
rate at certain temperatures and with
certain games the SC card is this one
here this is the cheaper card it's a 100
megahertz offset from the reference
version of the 1080 and that gives you a
bit higher clock rate but it's cheaper
so it sells at 650 this is one of the
only ones we have a price on 650 for
this that puts it below $50 below
reference and it's the only difference
really is the a CX 3.0 cooler it still
got the normal 8 pin power header
there's no extra header on there and
it's pretty standard card the a CX 3.0
updates will post in the article linked
in the description below but the main
one is the heat pipes of the Capri heat
pipes usually have a small gap around
them because they're round and so that
small gap has been filled in by a copper
or similar metal to help improve thermal
conductivity around the perimeter of the
heat pipes the FTW 1080 is priced at 680
dollars that's 650 that's TBD this is
TBD and then we've got this which is
also a TBD price but it's got the ECX
3.0 cooler it's an S C version so
basically reference but probably cheaper
and a better cooler definitely so that
sums up EVGA is sweet here at Computex
2016 as always it more information
