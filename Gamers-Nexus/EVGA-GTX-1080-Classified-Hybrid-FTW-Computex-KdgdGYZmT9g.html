EVGA sweet and now we're looking at some
of the new 1080s and 10 70s from EVGA so
we've got the classified which is this
massive one there's an FTW which is
off-screen actually an SC and then the
hybrid which I'm just going to say we
built one of these but this one does
look flat Petter so before getting to
that all this coverage is brought to you
by msi and the new x99 motherboards for
broad well II so let's talk about the
class white first this one is the
obvious monster of the group it is a
price to be determined the power setup
is 28 pins pretty crazy and this
actually plugs into the top of it this
is a power link and all this does is
power management or cable management
stuff so you plug that in the top and
then it routes the cables out the side
instead of at the top so if you're crazy
about cable management that's really all
that does power phases it's a 14 plus
three phase setup so it's three phases
for the memory 14 for the core vrm and
that makes it the most extreme vrm we've
looked at so far this show power 28 pins
on the top gives you some where the 250
300 range again maybe a little more and
there is a custom v bios that we're not
sure on the voltage limitations right
now we'll have to attach that later
classified again is price TBD the FTW
which is off screen here is a 10 plus to
face setup and is actually basically the
same card as is in this hybrid so when I
talk about FTW and hybrid they're pretty
much the same spec except for the liquid
cooler which is the important part of
course and that's a 10 plus 2 phase it's
got an extra power header on top as well
just like the classified does and that
gives you more room in theory for
overclocking as long as the voltage is
is more flexible than reference and then
the hybrid card has the ASA tech cooler
on it so it's got an ace tech cooler
down here on the core cables route out
through the top of the shroud and the
shroud is the updated metal shroud from
EVGA that shipped after the initial
launch of the 980 TI hybrid so that in
terms of thermals we have actually
tested this I can talk about it now we
were seeing about an 18 degrees Celsius
Delta ambient
Delta vs ambient temperature for the
hybrid card on the 1080 and that's as
opposed to 50 something 53 I think
Celsius maybe 54 for the reference 1080
it's a pretty big difference there and
definitely helps with the thermal
throttling we were seen on the clock
rate at certain temperatures and with
certain games the SC card is this one
here this is the cheaper card it's a 100
megahertz offset from the reference
version of the 1080 and that gives you a
bit higher clock rate but it's cheaper
so it sells at 650 is one of the only
ones we have a price on 654 this that
puts it below fifty dollars below
reference and it's the only difference
really is the AC x3 point 0 cooler it
still got the normal 8 pin power header
there's no extra head around there and
it's pretty standard card that AC x3
point O updates will post the article
linked in the description below but the
main one is the heat pipes of the copper
heatpipes usually have a small gap
around them because they're round and so
that small gap has been filled in by a
copper or similar metal to help improve
thermal conductivity around the
perimeter of the heat pipes the FTW 1080
is priced at six hundred and eighty
dollars that's 650 that's TBD this is
TBD and then we've got this which is
also a TBD price but it's got the ECX
three-point Oh cooler it's an SC version
so basically reference but probably
cheaper and a better cooler definitely
so that sums up EVGA is sweet here at
computex 2016 as always more information
