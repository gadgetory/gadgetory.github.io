the increased memory bandwidth of Radeon
seven is a bit of a challenge few games
will genuinely use more memory than
what's found on an RT X 2080 let alone
these 16 gigabytes on Radeon 7 and most
vram capacity utilization reporting is
wildly inaccurate as it only reports
allocated memory not necessarily the
used memory some applications will
allocate more than they ever used for
instance and that's what windows task
manager GBC will show you two best
benchmarks the potential advantages of
Radeon seven which would primarily be
relegated to memory bandwidth we set up
targeted feature tests still looking at
gaming to look at anti-aliasing and high
resolution benchmarks consider this an
academic exercise on Radeon 7s
capabilities before that this video is
brought to you by Thermaltake score p3
case the core p3 is one of the most
unique cases on the market it can serve
as an open-air standing chassis a test
bench in vertical or horizontal
orientation or as a wall-mounted
showcase PC the core p3 now comes with a
5 millimeter thick tempered glass panel
for its slide but keeps the front top
and back open for air the core p3
versatility as a display piece test
bench or standard desktop is reinforced
by its price of roughly 110 dollars on
Amazon you can learn more at the link in
the description below so I stayed an
academic exercise here what that means
is that we're going to be regularly
exiting real-world use cases to just
better look at how does the card scale
how does it scale versus an RT X 2080
it's totally irrelevant what the frame
rate is ultimately at 8k resolution
because you can't play at 8 K with
either device so even with really low
settings so that's why we call this
academic exercise it's just it's it's
looking at what can happen in scaling
but not necessarily what's usable for
you so what we're looking at here is
some unplayable scenarios in a lot of
cases although some are playable 8k
resolutions included just to see if
scaling improves over AMD or Nvidia I
mean if we see for example a 10%
difference where Nvidia might hold the
10% lead in one particular
new 4k does that gap close does it
become zero percent or three percent if
we switch to AMD at say while 8k
resolution as it can an example so
another thing that we can do here is in
theory test anti-aliasing this is
something that Andy indicated should be
a bit advantaged on the Radeon card and
that makes sense logically anyway so if
we change anti-aliasing where you take
multiple samples per pixel typically 2 X
4 X 8 X 16 X so forth or sometimes
called tap to tap it could have a
similar performance impact to just
increase in the resolution it's really
the same idea hits the same part of the
pipeline so if am these memory bandwidth
really benefits and in games what we
would hypothesize would happen would be
a diminishing or reversing performance
Delta between the 20 80 and Radeon 7
that anti-aliasing increases as we make
it more difficult if we increase the
resolution things like that so we
already demonstrated how the Radeon 7
card can sometimes close the gap at
higher resolutions when we posted our
review and we talked about how the gap
like an f1 2018 would widen at 1080p and
we can show some of those charts again
now though of course check the review
for fold these help but looking through
those charts again at 4k the gap is a
bit better in some of these games for
Radeon favoring Radeon or at least
minimizing the difference and then you
see again at 1440p it starts to widen
but it's still reasonably favorable at
1080p that gap really starts to widen
where Nvidia pulls ahead and a couple of
the games we tested and that's just
because no longer is it the case that
the HBM is really being leveraged in a
way that's meaningful because at 1080p
your just not hitting the memory quite
as hard as at 4k so this is where we can
start looking at other scenarios cue in
mind that the obvious downside as we
enter territory where the content is
unplayable at the framerate so you might
not really be able to do anything with
this information but at least it's
interesting we ran a few different types
of tests with Unigine superposition this
is a great test for a quick synthetic
benchmarking and give us a look at
performance as it scales across
resolutions starting with shader
set to low textures set to high and
resolution changes at 4k 5k and 8k
we saw that Nvidia held a lead of about
twenty seven point four percent over
baseline moving to twenty seven point
nine percent lead with an error over
baseline at 5k and then a twenty eight
point one percent lead at 8k there's
really no change here from 4k to 8k at
least with regard to scaling although
obviously these resolutions become
decreasing lis playable as they increase
we ran a one-off test next with extreme
shaders instead finding that Andy
actually gained ground in this scenario
in a pretty significant way Andy
operated at fifteen sixty six points on
average with Nvidia at 1504 points we
reran this test four times and averaged
it determining that this Delta is
outside of standard deviation between
those test passes so it is a meaningful
difference after learning that bigger
differences emerge with extreme shaders
we reran the tests from 1080p to 4k at
1080p and videos are TX 2080 performed
about twenty five point eight percent
better than the Radeon seven guard with
a 100% baseline there at 1440p VRTX
twenty eighties advantage rapidly
decayed the 16.1% 4k results are too
close and create kind of a messy chart
so sorry about that but the RT x 2080
ends up actually outperformed by radeon
seven here for the first time in all of
these tests with Radeon seven holding a
couple percentage point lead we can see
that as resolution scales with this
particular game using the extreme
shaders which are pretty compute
intensive in this benchmark it looks
like Andy does change performance in a
meaningful way so in terms of real
framerate the benchmark was operate and
had about eleven to twelve FPS average
clearly this isn't play it's not even a
game but if it were it's not playable
anyway and that advantage is really not
realized since no one would
realistically use these settings and a
game but it is interesting to see how
two cards can flip positions in
different testing scenarios and it gives
us a bit of insight as to how Radeon
seven works and what it does well and
this sort of confirms some things we
already knew which is that memory
bandwidth does matter as you increase
the memory the load on the memory boss's
Murray pipe and also teaches us or
reminds us that
he does well in compute scenarios
firestrike remains one of the best tools
for this type of synthetic workload for
this we'll be looking at gt1 and gt2
separately gt1 heavily loads the GP with
polygons and tessellation performs its
shadow and illumination crunching and
uses compute shaders for post-processing
and particle physics and simulation gt2
is very heavy on compute shader workload
and greatly increases pixels processed
per frame but reduces tessellation
workload by more than 50% gt2 should
therefore run better on Radeon 7 and gt1
wood relative to the RT x28 efe so this
is where it's really important to
understand what the benchmark is doing
and not just run it blindly because if
we understand those two differences we
can look specifically at the two
workloads and trying I'm trying analyze
where would one card theoretically do
better than the other
starting with gt2 we see that the stock
firestrike ultra settings have nvidia
below and these performance at eighty
six point seven percent of the baseline
radeon seven 100% performance this is
unique to this benchmark thus far at 2x
MSAA that gap shrinks to ninety point
seven percent of baseline performance
for x MSAA brings us to ninety four
point six percent of baseline with 8x
MSAA finally allowing the RT x 2080 to
surpass AMD and hold at one hundred four
point seven percent of baseline
performance it makes sense that AMD
would generally be more competitive in
gt2 where compute workload and memory
bandwidth are both stressed as for why
nvidia starts to pull ahead once msaa is
brought to 8x we're working with 3dmark
steam and others to try and better
understand the specific behavior that
we're seeing here our estimation is that
this may have to do with memory
compression technology on nvidia or
maybe edge detection and anti-aliasing
with this specific hardware and software
combination the software implementation
especially so there may be
implementation level advantages here but
we're working with the teams to try and
better understand them for GT 1 getting
that chart on the screen there's more
tessellation and polygons are a bit
heavier here so we see the two cards
start to functionally equal each other
under stock fire strike ultra settings
with
nvidia gaining a notable 16% lead at 2x
MSA a 21% lead at 4x MSAA and 27% at 8x
MSAA and that will also note that there
was a massive difference between Radeon
7 and the 28 efe when running 8k
resolution with 8x msaa
now as a percentage this difference
looks like something like 60% favoring
the Radeon card however in reality
you're talking about something like four
point something FPS versus one point
something FPS so it is clearly
unplayable on both however very
interesting to look at the differences
the reason this particular difference
emerges is because we were running out
of memory on NVIDIA card so in order to
exhaust properly truly exhaust that 8
gigabyte frame buffer we had to run an
8k resolution with 8 tap multi sample
anti-aliasing that's a lot of pixels and
and that's what it took to exhaust the
frame buffer at which point AMD was able
to produce a significantly higher FPS
when looking at percentages but in
reality it's a 3 FPS difference and it's
still unplayable it's just that that's
where you start seeing that deviation of
capacity versus brute force in other
ways so interesting data but not
particularly useful considering how
unplayable it is anyway
GTA 5 has a lot of anti-aliasing options
so we'll exercise both msaa from 2 X - 8
X and then the reflections MSAA at 8 X
well start this with just using an
average FPS chart at the different
settings which will best illustrate how
the gap changes between each test at 4k
and very high in ultra settings for
everything 2x MSAA puts us at 58.8 FPS
average for the 2080 and 51.4 for the
Radeon 7 card the more important
indicator is that the 2080 holds a 14.4%
lead over the Radeon 7 card at 4x msaa
that lead doesn't really change much and
scales down to 14.1% and it's pretty
close to error at that point at 8x msaa
we start to see some movement and the
average FPS of 27.5 on Radeon 7 verses
31 FPS on our TX 2080 shows that the
improvement for the r-tx 2080 the phrase
down to 13% down from an initial 14.4%
by then also adding 8x MSAA reflections
in addition to the other AAA we see that
the difference is now changing to a
10.8% advantage for the 2080 fe which
diminishes its benefit looking at the
line graph in total we can see that andy
does start recovering some losses toward
the extreme end of the scale
it's just that again we're in unplayable
territory for other reasons but the gap
does close so this sort of reinforces
that initial hypothesis from the review
that performance will be better at high
resolutions and heavier anti-aliasing
for reference with the amount of test
passes we ran standard deviation run to
run was about 0.3 FPS average so these
results are very accurate far cry 5 is
next for this one we test it with SMA
Ataa and HD textures under different
scenarios unfortunately we can't really
expand the anti-aliasing it in any other
way beyond these two in the first test
at 4k and using HD textures with SMA we
measured an Nvidia at 62.8 FBS average
and AMD at 60 point 6 FPS average put in
Nvidia as about 3.5% ahead with 1% low
similarly spaced as were 0.1% lowest to
test scaling with different settings we
also ran a test with the reduced vram
consumption but otherwise identical
settings we can switch to that chart now
the results disabling HD textures were
functionally identical to the results
with HD textures and nothing else
changed it's no surprise that we're
within margin of error as textures don't
really impact performance unless vram
becomes a limitation on both devices
quantitatively the experience is
unchanged from the previous chart
qualitatively the output is the same on
each device so one to the next there's
no visible difference if you're ignoring
framerate and things like that
again Nvidia is about 3.3 percent faster
in this test as well switching to taa
instead performance falls off a little
bit for each device but Nvidia still
maintains a 3.3 percent advantage in
average FPS HD textures and
anti-aliasing changes in far cry 5
aren't enough to reduce or change the
performance delta from card to card
closing out then we see some interesting
scaling and a few of these titles far
astray
the most useful it gives us the most the
clearest picture of what's happening and
why because of well we know how fire
strike is built it's extremely well
documented so that one's interesting to
look at it's also potentially a bit
useful to know that it required an 8k
resolution with 8 tap msaa
to exhaust the frame buffer on the r-tx
2080 fe and start to gain an advantage
in a simulated gaming scenario it's
synthetic obviously with the Radeon card
now again unplayable anyway at that
point but this might scale elsewhere and
maybe it would be useful to you to know
this information so that's it for this
one as stated it's an academic exercise
this is not particularly useful in the
real world but it's very interesting and
if you want actual performance numbers
as it pertains to playing the game we
would of course advise you check out our
review of the Radeon 7 card for more
information so that's it for this one
