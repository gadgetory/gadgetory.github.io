nexus Donette and once again at pax
prime 2013 we just shot a video with
these two guys right here about the
roseville throne industrial mod check a
link in the description below for that
and for now this is actually a top level
overview of case modding how you can get
into it if you're a system builder
you've liked modding but I haven't ever
done it this is the video for you so
we'll start with you Bob do you have any
starting advice for system builders who
really liked looking at mods and want to
do it but don't know where to start I
think most people are probably most
afraid of painting because there's just
so many different things you can do so
many products you can use and they just
don't know where to start and all I can
say is really just just start you know
just pick up a spray can and start from
there and whether you're spraying on
some blank papers and cardboard or
whatever that kind of thing and then
just kind of get the technique down also
there's a lot of you know YouTube videos
that kind of stuff with helpful tips and
that kind of thing and just start from
there and you know and then as you
progress you know you might go buy a
cheap actual spray gun and some cheap
paint just kind of you know keep
progressing and you know none of us were
born modders you know I mean we all
learned and started somewhere so I just
I just think that people shouldn't get
discouraged and they should just just do
something and just get started make it
small the first time and you know if
it's a pop-can or whatever just start
start painting and see where it goes how
did what's what's the story for how each
of you got started into modding well
we'll start with you this time I started
seeing some mods and LAN parties Darth
Beavis had some pretty cool mods I'd
like wow that doesn't look that hard to
build I want a cool computer that looks
really awesome so I Cup fifty bucks
later I'm cutting in Farland and using a
rattle canned and spray paint something
and that's just how I got started and
Bob how about you yeah pretty much the
same story you know I i had a dell you
know a black plain old dell desktop i
went to a land party the first time and
and I saw Darth Beavis sir richard's
arose and he had a couple cases and so I
saw those and and it was like you know
one of those moments where the light
goes on and you say oh my god I could do
that too you know and so that's kind of
what started it and then and then it
just started steamrolling after that
what were your first maje that you
worked on and are there any surviving
pictures of them actually yeah my first
mod is still a favor to some people and
it was a ant farm pc and i had 300 live
harvester ants that were living in the
side panel i had built a custom acrylic
side panel that was kind of like a
double pane window and I had aunt gel in
there and the ants with tunnel all the
way through and had lighting inside the
win you know inside the case so it would
glow and you can see the ants running
around and everything and you know of
course they don't live forever so you
know it that would had to go away but
you know it was it was pretty neat it
was it was a fun bill too very cool how
about you rod first built I did was a
trs-80 model three made by radio shack
in 1982 the year I was born it's a
little bit older need a little bit
upgrading so in from 64k ram up to four
gigs i think at the time it won a case
mod competition at pdx land and it's
still in my spare bedroom today very
cool any any advice on case selection
for our modders who are aspiring models
i should say when they're looking for a
case to work on something that's easy to
jump into what should is there anything
they should specifically avoid or
anything that they should be shopping
for if they if they want to start out
with something easy I would you know
naturally point them in the direction of
a pretty plain case you know it not a
lot of different layers and you know
little features that stick out nooks and
crannies and things because that takes a
lot more prep work if you're going to do
some paint work so something that's more
flat and square and then move into
the more intricate designed cases where
you may end up eventually doing some
airbrush work and all the little details
and stuff like that so and rod any
advice on case selection for sure i
would go with something inexpensive so
you're not afraid to cut it up and
destroy it because it's probably what
you'll do and it'll look awesome and
paint surface is important so if it has
a textured surface and you want it to be
smooth that textured surface could be a
problem so avoid something that's ultra
complex and think about what material
it's made of as well a lot of the
plastic is ABS plastic and then the case
itself is usually made of aluminum or
steel but think about like Oh aluminum's
harder is easier to cut but you know
steel is a lot more resilient Hale so
it's not you won't Bend and tweak it
wrong when you're working on it and
finally any resources for our modders
what websites or other resources should
they be looking into to get further
support a great resource for help or
answers to questions or just anything is
it's always going to be you know some of
the modding forums and different
websites and things like that we've got
websites and are you know with our
emails and we're very helpful and most
most modders are very helpful so we have
the ability and the facilities to do
everything whether it's a structural
work acrylic work sheet metal work
welding you name it we you know paint
work we do it all so we've we've kind of
been through just about everything we
you know you could think of that you
might run out up against and have a
question on and we're and we're there to
