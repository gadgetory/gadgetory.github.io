the AMD r7 3800 X CPU with the primary
comparison being against andis own
r7 3700 X that we already reviewed the
two CPUs are identical in every physical
way but the only difference is being
frequency boosting so the 3800 X goes to
4 point 5 gigahertz single core
allegedly and has a base of 3.9
gigahertz while the 3700 X boosts to 4.4
gigahertz single core by the box and as
a 3.6 gigahertz base the 3700 X should
sell on average for $330 u.s. MSRP with
the 3800 X at 400 MSRP this $70 Delta is
major while the frequency difference
really isn't today we'll be looking into
whether it's worth it to spend $70 more
on the same part with a higher stock
frequency before that this video is
brought to you by US and the gamers
Nexus toolkit on store documents axis
net our brand new toolkit just launched
and contains 10 custom made drivers for
video card disassembly reap hasting and
tear downs the 8 core tools are made of
high-quality chromium vanadium alloy
steel that's built for long service life
and resistance to wear during use the
other two tools are carbon steel hex
heads that were custom ground down for
capacitor clearance on video cards all
the tools are easily mounted to a
pegboard or stored in the GN made tool
bag for easy transport
learn more at the link in the
description below this will be similar
to our 3600 X review or really just
focusing on the intra and the comparison
3,800 X versus 3700 X all the other cpus
will still be on the chart but if you
want the comparison of and these new 8
core cpus versus a and these previous
cpus reverses intel cpus check our 3700
x review for a specific discussion on
that the charts have everything in them
today we're just gonna breeze through
them though and focus on the two
comparisons for and these eight core 16
thread 3000 series cpus and that's the
main focus so should be pretty quick one
thing here this is developing to be sort
of like the discussion of the 1800 X CPU
which was a poor decision in general to
purchase have $500 versus at the time of
1700 for 330 which you could then
overclock on every single CPU
a few minutes to equate 1800 extra ones
it's looking sort of like that but a bit
less extreme on the price differences
and this there's no longer an
overclocking requirement so another
comparison be the 2700 X versus the
2,700 2,600 X versus 2600 there's that
tax for the extra letter you get some of
them have a cooler difference to you but
we ignore that difference because for
the most part we think you should buy a
separate cooler so we don't really
factor that into the conclusions but
overall it's the same vein except now
both of them have have an X at the end
of it so that's what we're looking at
today let's let's go through some
numbers we'll go through the benchmarks
and talk conclusions at the end a quick
frequency check will help us out first
so we ran this frequency check before
digging into the 3800 x starting with
the max frequency line plotted out in
Cinebench our 20 we see that the
multi-threaded workload shown at the
beginning of this chart ends up maxing
at about 40 to 25 megahertz on the
fastest cores during the all core
workload single threaded performance
averages closer to 40 for seventy-five
megahertz 25 megahertz below the
advertised speed and hits 40 500
megahertz about a dozen times during the
test blender was another good frequency
test logging frequency during a blender
workload we measured the all core
frequency at 4200 megahertz
with some deviations to 41 seventy-five
megahertz average across the run overall
it seems reasonable to expect about a
forty 200 megahertz all core frequency
with comparable cool in two hours or
about 44 seventy-five megahertz single
core with a some spikes to 4500
megahertz and keep in mind that
temperatures really effects these
frequency numbers with just precision
boost to not PBO just the stock settings
and that's something we explored in our
frequency thermal response chart in a
previous content piece next we're going
into the game benchmarks and the
production benchmarks and for those we
have the 3800 x in most of the charts
we've got overclocked numbers but not
all of them because ultimately an
overclocked 3800 acts and 3700 X for the
same frequency are functionally the same
chip any difference you're seeing is
mostly within round around variants all
the rise in 3000 CPUs fall fairly close
to one another with SMT enabled in the
total war campaign test from 155 point 2
FPS average for the stock 3600 to about
160
five FPS average the stock 3,800 X did
show a 3.4 percent improvement over the
stock 3700 X here but overclocking the
3700 X brings it closer the difference
is down to frequency and the 3800 X does
boost higher beyond the 4.3 gigahertz
all core overclocked managed on the 3700
X and so it makes sense that it places
ahead although it's not much this is the
biggest improvement that we'll see out
of the tests following next up is 1440p
the campaign benchmark is less prone
than some others to GPU limitation but
even so the 3700 X and 3800 X scored
almost the same here at one 57.8 FBS
average for the 3700 X and 150 9.4 FPS
average for the 3,800 X with 1% in point
one percent low is actually falling
below the 3700 axes results and within
reasonable run to run variants an
overclocked correct those lows but
didn't improve the average FPS of the
3800 acts beyond margin of error in the
total war battle benchmark at 1080p the
advantage for the 3800 X is smaller
still just 1.5 percent over the 3700 X
and average FPS stock versus stock
overclocking the two CPUs to 4.3
gigahertz put them on about the same
level as they should be equal frequency
equal core count equal thread count f1
2018 is next the high average FPS
results of f1 usually make performance
gaps between CP is visible where they
wouldn't be in other games but even
comparing the raw averages of the 3700
acts at 277 point 8 fps and the 3800
acts at 279 point 3 FPS is barely a
difference at all that's far less than
1% improvement for the more expensive
CPU with overclocking on both chips
yielding similarly minor uplift 1440p is
next for the same game the rule of thumb
is that differences are even harder to
spot at 1440p than at 1080 with CPUs
with the averages pushed down and
leveled out by the GPU limitations that
normally emerge all for average FPS
results for the 3700 ecstasy and 3,800
ex stock and OC fall within a range of
less than 2 FPS from each other
civilization 6 is measured in turn times
and is very reliable for CPU performance
testing for this one the r7 3800 x stock
cpu finishes in 30 3.1 seconds per turn
on average which plays to just be
the 33 second results of a 4.3 gigahertz
overclock and within variance of a
thirty three point three second results
only 3,700 acts at four point three
gigahertz these are all within roughly
the same area there within variants run
to run the 3700 ax stock CPU at thirty
three point seven seconds which is
outside of the run to run variance is
still not particularly important in the
real world Assassin's Creed origins at
1080p positions the 3800 acts at 119 FPS
average tied with the 3700 X with some
run to run variants showing better 0.1%
lows although this is within testing
variance there is no meaningful
improvement at 1080p between these CPUs
1440p placed the 3800 acts at 112 FPS
average tied again with u 3700 X the
overclocked 3700 ax is minimally ahead
and it's worth in run two run variants
once again posting no difference for the
3,800 x @ 1080p GTA 5 positions the r7
3800 x stock cpu at 109 FPS average
which has it tied with the 3700 acts at
4.3 gigahertz and functionally tied
about 0.6% ahead with the r7 3700 x dock
cpu there's no meaningful lap lift here
and either CPU would be fine but the
3700 ax would save money that could be
put towards something more important
like a good GPU the same thing happens
at 1440p where the 3800 ax ends up about
tied with the 3700 X only 0.2 FPS
difference on average with the
overclocked 3,700 X not providing any
meaningful op lift let's move on and
shadow of the Tomb Raider at 1080p that
3800 X doc CPU ended up at 144 FPS
average with an overclock with an error
at 143 the 3700 X stock CPU performed at
142 FPS average which illustrates an
improvement of about 1.2 percent stock
the stock hitman 2 is up next for this
one tested verse at 1080p the 3,800 x
stock CPU operated an average FPS of
about 120 which is tied with the
overclocked 3,800 x result the 3700 AK
stock CB ran at 118 FPS average allowing
the 3,800 acts an improvement of 1.2
percent and that's not worth it at all
1440p is satisfying here and that it
produces basically the same result as
the previous 1080p charts we observed
the 3,800
CPU at 1:17 white six FPS average 3700 X
doc CBO 117 FPS average at over Fox for
both at around 118 and within run to run
variants of each other
Photoshop is the best demonstration of
how the 3800 acts OC and 3800 X scale
relative to each other
aside from some gaming tests and this
benchmark Photoshop has always
demonstrated strong favor towards higher
frequencies and has minimally favored at
higher core account as we always say
this is the best illustrated by
highlighting the tie between the 9900 K
and the 9700 K both at 5.1 gigahertz
overclocked where the thread difference
has provided nearly zero value the 3,800
x stock CPU scores 1024 points out
performing these overclock 3800 X by 20
points like we've seen with other rise
in CPUs this is because the single core
boosting frequency is higher than an
all-court override frequency and so the
3800 X does better when stock then with
an all-court overclock at a lower
overall value the 3700 X stock CPU is
bested marginally here but only
marginally it's a difference of about
0.6% 7 zip compression positions the AMD
are seven 3800 x stock CPU at 75,000
MIPS or million instructions per second
which has it ahead of the r7 3700 X
stock CPU by 1.6 percent the sad thing
is that this is a rather large gap
compared to the other tests but is still
generally meaningless the compression in
seven zip positions the 3800 acts at
ninety seven thousand MIPS to the 3700
axes 95 thousand seven hundred Maps
these two are once again functionally
the same and so there's no real reason
to buy the 3800 x over the 3700 acts in
this workload in blender and rendering
our in-house monkey heads test workload
really heavy workload with a lot of
different transparencies and types of
materials applied the r7 3800 acts
completed the render in eighteen point
six minutes putting it roughly tied with
the r7 3700 acts at eighteen point eight
minutes this improvement is 1% the
overclocked 3700 X at 4.3 gigahertz ends
up at 18 point two minutes or three
point two percent shorter time than the
stock 3700 X so there's not much room
for improvement with
overclocking here overclocking got us
barely anything and is almost within
error range of the 3700 XOC result or
practically is anyway and that's true
for a lot of these other benchmarks as
well the GN logo render had the r7 3100
X finishing in twenty two point eight
minutes which is again only marginally
faster than the r7 3700 X stock CPU
there's functionally no difference here
although blender likes frequency a bit
it prefers threads first and foremost
you'd be better off just running a big
cooler on the 3700 X to get similar
performance uplift Adobe Premiere is
next starting first with the 1080p 60
h.264 render we observed the 3800 X
completing the render in 3.8 minutes
when stock tying the 3700 X exactly the
3800 X overclocked completed the render
in 3.7 minutes placing it within error
of the test passes for reference the
3700 X overclocked also exhibited this
behavior placing with an error of the
stock 3,700 acts CPU this is an instance
where the boosting behavior is minimally
equal in how beneficial it is to an
overclocked especially because premiere
doesn't remain fully pin to 100% load
per core and fluctuates in its load
level / core allowing cores to boost
higher for brief periods in this test
there is definitely no advantage to the
3800 X or at least not one that we can
find with our 4k 6 th t-64 render using
similar settings to our youtube uploads
the 3800 acts have finished the render
in 11.1 minutes and completed the render
6 seconds faster than 3700 X in other
words they're basically the same again
overclocking is again minimally
beneficial and not worth it especially
if running at voltages above 24/7 safe
voltages like we are v-ray like blender
is a threat intensive renderer on CPUs
in this benchmark the r7 3800 X finishes
in functionally the same time as the
3700 X posting only a 0.6 second
improvement between the 3800 acts of the
3700 X this is within test variance
anyway so there's no gains here and
there not only in substantial they're
imperceptible overclocking gets us at
1.2 seconds faster completion time on
the 3800 X at 4.3 gigahertz which again
isn't worth it at all so that's a
these are seven 3,800 x over all the
differences are definitely not worth it
you should save the $70 if you want one
of these two CPUs it should be the 3700
X and this is no longer even a situation
of overclock to equate the performance
it's it's run out of the box and you're
basically there there's max maybe 3.5%
something like that difference in one of
the games and that game in particular
does have some run to run variance
that's wider than the rest of the games
and then we're seeing one to two percent
differences in a lot of the other titles
and production workloads it doesn't seem
to overclock any difference it
differently we still hit a wall at 4.3
gigahertz and so at the end of the day
you should just buy the 3700 X between
the two we don't necessarily recommend
the 3700 X it's not a bad CPU it does
fine
but it is much more embattled than the
flanks so the 3600 is pretty easy to
recommend it's it's one of the it is we
think the best in class at its price
right now for a modern generation CPU
now gets a bit different when you start
talking about rising 2000 series chips
freaking of the 20s over hard for about
the same price for cheaper you have two
more cores which might matter in some
workloads not others but you have 3,600
modern generation pretty easy recommend
3900 x4 what it does is pretty easy to
recommend doesn't always win but the
900k still kind of wins the game in
scenarios they're just clock for clock
it is still in the lead and that matters
but those 2 CPUs from name the 3900 X
and it's targeted work workloads and
3600 and pretty much everything easy to
recommend 3700 X it still falls in that
we're not quite so sure
middle ground we don't typically like to
recommend middle-of-the-road components
because we think that the argument is
much stronger on either end of it where
if you can't afford the more expensive
one it might be worth going for the
cheaper one and then just spending that
difference on a better video card
instead which will likely matter more it
has used cases of course if you do need
the extra 4 threads on the 37 or 38
series and you do stuff like blender and
you can't quite afford a 3900 X then
yeah it's it's way easier to defend that
purchase but you can find all that
discussion with a 3700 X review for this
one the conclusion
don't buy the 3800 exit to waste of
money he should just get the 3,700 X
instead save the money and this is this
is just part of Andy's market strategy
where they saturate every single price
point they can think of use the same
dyes across all of them which is that
part's brilliant by the way and end up
with roughly the same cost to assemble
the chips but can get $70 more out of it
and have a way higher margin on that
3800 X so without a guarantee to hire
bin which is relevant here because they
all overclocked about the same without
meaningfully higher performance we just
can't recommend it and it's as simple as
that it's again it is not a bad CPU but
in this instance it is an overpriced CPU
and it's not even because of Intel it's
because of AMD's home products that they
launch the same day so that's it for
this one pretty clear decision on this
thank you for watching and subscribe for
more
Oh quick note the overclocking numbers
we do so we just we just pump the
voltage and get it stable at whatever we
can all core which is 4.3 here and
you'll want to run lower voltages so you
might not even be able to hit 4.3 all
core because we just do a preview and
out for daily use but anyway subscribe
for more we go to store down here in
Texas net sports directly by buying
things like the shirts the mod mat or
the toolkit or you go to
patreon.com/scishow numbers and axis
thank you for watching I'll see you all
