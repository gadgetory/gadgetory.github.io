distinguished engineer at Nvidia quite a
prestigious title it seems prestigious
yes thank you prestigious so Tom just
got off stage here at a press event
talking about overclocking for the new
GPUs including the 20 80 and 20 80 TI
yes well we did we just launched our
touring products and we had our editor
stay here it's great to see you again
and I'm really excited because we we
introduced a bunch of new things
including something called the Nvidia
scanner and the Nvidia scanner actually
makes it possible to do one-click
overclocking so a lot of new stuff
before that this video is brought to you
by the NZXT E Series power supplies the
E Series PS use our high end power
supplies with real time digital voltage
and temperature monitoring per rail
wattage measurements and data logging
functionality for power usage the e
series PSU is also come with a 10 year
warranty all the way down to the 500
watt unit and they run fully modular and
with silent fan operating modes learn
more at the link below so we've we've
heard this a lot
one-click overclocking I've been hearing
this for a long time to a we take
something like that yeah yeah
so one-click overclocking most the time
in recent years it's gotten a lot better
I'll say so we've done some man vs.
machine things we're all overclocked
we'll let it overclock it's pretty close
yeah but I mean sell me on it why why
should I trust it to handle it this time
versus last time what's different fair
enough question well I can tell you
what's different this time is Nvidia is
doing it so we've developed all the
logic it's divided into two main chunks
one is called the test program the other
one is the test load and the test
program kind of knows about how does our
voltage frequency curve look so it knows
exactly which voltage points to test to
make things go really really quick and
then since we can control the voltage
exactly because we're Nvidia you know we
can control that stuff there's no
variability caused by games or load on
the load side it's a mathematical test
that we develop to exercise our GPU
precisely so we can modulate that load
based on the power or the temperature
and effectively think of it as if you
could get Jonah to like overclock your
GPU for you and write giant programs to
do it this is what he would do
right and this is it's if you watch the
thing it steps at one voltage runs a
bunch of tests steps at another voltage
runs a bunch of tests and it delivers a
high quality curve in about 20 minutes
so and this just to be clear here there
is an OSI scanner program or there a
couple of them at least previous
generation how is this different from
those well what's different is this
doesn't crash it doesn't it doesn't like
TDR it doesn't it doesn't fail because
we're looking at a data comparison and
that data comparison we can detect
errors in far before we see any other
like visual or Windows corruptions um
the other thing is of course we know how
our VF curve looks so we know which
points to let go after so we're actually
focusing on five different voltage
points and interpolating between those
voltage points to generate the kind of
final curve so it's like all of the
knowledge that we have in our chip team
and our board team and our architecture
team has been compressed into this test
structure and our test load and then you
know I have to bring up voltage of
course I think on the in your
presentation I think we're seeing
something like what did stop at 2130 and
130 and one point zero something volts
one point zero six something nice is it
one point zero yes yes and that's why I
have the question voltage I guess the
community decision on this is that it's
been locked is the the phrasing I'll use
so tell me why I'm wrong ah well you're
not wrong voltage is in fact controlled
and restricted but I think you're the
reason the community is unhappy I
believe is that they feel like the
voltages nefariously locked right that
that Nvidia is locking this for poor
reasons but the truth is we know exactly
how our silicon behaves and we set our
voltage limit like the peak voltage that
we run at is set to be reliable so that
we can run at that voltage for many many
years five years is typical now as you
increase the voltage beyond that we're
going to start having fallout meaning
that some chips are just going to die so
it's our our kind of obligation to help
gamers not blow up their cars everything
else on that that UI for overclocked
is non-destructive it doesn't void
warranties we don't have like Oh
tracking if you over voltage or not
so what we're kind of trying to say is
we want to make sure the people can
enjoy overclocking they can experiment
with it but they don't blow up expensive
graphics cards voltage is the one thing
that will blow up the card that is
accurate you can play with the power you
can play with the temperature you can
play with the offset all of that is
non-destructive but the voltage will not
just perhaps blow it up right away but
it'll also for sure degrade the
performance of the chip over time so as
kind of a promise to our end users its
overclocking is free and it's safe and
if we allow them to slide a voltage
slider where you know suddenly they're
going a to X the voltage we're gonna get
a lot of surprised and unhappy gamers
I'm gonna give you one more opportunity
to tell me why I'm wrong before we move
on to Foose 4.0 ok so the next one why
is the voltage slider from 0 to 107
offset and Pascal or I would assume
touring cards why is that not a placebo
slider whoo well it does what it does I
mean what that percentage means is how
much of the available voltage Headroom
is unlocked so it doesn't necessarily
say what voltage are you gonna run at it
just says what are the new voltage
levels that are available so as an
example normally you're not running at
your peak voltage you're normally
running lower because of temperature or
power
so just sliding that slider up doesn't
change anything unless you actually hit
those voltage levels so I think a little
piece sometimes people are a little bit
disappointed about how many levels that
actually unlocks because it's really
only gonna be a few ticks because we're
going from five-year reliability to
1-year reliability and that translates
into I think roughly 3 more voltage
steps on most of our cards so it's not
placebo it's just you know I want to be
responsive but I just don't want people
blowing up cards so it's like yeah yeah
but I think we talked earlier and I know
you would like a way to say I'm an
expert I would like to play with my card
so give me a ways that I can maybe go on
a website get a cookie or maybe you know
put a special USB key and
I can make it harder but just don't lock
me out entirely that's what you're
saying so I'm gonna go look at that
but right now obviously we don't have a
change but it's it's not something that
we're opposed to it's just you know
we've got to find a way to do that
without compromising quality and if any
of you I guess on that topic have a
specific idea relating to that let Tom
know below actually let you know and
then you know you can tell me yeah but
let me know but you're gonna make me
sift through the comment well yeah no
yeah yes yeah you can tell Tom is a is
high up in the company when he is
delegating that to me you got it yeah so
last question for you a quick overview
which is asking a lot but boots 4.0
what's changed versus 3.0 what are give
me the primary features that have
changed okay well there's two things big
one is that we have no longer had a card
temperature limit so on boost 3.0 you
set a temperature limit and that means
that pretty much the car it's gonna stay
below that limit and if the temperature
ever rises above that limit then we cap
all the way down to base o'clock and we
stay at base clock let the fam ramp
that's our default behavior you can
slide the temperature slider up to kind
of avoid that if you want to allow a
higher temperature higher fan on boost
4.0 what we've done is actually created
a plateau in that transition so it
doesn't go from uncap down to base it
actually goes from uncapped down to
boost and it'll stay a boost for a while
before the temperature goes a little bit
too high and then it'll cap down to base
so if you think about that it kind of
says boost for dot o is no longer like
this cliff it's more of a plateau and
we're gonna allow temperature and power
to rise up to a secondary limit where
users can you know say I'd rather I'd
rather trade off lowering clock for
lower temperature now since that's such
a user centric decision we've also
enabled that curve in a new API so the
boost for API allows end-users to sort
of dial in their own boost algorithm and
that will you know you can imagine
somebody says I just want a hyper if I
don't care about loudness or I want sort
of a smoother transition between
acoustics and performance and that's
really what blues for is all about very
cool so there's your quick overview of
that otherwise we'll have articles
online by the time this video goes live
so check the link in the description
though for more information tom thank
you very much great to see you again
brother for joining me and we'll see you
all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
