data land rx 580 not 580 2048 it's
basically a 570 T is what this is and in
the review went on to rant about how AMD
is lying there's no other word for it by
calling this a 580 but that's only half
of the story the other half is a more
fun one it's to look at what this thing
actually is like because this is a
different product for us we don't work
with the company data land in the US
never even heard of it before this
product so it should be kind of fun to
take apart a different vendors card for
once different manufacturers card and
see what they do in their assembly
process and shroud and heatsink design
stuff that we might not have seen in
cards that we normally work with now
this already has a couple thermocouple
sticking out of it we installed those
obviously but what we need to do is take
apart the rest out reclaim those and see
how the quality of components and the
heatsink is underneath if only because
it's interesting to see a different
regions video card the data land X
serial this one is called for the rx 580
2048 there's a 570 before that this
video is brought to you by the gigabyte
RT x 2070 gaming OC now available in a
matte white model to match the emergence
of white pc cases the RT x 2070 gaming
OC is a three fan cooling solution and
four composite heat pipes on Nvidia's
newest orion GPU and ships with a pre
overclock of 1740 megahertz in OC mode
or 1725 in gaming mode RGB fusion is
also available for the LED enthusiast
learn more at the link in the
description below
so for basics if you missed it an rx 580
2048 it is a 570 it's got a little bit
higher clock and that's about it as for
the rest of this it's a dual fan cooler
for the X serial card by data land and
that is using a just a plastic shroud
pretty cheap really if you kind of you
can push the shroud into the fans if you
wanted to and that's covering the the
dual fan set up for the heatsink the
fins are oriented horizontally so the
air will exhaust out the front of the
card on the back of the card rather than
the top and the bottom which can be
useful of no in some cases it's got a
couple of heat pipes what we need to
take it apart to see those closer and
then also before the original
disassembly where we put the
thermocouples on there was a there still
but it's damaged there's a sticker on
the back that says warranty void if
removed which this is a China only
product so not going to go on the same
rant as we do typically for those
because the laws aren't the same there
and we're not familiar with them that
said we didn't remove it we put a hole
through it to get the screw out so it's
still on there but where the hole is
there used to be the letters T at ul and
that company is the parent company for
power color so not a hundred percent
sure of how the relationship is between
this data land product and power color
but the t UL branding may be an
indication of some kind of subsidiary
relationship so let's take this thing
apart it's a about 180 USD just to give
you an idea of what we're working with
and the screws are pretty
straightforward is only a couple of them
so we can get a quick look at the card
and also it's got four gigabytes of RAM
so that's gonna come into play in a
moment as well so here's the close up of
the card you can see the shroud very
much fits the X serial branding as they
call it so this X series card only has a
couple screws in the back and we're
gonna use the iFixit Pro Tech tool kit
which will link this down in the
description below if you want to pick
one up so this is pretty straightforward
this part it's four screws for the cold
plate and the heatsink mounting let's
move this stack of video cards out of
the way so I can use our mod matte GP
teardown grid and this also is on stored
Akira's exes Donna if you want to pick
up one of these for your own teardown
projects
it's got PCIe pin out power pin outs
things like that as well okay so four
screws there there's the warranty void
if removed one as noted we didn't remove
the sticker so I think we're good if I
have to send it back we can still do so
that used to say tul though that was the
interesting part with that sticker as
opposed to normally and let's take care
of two more so these are spring tension
screws as well these go towards the i/o
side of the video card and we're up to
six screws at this point this probably
comes out
okay there we go okay so here's here's
the heat sink fan and PCB combination
just separate these okay much better
than that except excellent
okay so VRM straightaway is interesting
but not really that interesting we've
seen this before on a lot of low-end
cards where they'll pack the vrm in over
on the left side of the card instead of
the right largely for space-saving
reasons they can make the rest of the
PCB smaller and also part of this
requirement of needing to save some
space on the PCB because you'll notice
it actually has eight memory modules so
two four six eight but it's a four
gigabyte card now typically you'll see
four modules or something like that if
it's four gigabytes this one's running
eight so they are only 512 megabyte per
module in this instance which does take
up more space you end up using this
whole row here instead of using it for
the vrm whereas that could fit elsewhere
if it had fewer modules on it so for the
vrm let's take a look at that for c 5 5
n is the mosfet for the controller it's
an IR 3 5 6 7 B and then for the memory
so this one is it all the same memory
looks like it's all Samsung and this is
gddr5 memory it is all Samsung the
interesting thing here though if you
look closely there are two memory
modules and on the GPU itself that
deserve closer attention and that is
because you'll see that it looks like
there's a different attachment method
for the ease where it almost looks
manual like it was done not by a
pick-and-place machine so you look at
the border of this memory module and
you'll see the black out border whereas
the other ones don't have it and we'll
talk with some of our manufacturing
contacts and ask why you would typically
see this this type of border it's not
like and it's glossy but it's not like
it's thermal pad grease you could kind
of
you might think it's throne pad grease
because it does look wet but that's just
gloss it is not thermal pad Greece
so we'll ask why or if you know feel
free to let us know why this would
happen in an assembly or manufacturing
process but it does look like the these
may have been attached by hand or at
least separately from the other six
modules which would be interesting but
not 100% sure of the significance of
that and then as for the GPU let's just
clean it off and see if it says anything
I have the GP is typically do not say
anything on them whereas Nvidia will
label their model number yes nothing on
there but that is in fact an RX 570
which has been called the RX 580 in this
instance so you haven't seen polaris in
a while there is your reminder of what
it looks like hasn't changed with a
cooler this is we've got a copper cold
plate in the middle direct contact cold
plate and then we'll look at the rest in
a second so clearly if they're all pad
to contact the entire vrm over here you
can see the doubler imprints there with
MOSFET imprints as well and then the
inductor line so all the chokes end up
in this chamber they don't have direct
contact to the heatsink but that's
actually okay because they can take a
whole lot of heat and the thermals are
actually not bad on this thing based on
our testing separately the inductors are
immediately below a fan anyway so having
that direct contact really is kind of
irrelevant in this instance because it's
got a fan blowing straight onto them
they can take current 50c they're fine
so that's the chamber for the inductors
we have an aluminum base plate for
contact to the memory which you can see
over here and is this aluminum I'm going
to say yes that's got the marks of
aluminum on it so that is aluminum so
aluminum base plate for the memory
contacted via pad and then also the vrm
shares that same plate for the MOSFETs
as for this plate let's take this thing
apart and just I mean
should really just reveal the heatsink
but it shows part of the assembly
process so we can take that off as well
so we take these screws out this by the
way this is what we this is what we
would have been looking for in that XFX
Fatboy why they didn't do this it's kind
of unclear their version of of the plate
is a bit odd but either way this plate
will contact everything without leaving
gaps between things without using
stainless steel which is really a not a
good conductor
oh whoa interesting that was unexpected
got some rails in there oh cool I
haven't seen that kind of assembly
before it's just some rails inside
d-delenn it's got a better assembly
process that's how the XFX card so
you've just got some rails in there this
is not a good way to do this necessarily
either we've seen better but for a cheap
card maybe it makes sense either way
doing the rails in there means that the
screws have something they can mount to
and secure against a while still
enabling a fully flat plate for
conduction purposes so that's good and
by the way I just reminded of the throw
the heat pipes here so for the heat
pipes there are three of those and they
look to be about eight millimeter heat
pipes to eight millimeter one six
millimeter heat pipe by eye
can't get in there it started the heat
pipe to the plate so even though it's
got those screws in it for retention I
guess we would have to decouple the
plate from the fins and the heat pipes
this is a reasonably good quality
actually better than expected so yeah in
order to to separate this you'd have to
break the solder the bond between the
rest of it between the fin stack the
heat pipes and the plate so this is
actually better assembly than expected
despite those things kind of being a bit
of a surprise so we're not gonna be able
to remove that for the rest of it then
it's all pretty basic it's a two fan
cooler it's got three heat pipes it's
really not amazing but considering the
relatively low amount of heat output
it's dealing with a couple hundred watts
max it's fine so that's the data land rx
570 TI
that Andy has created and there's really
not much else to say about this one it's
pretty straightforward there is however
looks like there is actually a bio
switch though one more thing to remove
here is the backplate of the PCB got
distracted by the cooler
well they forgot to put the barcode the
part ID and the EAN code on it there's
nothing special at all on the backside
so standard backside of a PCB for a
video card and that at this point that
is all there is to the RX 580 2048 if
you're interested to learn more about
this card it is assembled form go to the
review we have that online talking about
performance numbers for it thermals
included noise included and of course
gaming benchmarks versus the actual rx
570 and actual rx 580 the real one with
23:04 FP use instead of 2048 so thank
