net and what you are looking at is a
maximum graphic settings version of Star
Wars Battlefront currently running on a
single GTX 980 TI the MSI Seahawk which
we just benchmarked and as you can see
at 4k with max settings we're actually
pushing this card about to its limit
it's it's not perfectly fluid if you
want perfect fluidity with 4k at max we
reveal in our benchmark which
accompanies this that it basically
requires sli gtx 980 TI s or a similar
AMD configuration so this course is our
benchmark course first of all the game
is in open beta that means not all maps
are available right now not all game
modes not all vehicles a lot of stuff is
still locked down so that means that
these benchmarks that we show in the
article accompanying this benchmark
course could be different depending on
what map your plane and how the full
release version of the game impacts
performance so do keep that in mind that
said this course was selected
specifically because it is easily
replicable I know it's not super
interesting compared to the multiplayer
footage which I'm also showing in this
video when the benchmark course
concludes but it was chosen carefully
because we want to be able to replicate
a benchmark scenario one hundred percent
of the time with certainty that there
are no external elements influencing the
performance of these cards and those
external elements could include
networking issues or even just having a
ton of players in the game but more
importantly being able to replicate
movements precisely on a map when you're
getting shot at and killed by other
players isn't really something that's a
reliable test measure so we tested it in
single player using survival mode test
the first 30 seconds and then repeated
for parity a minimum of three times per
video card / setting / resolution so
quite a lot of tests here tonight and
that creates very reliable metrics for
the game that we currently have
our hands on now as the game iterates
things can change but we will revisit
this topic as release date approaches
the rest of the footage you're looking
at and have been looking at is some
multiplayer stuff that I played around
with when I was researching the impact
of the game's multiplayer version single
player on FPS and I found that in
general with the game in its current
state the FPS of multiplayer and
single-player are comparable meaning
that the numbers you see in our
benchmark charts are representative of
what you would see in the multiplayer
game you might get a couple of 327 FPS
hits at absolute worst in very intense
multi-person battles with a lot of
explosions and environment damage and
things like that so in those scenarios
you will get a hit that is maybe not
seen in the single-player benchmark make
sure to hit that patreon link in our
postural video if you want to support us
in making this type of content in the
future we've been doing this type of
content for a while now it's very time
intensive but it's a lot of fun and I
hope it helps you all out so I will see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
