nexus bringing you the hard-hitting tech
content here from CES 28 what are you
doing I'm sorry hey guys this is the
gigabyte x9 laptop so we just took it
apart this is I think this is one of the
sort of handmade prototypes which makes
it a bit cool because you can still see
engineering marks all over the boards
and there's some tape in places that
obviously won't be there in the final
models but we like looking at stuff like
that at CES because it gives you a
better idea of how the actual
development went for the product before
that this coverage is brought to you by
Thermaltake and the flow liquid cooler
the flow is a 360 millimeter radiator
with three ring RGB LED fans you can
program the fans our custom lighting
through software and then of course
benefit from the larger radiator size
and cooling performance learn more at
the link in the description below the
reason we took this one apart is just
because the cooling solution is kind of
unique it's a four fan cooling solution
they are all radial fans
so therefore blower fans basically two
in the opposing corners towards the back
of the laptop and then two on the top of
the laptop and because their blower fans
anywhere obviously the fan blades are
exposed that's your intake there's
ventilation here on the panel as you can
see there in the Eagle shape or whatever
that is
so there's your intake exhaust comes out
in sort of narrow slats on the sides in
the back and the top side has mesh for
its own radial fans so for the heat
sinks the reason they've got four fans
on here is because this is basically a
portable desktop it's not really meant
to be used on battery it does have a
6,200 milliamp hour battery but it's
also got two gtx 970 s and sli and a
high-end i7k be like gen cpu so not
gonna not gonna last very long battery
but that's okay it's not meant to so for
the cooling solution you got all the
fans connected there are several heat
pipes connected to two cold plates I
think copper cold plates for the GPUs I
think a copper cold plate for the CPU
the PCH is under its own heat sink I
think but we'll talk about that more in
a second as for the heat pipes there's a
couple
eight mills so one eight mill for each
of the radial fans on the backside and a
couple of six mill pipes opposing those
actually this may be the chipset over
here with a pipe going to it as well so
the reason I'm talking about the chipset
is because technically you could maybe
try to make raid work with m2 SSDs doing
that in a laptop with actual high
sustained reads and writes and not so
sure how it does thermally but so
they're not tech they're not officially
recommending it but you could try for
memory you'll notice that because the
size of the laptop there are actually
four so dim slots and I think from what
I've been told you can run up to 64
gigabytes so if you wanted an insane
mobile editing rig or something you
could do that that covers most the core
components I believe this is one of the
thinnest if not the thinnest high-end
gaming laptop in terms of the actual
performance power output versus the form
factor and I will have b-roll shots of
it you can see it's it's pretty small
one more thing here the keyboard has a
mechanical feel I don't know who makes
the switches but they've been referred
to as like Browns basically it's not a
cherry Brown switch but it does kind of
have a feel more like a Romer G or a
damped Brown like on the g7 10 as far as
I'm concerned but that's all we know
about the keyboard for now so that's the
X 9 and this particular unit I think is
$3,700 it's up there it's getting
towards 4 grand
the display is a 4k display they also
have 1440p which they're calling 3k
sometimes but it's the same thing it's a
4k panel 60 Hertz and that about covers
it so thank you for watching as always
you can subscribe for more CES coverage

that directly and Paul's channel will be
