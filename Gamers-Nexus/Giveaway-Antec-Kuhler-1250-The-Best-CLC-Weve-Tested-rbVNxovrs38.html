next on that mirror back with another
giveaway this time we are giving away an
antec 1250 cuter and i say that way
because it has an Uzi loud as we called
it in German I knew four or five years
of German would pay off because now I
can say killer and be totally justified
so this is a 1250 cooler and it is a
close liquid loop cooler i'm giving it
away on the youtube channel to win this
cooler you need to subscribe by hitting
that subscribe button below i believe it
is read unless youtube has changed it
again subscribe leave a comment on this
video and this is the important part and
tell me what you would like my next
video series or article to be about what
you want me to explore it in depth
pertaining to computer hardware and
video games or one or the other either
one is fine so leave a comment with that
if I like your comment a lot and I want
to explore that topic in an article or
video then you will be winning one of
these this is actually my test model but
we'll be sending out a brand new model
provided by antec thanks to them for
that you have until june third at eleven
fifty-nine p.m. eastern standard time to
enter this contest at which point i will
check all the tube submissions i will
not be refreshing the page after that
and then we'll pick a winner and contact
you via youtube so hit the link in the
description below for full details you
must be in the US or canada to enter
this contest i'm starving for those of
you who are outside of those two
countries but it's for shipping and
legal reasons so about this cooler if
you're not aware it is a dual pump
liquid cooler has one pump atop each
family up to 120 millimeter fans and a
pretty standard radiator I reviewed this
back in December and it receives our
best of bench award for liquid coolers
and air coolers it is actually the best
performing cooler on our bench right now
in entirety there is nothing that beats
it and it's I it performs pretty well
it's reasonably quiet when you change
the settings it is controlled through
software so that's pretty cool and it's
got of course a fancy LED that's hot the
cpu block because you cannot have a
cooler these days without one
is this uses direct contact equivalent
cold plate for the bottom here and other
than that I was pretty standard for a
liquid cooler I will mention briefly
that it does not use a standard mounting
bracket like you're probably used to
because it's not is Tex applied and I
actually find the mounting bracket a
little bit painful with this one I wish
antec would address that but regardless
it's one of the best cpu coolers you can
get right now and i highly highly
recommend it trying to win it for free
because why the hell not right check
links in the description below or on the
side panel or wherever for sending the
right side or is that the right side I
don't know which side is correct but
check the links and I just posted a
budget PC for about seven hundred
dollars that will play any game on max
settings where I mentioned this giveaway
specifically so hit that if you are
interested and yeah let me know what you
want us to talk about in the next
articles and I will see you all next
time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
