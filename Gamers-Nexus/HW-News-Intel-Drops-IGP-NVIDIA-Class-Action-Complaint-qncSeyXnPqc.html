hardware news recap despite being an
end-of-year
it's a really busy week and that's
partly because we've got CES in the
immediate future so in the first two
weeks of January January roughly six
seven somewhere around there CES will be
starting we'll have a lot of coverage
then but there's some preliminary needs
to talk about and the leading ahead the
headlining item today is a class action
complaint filed against end video we'll
be talking about that there's the Intel
new CPU so Intel's new CPU is called the
F skew just before we get demonetised to
clarify that's that's F skew so we talk
about that as well
OLED gaming monitors finally due for
release maybe in 2019 probably at this
point and then some more rumors about
the RT X and GTX series cards before
that this video is brought to you by the
EVGA supernova g3 power supplies unlike
other power supplies on the market that
get easily tangled the EVGA g3 power
supplies are modular and you sleeved
cables so the PCIe connectors won't get
caught in your hair when building system
the supernova comes in several options
including popular six with UI and 750
watt units and it's fully modular with a
noise focused fan profile learn more at
the link in the description below very
quick GN content announcement first so
first of all we appreciate you being
patient with us the last couple of weeks
it's been obviously end-of-year some
people have had more time off and I've
been spending my time revamping the
website so it's not public yet but it
will be in the next few weeks and all
that has taken time so thank you for
being patient with us as we kind of
ramped down our benchmarking content for
about maybe 10 days or so but it's back
in full swing now so this week we have a
good couple of benchmarks ago enough
that are pretty interesting and one of
them is is a bit unique we think you'll
enjoy it so make sure you check back for
that subscribe if you're not already so
that anybody a class-action this thing
currently it's in complaint form so this
isn't like a full ongoing case as of
right now and the complaint that was
filed alleges that Nvidia materially
misrepresented its ability to combat the
cryptocurrency down swing that we all
pretty much knew was inevitable at this
point including Nvidia the difference
though is that
Vidia made some claims and it's investor
meetings that could have influenced the
stock price in a way that now that the
stock has fallen significantly is coming
back to bite them so here's what the
complaint says this is what we know
right now it's still in a status where
Nvidia can respond formally and they
haven't done that yet in a public
fashion the complaint directly quotes
Nvidia investor meetings that suggested
the company is quote master at managing
our channel and we understand the
channel very well NVIDIA suggested
overall low impact to product
performance from cryptocurrency mining
indicating an ability to sustain volume
after the inevitable crash Shaw law firm
alleges that these claims were false and
misleading and that the multi quarter
left overstock of Pascal GPUs affected
Nvidia stock performance in a
significant way so if you're you're a
shareholder of Nvidia stock you can join
this class action the only stipulation
is that you must have lost over $100,000
in the recent downturn of Nvidia stock I
don't know how many people in our
audience lose that kind of money on
technology stocks if you do I don't I
don't know why you're watching us at
this point but it may be worth your time
to look into this otherwise well we'll
fill you in on what's happening in the
very least so Shaul law firm states the
following in its complaint that was
filed they say quote Nvidia touted its
ability to monitor the cryptocurrency
market and make rapid changes to its
business as necessary and Vidya also
claims to the market that any drop-off
in demand for its GPS amounts of
cryptocurrency miners would not
negatively impact the company's business
because of strong demand for GPUs from
the gaming market based on these facts
the company's public statements were
false and materially misleading
throughout the class period when the
market learned the truth about Nvidia
investors that suffered damages the law
firms press release made some further
statements and one of those was another
quote investors who purchased the
company's shares between August 10th
2017 and November 15th 2018 that's the
class period inclusive again the class
period are encouraged to contact the
firm before February 19th of 2019
so again if that applies to you it's
time to get a move on
and we'll just show an Nvidia stock
chart to give some perspective here but
at time of writing the news story Nvidia
stock fell from a six-month peak the
last six months of about $289 on October
1st 2018 and it fell to $134 to 89 to
134 by December 28th of 2018 the
steepest decline was in November it was
November 15th to about November 19th it
was a four-day period where Nvidia fell
from 202 dollars to $145 per share
Nvidia CEO Jensen Wan recently stated
that the company was suffering a quote
cryptocurrency Hannover something we
discussed in recent news items and as we
all know 10 overs often include the loss
of millions of dollars of stock value
the Pascal architecture still saturates
the channel that's been a big deal in
all of this and rumors within the
industry indicated earlier the last
couple months that the 2060 launch was
delayed as a result of oversupply of the
GTX 1060 cards that already exist so
we'll keep an eye on this this is still
a complaint it is not any massive
ongoing lawsuit at this time but it
could become one and we'll keep you
posted on what happens and on NVIDIA is
response if they post the public one so
Nvidia overall remains in a dominating
position in the market they are more or
less uncontested and high on GPUs for
consumer class Hardware fairly
uncontested in a lot of the deep
learning machine learning spaces
although there has been movement there
as well from Intel and Google coming up
and Andy is working towards catch up
with navi so they are there they've got
some ground to gain but although NVIDIA
is in a good spot right now it's not a
spot that should be squandered because
there is a media competition on the
horizon for Nvidia next up Intel
ninth generation F SKUs these are its
it's a new demarkation that's currently
technically in rumor status now we
gamers Nexus officially received some
highly credible rumors and leaks about
this lineup probably about two months
ago
we we waited a bit to see how credible
those would be and it turns out they
were quite credible so we'll keep that
in mind the next time we get rumors from
that source thank you very much
but what we can do now is report on some
some postings by retailers primarily in
Scandinavia so they're a couple of
retailers and I believe Norway and there
might have been one in Sweden where
these F SKU 9000 series CPUs which are
technically really kind of eighth
generation coffee like they were posted
online early and what we know is that
these will be devoid of an IG P so
that's the the big item here there's no
integrated graphics process or at least
not one that's enabled there's probably
one there that's just off and a disabled
IGP could mean a slightly higher base
clock but from the initial listings it
does not look like that's the case
potentially there's a higher
overclocking Headroom for something like
a 9700 KF because probably they're
probably not going to call it f K let's
be honest it's probably KF so it might
have higher OC Headroom we aren't fully
sure of the motive behind the product
but one item we would speculate is that
it could be low yields on the IG peas
which if you're then going to turn
around and sell the product anyway just
with the IG p disabled would be a good
way to reclaim some silicon make some
money back on the silicon and
potentially create a new product line
that one would hope would provide some
value and that would either be through
dropped cost but it does not look like
that's the case or through increased
overclocking Headroom and that's
potentially more likely so unfortunately
the initial placeholder pricing and it
is placeholder pricing as far as we're
aware suggests that the MSRP is about
the same or slightly higher to the non F
counterparts the case cubes that already
exist in the market for the 9000 series
well see what happens once they release
of course the reduced thermal density
may impact the base clock but
realistically we're looking at a higher
OC Headroom option so although an idle
IGP shouldn't really impact performance
too much it does have an impact and
selling shows without iGPS does make
sense for high on parts for people who
aren't using quick sync or some other
IGP accelerated tasks and might be just
gaming in which case the discrete GPU
that you're likely
is sufficient for just about everything
so this allows Intel to take some
processors that are potentially
defective and garbage otherwise and sell
them which is a good thing for everyone
for the most part and we'll we'll see
we'll see what happens a disabled igb
can kind of act as dark silicon
contributing nothing while still being
present and in the way it's still taking
up dye space even though it's off and
ideally what you would do instead is use
more of that dye space to distribute the
thermal load or evenly but we'll look at
it if it comes out and if it comes into
our lab so far the listed parts and it
does look like this is real including
9900 KF the 9700 KF and the 9600 KF with
a 9400 i5k F or F rather than okay so 90
400 F CPU as well in the lineup which
presumably would be a locked but non IGP
part for a bit lower cost in the i-5
line of stock is allegedly expected to
appear January 3rd which is probably
ramen on this video will go up so we'll
know by the time this because that will
know how how true that turns out to be
and frequencies point toward 3.6
gigahertz 9700 KF and 9900 KF which is
the same as the case key parts but turbo
frequencies are yet unconfirmed at time
of filming AMD up so AMD recently
announced two more entries to their a
Fon lineup this isn't the newest news
item but we thought we'd pointed out
anyway because it came out kind of right
around when things were getting crazy
for holidays so if you missed it there's
a 240 GE and a 220 GE following up the
200 GE that we already reviewed and the
difference here is that they're more
expensive but otherwise same idea so
what's going on with this is when we did
our benchmark and review the MSI be 350
tomahawk that we used in as we
understand it most other MSI boards had
the against at one point 0.0 point 6 I
believe was update by AMD and either as
a consequence of that specific geesa
version or as a consequence of whatever
MSI decided to do which is probably
whatever it wants annoying MSI you were
able to unlock the multiplier and
overclock the Athlon 200 GE even though
it's supposed to be a lost part so this
is
this is where product segmentation comes
in the reason to lock that part is
product segmentation so you can create a
low end that's cheap and a high end
that's a bit more expensive where high
end in this case means probably about
$75 for something like the 240 GE or 65
for about the 220 GE
and instead what happened is if you buy
them a sideboard and a 200 GE just
overclock it even to these small levels
of 3.5 gigahertz for the 240 GE should
be trivial and you've got the same part
for cheaper assuming the motherboard
cost didn't add in ways that otherwise
it wouldn't if you bought a non MSI
special board for this overclocking
procedure so it's a AMD made a big deal
out of Rison being unlocked on all
platforms that was not true for the
Athlon series but will note that the
Athlon series out currently 200 series
is Rison one verizon 1000 series silicon
so 1,700 1,600 that air is silicon so
it's going to follow the same kind of
characteristics it'll have the same sort
of voltage threshold safe voltage points
the same volt frequency curve for the
most part other than potentially a bit
lower on the curve because the cheaper
part so if you know how those overclock
you know how these overclock did hitting
about 3.9 4.0 gigahertz max we did 3.9
on ours bit of a rumor alert on this one
the RT x 2060 allegedly will use both
gddr5 x and g GD r 6 which is
unconfirmed at this time but a bit more
credible than some of the other 11
series rumors that we saw previously we
didn't we didn't report on some of the
rumors we saw a couple weeks ago because
they were completely baseless to the
point of having like 1660 written on the
video card it's not even it's not even
an 11 in that number but it was supposed
to be an 11 series so this one looks a
bit more credible though and this is
it's it's credible because NVIDIA has a
history now of making a million SKUs of
the x axis
the 1060 which has let's try and try and
recap them actually we play a fun game
here if I miss one let me know what it
is in the comment section below I think
that 10 sixties include the following
1066 gigabyte with all of the SMS 1063
gigabyte with one SM disabled
a 1065 gigabyte that was a China launch
and a 1066 gigabyte nine gigabit per
second card there's there's one more
1060 gddr5 acts I think that's all of
them let me know if I missed one but uh
it looks like that might happen again
with the 2060s we'll see it's in rumor
status right now but from what we
understand there is potentially a a
model that's going to be well let's go
through em 2060 could common variants of
six four and three gigabytes according
to the current rumors of mixed
credibility but some credibility and
NVIDIA is also looking at g5x and GDR
six so that's what we're looking at for
that one they've used ddr4 in the past
as well the primarily for things like
the GT 1030 which should have been
renamed and then a bit of an an oops
here by Lenovo Lenovo must be one of
Nvidia's favorite partners to work with
because the company routinely
accidentally or accidentally if you
prefer post details pertaining to new
video card launches and also does this
to Intel at the same time so the newest
slip comes in the form of a notebook
allegedly containing a GTX 1160 and
that's marked with an asterisk that
notes all a TBD for the specs or the
lineup and it's accompanied by a memory
spec listing tentatively that indicates
three and six gigabytes key used for the
Y 5:30 and Y 7,000 feet notebooks from
Lenovo the légion series Tom's Hardware
reported that the GTX 1160 will use tu
116 silicon as opposed to tu 106 for the
RT X 2060 I'll reported on their site at
this point and other rumors around the
web indicate that the GTX 11 series will
axe the RT and tensor course would
probably make sense once you're getting
down to that class of hardware it's not
like you're gonna be doing a lot of ray
tracing in any way unless you like
playing games at 720p so this focus is
back entirely on rasterization it will
likely reduce the price that be welcomed
but that's all we know for now and that
covers it 1-1 short news - know your
actual - short news notes that
didn't didn't write these stories out
they kind of got cut from the list but
if you remember the wanna cry exploit
that apparently still is is dormant on a
whole lot of computers so you might want
to look into that if you're concerned
about security and then also there's a
and this is eighteen months later by the
way
after it was originally a hot item in
the news also AMD will join the
nasdaq-100 index
following increased performance and
market stock value increases and I think
it was six companies we're not a
financial news outlet but I think it was
six companies being removed from that
list including Seagate as one of them
and Andy is taking the place of one of
those six companies so interesting news
