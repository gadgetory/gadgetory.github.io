Hynix booth so this is a bit interesting
SK Hynix of course is a major memory
supplier they provide the memory for
most graphics cards they have a couple
of competitors but not many Mason comes
down to three major players in the
memory market for both system and GPU
memory so SK Hynix
is one of those we're talk about G DDR
six today as you probably saw in the
title the major news here from SK Hynix
we actually have a couple of things
talked about but one of them is that
they're G DDR 6 will be entering mass
production in about 3 months that does
coincide with some future launches
two of them are autonomous vehicle
launches from Nvidia and then we also
know that their face is gonna be in the
future GPUs from Nvidia as well for the
gaming side of things before that this
video is brought to you by Corsairs new
dark core RGB se Mouse the dark core RGB
se is a wireless gaming mouse rated for
up to 24 hours of continuous wireless
gaming with the LEDs enabled and can be
coupled with a Qi charging mouse pad for
easy battery charging it has both
wireless and Bluetooth antenna so the
mouse can be used easily on two systems
and switched between them learn more at
the link in the description below so
future and video gaming GPUs probably
going to be on GDR 6 from what I
understand today and hynek's should be
making some of them so I don't know
exactly when those will be coming out
but we do have a timeline of mass
production of 4G DDR 6 from SK Hynix
in three months that should give you
somewhat of a timeline to start with
because obviously they're not gonna be
ready until mass production is done
assuming the information been told today
is accurate and the NVIDIA GPUs or video
cards in the future do have G GD r6
anyway that's the basics that's the most
important stuff in terms of relative
costs we don't have exact numbers we've
talked about gddr5 pricing and HBM to
pricing in the past so you can check
previous content for that if you need
some actual kind of pretty accurate
ballpark figures that we've collected
from manufacturers but what I do have is
relative pricing so G GD r6 should be
about 20% more expensive for
manufacturers cost to manufacture than
existing gddr5 that will go down to 15
eventually 10%
production ramps up and they produce
more and more GDRs safe so for now it's
about a 20% cost increase pretty
significant information and news that
you should definitely be paying
attention to if you haven't heard it yet
and you haven't because we heard here
first
other than that base expects to run
everyone through all the stuff that
you've probably seen before gdr 6 we'll
be shipping an 8 and 16 gigabit modules
from SK Hynix and the existing GDR 5
from hynix was only eight gigabit module
so the density has a potential to double
if you as a manufacturer buy the 2x
density chips so that's item number one
item number two voltage both is about
the same it's one point three five volts
for GDR six and GG are five is 1.35 is
1.5 volts depending on what should be
which which one you use in which
manufacturer using things like that but
basically about the same voltage power
consumption we don't have hard numbers
on it's a lower but I can't give you a
hard number on it in terms of watch or
anything like that extra information
speed so gddr5 speeds anywhere from
seven gigabits per second to nine
gigabits per second of absolute high-end
it varies based on manufacturer Samsung
hynek's micron are the big three makers
of memory so depend on which one you're
buying from that's your speed variance
NVIDIA has a couple of nine gigabit per
second cards but it's mostly eight at
the high-end gt2 are six is supposed to
be going up to 16 gigabytes per second
per Hynek suspect there Mac spec and
samsung has announced similar numbers
for theirs I don't have the most recent
numbers with me today but it's similar
so those are your main items of note I
think for GT are six and five the most
important that you probably haven't
heard elsewhere before today is the
price difference 20% cost to
manufacturers that will come down to
consumer if they don't profit on it as
well so keep that in mind three months
time for mass production it's not there
yet it will be in three months and will
from what I've been told be used on
future Nvidia graphics card devices
which we would assume would launch
sometime coinciding with that three
month window if not a bit after just
because of how manufacturing obviously
works they need lead time to put it onto
the cart one last thing I guess so BGA
the gt-r six-member
is one-eighty ball grid array so it's
got 180 solder balls on it and gddr5 is
170 the primary difference the reason
they add 10 is not because of size
they're actually the same size so 14 by
14 for the module but for throughput so
throughput has increased of course 16
gigabits per second extra 10 to 180
balls in the ball grid array doesn't
prove the throughput so that's I think
that's everything you've got for you
pretty interesting stuff actually I
honestly wasn't really sure what to
expect when I walked up to the hynek's
booth but I'm glad I did so pretty cool
stuff subscribe for more as always we'll
be trying to talk to more people here at
GDC 2018 and go to patreon.com slash
gamers and access to help us out
directly with these types of trips in
the future or go to store it on gamers

mod mats we just got the second round in
they are shipping now thank you for
watching I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
