it's already got a few issues for PC
players that we've looked into and some
of them are resolvable and some not so
much but this has been a common trend
with Dark Souls and their PC ports over
the years Dark Souls 3 is certainly
better it's definitely a more honest
attempt at porting to PC but it's still
a port and it still has issues and one
of those major ones is micro stutter and
we saw this when trying to capture
gameplay we normally use SLI or
crossfire configurations for capturing
gameplay video and so in the process of
doing that we saw severe micro stutter
which you see on the screen now and that
happened only in the multi GPU
configuration so a few things here first
of all before getting too deep into the
fixes for all these things check the
description below click on the link and
that has an article with everything
typed out and clear order bullet points
and everything so that you can clearly
follow any instructions that may help
you now looking at micro stutter
specifically for this it would be best
advised of course to first download the
latest GPU driver because since this
video has gone live it could have been
fixes in the driver side and then
download display driver on installer run
it extract run it and boot to safe mode
and remove the driver that corresponds
to GPU install the new ones hopefully it
works and if it doesn't well then the
next best thing to do really
unfortunately is to disable your second
card until a point at which it's
properly supported by either the Dark
Souls teams or the driver teams from AMD
and NVIDIA now the next thing is key
bindings so this is kind of a funny one
Dark Souls if anyone remembers in some
of the original games you couldn't
actually save key bindings initially in
Dark Souls 2 it sort of had to be hacked
and with Dark Souls 3 they had a key
bindings tab it was there but even
though you could change them you could
not save them the button to save the key
bindings didn't even work and the head
is useless so there was a day 0 patch
that fixed this what you need to do is
go into steam or wherever you bought it
and make sure you enable the option to
grab the latest patches automatically
not just manually or if you have a
manually set then pull down a new patch
for Dark Souls it should grab up
hatch that from memory I think is about
fifty megabytes it's definitely on 100
megabytes and that will fix the key
bindings issue so you'll be able to save
your key bindings properly in the menu
is the next problem so well this one's
less of a problem actually more of a
location thing just to help you out so
the Dark Souls 3 save file location is
in the it's it's on the screen right now
you can see where it is it's in users
user name app data roaming Dark Souls 3
graphics config.xml is one of the top
items there and then if you go in
further there's a directory that's
alphanumeric and that contains your
savegame file you can pass that around
to friends they will be able to play
your game we did it in the office and it
worked out just fine
the graphics config thing that's in
there as well so this is useful for a
few reasons that are coming up and one
of them is that well first of all you
can do fine tuning and tweaking here not
a whole lot it's all the same stuff that
you see in the menus but if something
goes wrong you could reset it here and
the next reason it's important is
because of crashing CT DS black screens
flickering things of that nature if you
see any of those then short of doing a
driver uninstall which should definitely
do and reinstall them short of that
working one of the next best things to
do is delete that graphics file and then
go into steam or wherever verify the
integrity of game cache to reacquire it
you should back it up before you delete
it and once it's reacquired it will be
reset to the default graphics settings
and hopefully those will not break your
display device before you can get into
the options and actually change them
because that happened to us as well and
then the normal CTD is a lot of them
were fixed in that day 0 patch so
hopefully pulling that patch down for
really a various other reasons would fix
the CTD s but that covers most of the
stuff we've seen so far the big thing
here that I haven't really mentioned yet
because I don't have a fix for it is the
FPS limit and FPS drops so right now the
game is limited to 60 fps that was a
thing with Dark Souls 2 as well and
there was a hack that the community
created I was able to bypass this and
resolve it but Dark Souls 3 being brand
new doesn't have that yet I have not
found a way to unlock it perhaps someone
has bind up by the time this video goes
live
if they have a way out there to unlock
FPS you've found it then count below so
everyone else will benefit from it
I have not found a way to unlock FPS
from 60 I've tried the control panels
for nvidia and AMD and i've tried
forcing out vsync and all that stuff
it seems stuck at 60 and i believe the
game engine timing is tied to the
framerate so even unlocking it might not
actually be a good thing to do kind of
like with fallout 4 and that's really
all just lower level game logic so that
is all for our quick Dark Souls 3 sort
of crash fix pc port post launch guide
type thing hopefully that helps you out
and if you want to read our review on
the game or view it hit that channel and
you can see our video review of the game
and the article is linked in the
description below if you'd like to
actually read the review and see what we
thought about the pc port all together
because we recapped it pretty thoroughly
there so thank you for watching as
always patreon link special video to
helps out directly and I will see you
all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
