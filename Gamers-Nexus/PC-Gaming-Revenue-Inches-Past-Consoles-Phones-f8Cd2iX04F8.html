reported that PC gaming as a whole has
inched past console and even mobile
phone revenue in terms of the per year
amount earned or projected for 2016 and
PC games are now looking at a thirty one
point nine billion dollar annual revenue
through 2016 with their nearest
competitors like consoles being just
behind that PC games currently comprised
32% of annual global games market
revenue with 2.1 percent year-over-year
growth and its closest competitor of
course console gaming is projected to
generate 29 billion in 2016 or 29% of
the total marketplace which is nearly a
hundred billion dollars now and that's
got a 4.5 percent year-over-year growth
despite the growth pattern however both
device categories PC and consoles are
expected to stagnate and market share
and even lose a bit of their revenue
they currently have through 2019 with
their segments being sort of the set
upon by mobile devices the PC games
segment is broken down between quote
casual web games and PC MMO games or
more traditional PC gaming and it also
splits portables into personal screen
which means phones floating screen which
means tablets and handhelds and then
entertainment screens are in there as
well which is what your console segment
is represented by standalone phone
gaming revenue is reaching a staggering
27 point 1 billion against the mediums
age that's an impressive number anyway
and that's a 23 point 7 percent
year-over-year growth substantially
higher than its nearest competitors
handheld games comprise 1.8 billion of
the market with a twenty four point one
percent to you over year decline tablets
overall are sort of slowing in their
sales but there's still a software sales
growth of fifteen point one percent
year-over-year to the 10 billion portion
of the industry casual web games 5.2
billion in PC revenue somewhat
surprisingly and are declining by 7.5
percent year-over-year PC and MMO of
course the core segments most of you are
in this category consists of twenty six
point seven billion of the total 31.9 PC
revenue subtracting out the casual web
game segment so unsurprisingly the
asia-pacific region has 58 percent of
the global games
to share for the total saw through sales
revenue North America Canada in the US
has about twenty five percent right now
and then the rest of the segment in the
graphs is broken down into basically a
collection of Europe Africa and some of
Eastern Europe so overall of course Asia
has got the biggest market chair right
now aus is pretty close behind and then
the rest is is sort of filling in the
cracks you can find more information
