you missed the for our livestream of 31
SOT 5x overclocking last night we did
end up taking second place four times by
extreme dual GPU were right behind ODS
and we're ahead of dare Bauer who is now
officially put on notice so Roman it's
time for me to step it up I know I know
Rowan's got a doubt 3175 axe he had a
higher overclock than I was with liquid
nitrogen but he didn't do it is why
extreme benchmark with two GPUs I don't
know if he did one at all actually but
did Cinebench for sure so roman AKA day
bauer we're waiting for your return to
second place for for this benchmark so
yeah we're in second now we are behind
the OGS by 3 or 400 points total the
problem is that OGS is score is
comprised primarily of GPU so we're
ahead and CPU there but times by extreme
really likes GPU so let's let's just
recap what we have for set up and show
you where the 3175 axe ended up before
that this video is brought to you by
thermal grizzly and their high-end
thermal compounds thermal grizzly makes
cryo not paste for high thermal
performance and conductivity without
being electrically conductive so you
don't have to worry about shorting
components Crona is particularly good
for replacing stock GPU pastes as cryo
not is a non curing compound learn more
at the link in the description below so
for where we ended up the the big
question was with chilled water which is
what in tell you is that combi tax can
we got the 3125 x2 about the same place
they had it so they were at 5 gigahertz
and we we did do that so we got with a
5.1 gigahertz stable I think was one
point for 2 volts at that point for V
core VCC in was something like 2.1 ish
and we were fine it could have gone a
bit higher but start needing some exotic
cooling so 31 35 X does do in fact 5 +
gigahertz on chilled water that is not
really that useful to know because
you're probably not gonna use chilled
water but for purposes of benchmarking
it's possible power drought during times
by extreme was spiking to about 800
watts and Cinebench goes a bit higher
because it requires more voltage to run
the same clock stable we actually
struggled with Cinebench and stopped at
about 4.8
the mesh or mesh rather was at 30
3x for the bigger overclocked four times
by extreme and a V mash was about one
point two eight 1.25 in that range
memory were really lazy with so I ran
with just six of these Corsair sticks
because they are mismatched but we had
the most of them and these are only
thirty-two hundred megahertz so at the
end we switched them to six g.skill
sticks that are also mismatched random
at just 36 hundred megahertz CL 16 so
that is absolutely the weakest part of
the benchmarking but after four hours
didn't really want to play with memory
so we'll put up if we should have
already but we'll have screens
screenshots of the scores that we can
put up for you and we ended up at
sixteen thousand six hundred sixty three
four the total score times by extreme
which is behind 17 2016 4 o gs ahead of
16 365 we gunslinger and a head of 16 2
48 for dare Bower and then the the score
was comprised of a sixteen thousand
eight seventy graphics and 15 five 585
for CPU score so that CPU scores pretty
insane and shows the scaling that
happens with the 31 35 X their Bower for
example had a 79 80 X II that was at
13,000 points and his graphics score was
a bit higher than ours so Roman was
using 220 ATT eyes and I think had an
i2c connector like a volt mod on them
which is what allows him to get a bit
higher at graphic score but we kind of
compensate a bit with the Titan RT axis
so Roman definitely has a chance cuz
times pi extremes mostly graphics but
our graphics core isn't better than his
so if he wanted to do alan - he could do
it as for the rest interesting points I
guess with Cinebench at 4.8 gigahertz
we're doing 64 hundred points for there
abouts plus or minus 40 and then I
believe Intel score is in the seven
thousands or something for there 31 35 X
benchmark they did at Computex but I
don't know what memory they were using
it's probably out there somewhere the
bench itself will show you
so the bench there's still cold water in
here but it was obviously ice most of
yesterday night and we were just running
with two more well one more three
radiator and then one five hundred sixty
millimeter radiator that's cold from ek
so this is a separate loop for the GPU
and then the bigger one is used for the
CPU and the reason we did that is just
so that the water doesn't get warmed by
the GPUs before it hits the CPU so ice
melts a lot faster this way because
we're dumping like 1300 watts into the
bucket sometimes but it does cool things
more effectively so CP is on its own
loop we're using an e k WS block which
we have footage of it from CES we can
show you
it's a workstation block they just
showed and came out with so we use that
that's hooked up with the CMT tubing to
the dual d DC to the bigger reservoir
and then the smaller EK pump res combo
these for the GPUs which you've all seen
this stuff before in the past
motherboards the Dominus we have two
power supplies for it we ran an ax 1600
I just grabbed what I had available so X
1600 I for the GPUs and then a EVGA 1600
watt for the CPU and we only used for
reference for power connectors so think
I don't remember how many pins a heads
total but it's got another two EPs eight
that we could use and we didn't because
it's not necessary so that's the bench
settings again I went over them already
but it's about 50/50 1x for the ratio
are submitted scores 50 and then 1.4 2
volts about two 2.14 beasts in and then
we had the mesh at 33 X and all the
power limits lifted and stuff like that
so for what next we've officially beaten
Deb our score of course all in good fun
he's we were messaging this morning and
I think he could definitely beat our
score if you wanted to go and post an
Allen 2-1 it's just a matter of getting
the GPUs out so Roman respond whenever
you feel like it I guess but if you
don't know who he is go subscribe to
dare bower on YouTube and hopefully we
can have some fun back and forth once
both of us find the time to do more and
if Rowan does decide to go Allen to we
now we have the capabilities to do it as
well so we got the Dewar in and we're
mostly geared up for it
I do have a there Bower beast pot so
this whether or not he responds really
matter if he responds it's just just a
fun back-and-forth game for us but if he
doesn't
we are still planning to do some
liquid-nitrogen overclocking because
Roman was kind enough to send this along
previously and we just needed a mounting
bracket for the 30 125 X even if we
don't get that soon though that's that's
from ACS even if we don't get it soon we
can still use this for other things like
I don't know let me know in the comments
I guess what you would like I see what
you would like to see us apply this to
for overclocking for sure it can fit on
most of the standard mainstream
platforms so we do 9900 K you can do 99
80 XE stuff like that maybe some rise
and stuff I don't know let us know in
the comments what you'd like to see
happen on the x OC side I guess because
we're new to it and can kind of learn
with some of the parts that you're
interested in rather than just going
with the obvious biggest processor there
is so yeah comments below for what you
want to see next we are of course doing
normal reviews every pretty much every
couple days we're filming reviews still
so they'll see plenty of those coming up
this week ask Jen's coming up this week
news videos all that stuff but
occasionally we'll have some XOC in
there as we kind of get used to this
stuff so you'll see more of it but it's
not displace in anything and so and I
think this will be the second video
going up for today depending on these e3
90 dark vrm video so that's it for this
one thank you for watching thanks for
watching the stream there's a lot of fun
and we enjoyed having you all in chat of
course enjoyed going back and forth with
with chat on some of the XOC members
were in there talking about their own CP
scores and how to beat them and stuff
like that lots of fun we appreciate
everyone watching and yeah 5 gigahertz
was possible on the 3125 axe I didn't
tell show it at Computex but it did in
fact require a chiller so impressive CPU
for scoring though and times by extreme
impressively scales with all of the
cores very well so that's it for this
one thank you for watching subscribe for
more I'll see you all next time
I and welcome to a new video on my
channel today we are talking about the
Intel 3,175 X CPU for overclocking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
