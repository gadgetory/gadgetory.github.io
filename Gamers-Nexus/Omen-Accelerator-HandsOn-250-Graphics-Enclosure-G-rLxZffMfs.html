HP omen booth omen is the gaming brand
of HP I'm looking at something that's
pretty new so this was teased back in
June I think but it's new as of a couple
days ago as and you can buy it so this
is the HP omen accelerator it is another
of the external graphics solutions and
this one is $250 for the MSRP it
includes a 500 watt power supply and
we're going to go over the rest of the
specs through this video before getting
to that this coverage is brought to you
by the EVGA 1080i sc2 and NVIDIA Destiny
to bundle running up through September
4th a 1080i SC to comes with a
synchronous pain control for it to duel
fans and nine thermal sensors and again
includes destiny to learn more at the
link in the description below so getting
started the enclosure is pretty easy to
open this is your other half of the
panel that I've already removed and
removed by one switch so there's a lever
you pull it it comes off and that's the
end of the story there once you're
inside it's got two slot PCIe support so
up to to slog graphics cards and there
is actually ventilation on the bottom
here so that's that's what we like to
see some of the other external solutions
really don't do great with ventilation
but this one's got a little bit of
meshing down here so if you have a dual
axial fan or something like that you'll
be a little bit better off than if it
were just a solid piece of metal for the
rest
there's presently I think a 120
millimeter fan in the front of this case
and the 120 blows directly into both the
power supply and the card the power
supply does not have its own fan the one
that HP includes it's an 80 plus bronze
PSU it's somewhat proprietary because
it's just a 24 pin for the PCB the PCB
being what hosts the GPU and then 2 6 +
2 pin connectors to the video card so no
fat on that the front fan will ventilate
it just fine though and then GPU will
fit
a PCIe 16 we actually looked and it is
wired for x16
so it's true x16 now as far as length I
don't have a hard number for you but
we've worked with every video card on
the market currently that are large and
pretty much all of what fit maybe not a
hybrid card but everything else you good
internally looking also down here we've
got the PCB lower side we don't know
anything about it right now I've asked
we need to talk to engineering about
that's get more information talk about
the how the multiplexing or anything
like that works it raised it does so
much of some stuff on their core they've
done a lot of engineering on it it's
also a $500 MSRP it's a little bit plus
or minus depending where you buy it
single screw access back here it's just
a screwdriver pass through or you can
take all the paneling off everything
except is accessible by either an
alligator clip or a Philips screw and in
terms of the rest I mean it's it's
Thunderbolt so your protocol is
Thunderbolt connects to the laptop via
Thunderbolt just like always you can
connect one of these which i think is
what they've done right here and other
than that it's got a USB 3.1 type-c and
a couple of USB 3.0 Taipei's I think
they are maybe four of them on the back
plus an rj45 Ethernet and then
interestingly there's also a 2.5 inch
drive support in the front bottom of the
case so that will let you do I mean 2.5
inch rise that's just Eve hard drive
whatever you want to do which allows you
to store your games locally if you don't
have the capacity on a small lapse out
like that so that's kind of interesting
touch we haven't seen a whole lot of
that but yeah I think that covers most
of it I you get the PCBs probably
handling some of the data stuff the
storage control the processing from
sending everything back to the laptop
but we don't have any more information
than that on the technical side so
should be 250 bucks we'll have more
information on this later if there's
more to be had but otherwise that's your
first look at the HP omen accelerator as
always thank you for watching you can
