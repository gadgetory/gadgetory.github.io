reviews starting with the $130 r3 1300 X
CPU a fork or four thread units at 2.5
gigahertz base and 3.7 boost the r3 1300
X competes most directly with the Intel
i3 line where Intel Zone G 4560 already
strikes hard this lands the r3 at 1300 X
pricing about 20 dollars below nearby i3
CPUs at about 40 to 50 dollars below
nearby r5 CPUs today we're looking at
the r3 1300 x4 thermal power gaming
performance and some production
workloads before that this is brought to
you by EVGA s at CLC 280 liquid cooler
for CPUs which we previously benchmarked
and found to be a high performer given
its relative silence the temperature
output learn more about this $140 cooler
at the link in the description below and
immediately before even getting into
numbers the effects of the r3 CPUs can
be felt the i3 70 to 50 K let CPU that
we previously said was good had great
ideas but had a terrible price when it
launched is not $150 that's a pretty big
change in price and it was originally in
the 180 territory at which point you
really might as well have bought an i-5
when it came out or later in r5 as we
said in our review of the are 5s but now
at 150 that's a big difference and that
change is almost certainly because of
the pressure felt at the lower end and
mid-range markets placed by AMD with the
r5 s and now with the r3 CPUs coming out
today so that's immediate noticeable and
that's an important thing the 1750 K is
therefore a somewhat comparable product
in terms of price it's $20 more than the
closest r3 CPU the 1300 X and the 7300
is actually now about the same price as
the 70 250 K on all major US retailers
that we've checked both being around
$150 or previously it was 150 and 180
for those two SKUs the r3 1200 review is
the other counterparts to the 1300 X
we're reviewing today and we do have a
separate review for that one it will go
up probably tomorrow
so subscribe to that if you want to
catch that one today though we're
focusing entirely on power thermals and
gaming performance with some production
workloads on the 1300 X it's enough to
focus on for one thing including tests
on the stock cooler so we tested the
stock that's shipped with the unit and
tested it in stock CPU configuration
with a torture workload and Prime and a
realistic workload and blender and into
the same two workloads for an overclock
configuration we'll get through those
results today as well as some power
testing done at the EPS 12-volt cables
coming out of power supply directly
rather than using wall meter
measurements so that improves our
accuracy greatly to a point where plus
or minus 2% basically so let's get into
all that will start with power for the
testing methodology for all the stuff
you can check the link in the
description below to the article that
covers the testing that we're doing and
then has additional benchmarks and
charts in the article that won't be in
this video just for time purposes and
length of the video we have a bunch more
synthetic tests that will be in there on
with some extra thermal and power tests
looking at power first under idle
Windows 10 conditions the and the r3
1300 x stock Seaview consumes about 3.7
watts with plus or minus 2 percent error
for comparison the Intel i3 73 50k is
showing 4.9 watts or about 7 watts when
overclocked keep in mind that this is
the first time we're really adding the
EPS 12 volt power readings for CPUs so
that means these charts are sparse we
are well aware of that and are adding
things as we go these will grow with
time as always moving on to a blender
workload blender consume the 42 watts
for the stock 3100 X with an
overclocking increasing power
consumption 252 watts that's about a 24%
power consumption increase for what we
later find out to be a 4.6 percent
render time reduction the i3 72 50k
meanwhile consumes about 29.5 watts
during this workload with the
overclocked growing power consumption to
49 point 2 watts the 1750 K appears to
be less power Andriy than the r3 1300 X
as of now moving on to a fire strike
physics test shows us some gaming
workloads placing the 70 350 K at 22
watts 1300 X at thirty eight watts
consumption at EPS 12 volt again with
the overclock 1750 K at 39 point 4 Watts
when on a 1.3 5 volt V Corps the 1300 X
pushes to 47 watts when
requires as well within 0.1 volt offset
total war Warhammer is our real gaming
workload the 7250 Capo's 23 watts to run
this game with the 1,300 X at 42 watts
stock overclocking increases their power
consumption metrics to 54 watts on the
1300 x + 58 watts on the 70 to 50k with
prime95 l FFT is version 28 point 5 we
observed a power consumption of 39 watts
on the 70 50k and 56 point six watts on
the r3 1300 X with the overclocked
counterparts at 59 and 64 watts
respectively the additional power
consumption metrics in the article link
below
next with thermals we've completely
overhauled our thermal testing procedure
for CPUs this is also brand-new and so
this one starts out with just the stock
cooler performance or expanding this for
a feature piece tune and it will recap
all the CPUs with our new testing or at
least all the major ones along with the
stock cooler testing for each of those
note that we ran all of our actual
testing with the standard X 62 that we
always use so no thermal throttling
occurred as for the stock cooler
operating temperature landed at 59
Celsius when executing a blender
workload with the stock configuration
and max fan speed that's definitely
getting up there but not deadly yet
prime95 29.2 with 8k sizes burned at 74
C which is rapidly approaching the 85 C
shutdown threshold that we encountered
when running the stock core with our
overclock so the stock cooler could not
sustain our overclocks at all it would
just thermal crash eventually from a
shutdown temperature of around 85
Celsius depending on what we were doing
and how quickly the thing heated up this
also produced some interesting power
leakage numbers and you can look at the
stock not overclocked temperatures the
best for that because the overclocked
one just didn't survive long enough to
really show any power leakage as other
than just a runaway and eventual
shutdown scenario but this shows the
over time plot of power consumption as
we draw more power from higher thermals
and just leakage overall with these
stock configuration 30 and X and the
stock cooler before we get into gaming
performance let's take a look at blender
animation render
and premiere in code times with our
in-house blender testing the Andy risin
are three thirteen hundred ex stock CPU
with no overclocked completes the render
in eighty nine dot two minutes the CP is
ranked just ahead of an these are once
flagship FX 83-70 and that's stock and
just behind Intel's Nehalem i7 930 CPU
or about eight point six percent behind
the i5 2500 k overclocked to four point
five gigahertz similarly and just for
historical context really the are three
CPU the 1300 X is behind the Phenom 2 X
6 CPU overclock switch sit around 81
minutes compared more reasonably to the
recent generation products the r3 1300 X
CPU completes its render about 2 minutes
faster than the stock I 373 50k for a
time reduction of 2.3 percent
overclocking the r3 1300 X results in a
render time reduction of 4.6 percent
from stock r3 setup or 6.8 percent from
the stock 73 50k overclocking me 72 50 K
to 5 gigahertz boost its speed to about
seventy eight point three minutes
reducing render time by 12.2% from the
overclocked 1300 X using an r5 CPU would
net a significant boost as shown here
will highlight a couple of them if CPU
rendering on a budget is in your use
cases
you should really consider stepping up
to an r5 series CPU they make a whole
lot more sense for this type of task and
they're good performers overall the
extra $40 for a low-end unit would be
worth it in this case but ideally if you
can stretch the bit higher SKU then it
might be worthwhile for a budget
rendering machine as our three
ultimately suffers from only having four
threads available that said if you use
CUDA for everything anyway then it
doesn't matter quite as much
speaking of CUDA rendering a 1080p at 60
AVCHD source video into a video card
review with Adobe Premiere takes 156
minutes on the rs3 1300 x1 overclocked
to 4 gigahertz so it's 2.5 hours to
finish the render the 1500 X stock CPU
reduces this time requirement by 19% we
didn't bother running the test stock on
the 13 out of X because it just would
take far too much time to be worth it at
this point you really shouldn't be using
these products in this manner anyway
premier is not as good of a use case for
the r3 CPU does for the
r5s previously don't be talked into
thinking that the r3 will suffice for
any meaningful production work in Adobe
Premiere either rendering can be
drastically accelerated by CUDA in some
instances like an hour test but that
doesn't help with certain types of
effects or some preview playback
although it is possible to use an r3 CV
for this task we would strongly
recommend purchasing something better
suited for video production if that's
the desire r7 1700 is a good place to
look for a more professional outfit
where you make some money or maybe the
r5 again there's something where it's
more of a hobby we have additional
synthetic and production testing in the
article so you can check the link in the
description below for Cinebench
multi-threaded and single threaded
pov-ray fire strike and time spy and I
believe a couple others are down there
as well with the power testing that
wasn't covered here now though we're
going to move into gaming for the r3
1300 X started with total war Warhammer
first note that items containing
asterisks have been rerun with the most
recent version of total war hammer which
we plotted previously in our eyes and
revisit coverage as improving fps by
several percentage points on both AMD
and Intel CPUs all the relevant units
were updated for this review and
previously we found that the performance
uplift for Rison when this game updated
derived from the game update itself
which also benefited intel so it wasn't
just some arbitrary BIOS update or
something like that that just magically
fixed performances actually developers
waking up and using the extra threads
and optimizing their game code the MDR 3
1300 x stock cpu performs at an average
frame rate of 118 FPS with low that's
seventy one one percent and 65 G over
one percent the closest current gen
neighbor is the i3 7300 stock CPU at 128
FPS average with low as compare ibly
times given that these 70 370 250k have
both been at $150 for a while now we can
nicely look to the 72 50k style
performance at 134 FPS average this
plans to the seventy three hundred and
seventeen fifty K eight percent and 13
percent ahead of the 1300 X stock CPU
respectively the 7300 is it locked so
that's the end of its performance
overclocking the 1300 x2 4.1 gigahertz
permits the r3 CPU under test today
those are past the 7300 in-game
performance with this title that's
everything 50k
o'clock to 5 gigahertz boost to 150 FPS
average leading the 1300 x OC by 16% in
average FPS with lows also ahead in the
total war update battlefield 1 is next
and is also on the list of titles that
received an update boosting both Intel
and and the performance following the
rise and launch in this game the 1300 X
operates an average FPS of 110 which
places our 3tu ahead of the FX 8270 and
i7 930 by about 14% the G 4560 leads the
r3 1300 x stock CPU by about 2%
battlefield 1 has routinely shown strong
performance on these Intel CPUs so this
isn't all that surprising overclocking
the 1300 X bolsters performance to 116
FPS average and that's a gain of 5.9%
over stock performance for those keeping
track this lands the 1300 x OC around
the 2500 K and for a current gen
comparison instead the 7300 cpu averages
125 FPS for the 14% lead at gains over
the stock 1300 X and 7.8% Lita gains
over the overclocked 1300 X looking to
the 1750 K which receives its price drop
almost certainly because of rising 3s
launch and so Verizon 3 is already doing
its job prevalent leads by 17% at 128
FPS average stock or 17% when both these
70 250 K and 1300 XR overclocked
watchdogs 2 has proven to be a heavily
multi-threaded game and has benefited
from iron core and thread counts in the
past but also cares about the frequency
still as most games do here's the r3
1300 X CPU operates at 51 FPS average
stock with lows at 41% and 32.5 0.1%
overclocking to 4.1 gigahertz gets us an
improvement of 7.3% now at 50 4.5 FPS
average instead this plants the i3 6300
right between the r3 1300 X stock and
overclocked values at this before FPS
average and runs the 1300 X stock CPU
behind the 7300 block CPU by 16 percent
that's pretty comparable to what we've
been seen in the rest of the test so far
overclocking closes of the 7300 lead
27.9% the 72 50k stock CPU manages 66
FPS average for a lead of 30% stock over
the 1300 X and our talking doesn't do
much for the 1750 KS performance here
it's already
quite high that we do gain another
couple of frames per second ashes of the
singularity is mostly treated as a
synthetic benchmark in our test at this
point and so isn't really a game
scenario which is really useful scenario
we most need to understand scallion
particularly with a well optimized DX
well title the r3 1300 x5 CPU operates
at 21 FPS average placing it between the
i3 6300 to nfx 83-70 the i3 7300 CPU
operates 5.7 percent faster and over fog
in the 13 100x to four point one
gigahertz boosts it beyond the seventy
three hundred by three percent the 1750
K stock CEO outperforms the 1300 actor
overclocked Seaview marginally though
sustains better low-end performance and
over parking the study 350 K boosts it
to 16% ahead of the 1300 X overclocked
which again remains consistent with
previous tests is about the same spacing
as we've been seen for more gaming
benchmarks additional power and thermal
tests and synthetics be sure to check
the full written review that's the link
of the description below
again this contains a couple of extra
game at charts starter three TVs are
interesting they're not quite as
clear-cut a decision as the r5 T P is
where we've more or less said buy these
instead of the i5 s going forward unless
asterisks some special situation applies
these though are interesting primarily
because they've already forced Intel to
respond with the 30 to 50 K price
reduction or at least they contributed
to that response and that's helpful the
180 price point previously was just
untenable
this makes the 1750 K a real competitor
it's not too distant in price now and
it's unlocked whereas the 7,300 priced
out the same on Newegg and Amazon for us
buyers is locked and just not as good
period and same price so we can kind of
forget about that one until a point that
was the 30 to 50 K changes in price
whether it's every 300 drops in price at
which point we evaluate our charts
because they have the data for you if
you need it
so the 1750 K is interesting Anthea 1300
ex runs a $130 price target this makes
it 20 dollars cheaper than the 70 to 50
K it is a reasonable performer in games
if generally behind the 70 to 50 K and
the 7300 again generally speaking so it
manages a decent performance overall but
it's still a little bit behind in
performs and
a production synthetic type workloads
the 1,300 acts isn't as impressive as
the higher-end r5 CPUs where you have
more cores and threads and so they
perform better the 1,300 acts ultimately
is a fork or four thread parts and if
it's competing against other four core
or four thread parts even if there are
two core and four threads really it's
going to be closed it just comes down to
frequency at that point and other
potential architectural optimizations or
software level optimizations because at
that point you don't have the brute
force power of something like a 1,700
where you've got way more threads and
just will clearly dominate and attest
that as thread limited so again some 70
350 K something like blender just
doesn't make the 1300 X look as good as
the blender tested for previous launches
like the r5 CPUs versus the very thread
and court limited I 5 CPS by comparison
that means that for our perspective on
this if you are actually serious about
doing something with production other
than just brandishing the results to say
this is what the CPU does we would
recommend that you strongly consider an
r5 if you're looking at an r3 and
considering using it for blender it
probably means that you're on a pretty
tight budget if that's the case if you
can manage to shore up another $40 or
$60 and you're not going to benefit from
something like CUDA acceleration that
much then we'd recommend going for an r5
not an i-5 and r5 to be clear if you
can't afford that just look at our
benchmarks and all the other ones and
try and piece together what makes sense
for you ultimately the r3 CP is pose a
real threat to Intel i3 lineups the g45
6p holds strong at the cheaper price
point but the r3 doesn't challenge in
that territory the i3 is however have
already been weakened by Intel's own G
45 60 and now by ambe's our threes the
i3 70 50k is a superior CPU and nearly
all the gaming tests and manages to hold
a lead in blender rendering on to
overclock but not stock stock the 1300 X
outperforms the 1750 K in our blender
test the next major differentiator is
the IGP if that's of interest cost can
be saved by going with the Intel i3 part
it's actually using the IGP and not just
letting it sit there with a d GPU
this helps hold the line for SI
we're an IGBT might be preferred forbids
client type systems so we may see AMD
growth in that market sector which is
certainly important for gaming builds
that's not much of a concern and the r3
1,300 X can help save $20 by cutting the
IDP and then resorting to a d GPU for
your gaming performance as for the stock
cooler it's not terribly loud so Andy is
at least done decently there
unfortunately it's also not terribly
good it's it's actually kind of bad so
if you're doing any kind of overclocking
at all just get rid of this immediately
repurpose it as perhaps a hockey puck
and then get a real cooler even if it's
a $20 cooler because we were seeing
thermal shutdowns at 1300 X when
overclocking it to our anywhere really
in the 3.9 to 4 point 1 gigahertz range
even was as low as an offset of 0.1
volts with a with a voltage offset so
it's the plan is to overclock and you
can gain a decent amount of performance
from overclocking so we would encourage
it within normal warranty reason them
and not slowing things up then get a
better cooler otherwise if you don't
plan the overclock it's not terrible
it'll keep the thin alive it won't
scream like some of the other coolers
that intel has made in the past and AMD
to be fair but it's not very good so
this is the kind of thing you replace a
little bit later maybe after the thermal
compound has turned into thermal
concrete anyway and you need to replace
it with a better cooling solution the R
3 CPUs compete well we still think that
AMD estranja is in the r5 territory so
the r5 1600 1600 XR the most interesting
to us we gave the r5 1600 X an Editors
Choice Award and highly recommended it
over the i-5 7600 K at its price point
so those still have our interest
primarily not everyone can afford those
and that's fine at that point it makes
little sense to buy an i-5 you're
looking at our 3s and i3 s our threes
round out an T's pack and now it's
basically are you gaming or do you have
I don't know it's even even outside the
gaming scenarios now you're looking at
four threads versus four threads so in
something like blender it just doesn't
matter just whatever clocks higher and
has better optimization it's going to
win so it just it comes down to does the
r3 offer something specifically you want
maybe there
some sort of power reason you'd want it
or maybe you have platform reasons if
you want a m4 rather than an Intel
platform there's a potential argument
that you have a wider length for upgrade
pathways by going in for so if the plan
is to buy low in CPU like an i3 or an r3
and you're looking to the distant future
then potentially the amp or platform
will get you further with the next den
launch because if you're trying to stick
with the same platform same everything
same LS will be a lot easier to drop
into CPU that's the valid reason to go
our three instead of i3 at this point
even though the i3 is pushing better
performance in gaming workloads and
things like that so that's an item to
think about upgrade pathways saving a
couple bucks $20 cheaper and potentially
ending up with a cooler that's not
terrible unless you're overclocking so
that could save you some money as well
but that's all for this one as always
