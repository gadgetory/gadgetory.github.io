show floor coverage and I'm at the
Gigabyte Street right now looking at
some of the new X 299 motherboards which
were just announced today as of filming
actually so there are four main boards
behind me that are X 299 till the other
ones are d2 70 they're not the focus of
not the point of interest today for X to
99 we're going through the gaming 9
gaming 7 3 and go down the line from
there before getting to that this
coverage is brought to you by Corsair
and their vengeance RGB LED memory kits
you find a link for that in the
description below the RGB LED Corsair
kits block fairly high and our
pre-selected ICS for overclocking
potential let's go through the basics
here to clear a few things up X - 9 + 9
be new with the Intel skylake action KB
like X launch have a few points of
confusion still one of those is the dims
so there are 4 dimms per side just like
with X 99 as you would expect but with X
- 99 the actual concern here or the
question is what happens when you have
KB leg X because kb leg X being based on
KB Lake architecture naturally it's
really not meant to be used with a dim
so the answer just to clarify this these
gone use so you ought to be using the
four dams on the right side and that's
it you don't get the other four dims
those are for the sky like xcp use only
so with that cleared up we go over some
of the rest of this these boards are all
using the same vrm so in terms of erm
design we'll talk about that with build
Zoid separately but the most important
point is just the MOSFETs on here and
the controller that we've already seen
and those are all International
rectifier components so I used some of
the same parts that we just toss out
with EVGA X 299 stuff they're pretty
popular right now
the ir35 66 or 35:56 component so
International rectifier is 35:56 is the
MOSFETs up these are 8 4 v core on all
the boards behind me every single board
8 4 v core and then there's 2+2 4 the
memory for each side so that's the stuff
there
the controller is voltage controllers
also I are beyond that stuff there are a
couple of points of interest on the
board
well let's start with the gaming nine I
don't have a price on any of these yeah
by the way the gaming lines got all the
RGB stuff as you would expect Digital
RGB up here and everything is
configurable through software as usual
the one item I want to point out in the
bottom is this IRS de porc so this is
actually a special 4 pin connector for
basically a virtual rate so you have
problem where with rate if you're
running something like for 750 for
example you can't cross DMI from the
chipset so CPU and tap into those lanes
this helps us that by virtualizing the
rate some extent they've actually got it
for 750 set up immediately set up to the
side over here other than that they've
got the mq shield so we talked about
these in the past quite a bit we've done
extra testing on them as well and on the
MSI 1 so kind of runs a bit hot these we
are told should solve some of that
problem by adding actual fins to the top
of it
not like they're the biggest pins in the
world or the most dense pins but they do
have been to the top of each of the m2
slot and then there's a thermal pad on
the inside that connects to the m dot 2
device don't have the thermal
conductivity or resistivity of it or
anything like that but that's the basics
beyond that it's a it's an X 99 type
motherboard just X 299 so that's the
gaming 9 that'll be the flagship same
vrm on this one same be around here same
vrm here it's all IR stuff it's just
some different let's LEDs for example no
RGB LEDs in the memory slot here you
want to save some money you could do it
by buying the board's like that you kill
some of the LEDs and you get the same VR
app so not a bad trade they also have an
ultra durable 4 which is I believe again
the same BRM the only one that's not is
the workstation board so the ultra
durable 4 is the zero frills board that
gigabyte is showing here with X 299 no
RGB LED is none of this armor stuff on
the PCIe slot none of the armor on the
RAM
so it drives tossed out of it still
should be priced above the gaming three
though which is actually on the far left
over here so still be priced above that
that ultra-durable for that is but I
think that runs us through the basics of
the gigabyte line the BRM is the biggest
point of interest that we're talking
about right now we'll have more
information as always linked in the
article in the description below so that
article contains additional stuff I
didn't talk about here on the floor
because it allows busy check that out as
always you go to patreon.com/scishow
next that directly or you can go to
store cameras next and found out to buy
a shirt thank you for watching I'll see
you all next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
