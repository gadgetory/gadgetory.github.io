headquarters and the first part of this
tour is going to be the EMI lab so we're
looking at a few different places at MSI
HQ in Taiwan and we have a clip from the
acoustic testing room we have another
room in sa room that we'll look at and
we wanted to start here at the EMI lab
because it's actually it's really
interesting stuff before that this video
is brought to you by be quiet and it's
straight power 11 series power supplies
the straight power 11 PS use ship from
450 Watts up to a thousand watts
accommodating most of the gaming PC
build requirements you'd encounter and
focuses on delivering a higher quality
power supply that doesn't sacrifice on
efficiency or stability noise is also a
heavy point for the straight power 11
using a 135 millimeters silent winds
three fan that can spin as low as 200
rpm for quieter low load operation learn
more at the link in the description
below first of all you'll notice the
paneling is sort of similar in some ways
to an acoustic room like a semi anechoic
or anechoic chamber except this is used
for radiation testing instead of
acoustics so in this instance there's
the foam paneling on the walls there's
metal paneling on the wall behind that
and this is setup all for absorption to
reduce the influence of bounces from
radiation or from EMI on the antenna
behind me and there are two types of
antenna used where so one of them here
is a smaller horn antenna and the range
on this one is 1 gigahertz to 6
gigahertz for the signal that it's
looking for the larger one here can
actually move up and down and we have
some footage of that too and it's used
for Cee compliance testing so you have
different standards around the world
depending on where you want to sell your
product and they have to comply with
different radiation or EMI
electromagnetic interference standards
and so C II is one of those and MSI
complies with the c ii standard so it
has to push its components through
testing to make sure that it meets those
standards for EMI and what msi is doing
here is testing a full system they have
ways to isolate for individual
components so if they want to isolate
for their VGA or for their motherboard
they can't ask to ensure that those in
the
component sweetness back this is all pre
testing its pre validation so after msi
goes through pre testing with their
components here they take the component
send it out to another lab third party
lab for official final specification
testing and making sure it's compliant
so they can receive the c ii badge or
whatever badge it may be so the antenna
on the other side of the room they
receive direct radiation the paneling
around the rooms ensures that there's no
sort of application no picking up of
unnecessary noise unnecessary radiation
that's just direct feed from the system
under test or from the d UT and so
they're different test patterns the one
that's on the screen right now is
actually a vga test pattern they
generate some kind of load for the
system or the device under test and then
that's fed through a system that we
can't show you unfortunately but there's
a system outside of the room that reads
all of the what the antenna is picking
up and so then msi can validate if it's
meeting their spec and so the spec that
msi use is a minus 6 DB which is
actually lower than what they have to
meet so when they send the system out or
send the component out for further
validation there's some Headroom there
just in case there's a difference in how
the chambers are set up in different
locations and speaking of the chamber
setup so this whole room is special
built for this we have actually we have
a shot of the door opening to if we
haven't used it already and the door is
a giant metal door there's metal
paneling all on the outside of the room
metal paneling in the whole inside of
the room the corners of the room are
very specifically angled as well with
metal panels it's on a flush corner then
you have foam paneling here foam
paneling there the antenna of course and
everything else in the room so total
room cost or something like this is
somewhere between maybe 20 and 30
thousand USD somewhere in that range but
it's very important to insure seee
compliance and and ensure that the
designs are are good so if msi has any
issues with emi that can pick it up here
improve the design and then test it
again to make sure it validates for
compliance so this is used for testing
vga testing motherboard any other
components how much i might make
and then system under test is here this
actually table can rotate so all the
cables are hooked up plugged into the
table in the center and that's plugged
in elsewhere now the cables are passed
through the wall and insulated as well
so pretty cool we have a shot of it all
rotating as well so they can detect they
can pick up
EMI from different angles make sure
everything is within spec no matter the
angle the systems that I think that
mostly describes this room oh and they
can also switch antennae on the big
moving one so they Emma so I can change
that out and use a different type of
antenna if they want and also you might
wonder what the nets for up there it's
just strictly for safety it doesn't do
anything else but in case something
falls down so there's a lot of
sensitivity here where if you're testing
in this lab you have to put your phone
into into airplane mode because the
machine will actually pick up that EMI
that Electric electromagnetic radiation
or interference and it'll pick up on the
graph and cause a big spike that isn't
obviously from the system so I think our
sound recording equipment doesn't create
too much EMI but that would pick up as
well in theory and it's all very
controlled as a test environment so
that's the EMI lab let's move on it's
one of the other ones maybe the acoustic
lab next you're gonna hear my voice
change in that one because it's an SM I
anechoic chamber so you'll hear my some
of the the bass will be removed and it's
pretty cool experience so for this room
probably the audio in the video my voice
will have changed at this point we're in
an in a semi anechoic chamber we've
filmed these before we did one at
Logitech's years and years ago and this
is MSI's semi anechoic chamber so it's
actually pretty cool the way these work
and you may already know some of this
but these big foam blocks of course used
for I believe in this case its
absorption there's normally there's a
few different ways you can deal with
sound so in a case at a PC case product
you might do absorption or like a
deflection basically where you just kind
of bounce it around until the sound wave
dies loses all of its power or you can
absorb it and there's a few other
methods too but for a room like this I
believe they're doing an absorption
approach and the idea is to get the
noise floor as low as possible so that
when you're testing the products you
have more room to scale you're testing
your test resolution so for example
when we do noise testing on cases in our
lab we don't have the budget of MSI or
Logitech so our noise floor is about 26
DBA which is pretty low it's it's good
for a quiet room but this will get you
much more accurate results because your
range for for the scale of noise that a
product will output is expanded so when
we test stuff we can't bring our test
resolution below 26 it's not possible
because the room is louder than that the
noise floor here is about 16 DBA and
this is set up so that there's padding
around the whole room including the
ceiling we have some shots of and the
padding is mostly just this stuff right
here in two corners there's slightly
changed foam blocks that are more square
and that's just to deal with the
deflection in the corners because you're
dealing with noise bouncing between
three surfaces three adjacent surfaces
the walls in the ceiling and so those
blocks change to deal with that noise in
an appropriate fashion in terms of
testing so right now MSI has one of
their cases set up in here MSI also does
notebook acoustic test and they do
testing for customers and the goal is to
check from these ten different
microphones in the room what the noise
levels are typically testing from the
front from a user scenario so where
would the user be seated realistically
versus a notebook and test the noise
output of that device and so that's the
basics the really cool thing with these
anechoic chambers or semi anechoic
chambers is always just how how insane
the change and type of sound is so when
we start our videos we do a clap to
synchronize the audio on the camera and
my mic and I don't know how well that
carries through in video but we'll do
one from somewhere else that's not an
anechoic chamber and it just deadens the
sound immediately it doesn't really feel
like it travels and bounces like it
would in a normal room the foam even
extends to the door so there's two doors
one of them has big foam blocks on it
there's foam between the door in the
wall and then there's a second door as
well so any point of entry is thoroughly
deadened by more foam so pretty cool
stuff the testing here MSI looks at
frequency so they can look at the the
type of sound in terms of
see looks at the DBA output there's some
isolation under the floor as well by the
way we're not sure exactly what it is
but to help with noise further and then
this as far as the ISO standards go
complies with 37 44 and 77 79 which I'm
not specifically familiar with but
there's ISO compliance so that msi can
do testing for partners and meet those
standards and in the dimensions of this
room so it was built as sort of added on
for MSI and the dimensions outer
dimension of this room is five point
four meters five point four and then
four point one five meters inner
dimensions a bit smaller counting the
foam blocks comes down to like 3.5
meters mostly well squared plus 2.7
meters and if for other specs the cables
are patched through the wall through
foam blocks and the point of that is
just to further isolate the noise you
have to get cables in here to plug into
the devices to running them through the
foam through the wall will ensure that
there's minimum sound getting in through
the walls through any potential holes so
pretty cool setup and if you want to see
more of stuff like this we do have an
old video tour of the Logitech sound
anechoic chamber as well and I guess
I'll also note that temperature and
humidity is controlled in here so we
have some shots of dehumidifiers things
like that an AC unit that I wish I wish
was on right now because it's pretty hot
in here so but let's move on to the next
lab so this is the acoustic lab really
cool stuff from MSI we're gonna check
out one of the other ones EMI or sa will
be next the last time a sight lab that
we're looking at is the signal analysis
lab or sa lab MSI's electrical engineers
use this lab to insure motherboards and
video cards are able to produce clean
signals that land within the specs of
the association's that set them so that
would be things like DisplayPort visa
specs and HDMI requirements testing is
also conducted to ensure USB ports on
motherboards meet the USB if'
requirements or that SATA ports meet
SATA standard requirements but MSI has
its display testing hooked up for us
today each device is connected to a
series of probes that connect two
different scopes which then measure the
signal through automated testing
engineers are able to view a full lab
report at the end of the test and see if
the device failed any tests and if it
did pass all the tests the engineer's
can prepare the video card or
motherboard to go out to the authorized
test centers or third-party validation
labs to receive that these
certifications needed for DisplayPort
HDMI or other standards the first test
station is outfitted with a Tektronix
DPO seven one six zero 4c it's a high
end oscilloscope that's a digital
phosphorous illis co but looks at a
signal on the time domain for less than
11 hours when validated for compliance
test standard version at 1.4 or cts 1.4
the compliance standards are provided by
the various display groups or other
interface groups depending on what's
being tested and must be met to ensure
that the device and its video output
surpasses all of these standardized
tests this includes a video cards and
motherboards alike
there are eye pattern tests for one
example where the signal output produces
divergent and convergent patterns with
specific amplitudes a single test
failure would mean one of the features
of device has failed and has to be
improved potentially by rerouting
circuit traces or redesigning the PCB or
updating firmware MSI is experienced
enough with this type of testing that
there is rarely a failure of this type
but if there is one Emma sighs equipped
to look at it and figure out where the
failure occurred and then fix it before
any kind of public launch on the
Tektronix DPO seven one six two zero
four C scope MSI currently has four
differential probes hooked up that each
accept a pair of wires coming from
DisplayPort connecting into the special
header at the back of the video card for
signal analysis there are four pairs of
differential signals coming out of the
DisplayPort that need to be tested which
is what we're looking at here the scope
captures the signal and uses an
auxilliary board positioned next to the
blue wires which automates testing and
runs through pre-programmed test
patterns and sequences to individually
benchmark the signal for all cts 1.4
requirements as for the green probes
these are SMA coaxial probes that are
meant for the same type of tasks but
just used for their different bandwidth
capabilities MSI also has a customized
PCIe test
that is used to balance the PCIe signal
this board validates PCIe electrical
compliance testing and quality circuit
trace design for the PCIe capabilities
via the video card the board can connect
either via PCIe by sixteen or by one
depending on the test and has groups of
probe connections for each standard for
PCIe by sixteen testing 16 pairs of data
lanes are connected to validate the
signal producing a mountain of data that
engineers have to use to ensure signal
quality this compliance load board has
dip switches for PCIe generations one
through three and will eventually need a
switch for PCIe Gen four but MSI cant
presently talk about the new interface
as for the Tektronix oscilloscope used
on we mentioned earlier this cost MSI
about twenty five thousand dollars USD
originally the purchase and configure
for testing and it's not even the most
expensive scope in the lab the next
battery of tests comes from the network
analyzer which is focused testing on PCB
impedance and s-parameter measurements
for these tests MSI connects
differential TDR probes or phase matched
stable coaxial cables for measurement of
impedance or insertion loss or return
loss from the device under test or D UT
these tests first have to be calibrated
which can be done with automation fairly
quickly or manually over the course of a
few hours and then msi connects the
probes to the d-o-t and adjust signal
pitch according to the signal traces
finally MSI's most impressive test
equipment is one which tests signal
receiving validating that the signal
output is the same as the one that is
received or sent in a loop this test is
exhaustive and has strict requirements
for accuracy and can be used for display
outputs SATA USB or other connection
standards for example in one test
pattern that wasn't running when we
visited pc is IG requires that of 10 to
the twelfth bits transmitted and
received only a single bit can produce
an error in order for the D UT to pass
PC is IG requirements this tests that
the output signal matches the input
signal on the other side moving back
into the oscilloscope for validation for
perspective this equipment cost I'm
sorry about
two times as much as the earlier
Tektronix scope we showed and is one of
the most impressive pieces of validation
hardware we've yet seen on our tour
