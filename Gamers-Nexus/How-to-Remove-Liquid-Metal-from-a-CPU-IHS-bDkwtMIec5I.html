clean liquid metal and thermal
interfaces off of components like CPUs
IHSS and other components like this one
here as you can see this one has a
little bit of thermal paste that got
into the socket not too much but we can
solve this problem fairly easily
fortunately and that is done just by we
recently did a video on how liquid metal
interacts with different other metals
like nickel plated copper this for
example it's been lapped on one side
sanded down so you can see that it's
copper the other side is just nickel
plating and this is common for any
integrated heat spreader getting the
crude metal off of this isn't too hard
but as many of you have asked us in the
past there is definitely some left
behind material and the question is
often how do I get rid of it so I'll be
talking about that today
then there are just straight copper heat
sinks like this or you could apply the
same tricks for cleaning this one to
something like your actual heat sinks a
cold plate a laptop cool or anything
like that the CPU would be silicon so
you'd be cleaning liquid metal off of
silicon and everything else is gonna be
some variant of a metal we're looking at
today so this video will help you with
removing liquid metal safely from your
devices so that it doesn't short
anything in the future or so that you
can reapply liquid metal or some
standard thermal paste instead because
it is something that moves around it can
cause problems and sometimes it's not so
easy to get rid of but we talked about
this a bit in our liquid metal corrosion
test video before that this video is
brought to you by the thermal take level
20 VT micro ATX case the level 20 VT
takes the high quality at level 20
design and makes it more affordable and
shrinks it down to a micro ATX form
factor at that with fully modular
paneling it's possible to rearrange this
case into whatever configuration you
prefer for a micro ATX case that can be
a discussion piece in a home theater
system click the link in the description
below let's start with the nickel plated
copper IHS because this is the most
standard thing you're cleaning off other
than silicon itself you shouldn't really
ever have to reapply liquid metal but if
for some reason you do maybe switch
systems and remove it honestly you can
just take something like we like the
blue shop towel
is a little bit more structurally sound
than standard white paper towel from a
shopping like any food store so you take
that put some rubbing alcohol on it and
that'll kill a lot of it immediately you
have to be careful with dropping any
liquid metal onto small surface mount
devices and potentially causing shorts
now sometimes this doesn't work so well
so for example if your liquid metal had
been sitting there for a lot longer than
this solution was you could move on to
something like just a clean q-tip and we
use these frequently for applying liquid
metal you can see that they have a lot
on there but if you take a clean one and
dunk it in rubbing alcohol that's great
for getting some of the more stuck
pieces but if you look at this you'll
see there's still some black marks and
some of that is going to be permanent
but it doesn't impact on all performance
in any meaningful way we've we've tested
it we talked about it in the previous
video about liquid metal corrosion
impact and not really big concern so as
you see most of it's gone we get some of
it on the outer edge you can either wipe
it off with a shop towel or get a q-tip
and clean it off with that you can also
by cleaning kits so this comes with the
cool labs solution and it's it's
overkill you don't need this stuff but I
suppose if you wanted it all in one kit
you could grab it it's just it's not
necessarily worth it this is just 70%
rubbing alcohol that's all it is it's
the same thing we just used except it's
pre applied so not really anything
special you'll see it still gets pushed
around and that's where q-tips come in
but otherwise it should just pick it up
and more or less disintegrate a lot of
the liquid metal that you see so we're
just going to push a lot of this over
and then if you wanted to you can
technically reclaim that by siphoning it
up how useful it is at that point I'm
not sure if we were doing testing we
just get rid of it and used some new
stuff but also for working with cracks
if you end up with liquid metal and
anything small like maybe it falls off
the IHS and into a small socket or
something you can grab a brush hobby
brushes worked great these are just
cleaning brushes and these will reach
into those sockets and pin holes and you
can hopefully hopefully get some of it
out with
because otherwise it will cause an
electrical short and cause problems so
that's fairly cleanable just a q-tip
with rubbing alcohol on it will do the
trick that'll pick most of this stuff up
you can push a bit harder and just get
as much of it as you can just so there's
no electrical shorts later and you're
good to go so that's most of it as you
can see just picks up like that there's
a bit more we can do here you get the
idea you just keep working on this until
you get all of it and that's that's
pretty good so we're in pretty good
shape here
now there is this black marring left and
there's not a lot you can do about that
it just know that it doesn't really
impact on all performance what you can
try to do is you can grab some acetone
which is just if you pick up some nail
polish remover at the store it should
have acetone in it do not use this on
silicon because sometimes nail polish
remover has not not friendly chemicals
for silicon so you don't need much of
this stuff doesn't smell great careful
when using it all that stuff but you can
get nail polish remover or acetone and
apply it same shop towel in this case
and it will take some some pressure but
you can get a bit of the black marring
off so here's after just hitting it a
few times with acetone you can see that
we're definitely getting some of that
material off that's what's left over of
the gallium indium and tin so that makes
it friendly with nickel-plated materials
like nickel plated copper but every now
and then you'll get some permanent
staining like that we can keep going
here you can keep applying you're not
going to get all of it you'll get a lot
of it but it's really not important now
the cleaning kits do include sort of
sponges or steel walls sometimes this is
something we don't recommend you're
better off just cleaning with rubbing
alcohol if you want to get stains as
much as you can acetone but the end of
the day you'll have some stains on there
and if you start using basically a
sanding material you will strip some of
the finish you'll strip some of the
nickel plating you'll strip out if it's
on the top side which obviously we don't
have but if you have names or right now
the top side will strip that off so we
don't recommend this solution because
all you're doing is scratching up the
surface and yeah you'll get the liquid
but you'll get everything that is on -
and there's no performance hit - having
that there so just just ignore it if you
get it to this point you're fine you
don't need to worry about anything else
this we would consider this clean and
then just start reapplying liquid metal
I mean to the touch it's completely flat
and smooth so this is staining and the
reason this happens is best described
with this thing so what's happening here
is there is a difference in potential
between the liquid metal which is a
gallon sand compound and the surface of
the IHS in this case it's copper so
there's no nickel plating and what we're
getting is ion migration where the
liquid metal as applied to the CPU die
which is under this thing this sort of
leg that sticks up the liquid metal will
slowly have some ion migration into the
copper surface which causes a stain
functionally your performance pretty
much the same
you've just plated it and it's still a
smooth surface can't feel any unsmooth
this it's not like it's not level and it
thermally it's fine performance isn't
really any different we've tested that
as well so if it bothers you you can try
and clean it off but just the chemical
properties of this stuff mean that it's
it's pretty permanently plated at this
point however we can't do a bit of work
on it and if you want more details on
some of the chemical processes of this
stuff check out our liquid metal
corrosion testing video which is on the
channel or we'll try and link it below
so this is rubbing alcohol and you'll
see that it's not really doing much
we've get some up every time but not
really a good choice for this so let's
move on to some acetone so with acetone
on here same process you can just kind
of try and rub some off and you'll get a
bit of it but end of the day this is
pretty permanent so and this is where
you could if you wanted to cause some
damage and start scratching the surface
he needs kind of a rougher sponge or a
steel wool but it is going to cause
damage so it's not worth it because it's
just there's no gain from it for you so
we would not recommend taking this
approach it'll rough from the surface up
and yeah get some of it out but to what
end there's no benefit so that's how you
clean that stuff let's get a CPU a piece
of silicon as well just to show that
that's pretty straightforward so
let's find a CPU we can clean so we have
a few here we have we have quite a few
CPU options I'm just gonna grab this is
all from our fans thank you to those of
you who sent them we haven't turned them
into art yet but this is just an AMD
turion CPU not something you'd really be
putting liquid metal on today but you
could so let's do that and then we'll
clean it off
all right so number one thing that
happens if you've seen the the first
time we ever use liquid metal and also
every time Linus uses liquid metal
you'll see that anyone who uses the
plunger on these things and even if you
just do the flick of the wrist method
which is what happens here if you use
the plunger you might end up with a
scenario where the liquid metal just
sprays everywhere and that kind of sucks
so best way to clean this up and beat
this is the the most common thing a
beginner will run into you is to get
hopefully an empty syringe but you could
hope you could also reuse the one that
you just used and just pull the plunger
and siphon it back into the tube so
pretty cool how that works that's the
best way to clean a liquid metal
spillage if you spray a lot of it all
over the device you're working on if
however you actually just spread it on
properly and you now want to clean it
afterwards
we can show that as well so in this
setup presently we have some liquid
metal over here we need to get that off
use a q-tip with rubbing alcohol on it
and just go over the area hopefully
you're already pre coded this with nail
polish or something so that you don't
have to worry about the liquid metal but
you can also go over the area with a
q-tip and a and just rubbing alcohol and
you'll see a lot of it's picking up
right there so that's pretty clean
there's one more piece of liquid metal
over here I'm just gonna push that out
alright so here's an example of a liquid
metal application where you might want
to remove it it's a little patchy it's
not perfectly flat consistency is poor
so this is a good time to remove it and
try again if you're applying liquid
metal for the first time or something
and for that again rubbing alcohol blue
shop towel or paper towel as much of it
as he can with
going over the edges and onto the SMDs
you can see that we're not spilling past
just the border here because I'm staying
right over the middle of the dye and
that will get most of it then for the
rest you pull out the q-tip again wet
one side with rubbing alcohol clean it
off and it will be good to go then you
just go over the SMDs
and make sure there's no liquid metal
left on those that could cause any
shorting electrical shorts couple small
flakes here and there but that's that's
more or less done that's how you clean
them so if you've been wondering how to
clean liquid metal off of a component
once you're done working on it that's
how you do it
cleaning the IHS is I think is probably
the biggest question people have had and
the answer to how do I get this off is
you can you can get a lot of it off but
not all of it the rest of it stains
there and if you are like neurotic about
cleaning it just try not to be because
using stuff like this you start sanding
down the surface and like I said it'll
get the liquid metal staying off but
it'll also get the metal off so that
point you line up with worse performance
cuz not smooth anymore and the most
important thing is smooth so as long as
you touch the stain and it's smooth it's
not like it's a bump on the surface
leave it alone reapply your liquid metal
you'll be fine everything's good to go
copper will stain naturally because of
ion migration from the gallon stand
solution into the copper that's fine if
it needs more liquid metal just apply
more but it's it's effectively plated so
it's not causing any damage it's not
corroding it you might have some pitting
depending on the exact solution you're
using it's certainly something that's
been seen before but that would be
different than the stain that I showed
you today so that's it for this one as
