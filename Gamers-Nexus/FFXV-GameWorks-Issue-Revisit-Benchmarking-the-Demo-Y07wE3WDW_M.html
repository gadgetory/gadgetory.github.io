do you remember the Buffalo so required
viewing for this video is our final
fantasy deep dive where we looked at
game works implementation and just
objects in general where the game was
drawing objects that were not anywhere
near the player this is something that
we were not only able to validate with
other software outside of ansel but also
Square Enix posted a series of tweets
that more or less acknowledged the issue
and said that they were working towards
a solution so what was the issue then
the quick recap is that there was severe
performance loss in most of the
benchmark utility because aspects of the
game that the player was nowhere near
were being rendered anyway thus causing
lower performance than would seem
appropriate for what was being shown on
screen today we're revisiting it with
the playable demo of Final Fantasy 15 to
see if that's been improved before that
this video is brought to you by the new
cable mod pro series cable mods new pro
cables come with pre-installed closed
combs for clean builds accompanied by a
revamped color style and vibrance the
cables are now using thicker wires and
they've also added right-angled internal
USB 3 extension and right-angled SATA
data cables by the pro series cable kits
at the link below or customized at your
cable set with the configurator also
linked below so first up the settings
have changed significantly from
previously previously the settings
options were light standard and high and
the difference there were differences
within them that you had the hunt and
find because these settings specifics
were not exposed to the user in fact in
order to change the settings at all
beyond those three presets you had to
use external software to expose the ini
files and this is obviously not an
expected use case by square-enix so we
were able to use some of that software
and change the settings files which
allowed us to do independent game works
on off a be testing and one of the
things that troubled us was that the
game work settings were only on with the
high option and we're off with the
standard option however there are other
things changed as well like view
distance and other
quality detail settings that were not
related to game work so it made it
difficult to individually check what was
causing what performance hit and so we
were able to isolate those variables and
test them one of the numbers off top my
head was hair works on versus off could
cause a 17% performance hit on Nvidia
and something like a 37% performance hit
on AMD the result of which was visible
in gameplay most the time and that most
problematic was that this performance
hit existed even when you were miles
away from any objects with hair works
because the main characters in the game
do not use hair works in fact we have
screenshots of their hair meshes from an
application a debugging application
where you can see that they're just
meshes it's not hair work so we know
that the characters aren't using hair
works however there were Buffalo in the
game that use hair works and in the play
will demo there are a couple of
characters as well and monsters that use
the hair works so we're gonna do a
really quick test just to see if
anything's improved this is not a super
in-depth GPU benchmark because the game
is still going change from today to the
final launch so we might as well just
wait till then at this point our first
objective was to determine whether the
unnecessary hair works issue had been
resolved as that was causing the biggest
performance concern overall previously
we were seeing again somewhere between
17 and 40 percent performance deficit
depending on which card and which
setting and this was a result of the
Buffalo that were rendering 100% of the
time
something that square-enix indirectly
confirmed later and through other
sources we've confirmed as well so our
initial findings were absolutely correct
and hopefully those problems will be
resolved today and as we get into this
chart I think you'll see that they
mostly are because now as we look at the
first test site the service station we
noticed that the toggling of hair works
on and off did not change performance
this is what you would expect there are
no hair works objects in this scene or
nearby any performance difference was a
result of normal variance and error and
is not measurable within our test
resolution these results suggest that
hair works is not being rendered when no
hair works objects are present which is
correct that
should be and is significantly improved
over the initial benchmark we observed
the same correct performance behavior
out in the middle of the desert where no
hair works objects were around and
testing and combat versus the first boss
mob a user of hair works by the way we
logged an on versus off performance
disparity of approximately 7% on Vega at
56 with a similar disparity on the gtx
1070 note that these results are not
comparable to our initial benchmark
where we discovered the issues as this
is a single mob entity with hair works
versus a large group of buffalo that
means the boss alone is costing you 7 to
8 percent of your performance and in the
initial benchmark we had numerous
buffalo objects that were again costing
a lot more than that so we can say for
sure that there is a performance hit
with hair works and tightly knit on
versus off does show a difference so we
know that hair works is functional on at
least certain enemies or mobs that have
it we also know in at least the two test
sites that we just sort of spot checked
that hair works on versus off shows no
difference when there are no hair works
objects present this is expected and
good behavior we have not tested the
entire benchmark it's fully possible
that there are still instances where a
performance deficit exists with hair
works on when no hair works objects are
apparent to the player so it's possible
that still exists this was a much
shorter test than our initial one where
we basically spent an entire day
researching it for this one we're just
doing a spot check to build some more
data on what Square Enix has been
working on and once the game ships will
do another deep dive and see how it
looks then because at this point we're
so limited with what we can do in the
demo and we don't know what's going to
change so you could understand why
there's not a big desire to build a
gigantic data set and then have it all
wiped out when the actual game ships
however for now what we're seeing is
that hair works out OD scallion appears
to be working at least mostly properly
in the two very quick spot checks
possible that it's broken elsewhere but
we haven't seen evidence of that yet
and another item of note that's
important is that optimization overall
is significantly improved this is
something we can say for absolute
certain because if you look around the
game doesn't matter if you use ansel or
not you can use other debugging tools
because I think some people got hung up
on the fact that we were creating video
with ansel previously but you can use
other tools like render dock to
basically fetch items out of memory like
meshes textures every single pass to
draw the frame all the way up till the
frames completion and render dock is is
still showing objects that we can't see
near the player however they are
significantly lower level of detail to
the point where it's probably irrelevant
that they're being drawn at all and most
of these objects are at least somewhat
nearby so although a lot of overdraw is
still happening the game is still
drawing a lot of objects that you can't
see on the screen actively they are
lower level of detail which was true to
some extent with the initial benchmark
so it's not like that's completely new
but it does look like either more care
was taken since the benchmark or while
they were building this one in parallel
with the benchmark they did a better job
with LED either way optimizations
clearly better this time than last the
big question of course is how will it
carry over to the game will we see
performance uplift overall and this is
where the next big point comes in which
is that graphic settings are seriously
changed from the benchmark which had
three presets now there are four presets
low average high and highest and of
those only highest has any game works
options enabled at all and interestingly
it is lacking I think pretty much all
game works options except hair works so
turf was disabled by default from when
we looked at the playable demo and vxa o
is still off and also something you
can't change so it's not in yet these
shadow libraries are defaulted to off
with highest settings so this is a
pretty serious change before more
I think there were three from the top of
a top my head I think there were three
GameWorks options that were enabled
previously out of five and now not sure
about flow but we know that only hair
works is on and turf is off that's a big
difference alone because those two are
the biggest contributors to frame rate
differences so in the very least if you
want to get those other options now you
can but you have to go through custom
options so you can actually set a custom
graphics configuration I know it's
amazing mind-blowing technology and the
fact that it's changed like this means
that when benchmarking or when users are
discussing the game they talk about
highest settings the only really major
influence outside of the normal graphics
options would be hair works and compared
to previously that's pretty big
improvement because it's it will look
more fair to all vendors in this
configuration and if you still want the
Nvidia game works options which you
might you can enable them separately
three custom graphics configuration so
that's a big change and we thank Square
Enix for it's not just a game we're
saying it's just it's the fact that you
can customize graphics now that was a
big concern so we're glad to see that
and the extra care taken with game works
options is also appreciated because
there I mean we had 1080 T eyes that
were struggling to play the game
previously so that's not okay you could
of course tuned down but you have to you
have to build the game for the lowest
common denominator which is probably
someone who doesn't really get what's
causing that performance loss they're
just not sure why it's not running well
so so it's tuned better now for people
who might not be as tech savvy as all of
you are but to recap better job overall
with LOD scaling there's a better job
with object render distance there is a
better job with hair works
implementation and when it is being
called and rendered and we still
observed that many objects in the far
distance we're coming down the directx
pipe down draw calls but many of them
were lower detail so that eliminates a
lot of performance concerns that's not
to say that Final Fantasy 15 is well
optimized now it's not
say that it's clear and free of any
issues with or without game works that
really wasn't the only culprit
it was everything was being drawn so
there could still be problems we'll look
into it though in the game launches for
now just wanted to give you an update
kind of close the story on the beta and
pre-launch stuff and say that yes it
looks at least a little bit better so
good news there but stay tuned make sure
you subscribe to catch the final launch
deep dive that we'll be doing when we're
gonna double back and really dig into it
make sure that screen ecstatic good job
with optimization and as always
subscribe for more go to
patreon.com/scishow cameras and access
to helps that directly we would strongly
recommend you watch the first video in
the series because it will explain a lot
more we'll put that in a one of the
cards or something like that thank you
for watching you get a store at
Cameron's Nexus net if you want to pick
up one of the Graf logo shirts that I
was wearing for this video I'll see you
all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
