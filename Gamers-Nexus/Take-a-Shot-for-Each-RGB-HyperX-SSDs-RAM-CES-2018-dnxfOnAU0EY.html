suite now at CES 2018 there's a couple
new products that they have primarily
focused on RGB RGB or so before anyone
comments and says RGB something I've
been told you at this show is that
apparently user engagement via social
media channels increases by 60% if the
post contains the letters RGB so just
let that sink in for a moment while
while you let that sink in this video is
brought to you by Leon Lee and their 550
ex and 330 cases the 550 X is a $180
mid-tower case with tempered glass on
all panels it's got three RGB LED fans
positioned in the front each of which
has a metal frame housing and an open
interior design if you prefer a cheaper
option the 330 is $100 and comes without
fans and as what we recommended it most
heavily in one of our recent case
reviews learn more at the link in the
description below the modules here we're
looking at are kind of an iteration on
what we saw I think last year so these
are predator ddr4 RGB modules
technically it says they're 3200
megahertz the final speeds and latencies
are indeterminate at this time they'll
be finalized closer towards quarter to
when the module should be shipping this
time for real so the the primary
difference here from last time is that
these actually use infrared sensors to
synchronize with one another so rather
than using either internal or external
wiring which isn't that common these
days but internal wiring certainly is
rather than using that they're just
using an IR transmitter and receiver on
either side of the module so it does not
matter which one is in which position
you pick a module and the one in the
from this orientation bottom slot is the
effective master module and then that
will synchronize the others to it what
we're doing here is there's just a
sticker that's sitting in between the
sensors the IR receiver for this third
module counting from bottom up and that
is blocking the synchronization from the
other to see these are syncing to each
other and these are syncing to each
other
now if we pull it they pretty much
instantly
synchronize with one another so it's
kind of interesting it's RGB technology
but it's a new application of infrared
so we have not seen this yet on memory
which makes it kind of neat I don't have
speeds prices anything like that right
now
but that's most of it as far as
distances so if you're like I only buy
two sticks because memory is a thousand
dollars right now then you can they
actually will sense one space apart they
will not send two spaces apart but no
one does that anyway
if you had an x2 99 or a thread refer
tr4 board and you had four slots here
four here we asked about that as well
then the modules down here would sync
with one another and the modules up here
would sync with one another they will
not communicate across the SM bus so
they are syncing only to the adjacent or
nearly adjacent modules for the predator
RGB memory so that's the update on those
a couple other updates they also have a
new SSD so that one we have some b-roll
of as well and that is the HyperX fury
RGB which is I don't have exact
specifications on it but it's a Marvel
controller and it basically uses a SATA
power SATA data so your standard
connectors plus a four pin and the four
pin is just the four pin RGB connectors
that you see pretty much with every
motherboard at this point that will
synchronize via the motherboard software
I know it's compatible with at least
three of the vendors from other boards
and we'll see if it happens to be
compatible the fourth by the time
everything ships so that's just RGB SSD
based is all you need to know about that
one other stuff more functionally I
suppose is this this is the XO so it's a
savage XO SSD it's basically an MDOT to
drive inside of an enclosure and it
connects to it's meant to connect to
consoles like the Xbox one so you
connect to the Xbox one store your games
on the device it's bit faster then the
hard drive if you don't want to take it
apart like we did and just install one
which we have a video on but I suppose
if you wanted external you could do that
and it'll be a bit faster as far as that
you're concerned about thermals asked
about that because Crimea man MDOT to
SSD into a plastic enclosure
theoretically the Xbox shouldn't really
be doing a lot of high-speed continuous
reads and writes so theoretically
thermal should not be too much of an
issue
because it's just I mean it's it's a low
performance device that doesn't really
pain memory a whole lot it's not like
you're running Iometer on it so I think
that covers most of the HyperX suite
they have a couple new keyboards and
mice they have an alloy elite RGB
keyboard it's got some software for it
now basically coming out sometime soon
and also a mouse but focus here for us
is primarily on memory and the storage
solution so that's it for this one and

thanks for watching
I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
