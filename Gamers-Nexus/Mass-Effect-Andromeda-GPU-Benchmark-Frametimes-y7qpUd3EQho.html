interesting research opportunity for
game graphics and so we set forth
benchmarking the game with our updated
GPU test bench and about 14 video card
will be defining some of the game's
graphics settings in this video and
talking about performance issues that
influence test results and how to avoid
them and also we'll be going over GT
performance at 4k 1440 and 1080p
resolution before getting to that this
video is brought to you by EVGA GTX 1080
and 1070 hybrid cooling kit which we
recently used to hack together our 1080p
ife hybrid mod the kit offers an
efficient way to adapt compatible GPUs
to better cooling performance and allow
some more Headroom out of the cords link
below for more information nice Effect
Andromeda had a couple of interesting
options in the graphics settings menu
one of them in particular stands out
that we wanted to go over just to
clarify for everyone and that is frame
buffer format under display settings we
going over that and then afterwards
we'll be walking it through some of the
research that was conducted on Andromeda
prior to running the full benchmark
suite this is stuff that we wanted to
start publishing to get a better idea
frame times of specific performance
issues or anomalies and this is kind of
new how the game performs in different
areas of the game that's pretty cool
because we normally don't have that
information and thanks to our patreon
backers in discord we were able to get
multiple save game files to put it all
together frame buffer format offers two
different settings half 16 and
compressed speaking of with technical
artists that the company we learned to
that have 16 that doubles the size of
all colored buffers in the rendering
pipeline the more bandwidth is needed
during rendering it also doubles the
precision of the intermediate color
buffers and is something that won't be
visibly noticed on a standard displays
that is what most of us have considering
the performance hit though half 16 is
generally not worth it for users and so
is something with disabled in our
testing as for compressed mode that one
keeps five to six bits of precision per
color channel but doesn't have artifact
of 16 bit color because the rest of the
32 bits are used on range it's possible
that you'll see some color banding
issues in places with s
er but should be uncommon bright skies
for example can cause from exposure
issues sort of like Ian be mods but it's
otherwise it better than the performance
hit of half 16 HDR however stretches
range and precision and that's where
you'd probably want have 16 instead
because you'll start noticing color
banding otherwise as always with our
game benchmarking we started with
analysis of how the game performs in
different options configurations or in
this case different places in the games
that would include planetside testing
testing on Tempest testing on the Nexus
things like that and looking at the data
for all of them to figure out where
makes the most sense for our benchmark
course so that we can most accurately
represent the game as you will most
likely be experiencing it whether that's
a worst-case scenario or a best-case
scenario or somewhere in between so we
have some of that information for you a
big shout-out to our patreon discord
numbers for sending over save game files
to accelerate that process and most
immediately important before all that we
notice that just like battlefields one
the first test pass of Mass Effect
Andromeda has some interesting variants
it happens on both AMD and NVIDIA but
the performance hit is the biggest with
ambient so we have some data on that and
how we've elected to resolve those
issues for our benchmarking this first
set of several test passes with an r 9
fury x at 4k and ultra settings that
shows that some of the variants that
we're talking about the important thing
here is the disparity in frame times
this is repeatable and seems to happen
consistently on first load of a level
but goes away after exploring the
immediate area you can see it in this
frame time chart that we're seeing
massive noticeable stutters in the first
pass of testing but significant
performance improvement in subsequent
passes like past two in this case the
most exaggerated spike in this instance
is a two hundred 80 milliseconds frame
time at one point which means that
you're standing around for about a
quarter of a second waiting for the next
frame that is noticeable to further
illustrate here is a set of data just a
raw data table from our RX 488 gigabyte
gaming x at 1080p ultra and this one our
first half past shows 72 FPS average
with 56 FPSO
lo and 6fps 0.1 percent lows this shows
itself in stutters during the first pass
but it smooths out in subsequent testing
within about a minute normally and after
walking through the area and loading
everything into memory or vram as
necessary we improved from roughly six
FPS 0.1% lowest performance to 53 in the
second pass massive difference here and
the contrast this vs nvidia the GTX 1066
gigabyte gaming ex at 1080p ultra posts
a 60 FPS 0.1% low output for the first
pass then 65 for later passes and we
also see a difference in averages the
difference here isn't visible and isn't
anywhere near what we were seen with
andy but it is consistent and measurable
so this is obviously some sort of issue
with Mass Effect Andromeda though it is
exaggerated on AMD just be very clear
here we're not saying that Andy is worse
overall nothing like that what we are
saying though is that this is something
to keep in mind because you might see
stuttering as you immediately load a
level but it should mostly go away as
you start playing that level this is
particularly noticeable in the planets
where you're probably going to be on the
planet for a long period of time so it's
not a huge issue after you immediately
load the area surrounding your character
that said it does mean that we have some
considerations for testing namely do we
include the first pass in the data and
average it which would really bring down
the 1 / 7.1 for something low as mostly
point 1 percent on Andy Hardware in a
way that would make it look a lot worse
than nvidia or do we get rid of the data
so we did what we did with battlefield
one testing which is run a minimum of
four test passes per card / resolution
and then we're eliminating the first
test pass that means that the AMD data
will be more consistent because we're
eliminating that sort of outlier
although it is repeatable in the first
has passed so what that means is looking
through the data what you are seeing is
the latter the later three test passes
and we've eliminated the first one for
all cards that also means that you're
seeing numbers that are more immediately
comparable so it should be fairer in
that regard but keep in mind that there
is a potential stutter there that we're
not showing it but you've seen it now in
our research piece so that should give
everyone even ground
understand where the different cards are
anywhere we're assuming here that
there's some sort of driver level or
game level optimization issue and given
that this was an Nvidia partnered game
it's possible that there's still some
work to be done on and the devices by
either Andy or by Bioware as for other
research we ran several test passes that
lasted a few minutes for the first
planet for The Tempest and for the Nexus
zone overall performance numbers suggest
that planetside driving as the highest
performance no surprise there as it is
the least geometrically complex while
planetside battles tend to mostly equal
the average frame rate of the tempest or
of the Nexus zone the tempest ship has
consistently the lowest frame throughput
but overall all test environments are
roughly equal when you average the frame
rate output over a long period of time a
couple of minutes which benchmarking is
a pretty long time and so because we can
see that the averages of mostly align it
doesn't matter a whole lot where we
benchmark as long as it is not in the
open driving areas of a planet because
that's when we see frame rates that are
at least a couple percent if not ten
percent or higher more than what we see
on campus and Nexus or in battles
planetside because of this we decided to
run our tests on Nexus the Nexus seems
to be the most representative of overall
average performance when considering the
lower frame rate battles and higher
frame rate desert driving and mixed
frame rate ship or station traversal all
sort of land at around the same place
for average and frame time performance
having to find the interesting
discoveries let's get into the benchmark
charts for 4k 1440 and 1080p note that
as always the full testing methodology
is linked in the description below along
with the rest of the analysis from this
piece if you are curious how we tested
something what drivers we used what
specific versions of cards we use it's
all defined in that article check that
first just to quickly note on drivers
they were the latest at time of
benchmarking which was official
supported drivers from nvidia and from
AMD so those drivers were the ones
released by both video cards vendors
specifically for Mass Effect Andromeda
that's what we use you can find the
specific numbers in that article at 4k
Ultra and the Nexus benchmark our 1080
TI hybrid we built is performing around
55 FPS average with one percent lows at
54 and 0.1 percent at 50 moving down the
list a 1080 FTW from EVGA runs about
twenty percent slower than the 1080 ti
at 52 FPS average at whitlows about 10
FPS below the 1080p I is one percentage
point one percent values this is still
plenty playable even at Ultra as we
generally found that Mass Effect
Andromeda feels fluid enough for play at
around the 50 FPS range your mileage may
vary depending on how picky you are
about frame rates but that's what we
thought based on how this game plays and
feels at 50 FPS or higher the GTX 980 TI
hybrid from the maxwell generation runs
about thirty-nine percent slower than
the pascal pen a DTI at placing at 40
FPS average with low is just above a 30
FPS we can find and these are 9p reacts
at 32 average with lows in the 20s at
this point alongside the 1070 at 38 FPS
we're beginning to experience more
frequent and observable stutters or
tears the experiences poor enough on the
fury x the 1070 and potentially the 980
TI that we'd recommend dropping to
medium settings instead of ultra one
note here there's really not much of a
performance benefit by going to high as
it turns out in our test course so it's
really ultra medium or bust on 4k for
what it's worth the msi RX for any
gaming x 8 gigabyte card hands on pretty
closely to the fury x at 25 FPS average
tying the 390 x and outpacing at both
the former flagships from both andy and
nvidia the 290x and the 780 ti moving on
to 1440p ultra was the same necklace
workloads at 1080p I gianna hybrid
operates about two times its frame rate
as at 4k and now pushing 126 FPS average
as well as lows at 90 FPS one percent
and 79 FPS 0.1 percent the 1080 FTW two
trails at 101 FPS average making the
1080i roughly twenty-five percent faster
at this resolution that's not quite
Nvidia thirty-five percent faster claim
there's a gap between a 980 TI and the
1080 TI is a noteworthy sixty percent
improvement from the pascal TI the gtx
1060 gaming x6 gigabyte card now appears
on
chart as well placing that around 58 FPS
average with lows at 47 and 46 and these
are 9px has nearly identical performance
across the board at 58 average of 47 1%
low and 44 0.1% lows both the Andy fury
X and NVIDIA 1060 output frames it was
fairly even frame pacing which is
somewhat remarkable for a newly launched
title we don't always see that
performance regardless of vendor the
EVGA GTX 970 SSC runs about ten percent
lower them 1060 but is still playable
with ultra settings this is followed
closely by the RX 480 which in this
current state of the game seems to
perform about where the GTX 970 and r9
390 X perform interestingly we see both
former flagships continue to exhibit
their weaknesses and higher resolutions
with the 780 ti and 290x falling below
the modern art 480 and the GTX 1050 and
frame rate at 1440p these two cards
perform more closely to an RX for 74
gigabyte card dropping any of the three
tailing devices to medium settings would
push you to 50 FPS if you prefer to
1440p to the higher setting moving now
it's the most widespread resolution
1080p posts the 1080 TI nearing 200 FPS
average the 980 TI at around 120 average
and the 1070 tied with a 980 TI
everything here even the
worst-performing devices have tightly x
frame pacing which makes for a generally
smooth experience is above roughly 50
FPS average the gtx 780ti and r9 290x do
a lot better here thanks to the lowered
pixel throughput which is something that
these cards were more built for and the
290x lands a few frames ahead of the gtx
780ti from a cowboy generation that said
nvidia holds the top half of the chart
at least until Andy pushes its
highly-anticipated Vega GPU of the same
name architecture as the currently best
performing AMD card is the fury X at 82
FPS average which is at trailed about
eight percent by the RX 40 Gaming Act
and then that is followed closely by the
r9 390 X as for low-end cards the 1050
does reasonably here though dropping to
medium settings
would be ideal the GTX 1050 TI would do
fine but we didn't test it due to the
usual time and origin activation
restrictions the RX 462 gigabyte card
struggles and definitely needs a
settings reduction for better
playability for 1080p and ultra settings
it seems that Mass Effect Andromeda runs
play ibly on something like a GTX 950 TI
and up just extrapolating or an RX 470
end up that's the 4 gigabyte model with
before 70 offering about a 60 FPS
average throughput at the bottom end and
then if you look to things like the gtx
1060 or our X 480 we begin to exceed
that 60 FPS mark with a 1060 pushing
nearly 100 FPS in the nineties or
somewhere around there and that is also
capable of 1440p play ability to have
some extent though you may want the
slight settings reduction depending on
how much of a stickler you are for 60
FPS gaming the same is true for the fury
ax hanger on that card tends to perform
around where the 1060 is in some of
these charts depending on the workload
and resolution again as for 4k it's
looking like 1080 class hardware is
required for this game if you want to
play on ultra at forte so you could take
the settings hit and get some other
cards up to play ability if you
determine 50 FPS as playability for this
title your mileage may vary on that and
then finally we notice that the
difference again between high and ultra
is negligible so between AMD and NVIDIA
was never more than a few percentage
points which tended to be a couple of
frames difference at best and that was
with the Nexus and the tempest workloads
so it's mostly an option of old
traverses medium for this game with
potentially low if you're running
something like an RX for 60 or a GTX
entity as an option as well so as always
