snowblind panel at the Intel booth this
is by iBUYPOWER and it was sort of a
prototype it's still a prototype but
this is a slightly evolved version of
what we saw a few weeks ago the idea
here today is to talk more about how it
works what's actually in the panel and
how Iowa Power has been building this
thing to see if it's feasible for
production because before we didn't
really talk about the technical details
so what we have here is an NZXT Noctis
450 case it's a white and black case so
the white and black is chosen
specifically because of its high
contrast and that's something we did
talk about it packs the PAC system at
the Intel booth had well the components
inside were different it was a white
motherboard video card there actually
was one and had a reflective back and
everything was pretty much white and
black finish so that helps with the
contrast but we're still getting a
really good picture here on this panel
and part of that is because the
inclusion of a light guide so this LCD
is now backed behind it with a light
guide which in our b-roll and photos and
things you'll see it's kind of like a
dot pattern on the display and in person
you can pretty much see right through
that you don't even really pick it up I
can see it a bit from this viewing angle
but dead-on it's pretty much invisible
the cameras pick it up well so you'll
see that in the cameras into the shots
but that's the light guide that helps
some with the contrast with making these
black colors a harder black so there's
less of a gradient there and the panel
itself up here you'll notice if you saw
our previous video this is the thicker
part now previously it was down here and
that's basically where some of the PCB
and stuff like that's melted the cable
connects up here and previously was in
the bottom part of that is just because
well I guess from cable management
perspective it's pretty clean to route
through here down through the back of
the case and then where it's going but
also viewing angles so you and angles
obviously matter with displays as for
the cable itself it routes through as I
said behind the back plugs into the
bottom into into an expansion slot so
i/o powers made a custom enclosure for a
PCB that's just sending the cable the
signal back to the motherboard right now
because there's no video
cards in the system and the file that is
playing here is actually just a video
file like none before and that's playing
an Intel movie which is on the host
system or I guess the host system right
here that's the panelist can is on
itself so that's the panel this is the
snowblind I think that covers a bit more
of what's going on in terms of
production manufacturing things like
that this side panel was a one-off made
by NZXT so they took a panel for
probably a novice 450 punched a hole in
it and you get this wider window
so the Knox's 450 has a smaller window
than this this is a 5 by 4 display 1280
by 1024 and then they punched a hole to
fit that and for feasibility it's
basically just a matter of is there
interest in the market and what does it
cost to make because the manufacturing
feasibility has been handled and I would
power things that's actually possible to
make so if you're interested I guess
leave comments below let them know maybe
let them know what you'd be willing to
spend extra on something like this
because that's the main question at this
point otherwise it just becomes
something like the H tau or something
where vendors have it at booths because
it's still useful for that I suppose so
leave the description below for more
information as always patreon like the
postal video thanks for watching I'll
see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
