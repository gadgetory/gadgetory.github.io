Athena I'm just a computer nerds I'm
left I'm Sweeney the founder of Epic
Games and this is that on the keyboard
this is the start of something new for
epic if you look back every last two
years there's been a lot of change a lot
of the dudes that I think has been about
what games we won't be developing and
but he of all time that that folks won't
be nothing like that's in the future but
throughout that whole time we've been
working really quietly behind the scenes
coding a new generation of technology a
new generation of games and this is
really the first time we're going to
have a chance to get out in front of the
world and tell you about the future and
I keep my brother feature because this
unreal engine you know its development
started in 1995 the first first Unreal
Engine 80 percent myself since then it's
grown into the team of 100 developers
around the world they're really awesome
leading attention but for the past two
years we've made this engine available
to a few triple-a licensees around the
world and using it to go on you know so
really awesome and the Eng games some of
them have been announced many heaven but
you know the other ball engine remains
that and also many of your building very
high quality games but yeah we rise we
haven't covered the entire depth of what
the engine is capable of and so here
we're going to talk about things the
mortgage go and tell you about her
future for the Unreal Engine I know the
future of the engine is really inspired
by a lot of changes in the game industry
the always think back to the last
generation when it began in 2005 PT was
in decline steam was like this funny
download service that you had to go
through to get half-life 2 next
generation consoles were launching and
there were gigantic triple-a teams
forming around building next generation
games if you looked at the game industry
at that point you know and it's 20 years
of history you might have realistically
at that point thought okay I get it
every year game teams are going to be
bigger budgets are going to be bigger
and this the future is going to be this
simple
the building bigger and more complex
games but a huge amount of exciting
things have happened in the in the past
few years the change saw that yeah since
the last generations launched Apple was
introduced to I found a huge and vibrant
development community of any developers
has warmed up around that you have new
platforms like oculus VR and the major
distribution opportunities to reach you
know tens of millions of gamers through
venues like Steam and the online
distribution systems coming to Xbox and
PlayStation platforms and all the mobile
platforms
so really it's all about that future um
whatever just to recap what what the
only one engine is capable of them left
here for GDC will be we bought the
infiltrator demo which is a high-end and
a running a real time in real time on
high-end Nvidia graphics hardware and on
its time we just show a video of the
info here demo to recap what the engine
so that's infiltrator you're probably
making a bunch of things you're probably
thinking that's that's really cool but
it's probably really just call it and
complicated to create content like that
you know baloney things about Unreal
Engine 4 that's been a major focus for
us is building an engine until set that
are very highly usable for developers of
all sizes and so we haven't terrible
about what the experience is like every
day where the programmers and designers
and artists who work with the Unreal
Engine but they're generally working
with the auto editor and it's a very
polished and I'm fine until now and
you'd be really amazed of what you can
do it with just a few mouse clicks when
a few days of learning and basic
environment here so let's bring some
geometry to the world and let's resizes
to something slightly more usable for
our purposes and I'll snap this right
down to the ground let's bring a camera
up on it all right cool I have a brick
that's a copy of our brick I'm gonna
make this day need some traffic so you
can see I kind of started carving away
some in geometry and will resize this a
little bit and a little bit of moving
around we end up with a little to waltz
set like that
currently it's a fire hazard if this one
that's what put a door in the back so
I'll duplicate this let's think it's a
little more like
puncheon's numbers I can do snap that's
right down to the ground and it slide it
into the back wall and the instant or
now currently yeah quickly default my
feels a little bit boring so
back wall and spread up the algorithm to
grab all the wall surfaces and let's
dragging drops and break off of that
floor will do this is hardwood flooring
let's rotate that because it's nice and
then we'll put something up on the
ceiling of course these decorations
would be good to do so we can just
quickly drag and drop into a table a
chair another chair and if we did
something special we can quickly search
do this would be like let's look for a
cow
we won't overdo it on the gas and then
we might get ceiling so I can drop it a
light down this is created with our
blueprint system which I'll talk about a
little bit more later but that means
you're doing this in scriptdb native so
I can turn it on it starts lighting the
scene or I could do something a little
more fancy like I can make a duplicate
of it and toggle it slam title to
something else entirely the floor light
and we can put that over in the corner
of the room
now of course our doorway to look cooler
if there was something in there so I'll
just drag and drop on it or not this is
also created with our blueprint system
so that means now if I want to I can
just go ahead and start playing right
here in the editor and when I turn
around and look at my environment the
door just magically opens now that's
just a quick look at some amount of
basic environment creations moving on
let's take a look at more new material
features in report so we're not using
any physically based material system
something can we define our materials
much more simply and easily work with so
here we're adjusting the base color or
which just changes how light is or how
we can control roughness now technically
then controls micro fasting along with
surfaces that really just makes me shiny
so the rougher something intellectually
need appears as you see here we can also
control how the Metallica services so
here at some say it looks very much like
shiny plastic as I increase its metallic
properties it's just over torque wrong
and we do some much more fancy things as
well so here I have a couple of
materials that are actually perturbing
their geometry
take a look at this in white frame you
can actually see that geometry moving
around and over here we have some
materials really we have some materials
that are taking in input from a camera
there's actually a camera object over
there filming those other materials and
displacing hearing here we have the
material that is taking in the actual
scene and then adjusting it to be sort
of a high-tech tron-like look I hear
we're wiping between one of the many
render buffers that we use so here's the
actual roughness buffer so you can get
an idea of how drop all the surfaces on
here we have multiple surface types with
mask opacity you can see how the
transparent areas are shadowing properly
along the surface over here we have a
material that is blending out water and
metal and this is a material instance
it's very easy for me as a user to jump
into this and quickly make changes that
update in real time with in the game or
governor to make a change the actual
behavior of the material I can open up
our powerful material editor system and
change the graph network that actually
define into that material
now our materials can also respond to
indicators as well so if I jump in here
I have three material ice wood and steel
that I can pro fire
and they change appropriately or I can
cool them back off the water I get an
entirely different look and then we gon
look at blueprints you can be discussed
earlier little French army the visual
scripting system in Unreal Engine 4
they allow non-programmers particularly
artist level designers to be able to
create their own in-game agers so now
I'm just going to play in the engine now
I'm gonna simulate the engines which
sicily means the game is playing about
we remain back behind the editor
students to work with names I'll select
this little bouncing ball and we can
open up the graph that is driving in
Spain so it's fairly straightforward we
have what's called a time line which is
driving me being motion and scale on the
ball and down here at the bottom there's
a which is firing off the little ripple
effect that takes place down at the
bottom every time it bounces I can right
click on this and add a great point and
the next time that note is executed
it'll actually call execution of the
game in this location making debugging
use these graphs very quick and easy of
course you can also see how the data is
flowing through it in real time
now blueprints don't have the Gipsy for
things that are moving and actually
doing things within your game you can
also use them to create powerful level
design tools so here we have a railing
that has a variable length so I can just
adjust the slider and make us any length
that I need to and this could be
independent of each instance let's bring
these using me to copy this off changing
the length and I can quickly populate my
levels and so with blueprint where we
can make a powerful level design tool
that we can use to make our maybe more
quickly but this can also communicate
with one another so here I have three
blueprints I've got a button I've got
some gears back here in the back and I'm
just like when I step on the button the
gears start turning
a she's picking places to clean those
two blueprints it's very easy for me to
select the button and say you know what
I want you to talk to the light instead
no that's from a play like I'm done and
actually really one of those lightbulbs
now we can do some more sophisticated
things as well so a repeater I have this
little butterfly and I need to apply
behavior that was created entirely
within blueprint by a level designer not
by an AI coder or anything fancy like
that so as he flies around he gets tired
to look for a place to land and then
he'll recharge is it strike off again in
a random direction and we can actually
watch the data flow through its entire
brain if you will as he simulates in our
scene
you have to really drive this home in
here we have a couple of games that were
made with in blueprint that exists
within our eating environments as games
within a game
so that was created entirely by one
level designer who just wanted to make a
Galaga style game over here we have
another example where you see my camera
gets taken over I have new controls and
now I'm flying this alcohol around and I
can come over here into the ducts these
little calves or the trees of other ones
and I can put them back in the middle
pen and once again all of this behavior
is made possible with lip print nothing
to show that off I'm not gonna jump out
of the game it's like an eject and the
game will continue to play without me
you see here so now I can select the UFO
we can open up his graph there's a
suitcase going on here let's go over to
the craft that actually makes the
abductions being possible so the water
different things going on but I'm gonna
zoom in basically just on the on/off
controls and on making most of my screen
space here just so we can see that so
now if i repossess this is fo and start
flying around you can see as I turn the
beam on we can actually watch the
behavior flow through the ground and
best of all these are not all individual
necessary pieces they all just work
seamlessly together so it's not like
when I'm done playing around and picking
up towels I have to stop everything they
will interact with my
all the way back to our little
environment that we got earlier and of
course it's always fun to destroy things
so so that is a quick look at some of
the new tools and techniques available
in thanks thanks a so that's the engine
huh you know it's with forethought more
than building massive triple a project
anything from lone wolf a designer
wanting to build a game even if you
don't know how to program I'm in C++ you
can go any game using the blueprint
system and just what the video tool said
get something up and running really
quickly and and easily to larger indie
developers mid-sized teams triple-a
teams ranging up to hundreds of people
and even though I think this would be a
fun experience for like high-end
minecraft player who yearns for the
capability of going more realistic and
larger and more expansive worlds this is
potentially a new outlet for them and
all this growth in the capabilities of
the Unreal Engine is is to really
rethink their whole business and how we
make the engine available to individuals
and to teams you know all along in epic
history we've made the Unreal Engine
available to triple-a game developers
it's often cost many millions of dollars
and licensing is involved
law here is negotiating for weeks for
months at a time to figure out business
terms but for the really big and
successful teams who want access to it
they were able to get it and they've
built some great games over over the
unreal engines history but I look at the
new shape that the industry now we're
like that's an outdated model for most
people this was a joke and an engine
that command fit absolutely everybody
and to let it be the possibilities for
the engine we started out from scratch
and we asked how can we make the most
valuable and useful engine available to
everybody as
as practically as possible and so we
came up with the entire to do in
business model for a for the Unreal
Engine which we're announcing today and
so here's what is there to start two
parts to the to the equation first of
all absolutely anybody can gain access
to Unreal Engine 4 or by by subscribing
to the antenna and in this subscription
you pay $19 a month and you get access
to to everything you get the latest
tools the Unreal editor and the other
supporting tools for PC and Mac you can
use the tools on those platforms to
develop games and on those platforms you
can then deploy to PC and Mac iOS and
Android
all of this platforms today and more
coming in the future and so that gives
you access and then for developer who
wants to ship a game we have a very
simple royalty model where developers
pay 5% of the game's gross revenue from
product sales to users and my thing is
Ron with easy access the complete engine
until 10
no I'm now you know over history we made
the Unreal Engine available to the
public in various ways you know with
under tournament we released the mod to
up get back in 1999 in particular the
immersion of the editor but the ability
to ship standalone games more recently
with Unreal Engine 3 we released the
Unreal development kit which was a
binary only version of the engine which
included the adder and some some terms
where developers could actually build
and ship indie games and some of the
successful games have come out of that
but it hasn't gone into the magnitude
that we go and so with other one you
were aiming to just wipe the slate
completely clean and here's how we're
doing that everybody who subscribes to
the Unreal Engine get access to the
engines complete C++ source code no one
was talking to my outside of the game
industry about source good and they're
like oh is that textile stuff that
programmers edit it and then yeah yes it
is that but it's also a lot more the
source coded its epics crown jewel this
is
the entire code base that we used to
build all our games the entire code
makes that we make available to all of
our licensees paying millions of dollars
for access to the engine and now we're
making it available to everybody in the
general public and with the source code
you can do absolutely anything you're
not limited by the features have any
design in the product absolutely
whatever you want you can either find it
internal engine for today or you can
find it out in the Unreal Engine 4
community developed by somebody else or
you can do it yourself and with the
complete source code you can do all that
you can modify it Indian cherry and
we're really seeing the source code
through the github community it's a it's
a sharing and sort basically a community
source kind of development website which
provides really great features for
developers to collaborate together to
build projects to modify and extend
other people's code bases and to
magically present so everybody could
subscribes to the engine and go download
the binary version the tool is the
editor without any programming
experience you can get up and running
and start building levels just like that
parish can and if you're a programmer
you can then download the source code
and start editing it and do absolutely
anything you want to wipe it we think
this model it's going to be really
really interesting for the game industry
because if you have absolutely
everything offer under economical access
to absolutely everything we add up at
Cash when we develop our games eternally
all of the advantages and all the
capabilities are on there and you can do
with it whether you like so I'm going to
pay $19 per month for access and and 5%
of grants revenue and it's a that's a
Bourdon aesthetic but we think it's an
appropriate one given you know the new
style of the game industry it's now
grown into a very to open in a
democratic form where everything anybody
can go and build a game and and ship it
and the best game so I rise to the top
and be successful and if the Unreal
Engine didn't be a valuable part of the
people's development pipeline and
building these next generation games
will be will be very happy in that
supportive of it
now I'm to support Unreal Engine 4 we're
Anisa epic performance where the
community and the developers can get
together in chat about development we're
hosting Q&amp;amp;A site for asking questions on
the answer hub we have the source code
available on github
zach has recorded some awesome video
tutorials explaining how to use all the
content creation aspects of the Unreal
Engine we also have a very large hub
documentation available for everybody
and all this we're not just announcing
it it's available today
starting at 9:30 you can go to our
website sign up and get started and then
you know this is really just the
beginning if you go download that source
code you can see the beginning of many
new initiatives in Unreal Engine 4 there
are not quite ready for primetime yet
but are well under development and can
be used and experimented with my
developers all over the world
it was support for Linux and now a steam
boat steam steam OS operating system in
the anticipation the steam platform
coming out their support for deploying
the Unreal Engine 4 games into html5
where they can run run within a web
browser without any plugins at all we
brought that in partnership with Mozilla
now everything we develop from today
forward is going to be accessible in our
source code you'll be able to start
seeing the code changes were making and
seeing a big future its might be a very
open and collaborative environment not
in this sort of secretive elite uh-hum
approach that we've taken in the past
where the engine is that they all been
available just to a few teams and strict
secrecy but they all go to everybody and
a very very transparent process so we're
excited about this and besides releasing
the engine we're also releasing lot of
samples of things you can note with the
Unreal Engine they wanted to help or to
show what you can do using the engines
for high end graphics capabilities to
build it into the original type of game
all right so we go happy chicken this
isn't necessarily so we'll just change
the gender by real quick quick recompile
done awesome play again
all right I got just now I see precision
controls sort of not really so this was
built by a designer and owner in the
course of two days this is a
demonstration of what class 1 is he
continued the games in design entirely
in blueprints there was absolutely no
programming in this the designer doesn't
even know a C++ and I doubt he even
server
so there you can see blueprints me I'll
have to work on that as you know various
different controls and and you know look
we're kind of the interface now between
programmers and designers as you're
doing a more complex game there's
nothing the designer needs the visual
tools to create gameplay logic within
the game they can then ask the
programmer for a teacher instead of the
programmer going and including its
gameplay specific logic somewhere the
programmer can expose expose new types
of blueprints and then the designer can
reuse them all over the game so it's
really designed to make create a very
simple iterative process for designers
and programmers to both maximize their
productivity in building games you know
Anna forward looking feature style to
take advantage of everybody's abilities
we've also we're chipping about ten
samples with the Unreal Engine and have
many more in the pipeline one of the
samples for example is a shooter game we
thought what to kind of demonstrate what
a very simple and basic but next
generation type of Pewter would look
like this is the sample making available
to the entire community for free the
community can take this and all the
assets and all the code and build their
own games with it and so here you see
the shooter
weapons we have enemies we have
something out here but it's just one of
many examples are providing to show the
Kennedy how to build games of different
types we have a strategy game that's
basically a tower defense type of
scenario you have some other simple 2-d
game examples and on other things on the
way honey is the engine for different
genres of games at this point you think
that it the engine isn't just a shooter
engine anymore itself or just to have
anything you might might have going and
because you have the combination of the
full ed or in the blueprint system and
before C++ source code for those four
platforms you really not limited by what
provides at all you're limited only by
your imagination and your
to development cool things with it and
so we were looking forward to seeing
what people can do with it so we've made
a great green amount of fun learning it
and we're really excited to be able to
make it available this way everyone
and now um well uh any questions anyway
I would like after that any of these
times yes oh sure so at the five percent
royalty terms apply to gross revenue
from users from all aspects of the game
that would include the sale price of the
game if it has one
if the game is free-to-play you announce
microtransactions includes micro
transaction revenue and the developer
community from advertising and this is
explained in a lot of detail on our
website there's an end user License
Agreement meant to be the simplest
possible amount of lines all the all the
ways that that these terms were it's
designed to be simple and enter Keable
so that you know if if a developer
succeeds with the engine and we
succeeded
and because we're pricing the engine
available with everyone the same basic
subscription prices in an MMO you know
that's not going to fund 100 person
development team our whole business
model is structured so that we succeed
with this Elliott cooperate succeed and
making great games and that's what
really excites us about this business
model he reminds me of this year our
dates back in 1991 when released one
episode of a game for free and then
asked people to send in a check and then
I know a three and a half inch floppy
direct desk with that with the other
episodes of the game with that model if
our product sucks
nobody's never going to pay for it so we
are absolutely forced by the economics
of the world
valiant everyone and make sure the terms
are I know if the game is if the game is
completely free then there's no way to
attach to it so everybody can do
anything they want as a hobby project
and release it to the public and if
you're doing it for fun then then
there's over yeah
console projects will be separately
negotiated back yes right now
so other ones in for runs really well on
console we have some stuff in our DDT
but shutting it off
we were support Xbox one and PlayStation
4 we have a that shooter game chat has
nothing around a high frame rate on the
console platforms is an example we can't
provide the console source to the
general public under these terms because
the variance in the age agreements in
place it is available under negotiated
license you know for anything who's a
building game with other engines for and
each console access we can talk to us
and we can find a way to give you access
you know we hope in the future over the
coming months and working with Microsoft
and Sony to find a way to make all this
console support generally available to
everybody that's what we'd like to do
but you know opening up things really
widely to the Indian community are new
to all of us and it's going to take a
few months to figure that out well have
additional cost would it be for the
additional licenses heard counsel the
console terms their custom negotiated oh
depending on the scale so in addition to
these terms that we've announced here we
will still work with any game developer
who wanted to negotiate custom license
terms you know some developers and
publishers prefer to pay no royalties at
all and so they negotiated a deal where
they paid you know some money up front
generally in our development
and it's changed for nothing royalties
for console access we can do anything
ranging from like the terms would have
been on the team but for a good team
voting ago game we're gonna try to be
very supportive so is there anything you
can say about Unreal Tournament
it's normally debuted with engine
technology oh no we are not shipping
another tournament we have a lot of
nostalgia for that being but actually
you're not developing anything in the
game universe at all at the moment we
have a you know we've announced
fortnight which is a roll yeah you're
you're building structures and then
defending them in zombie attacks by day
and by night this game will be staying
more about lately we don't have we don't
have the game to show you here today at
GDC we're developing that they have
several other projects other than they
aren't announced yet being built with
Unreal Engine 4 and so we're pushing the
engine is feature set on all platforms
really hard ranging from MP TV console
her mobile and then well we just have to
leave the announcements of those things
to later any more questions
okay well thank you very much for coming
forward to seeing how this all works out</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
