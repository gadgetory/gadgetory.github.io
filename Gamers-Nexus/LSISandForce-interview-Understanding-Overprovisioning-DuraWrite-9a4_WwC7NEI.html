dotnet and i am here with kent smith
from LSI and we are here to talk about
the San force controllers and SSD
controllers in general Kent can you tell
us a little bit more about what you do
here at LSI sure I'm the senior director
of outbound marketing for LSI and
specifically I focus on the sand force
controllers and the technology we have
so when when consumers are looking at
the SSD market today you obviously see
various capacities on the drives 240
gigabytes 256 gigabytes we've talked a
little bit about over-provisioning and
how that affects capacity and why it's
important can you tell us more about
over-provisioning and why consumers
should care about it absolutely it's a
it's a very misunderstood concept
over-provisioning is very important
because the the capacity that the SSD
has in spare or that which is over
provisioned is very important during
garbage collection and so if an SSD is
giving all the capacity to the user
there's no spare area for it to do its
recycling and what happens is it slows
down in that period so if you take a
small portion of the user space let's
say seven percent you can typically get
back a much larger improvement in
performance usually on the order of
twenty percent or more and in fact last
year at the flash memory summit I did a
whole presentation just on this very
topic and so that's actually available
online and you can look at your your
your users could look at that and see
more details behind that but also you
know just on the client side typically
you'll have like a seven percent
difference but to really understand how
much you can improve performance and
enterprise SSD will oftentimes take as
much as twenty eight percent of that
user space and give it in the form of
over-provisioning so instead of 256 gigs
you might see a 200 gigabyte drive and
so you know a lot of people say hey
you're stealing gigabytes from me you
know and it's funny when I see that
because those enterprise SSDs are
disley higher in performance you know
twenty-eight percent reduction in
userspace could equate to a fifty
percent or higher performance
improvement so users shouldn't think
they're losing anything they're getting
it in speed and performance and that's
really the reason for ssds in the first
place so one of the key differentiators
force and force from what I understand
is dura right and can you tell us a
little bit more about this technology
and what it does and why it's relevant
to consumers yeah sure adder right is
actually a very unique feature force and
force controllers introduced back when
we first introduced our first controller
and again just like over-provisioning a
lot of people don't really understand
what it's doing and how it benefits
users the entropy which is kind of the
the randomness of the data if you have a
relatively low entropy file you can
reduce its size on the SSD and so the
advantage of that is directly related to
what we were just talking about for
over-provisioning so if I had let's say
50 gigabytes worth of data and I could
make it physically fit into twenty five
gigabytes I then have another twenty
five gigabytes of over-provisioning and
we were just talking about how you can
take a little amount of user space and
it translates into a huge performance
gain and that also is what dura rights
doing so they're very interrelated and
so if you had an SSD with relatively
typical entropy you can gain a
tremendous performance advantage and so
that's what a lot of benchmarks show
when you when you run them with some of
the real world benchmarks you see a lot
of real world entropy and so that's
really what you're going to see when you
get the drive and start using it on its
own if you take a more synthetic
benchmark it depends on how much entropy
that benchmark has so if it's not very
compressible if it's completely
randomized data the benchmark is going
to look pretty bad on a sandforce drive
and so people will say oh see that's
what I could expect
my data is all you know high entropy I
have a lot of MPEG data SSD is generally
comprised of a combination of different
entropy types especially when it's your
boot drive so if you have a system
you're booting from that SSD the
operating system itself takes a lot of
capacity and that has a huge advantage
with dura right so a lot of your
capacity is already already going to be
condensed and even if you were to give a
hundred percent entropy after that on
top of the OS you're still going to have
quite a bit of game so again if you if
you take benchmarks that synthetically
are just looking at high entropy data
you're never going to actually see that
in the real world so Durrett is a huge
advantage for for ssds all the San force
SSDs have that capability and you know
when you test with a real world
benchmark you can really see its
advantages there's another area that's
really important for ssds and that's
right amplification and there's there's
again a lot of people that are sort of
confused over that whole area and so
right amplification first introduced by
Intel and other companies back in the
early early two thousand nine and then
later San first introduced a write
amplification of actually less than one
and so the idea behind ratification is
you send so much information to a hard
disk drive and that data is written
directly to the hard disk drive so it
doesn't have an idea of a right
amplification because what gets read
from the host to the hard disk drive is
written directly on an SSD because it's
using NAND flash it has to be moved
around during what's called garbage
collection and so the the problem is
that when you write from the host to the
SSD you actually have to move that data
multiple times so you're writing in an
amplified form so what you write to the
flash is many times greater than
you rode from the host and so you get
this right application factor now
there's many things that affect it when
you write sequentially you can keep a
relatively low write amplification when
you write randomly you get a really high
number now most people wouldn't care
about this except SSDs have a limited
write cycle because of the flash memory
so the more times you right to it the
shorter its life will be so you want to
keep your right amplification down as
low as possible now in general you can't
really control it you know there's not
things you can do hey I'm going to I'm
going to stop writing certain data that
would be ridiculous what's the point of
that so what you need is technologies
that can take advantage of it and in
fact the the lsi sandforce technologies
like dura right have a huge advantage in
this area the capability of Dura right
can actually reduce the right
amplification less than one because of
its data reduction technology you write
less data in the first place so then
when you're garbage collecting and it's
moving that data around it takes
actually quite a bit of time before it
ever equates to the original size and so
you have a huge advantage your drives
last much longer and again that's only
available if you're using a an lsi
sandforce controller in your SSD</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
