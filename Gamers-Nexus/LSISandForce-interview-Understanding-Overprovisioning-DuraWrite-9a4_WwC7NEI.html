Donna and I am here with Kent Smith from
LSI and we are here to talk about the
Sanford's controllers and SSD
controllers in general Kent can you tell
us a little bit more about what you do
here at LSI sure I'm the senior director
of outbound marketing for LSI and
specifically I focus on the SandForce
controllers and the technology we have
so when when consumers are looking at
the SSD market today you obviously see
various capacities on the drives to 40
gigabytes 256 gigabytes
we've talked a little bit about
over-provisioning and how that affects
capacity and why it's important can you
tell us more about over-provisioning and
why consumers should care about it
absolutely it's a it's a very
misunderstood concept over-provisioning
is very important because the the
capacity that the SSD has in spare or
that which is over provisioned is very
important during garbage collection and
so if an SSD is giving all the capacity
to the user there's no spare area for it
to do its recycling and what happens is
it slows down in that period so if you
take a small portion of the user space
let's say 7% you can typically get back
a much larger improvement in performance
usually on the order of 20% or more and
in fact last year at the flash memory
summit I did a whole presentation just
on this very topic and so that's
actually available online and you can
look at your your your users could look
at that and see more details behind that
um but also you know just on the client
side typically you'll have like a 7%
difference but to really understand how
much you can improve performance and
enterprise SSD will oftentimes take as
much as 28% of that user space and give
it in the form of over provisioning so
instead of 256 gigs you might see a 200
gigabyte Drive and so you know a lot of
people say hey you're stealing gigabytes
from me you know and it's funny when I
see that because those enterprise SSDs
are Tremaine
higher in performance you know a 28%
reduction in userspace could equate to a
50% or higher performance improvement so
users shouldn't think they're losing
anything they're getting it in speed and
performance and that's really the reason
for SSDs in the first place so one of
the key differentiators force and force
from what I understand is dira right and
can you tell us a little bit more about
this technology and what it does and why
it's relevant to consumers yeah sure
adder right is actually a very unique
feature force and force controllers
introduced back when we first introduced
our first controller and again just like
over-provisioning a lot of people don't
really understand what it's doing and
and how it benefits users the entropy
which is kind of the the randomness of
the data if you have a relatively low
entropy file you can reduce its size on
the SSD and so the advantage of that is
directly related to what we were just
talking about for over-provisioning so
if I had let's say 50 gigabytes worth of
data and I could make it physically fit
into 25 gigabytes
I then have another 25 gigabytes of
over-provisioning and we were just
talking about how you can take a little
amount of user space and it translates
into a huge performance gain and that
also is what dira writes doing so
they're very interrelated and so if you
had an SSD with relatively typical
entropy you can gain a tremendous
performance advantage and so that's what
a lot of benchmarks show when you when
you run them with some of the real world
benchmarks you see a lot of real-world
entropy and so that's really what you're
gonna see when you get the drive and
start using it on its own if you take a
more synthetic benchmark it depends on
how much entropy that benchmark has so
if it's not very compressible if it's
completely randomized data the benchmark
is gonna look pretty bad on a sand force
drive and so people will say oh see
that's what I could
Specht my data is all you know high
entropy I have a lot of MPEG data SSD is
generally comprised of a combination of
different entropy types especially when
it's your boot drive so if you have a
system you're booting from that SSD the
operating system itself takes a lot of
capacity and that has a huge advantage
with dira right so a lot of your
capacity is already already going to be
condensed and even if you were to give a
hundred percent entropy after that on
top of the OS you're still gonna have
quite a bit of game so again if you if
you take benchmarks that synthetically
are just looking at high entropy data
you're never gonna actually see that in
the real world so Durrett is a huge
advantage for for SSDs all the SandForce
SSDs have that capability and you know
when you test with a real-world
benchmark you can really see its
advantages there's another area that's
really important for SSDs and that's
right amplification and there's there's
again a lot of people that are sort of
confused over that whole area and so
write amplification first introduced by
Intel and other companies back in the
early early 2009 and then later sent
first introduced a write amplification
of actually less than one and so the
idea behind ratification is you send so
much information to a hard disk drive
and that data is written directly to the
hard disk drive so it doesn't have an
idea of a right amplification because
what gets read from the host to the hard
disk drive is written directly on an SSD
because it's using NAND flash it has to
be moved around during what's called
garbage collection and so the the
problem is that when you write from the
host to the SSD you actually have to
move that data multiple times so you're
writing in an amplified form so what you
write to the flash is many times greater
than
you rode from the host and so you get
this right application factor now
there's many things that affect it when
you write sequentially you can keep a
relatively low write amplification when
you write randomly you get a really high
number now most people wouldn't care
about this except SSDs have a limited
write cycle because of the flash memory
so the more times you write to it
the shorter its life will be so you want
to keep your write amplification down as
low as possible now in general you can't
really control it you know there's not
things you can do hey I'm gonna I'm
gonna stop writing certain data yeah
that would be ridiculous what's the
point of that so what you need is
technologies that can take advantage of
it and in fact the the LSI SandForce
technologies like dura right have a huge
advantage in this area the capability of
Dura right can actually reduce the write
amplification less than one because of
its data reduction technology you write
less data in the first place so then
when you're garbage collecting and it's
moving that data around it takes
actually quite a bit of time before it
ever equates to the original size and so
you have a huge advantage your drives
lasts much longer
and again that's only available if
you're using a an LSI SandForce
controller in your SSD</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
