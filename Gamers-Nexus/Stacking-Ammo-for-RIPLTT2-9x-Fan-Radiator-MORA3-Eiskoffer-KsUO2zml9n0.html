about basically the water-cooling booth
right now it's mod my mods alpha cool
and water cool all in one booth here at
back so technically there's some
competition going on but it's all
friendly so we're gonna start here with
some water cool stuff also got the Alpha
cool ice cow for I'll talk about at the
end and the thing I want to start with
is the mora 3 radiator before that this
video is brought to you by the EVGA z10
mechanical keyboard the EVGA z10
includes a small display readout top and
center capable of providing hardware
monitoring information and EVGA
precision statistics the board ships
with either MX brown or MX blue switches
offers a column of programmable macro
keys a volume slider a dimmer and a
detachable wrist rest
learn more at the link in the
description below the reason I want to
start with this is because we recently
did that hash tag rip LTT stream where a
couple of you recommended that for the
future we switch our cooling to one of
these because I think we have the Titan
V doing something like I don't know 500
watts when it was shunt resistor modded
and we were running out of thermal
Headroom at times so the idea here this
can fit in its current configuration 920
millimeter fans on the back they have
two out of four possible 180s
fixed to the backside of it technically
if we have b-roll of it it looks like
they're spinning against each other but
actually the back ones aren't connected
they're only spinning from all the air
going through from the front fans but
either way so this it's the more three
it can do nine 120 s they have
perversion exited 911 40s you do four
180s on it or any other mathematical
combination there are also several
brackets so you can go up in size for
fans if you wanted to obviously wouldn't
need to go down in terms of basic specs
on the side there's a reservoir mount
that I'm going to talk about in a moment
there's
one over here and then it's got a card
here that says 110 feet of copper tubes
30 square feet of aluminum fins so
pretty large radiator anyway we might be
considering that for our next trip LTTE
to stream because the idea is for Pascal
for voltage GPUs the architecture goes
up in frequency for about every 5
degrees Celsius drop in temperature it's
actually extremely responsive to
temperature down to about negative 10
degrees Celsius at which point you run
into a cold bug so this kind of thing
would help us get an extra couple
degrees practically and I probably don't
put in a lot of systems but for
something like that makes a lot of sense
or ultra silent one last spec on it I
can handle about 2 to 2.5 kilowatts of
heat which is a lot of heat to give you
the idea I think I don't know how much
we're doing in heat but in just raw
power we were at something like a
thousand 1,100 on that 18 Core Plus
Titan V rig so next thing this is a
pretty cool heat cooler heat killer
reservoir a couple things I want to
point out one these bars can be
customized for color you can get a raw
aluminum if you want to anodized it
yourself it's all made in Germany and
they can do some custom work for you and
also very easy to twist off and put back
on and the the glass is pretty serious
stuff so we had a demo I think we have
b-roll of it of the rep here hitting the
glass with a piece of aluminum and it
holds up pretty well now do you need
that for your hope and loop now probably
not but you also don't eat an open loop
so if you're going part of the way I
guess they figure you might go all the
way and get the extra rebuffed glass but
yes that comes up in 100 150 and 200
millimeter options it can fit here comes
blank you can fit a DDC pump or a d5
pump for the pump options a couple other
things they have here
I mean just a heat killer for plate
block this is not news at this point
there's a thread Ripper blog not news at
this point we've covered it in the past
however it opens the door for us a bit
on a future water-cooling content that
we've been looking into lately so other
than all that stuff there's a couple of
cool things here there's a bagel block
that has some LED routing options and
we'll be talking more about GPU blocks
in the future as well last bit of
contents cover for this booth is the
Alpha cool ice cover so we have some
b-roll this one as well it's basically
it's $210 and it's a an all parts
included bending kit so the idea is it's
got a big piece of steel underneath on
the bottom we'll have footage of that
you can mount the different to bending
pieces to it so they can retain the
tubes there's a bunch of different
retention pieces on it it's also got all
the different angles so I mean 0 30 60
90 and then you can obviously split
those as needed depending on what you're
trying to bend 360s included as well
couple of tools and and then all the
mounting hardware so that you can mount
all the pieces to the board and get the
bend on basically the idea is you buy it
and then you don't need anything else
for bending ever again so that's the ice
Carver that's been out for a little
while now but it's the first time I've
seen it in person so I thought we'd show
it off that's it for this booth at PAX
