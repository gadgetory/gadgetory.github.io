Don that and today we're looking at raid
max's new iteration of their cobra
budget gaming case we received the cobra
case around the same time as CES was
going on so to the same tune as our
armored Evo and impending phantom 630
review it made sense review a purely
budget targeted enclosure with gamers in
mind as always let's talk hard specs
before we get into any of my opinions
and the objective thermal performance
data the cobra is currently marketed at
around $70 MSRP placing it firmly in the
odd niche that lies between the ultra
budget and true mid-range sections of PC
cases and the the Cobra ships with two
120-millimeter fans one rear exhaust fan
and one from intake fan with a green LED
that is not toggleable and there's
availability for either tomb or 120
millimeters to 140 millimeters or 1 180
millimeter top fan as well as one 120
millimeter bottom fan if your PSU is not
large I did some testing on which which
extra fan slot was optimal if you did
decide to buy one more fan so check that
out toward the back half of the video
raid Max's Cobra offers a few dust
filters on the bottom a couple of cable
cutouts for cable management and a full
25 millimetres of depth between the
mounting wall and the right side panel
at the deepest part of the bezel there
are cable tie anchors scattered along
the green mounting wall as well making
cables fairly easy to maintain
so the Cobra as you may have noticed by
now ships with a green front led and
like I said a green mounting panel but
you won't get the green glow in the side
window that rain max shows off so
prevalently in their marketing images to
get that you'll need to add another
source of green light probably a cold
cathode or a different rear fan and
speaking of the window
the Cobra case has a small but
interesting side view window that is
using a sort of dragon scale pattern on
the glass I guess you could call it and
the window is shifted away from the ugly
drive cage scaffolding enough where you
won't even see it so that's kind of nice
but it still tries to give a view of the
CP
and VGA you won't really see at least
with our build you really just see the
bottom left quadrant of the CPU cooler
and the back ugly part of the VGA so no
big gain there but it is kind of a nice
thought with all of the basics out of
the way though let's talk about build
quality cable management and cooling
performance the raid maxx Cobra case is
fairly standard in build quality it's
surprisingly sturdy for a case of its
caliber of its of its low price and the
materials are the typical steel plastic
mix but the plastic isn't abundant
enough to feel like it cheapens the case
the green paint is resilient and doesn't
feel like it'll be chipping easily so
that's a plus and one of the fans and I
couldn't figure out which one by ear but
one of the fans makes an annoying
resonant vibrational acoustic as a
result of turbulence between the fans
blades and the cases mesh this is a
common problem with cases of this design
and is resolved by certain aftermarket
fans like silver stones new ap 123 that
we use in this video the noise wasn't
bad enough to dry drive me crazy and
throw the case out the window to
defenestrate the case if you will but it
was it was enough to drive someone who
is already sensitive to such noise a
little bit insane so to the same tune of
that the front fan is largely obstructed
by the drive cage scaffolding and the
plastic front panel and of course the
metal mesh that sits between the two
which is the source of this vibration
all of these obstacles to airflow will
be evident in our thermal benchmark in
that I'll show in a moment
but it definitely is not the ninety
percent intake that you would like to
see in performance cases this isn't a
performance case though the cable
management was actually very satisfied
there's plenty of room on the dark side
of the motherboard so to speak for cable
routing even the fat 24-pin cable with
others routed under and over it and the
cutouts are mostly well placed the one
the one exception being that the 24 pin
cutout is I believe it should be shifted
about a quarter inch downward for better
concealment of the 24 pin cable but
overall small complaint they're all
pretty good for a case of its price one
interesting item is the interior drive
bays the 2.5 inch and 3.5 inch bays the
cobra natively ships with 4
two-and-a-half inch bays that are made
for SSDs obviously to put a laptop
laptop drive in there but it's it's for
SSD cages
that's crazy for a case of this price in
my opinion because at the end of the day
considering that a buyer at this budget
will likely not own for solid-state
drives I just I don't know that those
are ever going to be utilized by most
users but I suppose it shows a shift in
market trends regardless if you can't
keep the components cooled everything's
a bust so let's talk about cooling
performance our case testing methodology
is all included in the review linked in
the description below but in short we
put the CPU under for threaded large
FFTs in prime95 for the CPU test which
brings it to 100% load and we use fir
mark for the GPU test which also puts
that I want the GPU at 100% load and
these are conducted independently of
each other here you can see the CPU
thermal performance despite its moderate
quality and decent feature set the kobra
really falters and it's cool in
performance this is mostly due to the
two fan design and heavily obstructed
intake but if you were to purchase an
additional fan and obviously this will
change based upon your CPU coolers
architecture we found that the top
exhaust position was most efficient and
cooled at least our cooler down on our
CPU by an additional three degrees
Celsius which is quite noticeable the
that does push the price of the case up
though because you have to account for
another fan so do keep that in mind the
bottom intake position called the GPU
down similarly but didn't benefit the
CPU a whole lot here's the GPU
performance chart and once again the
Cobra comes in dead last and the case
isn't anything amazing in the cooling
department that's for sure but whether
or not this is relevant to you will
depend largely on your cooler selection
and overclocking intentions if you do
plan to overclock and will be using a
cheap mid-range or for bid the stock
cooler I'd probably recommend that you
consider another case if you're just
running a true budget or mid-range
system at stock settings well I think
the Cobra is quite acceptable for that
actually in terms of the overall value
and my conclusions I really don't think
the case is anything groundbreaking and
that's evident to those of you who are
experienced with such things but it did
have excellent cable management features
for a case of its price and had a few
cooling expansion
making it a potential winner for budget
systems and some mid-range systems the
main reason you'd be purchasing this
over an r5 s11 410 or other similarly
sub $100 case is that you'd be looking
for the green aesthetic and the the just
generally the jaggedness of the front
panel if you don't need killer
out-of-the-box performance and you do
like the appearance of this case well by
all means this seems like your case go
for it if you could care less about the
aesthetics then I'd probably point you
elsewhere for performance I was quite
happy with the overall quality of
materials at the price though especially
given the armored Evo's disappointment
but with that check out the link to
review below for more details and let me
know if you have questions and I will
see you all next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
