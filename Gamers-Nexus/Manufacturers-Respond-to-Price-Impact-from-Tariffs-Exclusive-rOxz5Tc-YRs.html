impacting PC component prices by now
with increases upwards of 10 percent to
25 percent by January 1st we've spoken
with several companies and individuals
in the industry to better understand how
PC builders can expect prices to
increase on our list of those providing
insight as EVGA CEO Andrew Hahn NZXT
silverstone and alpha cool among
off-record insight from others in the
very least North American buyers can
anticipate price increases as a result
of the current administration's new
tariffs it's just a question of how much
of that price is passed on to the
consumer before that this video is
brought to you by power colors red
dragon Vega 56 which is now below MSRP
on new I got $380 with a rebate from the
28th to the 30th of September when we
first tested Vega 56 we found the card
competitive and fun for tweaking and
modding and now that it's back in stock
it's worth the consideration
Vega 56 also comes with three free games
including Assassin's Creed Odyssey star
control and a strange Brigade while
supplies last
learn more at the link below here's the
TLDR of the tariffs everything imported
from China that is a computer component
for the most part will be affected so
that's almost everything you buy within
this specific industry there are a few
exceptions we'll go through those but
most of the things you buy if you were
in North America for sure will be
affected if you're not in North America
there could still be an outward reaching
effect so even if you're in Europe even
though these tariffs obviously don't
apply to you since they are u.s. tariffs
imposed on Chinese imports even if
you're in Europe you might feel some
affect of this because companies are
going to be trying to stabilize their
revenue sources as they are compensating
for potential downtrend and overall
sales especially in the US market so the
tariffs were pushed into law by the US
federal government with the first 10%
tariff taking effect October 1st of this
year and then after that there's another
it's a total 25% tariff so there's
another 15% tariff that will be imposed
by January 1st of 2019 so total impacts
will be about 25 percent increase in
cost to bring the goods into the US
ports or North American ports into the
poor and then distributed to Canada for
example so that's that's a total impact
10% by October 1st that's the most
immediate and we'll be facing that
within a couple of days here we're
looking at over a 25 percent increase in
product and port prices by next year
which we passed on to consumers the full
list of tariffs includes power supplies
motherboards video cards complete system
builds sometimes SLI and NV link bridges
SSDs mouse pads mice keyboards and mice
only if bundled together but not if sold
separately for the keyboards that is CPU
coolers are affected cases chairs and
more the tariffs cost is applied as
goods come into port technically it is
the company that must pay the tariffs
but those costs will be passed along to
consumers this isn't because the
companies are evil it's because as a
reminder a lot of the margin in this
industry is very low so some video cards
we've worked with recently have profit
margins of under 3% like 2.8 for example
on one of the cards we recently
benchmarked there's an average of around
4% very few cards reach even an 8%
margin the retailers often profit more
than the video card makers in terms of
strict margin and all this means that
it's impossible for the manufacturers to
bear the burden of a tariff increase
without consumers also paying more for
the products they buy the most heavily
impacted companies are those which make
electrical components that come from
China so that would include all of them
even case manufacturers are getting hit
here because aluminum and steel are
included on the list of affected items
and of course some of those cases do
include power supplies or other
electronics very few manufacturers in
this industry make things outside of
China and it's typically Taiwan when
it's made elsewhere Taiwan isn't tooled
up with enough factories to allow for a
mass switchover of manufacturing but it
does have a few low capacity factories
like gigabytes motherboard and video
card factory a few case factories like
in wins and Lian Lee's but not much more
than that
even still all of these companies make
more Goods in China than not and will
still be affected one off-record
industry source told us that some
companies will likely offset prices by
greater than the 25% import overhead as
the time cost to money carries a value
as well companies now won't be able to
invest as much
their money elsewhere like ordering more
products because they needs a free up
budget to pay the extra import fees or
the tariffs this has a knock-on effect
where the companies lose spending power
and will charge consumers more to try
and make up for it
the need-to-know information is as
follows October 1st is when you're gonna
see the first 10% tariff impact but
whether or not it affects you depends on
warehouse inventory we'll talk about
that in a moment there's an additional
15% January 1st and then the companies
are currently trying to stockpile
inventory in warehouses as much as they
can because the tariffs the extra money
being paid on these imports takes effect
when it gets to ports and that's October
1st year later for the first 10% so
anything they can bring them before
October 1st and this has been going on
for the last few months now as they've
prepared is not going to be affected by
this increase and depending on the
company hopefully most of them will not
be passing along the tariffs on products
that they imported before it took effect
but we'll see how that plays out so tell
me is with larger warehouses in the US
will fare better during this cycle EVGA
has a pretty small warehouse in the US
as an example gigabyte has limited
warehouse space as well but from what we
understand a decent amount still so
having more warehouse space bringing
more stuff in before the tariffs take
effect will benefit the consumer because
you shouldn't have to pay that extra
cost because they didn't have to pay
that extra cost unless of course they
all decide the profits here off of it
anyway but we really have no way of
validating that so inventory that makes
it in before the tariff hike will dodge
the cost increase to the manufacturers
and hopefully consumers and just for
perspective as to how wide reaching this
is if you think it's not affecting
everyone actually the cost increase also
applies to shipping costs to increases
here because as manufacturers are
panicking and trying to get more of
their stuff out of China and into the US
before the tariff hike shipping costs
are going up and we know this firsthand
so even outside of the tariff impacts on
cost of goods for goods which are not
affected by the tariffs their shipping
cost is still going up our own mod mats
for example the ones we saw we saw on
the store the one I have on the table
here shipping cost of these went up by
30% just because of the limited space on
planes on boats what
whatever shipping mode you have even the
trucks that go from the factories to the
plains it's limited so that's driving
the cost up to ship things even for
things which are not directly affected
by the tariff a 30% increase on our
shipping rates eats margin a lot and you
can bet that this also applies to
computer part manufacturers we've
decided to keep our prices on the
product the same but that does mean
we're profiting less as a result and
that's on a product with already low
margin some companies can't afford to do
this if they're making things like video
cards and power supplies because the
margins are low enough that the increase
in cost would destroy the margin and
leave them losing money we spoke with a
few of our international and shipping
logistics experts on these increases and
one of them provided the following
comment quote the air and ocean rates as
I advised are increasing due to the
providers polling space out of both air
and ocean airlines have reduced their
flights and steamship lines that have
reduced their capacities and allocations
out of China imports from China continue
to be strong and are increasing however
with the next round of tariffs imports
will sharply start to decrease
Andrew Hahn CEO of EVGA told gamers
Nexus the following thanks for reaching
out and being proactive to educate the
gaming community about the upcoming
tariff and how it could impact gaming
components with the previous imposing
tariffs on China made goods so far the
impact has been minimal to EVGA based on
list at number one effective July 6th
and list number two effective the 23rd
of August however list number three will
have a significant impact to the GPU
power supply and motherboard categories
for EVGA with a proposed at 25% tariff
since many key products are produced in
China the ultimate impact to the
consumers is significant to our
knowledge not all manufacturers
including EVGA have a sufficient
capacity to produce all these products
outside of China in the near term with
the upcoming holiday season EVGA is
trying its best to mitigate the impacts
to the gaming customers NZXT provided
gamers nexus to this statement
unfortunately the latest round of
proposed tariffs on imports from China
will very likely impact on z-axis
products if we cannot obtain a waiver or
legally reclassify our Goods will be
forced to increase our suggested retail
to cover whatever tariff level is
finally set currently either a 10
percent or 25 percent increase is being
considered the timing for the increase
would be directly tied to win the tariff
goods clear US customs and move into our
retail channels the price increases
would affect all of our North American
customers including Canada NZXT
continued by saying quote everyone NZXT
works very hard to deliver quality
products and great service at fair
prices it would be regrettable to see
our prices increase to customers in
North America due to changes in our
federal government's trade policy if you
wish to express your opinions on these
policy decisions and how they are
affecting you you can find your elected
officials at contacting Congress org
silverstone noted that all of its
products have been classified as
affected by the tariff and the u.s.
office will have to increase prices as a
result silverstone noted the followings
a gamer's axis before the tariffs came
into effect quote we are aware of the
possible impacts the tariffs will have
on our products will raise prices if our
own cost is affected and will not take
advantage of the circumstances to
increase our profit margin alpha coul
also replied to a request from comment
and stated the following it seems alpha
cool isn't affected by the tariffs as
much as some of the other brands in the
industry will be our prices on certain
products will have to increase these
include but are not exclusive to our
hard and soft tubing our ice cam cable
combs and our alpha cord sleeving
this is due to them falling into
categories that will have the increase
implemented we don't yet know how much
of an effect it will have on the pricing
for the end-user
we're trying to keep them as low as
possible still but when a region
implements an increase unfortunately it
has a knock-on effect the US region is
one that alpha cool is currently looking
to be more active in and the tariffs are
not ideal we don't think it will affect
our end goal too much it will still be
able to purchase our products at a
reasonable price and although the prices
may go up slightly we're committed to
making the increases to the end-user as
easy to swallow as possible we look like
we're a little luckier than some of our
friends in the industry and we hope that
other companies are not hit so hard that
it isn't viable for them to continue
trading it is certainly a strange time
for the industry's gigabites statement
to partners noted that notebooks
keyboards at memory and headsets will be
unaffected at this time given existing
memory price-fixing concerns
is a silver lining and otherwise of bad
news we don't fully understand why
motherboards Paris flies and mice can be
affected but laptops are somehow
unaffected but it has something to do
with the fact that it's a preassembled
complete unit we also spoke with several
the larger component manufacturers off
record who didn't want to go on record
with a statement like some of these
other companies all of them 100% of the
people we spoke with shared concerns of
a 10 to 25% price increase from the
tariffs and concerns of impact to
consumer pricing as well so I mean
that's we I can't remember a time when
we've done something like this reaching
out to manufacturers where when 100% of
the people come back with the same
answer which is that they're all
concerned about it
so this is real at this point alpha coal
was the closest manufacturer to one that
expressed that they aren't heavily
impacted
well that's because alpha cool doesn't
trade too much in the u.s. right now
they're trying to get into the US market
so these tariffs will absolutely affect
alpha coals ability to enter the US
market and start serving a customer base
here and that's unfortunate but as a
company overall they do most of their
sales elsewhere outside of the US so
they aren't impacted quite as hard as
some of the others but they're the
closest to a company that is less
impacted and it's still not completely
unaffected so this will be bad for the
industry overall it will hurt the
consumers it will hurt all the companies
in it including media because even just
on our side you're looking at a
follow-on impact of reduced advertising
budget because our companies have to
worry about how do they afford the
tariff cost there is reduced affiliate
revenue because consumers will probably
be buying less and we don't really
benefit from the increased price if it's
also everything is getting tariffs to
when it comes in and consumers buying
lastest hurts everything of course so
reduced interest as products become
increasingly difficult to purchase as a
problem and the US market even though
it's actually it's it's about 40
something percent a viewership for most
of the youtube channels you watch it's
the largest buying market at least out
of all the channels we know that use
affiliate links and things like that the
u.s. comprises most of the revenue the
u.s. also has the highest advertising
spend and
terms of cost per thousand views it's
got the highest affiliate revenue
payouts so to lose a big chunk
potentially of us-based
sales of computer hardware will impact
everybody including the media and if you
want to get involved and are a u.s.
resident your best bet of course is to
vote appropriately but as NZXT said you
can also go to contacting Congress org
that was their recommendation to find
your representatives if you don't know
who they are as for manufacturing that's
not leaving China anytime soon despite
its old reputation for low quality try
to now have some of the best facilities
for manufacturing the products you buy
on the planet that includes things like
motherboards and video cards of course
any country can have low quality as well
and they do but the components you buy
all of them for your computer including
the ones that you like a lot maybe high
end power supplies high end video cards
things like that there's a company that
makes stuff you like a lot there's an
extremely high of a certainly high
chance that at least some of the
components in that product come from
China if not the entire product as a
whole so despite the old reputation good
stuff does come out of China and it's
just at the end of the day the only
stuff I can really be moved elsewhere to
avoid potential tariff impact is
primarily going to be things like a
couple of motherboards and some video
cards in some cases and those will be
going to Taiwan next door where some
factories already exist but out of the
companies we've spoken with none of them
have an immediate plan to start building
new factories in Taiwan because the
tooling up cost of that is tremendous
and the concern from the companies we've
spoken with is that an administration
change or a decision flip on the tariffs
could mean that that effort and money
would be wasted if they start twing up a
factory and then the tariffs are wiped
out all this stuff is reverted something
like that then it's just wasted money
wasted time because it takes a while to
get those factories up and running so
it's not like it's an instant flip over
that they can do and manufacturing in
the u.s. is just not even on the radar
for all the companies we spoke with
which is really not all that surprised
and knowing what we know the entire
supply chain
in Asia for this stuff like if you're
making a motherboard video card power
supply capacitors come from Asia Japan
in a lot of cases MOSFETs Asia inductors
Asia so the entire supply chain is
already there which means most the
manufacturing will likely stay there
to avoid shipping stuff back and forth a
whole lot so that's where we stand right
now aluminum and steel also affected by
these tariffs which means cases without
electronics will be affected by these
tariffs and we did have notes from
several case companies some of them did
not want to go on record or we're not
yet prepared but we'll probably get
commentary from them soon enough but the
case comedy silver stones in here they
went on record with an answer and DX T's
in here but some of the other ones did
strongly support our decision to make
this video because the concern I think
for everyone in the industry right now
that makes stuff is that consumers will
see the price hikes and just feel like
they're getting screwed for no reason
like it's just profiteering
and while that is certainly possible
it's possible that a company could
import a lot of stuff now and increase
the prices on it anyway that surely
could happen the end game is that as we
get through the current inventory it's
actually just going to be a straight
tariff increase and that will be passed
on to you so the companies we spoke with
wanted to make sure that consumers
understood that this isn't like the RAM
price fixing concerns or the mining
price higher prices concerns that we saw
over the last year this is in fact a
result of a federal government decision
it will impact the u.s. almost certainly
Canada and then there can be a knock-on
effect as a local said to other
countries and regions in the world so
that about covers it we're not going to
get any deeper in this it's it becomes a
political topic so we're staying away
from that but strictly as it affects the
computer hardware industry this will
change the prices in the not-so-distant
future so keep an eye out for it and if
you want to read more there's plenty of
material out there USTR has all the
documents for affected components if you
want to see those as well
