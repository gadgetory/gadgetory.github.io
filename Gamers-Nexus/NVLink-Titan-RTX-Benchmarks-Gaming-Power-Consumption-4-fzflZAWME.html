with the 13 50 megahertz lock on one of
our tighten our TX cards and now we can
properly test them in SLI so these are
the same device they're both working
this time and they come out to about
$5,000 total between the two of them
we've done this test before with our TX
2080 TI's and these really aren't all
that different we have a review of the
Titan r-tx on the channel if you want to
see the performance differences between
one of them and one of the 20 ATT eyes
you can check that review of it today
we're really just seeing how far does it
go when you put them in SLI which is
what mblink
is and we look at primarily games with
some additional focus on power
consumption just just because it's fun
to see how much power system can draw
under a sort of maximum high end GPU
configuration available at present
before that this video is brought to you

or click the link below just as a
reminder these are really devices that
you're gonna use for things like
production tasks which is not what we're
testing we're testing first with gaming
and our previous test was with
overclocking power acoustics noise and
thermals and the point is really I mean
that's just it's what we want to do it's
a bit more fun and we're gonna put them
in a higher end overclocking setup at
some point in the near future but we do
hope to eventually look at these from a
production standpoint it's just we're
waiting on some of the software that we
would use for production testing to
update so we can leverage our TX and the
RT cores properly or the tensor cores as
it may be so that's something we're
waiting on the reason these are better
for production than just straight gaming
is because ultimately it's the same GPU
it's still tu on it too it's just there
are four more s times enabled on the
Titan then on the 20 80 TI and then
secondarily the only real difference
beyond that which that was an
insignificant one is that it's got a
little more than two times more memory
so it's 24 Giga bytes instead of 11 and
that is a significant change and one
which will impact things like for
example blender where blender if you're
rendering on
the GPU you might run out of GPU memory
with some specific project files but
we're not testing any of that we're
testing gaming so now that you know
those differences and where these should
be applied we can look at where they
shouldn't be applied which is in a
gaming computer with $5,000 worth of
gilded video cards inside of them Sniper
Elite 4 comes up first running at 4k
high with DirectX 12 and async compute
as always we select our game benchmarks
based on what they illustrate carefully
choosing each one sniper is the best
representation of a well optimized dx12
title with asynchronous compute with
this configuration sli tighten our TX
cards end up at 219 FPS average just
ahead of the RT x 28 et is an SLI which
run at 210 FPS average lows are well
timed on each device but we'll look at
frame times momentarily to see better
what's happening underneath the hood the
1080 Ti is in SLI end up at 170 FPS
average also strong performers in frame
times overall we see scaling of about 96
percent over a single Titan RT X cards
112 FPS average the r-tx
2080 Ti is posted roughly 94% scaling
over a single RDX 2080 Ti so the Titan
is consistent with our previous scaling
findings a well-built game will clearly
give plenty of room for scaling although
it still doesn't make any financial
sense to go with to tighten our TX cards
over to our TX 28 ETI cards and even
that's questionable frame x should be
more interesting to look at as always
this gives you a look at frame to frame
experience and illustrate to any
potential spikes or stutters that would
otherwise be averaged out we care about
lower frame times but more importantly
about consistent frame times with
minimum deviation from the mean more
than an 8 to 12 millisecond deviation
will be detectable as a stutter by users
and anything within that range is
acceptable with the Titan RT X cards in
env link we immediately see a dense
frame time bar that takes back-and-forth
in an oscillating pattern this isn't an
ideal bar every other frame is half the
speed of the previous delivery which may
speak to alternate frame rendering
patterns we're seeing frames at 3.2
milliseconds than 6.3 milliseconds in
3.2 and 6
and so on fortunately this pattern isn't
highly noticeable to the user as it's
really just three milliseconds but it's
certainly less smooth than a single
Titan r-tx a single Titan r-tx has frame
time variation of less than one
millisecond per frame which is
incredibly good its industry-leading you
can't get much smoother delivery than
that the single 20 80 TI looks similar
with a variation frame to frame of less
than one millisecond on average SLI
produces a similarly chaotic pattern for
the 1080 T eyes although a less chaotic
one for the SLI 28 ET eyes than the
Titans it's still less consistent than a
single card but ends up somewhere
between the dual Titans and a single 28
ECI for consistency the chart is getting
a bit illegible at this point so we'll
cap it here wherever you see the thicker
lines
that's an SLI configuration anywhere you
see the thinner lines is a single device
F 1 2018 gives us the opposite
perspective instead looking at a
well-built DirectX 11 title this
represents most of the games on the
market presently and in this title the
SLI Titan r-tx cards operate at 175 PS
average with frame time scaling
minimally from a single card the single
Titan r-tx does 110 FPS average with
lows at 51 and 29 as opposed to 67 and
28 for the SLI configuration
demonstrating limited gains in the frame
time department at SLI the Titan RT X
cards hold the lead of 3.8% over the
dual 28 e TI cards which is overall
unimpressive scaling versus the single
Titan RT x is 59% that's better than a
lot of games when running SLI but
nothing close to what we saw with sniper
as for CPU limitations we know from our
1080p test that this game can minimally
push 213 FPS average so we aren't
hitting a limitation there just yet far
cry 5 @ 4k places the Titan RT x NV link
cards at 114 FPS average scaling about
5.3 percent of ahead of the MV link RT x
28 e TI cards or about 25% over the dual
1080 ti cards as for scaling over a
single device the dual Titan R T X's end
up 62% ahead of a single Titan RT X with
dual 28 ET is scaled about 65% over a
single 2080 Ti and dual 1080 T is scaled
about 59% over a single 1080i 1440p
Dean shows us that we weren't hitting a
CPU limit in the previous chart although
it's starting to emerge here and we link
Titans do 143 FPS average but scaling is
now limited to 12% over a single Titan
r-tx
it's at this point that we're clearly
hitting CPU bottlenecks we won't bother
showing it but at 1080p the limit was
also 143 FPS average so that does
confirm a cap for the CPU GTA 5 deserves
a bit of a preload before we get into
the numbers if you missed it previously
we discovered an issue with GTA 5 where
i5 CPU is would bounce off of the frame
rate cap at 187 point 5 FPS average it
did so in a pretty rough way that's
resulted in higher performing i5 CPUs
getting punished for their high
performance because they'd stutter hard
with each hit to 180 7.5 fps but if you
pushed the frame rate down intentionally
making the graphics for example higher
quality that would result in a better
gameplay experience despite having
technically lowers fps in the average
this was never resolved by Rockstar and
the best solution was to just increase
the graphics quality until framerate
became worse on average a higher
framerate gave a worse experience that's
seen again here despite using an i7 8086
K at 5.1 gigahertz or so we never saw
this in our previous testing so it's
somewhat unique at 4k our sli Titan RT X
cards are hitting 151 FPS average which
would look fine if we only looked at
averages in reality the frame times are
inconsistent with one percent low as
hitting thirty-nine and 0.1% low has
gained thirteen point five so somewhere
in there were hitting stutters it's
instances like this where our 1% and
0.1% low numbers work to illustrate well
the limitations of the average frame
rate but we still need a bit more we'll
look at frame times in a second SLI 20
atti cards didn't encounter the same
issue as frame rate was low enough to
not trip GTA 5 is weird game engine
constraints that we found in the past
here's the example of why average frame
rate is insufficient for a lot of things
in this scenario the chart looks great
for the Titan RT X card for most of the
test that is until we hit about the
three thousandth frame where we
encounter 180 milliseconds
this means that you're waiting for
nearly a fifth of a second to get a new
frame which is very noticeable this
happens again toward the end then again
in rapid succession where we encounter
multiple 240ml a second frame times in a
row
performance is dismal in this title
despite overall high averages oddly the
2080 TI is in SL i don't seem to get hit
as hard the solution is to boost
graphics settings until FPS is lower on
average which will help dodge these
issues it seems like this is probably a
GTA engine bug and is related to the
previous bug that we discovered with the
i5 cpus finally here's a look at power
consumption during our GTA 5 test passes
the first set of test shows 1080p
results plotting 480 watts for total
system power with the SLI Titans or
about 330 watts total system power for
the single Titan r-tx card that
increases to 560 watts at 1440p as we
were heavily CPU limited and at the
1080p test and the single card climbs to
400 watts under the same scenario at 4k
the total system power consumption for
SLI and the Titan r-tx cards is 720
watts with a single Titan r-tx card it's
still capped at about 400 watts that's
it for this one it's just a it's just a
what-if scenario we don't suspect many
people are going to be buying these for
gaming and putting them in SLI which is
what envy link is because in this use
case envy link is it works like that's a
lie it does AFR it doesn't pull the
resources so it's SLI but people are
still gonna buy these just to have the
best just like they bought the Titan XP
for the best where you paying about two
hundred dollars per one extra frame over
the 1080 Ti at the time of launch so
they're still going to be buying these
and probably still going to be buying
them for SLI if you happen to be one of
those people who is considering that
purchase we would strongly advise that
you consider dwell 2080 T eyes instead
if even that but if you must have two
video cards for gaming you're talking
like three percent improvement by
spending two times the amount of money
so 2080 Ti is even in in dual
configurations we don't fully recommend
would be a better purchase and
if even if you have a lot of money you
can still do other things with that
money in the computer so that's that's
all we'd suggest that you consider one
upside of these though if you are buying
them is that it's a twenty eighty TI fe
PCB so if you wanted to put a water
cooler on this it's trivial you buy a 20
80 TI water block from ek or alpha cool
or thermal taker any of them and
trivially remove about 30 screws and
head and you're good to go but that's it
for this one we don't recommend the
purchase if you wanted the numbers
though you now have them so thank you
