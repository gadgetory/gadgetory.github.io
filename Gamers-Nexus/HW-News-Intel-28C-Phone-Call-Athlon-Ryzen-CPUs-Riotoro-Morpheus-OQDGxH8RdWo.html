news recap for you just before we go
over to Japan so we'll have some content
there as well just kind of walking
around and touring things and quick to
note if you missed stuff during the show
we uploaded a ton of videos YouTube
probably did not send them all to your
sub box so make sure you just go
straight to the channel and check out
what we uploaded for the last week
because there's a lot of it so for this
week's news recap we're talking about
the Intel 28 core CPU again we're also
talking about the 8086 K the Athlon 200
GE series and a couple of other items
from Computex before that this video is
brought to you by thermal takes view 37
case the view 37 focuses on highlighting
custom PC builds with its full panoramic
window and tinted front acrylic and our
thermal testing the view 37 performed
reasonably well when considering its
looks focused build which is partly
thanks to the airflow design and the
removal of a bottom power supply shroud
for a balance of looks and performance
check the link in the description below
for the view 37 for the Intel 28 core
CPU a couple things to note first of all
we had a call with Intel after
publishing our video and we were told
the same thing as what Tom's Hardware
published just difference was we waited
to film a news recap to include it so as
Tom's was told we were also told that
Intel functionally made a mistake during
the demo basically was the gist of it
and that they forgot to note that the 28
core CPU is overclocked when it was set
to 5 gigahertz so you had a lot of news
media especially non-technical media or
less technical media running stories
than the 28 core would be a stock 5
gigahertz CPU not quite the case another
thing here so we were talking about how
it's almost certainly skylake X
architecture on the 28 core and as far
as we know from all of our sources
that's accurate
it's basically an 81 76 Xeon CPU we've
also been told and have had have known
this for a little while but it's
probably going to become cascade Lake
it's just it wasn't at time of demo so
it was shown way ahead of when the CP
should have been shown because it just
simply wasn't ready and basically ended
up being a disingenuous demo as a result
of it so the product should be good
enough on its own once it's ready to
turn
and to be impressive this is a thing we
talk about with Rison where you really
don't have to make things up to make the
product look good if it's already good
it doesn't have to be good at everything
and if it's not ready now to talk about
then just don't talk about now so anyway
20 course should eventually be cascade
Lake probably and it was definitely
overclocked during the demo and Intel
just forgot to say it or something along
those lines the ad and that's by the way
also straight from the Tom's Hardware
article which is already public so the
8086 K is the other Intel CPU this one
is a binned 8700 k we talked about it a
little bit and it's a bit odd so it's
four hundred and twenty-five dollars
it's supposed to be a bit a limited run
but from what we understand it's not
gonna be that limited so the 8086 k kind
of hard to justify it's a bend eighty
seven hundred K and at those five
gigahertz basically and other than that
it's commemorating old old processors
from Intel so unless you're sentimental
about the about that particular era of
processors not a lot of reason to spend
the money on it another news item on
CPUs and in tech reported that the AMD
Athlon 200 GE and 200 GE pro CPUs should
be competing with the Pentium gold
market so this will be the new Athlon
series typically and he has a athlon x4
s for example they are actually pretty
popular CPUs and these ones are supposed
to be 3.2 gigahertz stock 35 watt CPUs
and they are targeted again at Pentium
Gold built on rise in architecture
presently unclear if there will be an
AGP but possibly not if it's following
the typical Athlon line that's socket am
four has two cores and four threads from
what the listings showed on AMD's
website Asus had CLC's at the show so
Asus at Computex we talked about their
case is already an hour needs
improvement at Computex video but the
CLC's were sort of interesting these are
built on ASA tech pumps our
understanding is that they should be Gen
six pumps which is what the H 150 I uses
and the ASA tech CLC's have LCDs built
into them basically that's the the
fanciest part of it it's the only thing
they're really changing with ASA tax
pump design the one of them has
a vrm fan it just blows straight down so
or we're not actually clear if it blows
down or if it pulls air up but either
way a very little air flow over the VRMs
might help a bit but it's more of a
gimmick than anything if you have a case
fan on the top of the case that'll do a
lot more for you than that
CLC fan will plus it's gonna be noisy
because it's small and small fans whine
and they also die really really fast so
more of a gimmick than anything really
but that's a Seuss's CLC lineup that's
going to be the ryujin which is a $120
for 240 millimeter or there's a three
sixty millimeter variants as well it's
got Noctua
n ff12 fans so the fans will be doing
all the heavy lifting 60 millimeter vrm
fan and then there's also one point
seven seven inch OLED panel on it that
can playback gifs system stats images
things like that and Gen 6 has liquid
temperature sensing capabilities if you
weren't familiar with that quarter 3
2018 launch for that the other ROG CLC
is the ROG Ryu which has a 240 and a 120
variant base attack Gen 6 pump Asus fans
with wind blades as on the Thor PSU
quarter 3 launch hundred dollars for 240
millimeter and also at Asus booth there
was a sous Tour who have just pushed out
any for bait and asked with 10 Gigabit
Ethernet supposed to be pretty
affordable I think it's these 2 Bay and
4 Bay 10 gigabit nastas are supposed to
be in the low hundreds of dollars range
so pretty competitive with sign ology
finally Rio Toro had their new case
called the Morpheus which is not a
finished product and they want audience
feedback on it we'll be talking about it
in one of our other videos kind of soon
ATX e ATX micro ATX are all supported at
max height it can actually fit all three
of course but at the shortest height it
can fit ATX and micro ATX the case is
basically resizable that's the whole
gimmick with this one the motherboard
can be installed inverted and an upright
option was not really considered until
just recently so that might change
they are presently unsure on the fan
count but it sounds like at least one
RGB LED fan will be included and
probably possibly an 80 millimeter fan
although we typically don't really like
those because they are allowed and again
they die pretty fast the case is all
custom tool in its using a 200
millimeter front fan option as well or
will potentially include one all steel
construction
lots of ventilation and has a tempered
glass side panel that may be an option
in the future prices TBD launch is
expected possibly quarter 4 in rio tora
if you don't know is comprised of a
couple of former coarser folks so they
do have some experience in this the
Morpheus uses an interlocking front back
and set of side panels to resize a TX to
e-atx compatibility the side locking
mechanism for the panels has not been
finalized and it was screwed in right
now so we were unable to show it
unfortunately but basically they're
supposed to slide up or down to achieve
the desired height for the case and the
case is basically perforated metal
sheets but the build quality was
surprisingly good for a company that's
new to the market so that's it for this
news roundup as always links in the
description below for more information

lot of uploads because we had a lot of
them and YouTube doesn't send everything
