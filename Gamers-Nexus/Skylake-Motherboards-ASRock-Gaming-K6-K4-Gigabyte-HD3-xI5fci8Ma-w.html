nexus dotnet and we just recently
towards cyber powers offices in
california where the company had a few z
170 motherboards on display so these are
skylake motherboards with the newsie 170
chipset and that will effectively be
replacing the z97 line and everything
that came before that it is not an x 99
replacement the Z 170 chipset can
tactically support ddr3 and the ddr4 but
all the boards we looked at while there
where ddr4 really not surprisingly and
all we're doing here is showing off a
few of those motherboards there are
three that we saw in person and I should
quickly note that none of these were
necessarily finalized models so they may
change before publication or production
rather in the August timeframe for Sky
lake s but the asrock boards were fairly
feature complete and we saw the gaming
case 6 and gaming k4 from has rock and
then the gigabyte Gaz 17 th d3 which is
a lower end entry level board so the
game k-6 is something that we don't have
a price for yet and that's true for all
three of these boards I would imagine
this will be in the probably middle
100's upper 100's range because it is a
pretty feature complete board it has 12
or 14 phases on the vrm not a hundred
percent clear on that but quite a few
phase is more than enough for sky like
overclocking it's got three PCI Express
x1 slots by one and then it has three
pcie 3.0 slots one hardwired for by 16
and the other two are by eight and by 4
or x 18 x 4 however you want to say that
SLI and crossfire are both listed as
supported on the k-6 and it's also got
an ultra MDOT to slide 32 gigabits per
second consuming for PCIe three-point
line and that rest below the first
primary pci express slot the k-6 board
is definitely a mid-range to upper
mid-range board for Sky lake it's got a
couple of SATA Express ports on it and
then the usual state of three options as
well for troubleshooting and diagnostics
the bore
it has two BIOS chips which are
toggleable so if you break one chip when
updating you can toggle to the other one
and it'll still be usable and then
there's a seven segment display that
lives near the bottom of the board and
that's really just used for
troubleshooting error codes things like
that and then you've got the somewhat
standard now overclocking and power
buttons up near the dimm slots so that
is the gaming case 6 from asrock it is a
fatality board as rocks fatality gaming
k4 is a lower to your board I would
imagine this will probably be closer to
the 100 dollar price point but again we
don't have prices yet that's just
speculation based on feature set and it
looks like the k4 has the same black and
red aesthetic as the k-6 it's got the
same IO cover on it with the asrock
gaming logo and then it has the purity
sound 3 cover as well which the k-6 also
had the k4 has a slimmer vrm voltage
regulator module it looks like it's
about 10 phases for the cpu and it's got
a single pcie slot wired for by 16 with
one more four by four usage so not
really great or even usable for multi
video card support and then it's got
three pcie x 1 slots if you want to do
audio cards or capture cards things like
that there is a 4-pin molex header
sitting above the pcie x 11 slot for
additional power I'm currently unclear
on whether that is for GPU or cpu
overclocking but it is probably and
almost definitely for one of those based
on the history of 4-pin molex connectors
on motherboards and then it's also got
an empty slot just like the case 6 does
but it is unlabeled and unbranded on the
board which means that we're really
unclear right now and whether this will
remain in the final production model or
if it's just something that was on there
for the prototype dummy but it is there
in the board that we saw so it's
possible that it'll make it to the final
production model the k4 then the usual
say to express state of three ports and
two more say to three ports near the
chipset heatsink and the dims so it's
got a couple of those but not as fully
loaded it still has two BIOS chips BIOS
a1 and b1 which are nice to have in the
event
of a BIOS failure the final motherboard
is gigabytes gaz 17 th d3 this board is
the most prototype looking board that we
saw so it is very likely that this is
incomplete and not representative of the
final model as evidenced in part by some
of the striped marks on the PCB but we
can learn the basics from it and this
hd3 has just two pcie 3.0 slots one is
wired for by 16 one is wired for what
looks like by four and then it's got two
pcie x 1 slots and two pci slots not
express for whatever reason i can't
really think of a reason you had to use
those anymore but they are on there
there's also some cereal and ports like
that as well so it's definitely got some
support for what would be the asia or
business markets where they still some
use some of those legacy technologies
there is an m2 ultra 32 gigabits per
second port between the pci-e and the
cpu slot and then it's got a black and
gold vrm heatsink north of the cpu it is
currently unclear if there will be more
heat sinks or shields on the board it
could be dressed up a little bit before
launch we're really not sure yet we'll
find out when the product comes out and
is a officially showcased in less than a
month here the vrm looks about six
phases on this board as is and that's it
for this quick motherboard roundup we
saw these at the cyberpower offices and
we're expecting skylake very shortly we
actually have test samples in hand and
as soon as embargo is lifted we'll have
a review on intel sky lake and all the
supporting technologies ddr4
motherboards things like that so be sure
