testing for our GTX 1080i review today
that's the spin right here torn to
pieces as it so happens we'll be going
through those metrics thermals versus
frequency mostly alongside the usual
gaming benchmarks when we have some
synthetics linked in the description
below in the article where there's a bit
more depth on everything about this card
before getting to review this coverage
is brought to you by Thermaltake and
their tower 900 display case this case
has glass tiles all around and is an
excellent option for a full custom water
loops which if you're buying a car
that's $700 you might be in the market
for link in the description below for
more information
going over price first again the 1080i
is a $700 MSRP partners can ship above
that but the founders Edition still
called that the reference card basically
is still going to be 700 so they've
removed the special founders edition
price that costs how much confusion with
a 1080 launch that's a good thing this
is 700 dead for the EFI version and MSRP
with that announcement came the
announcement of reduced MSRP for the GTX
1080s there are already today on Newegg
Amazon wherever $500 GTX 1080s
including $530 EVGA SC models if you're
looking a little bit overclocked or
gigabyte models for 500 flat so the 10
80s are already dropped 1080i is on the
way and AIB partner models of this card
were reviewing today should be available
within a few weeks pretty shortly
actually because this has been kind of
in the wings for a while now in the
meantime we're looking at the reference
version all of these cards ultimately
are built on the new GP 102 die if you
wanted the full identifier its GP 102 -
350 - k1 and that's for the die
underneath the cooler of course and
we've already taken the car departs for
a few project what you'll see over the
next few days there's a block diagram of
the gtx 980ti it shows it to layout
broken into 6g pcs or graphics
processing clusters in a similar fashion
in some ways to how the GP 100 is broken
up though with some pretty important
differences in SM layouts
the focus is removed from anything about
FP 32 with the gtx 980ti
and
we have 128 FP 32 CUDA cores 4 SM just
like all the other pascal cards in the
gaming line when counting a total of 28
SM times 128 we're at 35 84 CUDA cores
in total the GTX 1080 GP 104 chip
host:20 sm's which totaled at 25 60
cores so are about a thousand cores over
the GTX 1080 that seems to align with
Nvidia's marketing claims that the 1080
Ti increases performance by 35% over the
1080 that launched in May of last year
that will be validating those claims
throughout this video the rest of the
block diagram is familiar we're faced
with 224 T mus and a base clock of 14 80
megahertz or boots 1582 and that results
in a textured filter rate of 350 4.4
giga tackles per second at the boost
clock we have a video on the channel
already if you're not sure what that
means a total of 88 Roth's are present
on the card compared to 64 on the GTX
1080 a bit of an upgrade there and if
you start totaling these things up GT
102 in some ways looks familiar to the
GP 100 it's got the same TMU counts the
same GPC count but they're still again
significantly different in their targets
GP 100 of course is built for
acceleration not for consumer graphics
certainly not for gaming in any way and
this means that precision on G to 100
splits itself between 32 16 64
capabilities whereas one of two focuses
on F P 32 applications GP 102 is also a
bigger die than the GP 104 which was 314
millimeters squared that's the 1080 and
GP 102 measures in at 471 millimeters
squared which helps accommodate the
additional sm8 additional SM so bigger
die area since we're getting on a plane
in about 6 hours from filming this we're
going to jump straight to the benchmarks
when the benchmarks today we're using a
fully rebuilt GPU test bench for 2017 I
believe this is the first I know this is
the first GP Review other than the IC X
card of 2017 that gives us an
opportunity to move to the i7 7700 K
which has a higher top end more headroom
in frame rates than the 59 30 K we were
using previously and it also means that
we can refresh our suite of games and
other applications with being tested
including some new automation done by
Patrick Lathan in-house
that's really exciting now this also
means for all the excitement's with a
new testbed we lose some data that's
unfortunate so everything on the
previous tests can't really compare it
anymore it's a different platform
different memory different drives
different testing methodology for the
games of Doom we've changed how we test
it a bit and we've added new games so
that means that we lose things like the
Titan XP comparison since that was on
loan to us so we don't have that for you
today unfortunately but we do have new
numbers for the 1080 1070 980ti
reference cards the 1080 TI reference
card and then 1r x 480 just to throw it
in there as a representative of the $250
market so in the article below
we'll have the testing methodology as
always we'll also have numbers for
future market testing like 3d mark fire
so I can tie this by moving forward
we're refreshing our GPU bench with the
relevant ions contenders first as listed
with a splash from the $250 market
represented again by the 480 note also
that before he competes in a completely
different price bracket so we're not
really going to pay too much attention
to it it's just there in case you want
an idea of where stains fall well ad
Vega of course once it's ready and we'll
slowly add more GPS to this bench with
each content piece including aib models
if you're curious about those and one
final note here because of the limited
time between pax Rison and other events
we are going to be visiting overclocking
and noise testing separately so theirs
won't make it into this piece
unfortunately but they will be in a
piece post pax our thermal tests are up
first for these benchmarks for measuring
MOSFET temperature in the middle of the
board and at the bottom of the board so
that will be stats number two and seven
on the 1080i on the IC x GT X 1080 or if
that's number one and five on the GTX
1080 Fe card-counting bottom up and
those are measured with our
thermocouples they are K types they're
calibrated in boiling and iced water as
normally and we have some more
information on exactly what those things
are in the article let's start with just
the 1080p I then add other cards for now
we can see GPU temperatures in the 84 to
85 C range with MOSFETs number seven and
two closely packed around 65 to 68 C
this is actually heavily competitive to
a ivy
partner set temperatures but the card is
also only stock clock loads and the GPU
temperature of course looks dismal when
compared to IB partners the card
requires a significantly higher fan
speed in order to sustain a comparable
GPU temperature to what will be possible
on a IV partners and we can say like
confidently because of previous
experience with the 1080 and of course
you sacrifice noise output
I mean 1080 CIF II version if you want
to achieve at those temperatures to this
end despite using high quality materials
externally and internally the cooler is
actually not all that great for our
audience it's a better fit for system
integrators high power cyber power at
all and if you have specific needs maybe
SFF it could fit there as well we're
still recommending axial or liquid
coolers for the most part though because
you're choking on the clock in a way
which is unnecessary with the EFI cooler
that's where IB vendors come in of
course to fix things here's a comparison
to the GTX 1080 Fe for frame of
reference to the last gen of coolers
from the Pascal lineup we're seeing the
GPU temperatures on each device locked
to their max permissible limit when
under stock settings with the FET
temperatures all within the same range
that's actually a good thing the GT x
1080 FPS middle MOSFET does run about a
Celsius warmer one degree Celsius or so
than the GTX 1080 T is middle MOSFET but
the card cools effectively identically
went under a high-stress workload and of
course these aren't the same FETs
they're not in the same place so that
does impact things as well the
measurement is not perfect what matters
is the frequency throughput though and
that is a perfect measurement since both
cards are boosting to a point of hitting
thermal limits looking at the clock rate
versus temperature we can reveal that
the 1080 Ti is able to sustain a higher
more stable clock when four Smith's fan
to 80% this enters into territory of
unbearable noise and does not
representative of a sustainable user
scenario without a noise damping box of
some kind maybe shoved into a basement
but it does show how the silicon behaves
when temperature is no longer a concern
the GPU frequency on the 1080i with Auto
fan speeds or around 50% shows that
we're bouncing rapidly between about
1341 pretty low to about 15 and 44
megahertz by contrast
10 atti at manual 80% fan speed post
frequency almost at a constant 14 80
megahertz with occasional spikes to
around 15 44 note that this is with AVR
empower virus scenario so we're seeing
higher thermals despite a lower clock
overall that is expected behavior and
this clock rate is not representative of
what you would see in a video game just
to stick one of our ancient charts back
up here that we've now changed
methodology to accommodate set
temperatures these temperatures that
show at a steady state so we're looking
at how the GPU performs in terms of
thermals once it has been left alone
under heavy load for a long period of
time the 1080i reference ends up around
50 Hz delta T for steady state
temperature when under torture workloads
end with an auto fan control the FE
version of the 1080 meanwhile switch on
57.5 C as well within our measurement
variance and so we must say that the
1080 F II alongside the 980ti and 1080
TI are effectively equal in thermal
performance Nvidia claims 5 Celsius
improvements with the 1080 TI layout but
we can't exactly validate that on the
same PCB which is important because one
GPU binning to different GPU three
different drm we can't validate it
exactly because we don't have a means to
fit both coolers on the same car that
leads within a reasonable amount of time
the changes to fetes v rms all that
means it's not exactly an apple savile
comparison but we are not seeing a 5
Celsius reduction stock you might see it
if you match the clock rates or
something like that if you're curious
how n AI be partner board compares our
previous EVGA icx review gives a good
look at those numbers in general for
thermals you should expect the same
high-ish to high temperatures for these
reference designs for the 10a DTI
as with previous reference designs from
both Nvidia and Andy and video is not
alone here neither is AMD they both make
reference designs that are versatile
they're good for sis they're good for
other sectors of the market but for our
audience for most of you doing system
builds DIY style it would be better off
with an AIB partner model that cools
quieter and better or at least in the
very least quieter for the same and
that's really not a bad trade-off this
cooler is not particularly impressive
but neither was the 1080 at these cooler
despite that Nvidia is marketing did
show in its presentation when Jensen was
on stage in San Francisco they showed a
twenty thirty eight maximum clock rate
with temperatures below eighty five see
that may be possible in their test
environment we were not able to
replicate that in our testing without
making the fan speeds so high that they
make your ears bleed which may be the
case just like with the 1080 in Austin
it may be that the card was in a box
somewhere in a back room at 100% fan
speed because then I could see those
temperatures being possible but
otherwise I don't know that the 50% more
bearable fan speed will make that a
reality if you do need a reference board
for liquid blocks for example consider
waiting for board vendors to ship their
stripped-down versions of the same PCB
with disposable plastic coolers because
those might be a bit cheaper or include
rebates at least to drag costs out of it
moving on to FBS we're starting with a
brand new game to our bench Ghost Recon
using the built-in benchmark and set to
very high preset at 4k 1440 and 1080p we
are looking at GPU performance first
with Forte at 4k the 1080 TI pushes an
average frame rate of 55 FPS with
one-percent lows at 45 and 0.1% lows at
42 comparatively the 1080 F II card
runs about 10 FPS lower in all values
for a difference in average frame rate
of approximately 29% that's not exactly
the 35% number that was thrown around
everywhere but it's pretty damn close
the gtx 1070 reference card lands around
35 FPS average for the same test for a
performance improvement of about 58%
when moving from the 1070 to the 1080 TI
as for the last gen comparison the 980
TI reference card post performance
around 34 FPS average at 4k which is
really dragging into territory of being
stuttery
in this title you can get away with 4k
lower settings of course but not with
this setup
shifting to 1440p we see the GTX 1080p i
operating at 91 FPS average with lows
three times at 74 and 66 FPS that looks
good in terms of the frame time
consistency the GTX 1080 is just under
20 FPS lower than that at 74 FPS average
with lows also fairly close at least to
the Ti at 61 and 54 the improvement here
from the 1080 reference card is about
22.5% as for the TTX 1070 efi the
performance improvement is about 47 FPS
from the gtx 1070 to the gtx 980ti FP
cars moving us between 62 and 91 average
with a 980 TI at 1440p we're seeing a
performance improvement of around 60%
generationally that's at 57 FPS average
certainly playable the RX 480 is on here
but again with these settings the unit
very high and 1440p it's not really
targeted to benchmark these mid-range
cards bit unfair if you're looking at
1440p for a mid-range card you'd have to
drop your settings and it would still be
playable just drop the setting but doom
is where we really start seeing things
get a bit interesting our doom
benchmarking has ditched OpenGL for
comparison entirely mostly to make time
for other tests and instead it pushes to
strictly rely on Vulcan for the test api
of choice we're also now using ultra
settings for graphics with anti-aliasing
disabled and async turned on so you get
that extra boost you can find more in
the article below
at 4k Doom positions the 1080 Ti at
around 90 FPS average with lows close
behind and in the 70s the GTX 1080 F II
card stands around 68 average resulting
in an improvement of about 33 percent to
the ti the 1070 was never really a 4k
gaming device but it's holding on
respectively well with doom at these
settings were just under 60 FPS average
and could make tweaks to go over 60 the
difference is about 60 to 64 percent
improvement with a 1080p eye but of
course that price is also about a
two-act to increase the gtx 980ti
performs at 49 FPS average at these
settings and is mostly playable with the
album zooms engine optimizations you can
make a few tweaks though looking now at
1440p the GTX 1080p eye is bumping
against the limitations of Doom's
amorous and that is an engine limitation
doom limits itself to 200 FPS due to a
physics bug and so frame rates that
exceed 200 FPS aren't really seen there
cat the excuse numbers in a way that
makes the higher end cards capable of
exceeding 200 look a little bit lower in
the chart and just like a bottleneck
would do the only difference here is
that rather than a CPU or GPU bottleneck
we have one that's not too commonly
discussed and engine bottleneck we see
these in GTA 5 for quad thread testing
at 180 7.5 FPS as well for similar
engine reasons we're starting to really
illustrate generational differences here
with a 980 I've nearly doubled in
performance by the 1080p I just to
really illustrate this frame cap and
doom let's look at 1080p with this our
average is a steady 200 FPS with lows no
worse than 175 your 1% the GT X 1080
isn't far from this I 190 and throwing
effectively equally since they're both
bottlenecks by the game engine the 1070
hits 200 less frequently and is met
early behind of course you would really
for the most part play at these types of
settings unless you have a 200 Hertz
display but it does show generational
scaling better to 980ti since that was
even more common when it shipped moving
to for honor one of our new titles added
we're testing with extreme settings
across all up three main resolutions at
fork an extreme the 1080i is finally
able to crack 60fps my games though just
barely read 66 average with 60fps one
percent load 57 0.1% loads if you get a
1080 to similar Heights give it an
aftermarket card and some tuning but
we're talking about a drop of maybe one
tick and setting to get there the gtx
980ti is entering unplayable territory
with these settings right alongside the
RX 480
you would need settings reductions or
just really honestly drop the resolution
and doing that dropping the 1440p the
story changes a bit now something like
in our X 480 would be an excellent
choice at its price point roughly 250 if
you wanted 1440p gaming with pneumatic
settings a slight reduction would help
frame times but we can have a 1080i
today anyway and the gtx 980ti for a
generational look at that still holds
its ground well against the new Polaris
and Pascal cards but posts an
improvement of about 50 for FPS by
moving the to the 1080i or around 70%
the GTX 1080 is plenty playable here
with a nearly 100 FPS
a virgin type same time using ashes for
another dx12 look configured the high
settings GP focused on Forte we're
seeing the 1080 TI land at 99 FPS
average width to 1080 reference at 79 or
about a 25% improvement to the 1080p I
really not hitting that magic 35 because
I'm figure in this test though the jump
from the 1070 is naturally a lot higher
though so is the jump in price again
looking at an improvement of about 62%
to the Ti our final benchmark game is
Sniper Elite 4 this was recommended by
AMD for the bench we spoke to both
Nvidia and AMD and gave them both an
option to recommend one game for the
bench and video like Ghost Recon and D
Lite Sniper Elite so we added each
although we're not looking in depth at
AMD cards today that time will soon come
at 4k and with high settings with async
enabled and dx12 the 1080 TI operates a
frame rate of about 76 FPS average
pretty damn high for 4k but sniper isn't
the most graphically intensive game on
the market the 1080 reference cards has
had a hard 60 FPS with it lows dipping
into the 40s this is still just fine for
gameplay and we're not able to start
seeing more visible stutters until
jumping to the 1070 considering 4k is
more of a 1080 or TI class config the
1070 it holds well on its own at 48
we'll have to see how Andy does on this
bench shortly as it should be favorable
for the Polaris and Vega GPUs given an
async and the x12 focus given that we're
sandwiched between PAX East and a few
hours and rise in coverage and the risin
event and the Nvidia event and other
events this review still has some things
I'd like to add to it like noise noise
is one of the things we're overall we're
not recommending an F II reference
design anyway if you were to buy a 1080
TI it should probably be a partner model
so the noise tests would be nice to
further back that up and show things
objectively but they'll be have to be
added after pax in addition to this you
may have noticed that overclocking
wasn't a major focus we have one
overclocking number with firestrike
extreme on the website but I was having
some stability issues during
overclocking in the last few hours
before getting on this next plane so we
scrapped it it'll have to come in the
next content post probably right after
pack so there are still a few things to
look at overclocking was
the same process as always it just
didn't happen to be stable when we were
working with this card and that's really
a matter of some more fine-tuning so we
need time for that stock performance
overall though the GTX 980 is still more
than enough if you own one of those
don't bother upgrading to a 1080p iOS
you have a very specific need it's more
of a side grade almost you're able to
split the difference and trade in with a
manufacturer Nvidia sort of is competing
with itself by dropping the GTX ndnews
in price anyway it's a $500 since that
card can also handle 4k with some
settings tuning and handles 1440p
without much trouble at all the bigger
argument you could make would be for
high refresh gaming as the 1080i fills
that niche where others have fallen
short though have gotten quite close
1440p at 144 Hertz is doable in some of
these games like for honor if you're
okay with dropping too high or very high
from extreme in that case assuming no
anti-aliasing for owners of a gtx 980ti
this is a sizable upgrade and in some
cases it's a pretty damn big jump if you
want those higher resolutions you're not
on high resolutions maybe don't bother
there's still mileage left in the 980 TI
it's a 780ti that's the most interesting
to look at but again unfortunately
because of time that wasn't added yet
still based on just extrapolating
performance that's probably where an
upgrade makes the most immediate sense
it just comes down to what resolution
you're trying to use so many reasons buy
a found edition card as always is going
to be the reference PCB there will be
other reference PCB cards but this is
the first one if you want it they'll be
out there EK WB already has plans for
water blocks compatible with this PCB
the 10a TFE water blocks won't work it's
a different board different VRM layout
but there are plans already for water
blogs in the works we've spoken with
them about that otherwise wait on
partner models for cooling reasons and
for potentially custom PCBs potentially
better overclocking we've also got build
Zoid working on a vrm analysis of this
board this is quite a bit different from
the 1080 so for this board we're looking
at AV RM that is doing some doubling
actions we've got to fats per phase
which does spread out the heat a little
bit so that would help explain why the
vrm temperatures on this board are
actually really good there can
parable to an icx video card the ones
EVGA just launched and that's a good
thing
the place that falls behind is GPU cool
and as expected and as seen in the past
but the vrm design does spread out heat
a bit and helps in that scenario as for
whether it's worth buying this is sort
of a weird market position right now
where Nvidia exists largely uncontested
and these last major cards in this type
of market where the fury X and fury
cards and the rx 480 is the newest thing
that they have it's an extremely strong
competitor at the 200 250 as price point
that's a pretty good winner it holds
that market very strongly while Andy is
waiting on Vega so they're in a good
position for the mid-range they just
don't have anything of a high-end yet
which makes this a weird thing to review
because it's not a lot of competition so
what we can say is that the 1080 Ti if
you don't need an upgrade now today if
you're not building a system this week
or something like that it's probably
worth looking into if you're looking at
a high budget card that said the 1080
does sort of compete with the 1080 Ti if
you don't need those 144 120 Hertz
refresh hits you could drop down to a
1080 it's still a damn good card and you
save a lot of money you can put that
money towards something better in the
system like better SSDs or something
like that if you do need to upgrade
today there's no shame there should be
no remorse in buying a 1080i 1080
something like that Vega will gone we
will review it it's just a matter of one
at this point we know first half and
that's really all we know in terms of
specifics there's not out there so Vega
will be compared to eventually the RX
480 so looks good at the 250 dollar
price points we would recommend that in
that category the 1060 is good but look
between the two and figure out what
games you're playing because they have
advantages the 480 at its price is very
competitive 1070 is still good 1080
school good 1080i is great for its gains
it doesn't always have that 35% number
but overall it's a good card is just a
matter of getting better cooling on the
things that can perform to its full
potential which is something we're doing
to can't tell by this setup so as always
go to patreon.com/scishow and was next
directly gamers Nexus net for the full
review like comment subscribe all that
stuff quick shout out for anyone who
watched 3440 by 1440p benchmarks 1440 I
guess if you want there's altra wide
benchmarks one of our friends of the
site tech gauge comm will have that
stuff he does it where I don't just die
which I come out if you want to ultra
wide stop I trust his numbers we'll see
you all next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
