counted you copied Linus he has a tool
pegboard well yes we're back in this
layout in fact Linus did invent these
and now we are back to fix the
Coolermaster h 500 p this is part 2 in
our series fixing the coolermaster h 500
p wherein we attempt to fix the equal to
master aged 500 p before we get into
that this content is brought to you by
the Thermaltake flow RGB closed-loop
liquid cooler which is a 360 millimeter
radiator plus 3 120 fans that are RGB
illuminated the if then we'll take it
rain fans at that this is a 4.5 done a
stacked pump which is one of the faster
pumps you can learn more at the link in
the description below this is the case
you might observe that it presently has
tape all over it that's from part one
where we tried two things primarily
spacing out the distance from the back
of the panel to the front of the case to
better allow air flow through the mesh
on the side intakes and also fix the
problem where it comes off the front
because doesn't anymore so we're going
to cut this and then my plan is to Mesha
fie the CMH 500 p by adding some mesh to
it so we've got a couple different
options here here's one from the C 700 P
which we actually reviewed somewhat
positively just want to make sure cooler
match remembers that so they don't hate
me eternally for this one and we have
this match from I think a fractal or a
thermal take case and we have this one
from the see 700 P so we're gonna try
those out okay so step one of this mod
is cut open the tape because we no
longer need that on there so we're gonna
do that and then start digging into the
actual get the plastic off the panel and
see if we can fix everything
alright there's part one back to where
we started that would look kind of good
it doesn't stretch all the way down to
the bottom you can see I'm about one to
two inches off right here so I think I
can just put some electrical tape down
there it's not going to be pretty but
it'll be functional and a
proof-of-concept that's about the right
size but it's got those flanges on the
top I could cut them off so then for the
top I'm thinking here's our top panel
the front door Ian towards you guys I'm
thinking we do like knock this glass in
and then that's too big but let's let's
start with the first one so this point
we are entering territory of no return
how does this held in so anyone remember
this that noise well the reason that
creaking noise exists and that cracking
noise you just got is because this was
secured by glue in fact me picking this
thing up did that you see that the gap
in here so this this was formed from
what I just did picked it up so yeah I
mean the good news is that that means
it's gonna be easy to split this apart
and it might even be able to to be
restored after the IRA's originally
think you know we could just break it
but honestly if it's just glue oh it's
not glue it's done it's literally double
stick tape oh I see I see okay here you
go I forgot about this Patrick did most
of work on this case two screws right
here so we're gonna remove those two
screws and I think that'll let us get
access to the part that's holding it
down
something big one there you go look see
you could you could clean the dust out I
don't know what everyone's talking about
no dust filters that's totally a dust
filter and completely reasonable to
access for cleaning I just need to turn
this kind of oh man if I can get this I
probably just leave that tape on there
and reuse it oh you know all right when
I get the knife out everything starts
working oh nice okay well nice and easy
didn't even break any of the plastic
which is surprising
so that folds under there it's got a
little foot on it and sets in and a
probably not salvageable thinking that
comes off in pieces so we may need a new
solution for that but let's look at our
options here so I could put this like
where's the butt okay bombs towards me
so this just barely will fit with I'll
just put some electrical tape down the
sides I think I mean it's gonna be on
the inside and because I'm not really
touching much of the I'm not even on the
tape over here so I think because of
that I'm gonna end up doing just
electrical tape on the sides that'll
hold it against the front and then you
know I'd love a longer one of these I
could take another one and cut it in
pieces and bridge them but it's not
gonna look that great not that this
looks great anyway don't get me wrong
hahaha but I think it'll be fine to just
tape that bottom section off it'll choke
some cooling granted but it's the you
can't make it worse than stock so how
does that work so if we wanted to call
this mod early I'd say that's done we've
done it we fix the air flow problems it
can breathe pretty well now wow that
would drop temperature to 13 degrees
Celsius I'm not kidding you we tested
that so that would be the real the real
mod but
let's say you've got kids or pets or
things you don't want exploring the 200
millimeter fans with their peripheral
limbs and maybe you want some filter I
need something like that
that's not bad
there it is pretty much finished not bad
it looks a lot closer to the half X then
the age 500 P does and it looks way
closer to high airflow so yeah I mean
I'm pretty happy with that we can see
how it looks and this is just with a
mesh filter from like a fractal case or
at one of those there you go that's
pretty damn cool and that's like that's
exactly what I was imagining when I
thought high air flow case from
coolermaster with 200 millimeter fans
because here's the thing as a general
rule of thumb you lose about 30% of
pressure for every 90 degree turn you
make this being glass you've only got
two ways of entrance here and it's on
either side of this technically there's
a little tiny bit up here there's a
little tiny bit down here but ultimately
the two sides of the main thing and as
we showed in our review those sides are
largely covered by these fans and that
means that we took these off earlier
that means that you're really not
getting a lot of airflow in there so and
only like this very outer edge of the
blade is ever being used anyway because
it's clearly got no way to access air
from the outside when there's glass in
front of it so all this inner part of
the blade is just left unused so I think
we're gonna fix that
and I wouldn't make comments about how
this panels a bit fragile now because if
you push the middle of it the mesh will
cave in but honestly it's not any more
fragile than it was originally so yeah
we're good with that one that's done I
think the next step is to mesh if I the
top panel sorry for the creaky noises
ah Coolermaster trying to get me back
that should work for now you may have
heard the phrase to cut away from
yourself so I'm doing that I'm cutting
away from myself and towards the camera
operator for maximum safety all right
nice okay
so that's how next step
Oh not bad you know from the front I
think it'll look okay we're gonna want
the back towards the wall cuz this is a
little like Batmobile like sticking out
at the end but um that's fine I'll take
it I'll take it we could do another mesh
in there I guess I don't know would that
look better if we did if I found another
one of these what do you think oh that's
not bad but it is the the half mobile
we've got now so there's our top eye
from the front it'll be fine I'm gonna
sighs it's not bad a little bit of a
blemish there but okay so this needs to
come up a little bit there we go got it
nice old and new if you have it I'm
pretty excited to see how the thermals
do here we've got it set up in our same
original test system so we can actually
really easily validate the stock
thermals and then rerun for this set up
and I think that should that should give
us an idea for what this case could have
been if Coolermaster properly made it a
successor to the high airflow series and
honestly it doesn't look half bad I
stole that from Paul I'm sorry it
doesn't look half bad though it's like
seriously considering what it like
hack job approach this was and how it
took us like half an hour or something
it's pretty damn good and I think what
happened here is Coolermaster probably
fell for the glass trend I think they
were like we gotta have glass everywhere
on this thing it looks good and it's
popular and they're not wrong but when
you have two hundred millimeter fans why
like this is the whole point of the case
is those fans make them breathe so yeah
I guess we'll we'll test it see how it
does so here it is this is the Mesha
fied h 500 p from us yes we're not gonna
sell it
fractals so no we're not touching your
mesh my name I think they have rights to
that but that's what it's kind of
loosely named that so we've got the the
front panel is still the mesh version
tested at all and basically fixed of the
thermal problems so the thermal issue is
that Coolermaster had with the original
version of the case have largely been
resolved the top panel you'll notice
that we actually restored it back to the
acrylic panel and there's reason for
that we'll show it in the charts it
largely has to do a static pressure of
those front fans and we've got some
noise tests as well
quick note the testing here is not
comparable to our original review it is
comparable to our radiator testing that
we just posted at time of this going
live yesterday but not to the original
review we've changed the way change the
software we're using to monitor change
the testing method and change the
averaging method for the data just
specifically for this because some of
the numbers were close enough that we
needed better test resolution so I went
through and fixed some of that stuff to
improve it and we've got the numbers for
you that we can go through now first a
very quick look at noise levels we've
got the original H 500 P highlighted and
the new Mesha fied GN version of that
the original was 38.7 DBA and the test
not particularly quiet but not awful
either with the mesh front and with the
mesh top so not the acrylic top we're at
about 40 DBA so we've increased by 1.5
ish
decibels not too bad really considering
we took out the panel and replace it
with mash so that just really speaks to
where the noise is escaping on this case
our thermal chart is flanked by stock
configurations defining our bounding
boxes for the mesh mod in the worst case
the stock configuration we're at sixty
four point five degrees Celsius over
ambience for cpu load temperature or
fifty three point four C for GPU
temperature removing the front panel
gets us down to fifty four point three
eight degrees Celsius for the CPU and
forty eight point five C for the GPU
this marks a maximum improvement of
about ten degrees on the CPU or about
five degrees on the GPU if we can get
close to this with our mesh mod we're
doing pretty well this is the maximum
performance we'd be able to get for the
completely mesh divide each 500 P with
both the front and top panel converted
to mesh we end up at fifty seven point
nine degrees on the CPU and forty eight
point eight on the GPU this isn't
particularly exciting marking only a six
point six degree improvement in CPU
thermals or four point six on the GPU
not bad and certainly better and puts us
in the range of higher-end cases but
really not that exciting so looking into
this problem the panel we had on there
originally was this one the mesh one
that we replaced it with and the front
of it's over here waving a hand over the
front of this mesh right around this
area you can feel a lot of the cool air
escaping the case and that comes down to
basically pressure the fans just there
they don't spin very fast they don't
have very high performance for static
pressure and so you end up with a lot of
that air just kind of drafting up and
out of the mesh when it's on the top so
replacing it with the acrylic panel
actually kept up most of that air in the
case it gets pulled through the CPU
cooler a lot better the CPU cooler can
leverage its own fan pressure to suck
that air in and we can look at those
numbers too
the result was noteworthy how our CPU is
now at fifty six point one degrees for
about a two degree reduction the GPU
thermals are roughly the same though at
forty nine point three versus forty
eight point eight this is within our
test resolution that makes sense since
removing that top panel or changing it
anything like that is really going to
impact the sea view primarily we are now
within a couple degrees of completely
removing the front panel at all but have
a solution for dust and visuals not a
bad trade so that's it for this one
Coolermaster did send out one of the
reps sent a tweet in response to my
teaser of this where they said something
along the lines of they're listening to
the audience and plan to have things in
the future which I basically translated
in my head to mean we're gonna be
selling mesh panels in the future as DLC
so it may be the option that with age
500 P going forward there'll be
alternatives out there maybe they'll
have a mesh version or maybe they'll
just have panels sold separately
but for now what I can tell you is you
can do this mod yourself for a few bucks
like electrical tape on the inside you
grab a mesh panel or a dust filter like
this one just on new I agree Amazon for
10 bucks and make sure it's the right
size throw it on there you'd be good to
go now it's probably a little bit more
of a hack job than what Coolermaster
would do but I mean probably not that
much more of a hack job than what they
would do because I the bar is pretty low
for these panels so I don't know if if
they end up selling something that's
like a standalone pack of accessories
rather than a completely separate mesh
case and that pack ends up being like 50
bucks for two panels I'd say just do it
yourself for less than definitely less
than 20 in the US anyway and call it a
day but yeah in the very least this
shows the true potential the case when
it's not obstructed with acrylic so it
looks pretty good in those conditions in
terms of both thermals and visuals noise
isn't bad and yeah kind of a fun project
