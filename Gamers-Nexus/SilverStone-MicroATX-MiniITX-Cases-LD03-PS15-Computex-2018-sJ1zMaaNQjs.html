the Silverstone booth now a couple of
updates from CES cases we saw from
Silverstone also a couple of new ones so
the main one to talk about probably the
LDO 3 which is basically a showroom ITX
style case this is the frame of another
case where we talk about the SG 14
except on its face before that this
video is brought to you by Thermal
Grizzlies high-end thermal paste and
liquid metal thermal Grizzly's cryo knot
is an affordable high quality thermal
compound that doesn't face some of the
aging limitations of other pastes on the
market cryo knot has a thermal
conductivity of 12.5 watts per meter
Kelvin focuses on endurance is easy to
spread and isn't electrically conductive
making it safe to use on GPU dies
thermal grizzly also makes conductor not
liquid metal which we've used to drop 20
degrees off some temperatures than our
dee-lighted tests by a tube at the link
in the description below so the LDO 3
basically it's it's the new SG 14 and
they show it as G 14 years ago it's been
revised completely power splice we moved
around this is an L do 3 that uses the
SG 14 chassis and tooling again just
inverted so inverted motherboard lay out
the orb all rotated motherboard layout
the video card over here is up against
the glass on the side we'll talk about
that in the moment in a moment the
bottom intake here is suitable for a 120
motor fan there's also a 120 millimeter
fan option at the top there's an 80
millimeter fan exhaust option over here
Silverstone is still kind of in the
design development phases so if you have
thoughts on this case let them know
below because you actually have an
opportunity to impact it one of the
things they're debating is whether or
not to include 120 fans or just let the
users buy it because as always they can
include them it'll cost a lot more
clearly to do that or leave it stock you
pay less but then you provide your own
fans
so anyway 120-millimeter option the
bottom all the intakes coming in through
sort of the back here where there's no
plastic or anything on the side this
side has a bit of glass and some grille
on the sides a bit of a grille on this
front and other than that the exhaust is
entirely out the top where there's a
mesh and there's some exhaust on the
back where the power supply goes power
supply mounts back this way there are
SSD sleds on this side of the chassis
facing
like I said it's a showroom case so
everything that could look good is
exposed out words the CPU sort of down
center as you'd expect video card is the
only thing I'm personally concerned
about I really like the case design
visually it looks cool it's very
interesting they've rotated a Mini ITX
case and many ITX is kind of in right
now so I really like where the designs
going thermals for the GPU my only point
of concern I think it can be addressed
though I think it can be made to work
especially if maybe I don't know how
much room there is to play with the
matte bottom fan but shift it over it
should be pretty good
anyway that's the LDO 3 pricing I'm
curious what you think it'll cost I
guess leave a comment on what you think
that'll be but if you unpause the video
now should be somewhere towards $100
depending on there's 120mm fan
inclusions and also what happens with a
80 millimeter fan so that's the LDO 3
pretty interesting but let's take it
over to the other new case from
Silverstone's booth including the CS 381
which is more of like a mini server size
chassis we talked about at CES and then
also a PS 15 tentatively tjo a and a
couple of other items over in the rest
of the booth CS 381 over here is
personally interesting this can fit 10
hard drives in it in the front center
area and they've updated this front
panel so now it's got a bit more mesh on
the front for the paneling but you can
see it's actually more or less hot-swap
setup for the 10 drives if you wanted to
you could do another two hard drives 3.5
inch on the side currently it's set up
for fan so it's either you got more fans
more airflow or more drives and they
actually have a really old card as an
easter egg in there it might almost be
ATI era card but if you wanted to do a
micro ATX base the Mini server build
which we're considering for an Astra
placement it's a pretty good form factor
for it you can fit a high end machine in
there so my thoughts on a use case for
this or basically small compression
server so you put something like micro
ATX thread ripper or I nine whatever
series CPU is you can let it do video
compression and stuff like that while
also storing a ton of video on it
airflow should be pretty good actually
especially if you forgo the 23.5 options
on the side and just go with one 20s but
worst case you'd throw in some one 20s
and or some extra hard drives v twelve
of them so that's a cs3 81
100% clear on release date for it yet
but it's been updated a bit from CES
looks pretty good this is the SG 14 I
was talking about so this is the one
that the LDO 3 we started in front of
his based off him super lightweight
chassis it's got a pass-through for
demonstrating the lightness here the
pass-through for the power on the back
and that just plugs into the power
supply
Silverstone's done that a few times
before so that's a mini ITX case it
looks pretty good it's actually this one
I'm interested in as well so this one
here is a PS 15 it's a micro ATX case if
you remember the Vulcan I want to say
that was an ng XE case a lot of people
really wanted to follow up to the Vulcan
and it never came not from NZXT anyway
so it's a this is a micro ATX set up
with a full mesh front supposed to be
pretty budget targeted so anywhere
thirty to fifty dollars just call that
the range I don't know that it'll
include fans but you can pick them up
cheap enough so yeah micro ATX
silverstone basically with their small
form-factor cases tries to stay true to
the form factor of the motherboard and
not just making a gigantic box with
smaller motherboard support and call it
an ITX rate micro ATX case this is
genuinely micro ATX and suitable for the
size so i really like that one presently
we'll have to see how it doesn't reviews
obviously before recommending to
purchase but in terms of airflow and
mesh I can tell by looking at it that
it's gonna be better than a lot of the
ones on the market it's just a matter of
what fans do you put in it because it'll
probably come with none so as far as
cases where a tradeshow looks pretty
good for that one
these two are based off of some of the
chassis he's that I was standing in
front of a moment ago over there this is
a tjo a tentative name tjo 8 pro and the
PS are 7 more or less the same tool in
just the differences the front panel is
solid on one of them and then you can
push this thing down if you want a five
and a quarter bay I know a couple of you
I've wanted them a couple of you really
really really really hate five and a
quarter Bay's but I guess it's an option
if you want it so that's the case is for
Silverstone and let us know which ones
you're interested in and we'll try and
get them for review in the future as
