Watson this is our third and probably
final video that were shooting during
his visit Scott brought this along with
them when he flew out here so Scott what
is this this is a sapphire Nitro+ Oryx
588 gig video card so it's kind of that
one of the faster five 80s that you'll
find out that in the wild
yeah and it's it's also brand new as you
may have noticed 500 series yes yes
before that this coverage is brought to
you by the Computex conference which
runs from May 30th to June 3rd in Taipei
Taiwan this year Computex is the biggest
event of the year for PC hardware and
technology where we preview the newest
prototypes before they come to market
we highly recommend attending or
following this event online for industry
professionals and enthusiasts learn more
at the link in the description below so
the plan here is I retain this down
we're going to look at just from here I
can see some really interesting features
of the cooling solution so we're going
to look at that and I'll talk with Scott
to go through the basics of the card
maybe some other stuff grabs ready on
chill or something like that so I'll get
started on this Scott what are the
basics on the rx 580 versus something
like the 480 can you get everyone up to
speed on that sure the 500 series is
what we're calling it as Polaris evolved
so you're familiar with the 400 series
in our Polaris GPUs the 500 series
offers an expanded range of products
actually have new silicon going down
into well below 99 dollars so we're
updating that low in segments where you
know a lot of times you'd see older GPUs
in the past with a new chip that has all
of the Polaris display bought blocks
right a TV CD code and HDR support and
all of that and then every price point
along the way we're offering more value
than we have in the past and then at the
high end with the the 580 we have a
higher performance obviously and then we
also have allowed our partners including
sapphire with nitro plus to really push
on performance beyond where they were
able to do in them so that is that a
focus more on the board partners this
time
it sounds like yes okay so the what
you'll see is instead of you know
goodbye and deborde's you'll see a lot
of partner boards you'll see more
variety in the designs and this is a
really nice example of what those guys
have been able to do right so basics
here for people who have been watching
this so far interestingly all of these
screws for the back plate thus far one
they're pretty big screws but two
they're also the spring retained screws
which we normally only see for the cold
blade in the cooler itself so that's
different things are a bit loose now so
we can start kind of pulling it apart
I'm going to remove this i/o panel or
plate and then it looks like from there
it'll be a matter of disconnecting the
cables and then our PCB and cooler
should be free from the shroud so in
terms of clocks it sounds like you're
saying the 500 series is going to be at
a boosted clock to the 400 series right
yes and whether 1340 is that the new
yeah 1341 and 1340 now I'm forgetting
but one of the two course is 1266 for
the 480 and then on this particular
product I believe the boosts clock is 14
11 right and that from memory 13:40 is
right around where we were hitting with
our original our X 480 overclock which I
would assume given equal drivers and
things like that
13:40 on our X 480 and 13 for down and
our X 580 should be about the same
performance yeah that's the new starting
point right that's what they're
something to think about
yeah so now you've got more headroom to
actually go up beyond that another thing
we're doing with the 500 series is we've
tuned for idle and video playback and
multi monitor scenarios okay you'll see
lower power use in those cases compared
to the 400 series caches so what about
so on the power use side we were talking
about Radeon chill earlier that impact
power use as well right yes so what are
let's go over some of the basics on that
just because I know Radeon chill was a
big part of your slides for this launch
yeah so radiant chill is a new software
feature that we introduced
actually late last year but it really I
think hasn't gotten the attention it
deserves it's a really interesting sure
option for gamers you know power
consumption in noise and heat production
is a big part of correct you know
dealing with the PC and Radeon chill is
a software method of actually just being
providing a similar experience right but
be doing it much more efficiently gray
and to the way that shield is that is it
looks at for certain types of games that
use a lot of specific types of inputs
like first person shooters third person
games we know that if you hit WASD or
lose Mouse there's no movement on the
screen right right and so what chill
does is it will limit your frame rate
when there's not as much movement on the
screen and then instantly raise it back
up when there is more move that's right
and in both cases make sure that you
don't go into those 300 frames per
second sort of head cases where you're
using a lot of power and you're running
well ahead of like even the monitors
display kay there there's no real point
in doing that have primary talking on
effector experience and so chill has the
ability I know people don't like to
think about limiting their performance
but it actually gives you the ability on
per game basis to going into the
thresholds that you choose right so that
that the idea is that at the end of the
day you shouldn't perceive a difference
between chill and not chill operation
but you should see the card hopefully
running quieter running cooler and less
power consumption all right until
something I want to benchmark now and
now that we've kind of gone over some of
the basics particularly on the input
latency stuff which we have your
marketing slides but we'll look into
testing in the future for that for what
we've got so far so I've taken them tend
out pulling that down excusing most of
the card the backplate can still come
off I got a couple things to do there
but before taking the rest of it apart
what we're seeing here is one of the
biggest aluminium heat sinks I've ever
seen on a video card it is a
full-coverage sever going all the way
across here with some really interesting
depth profiles on the fins and part of
that is to accommodate
just the cooler which I don't have the
calipers or thing but that looks to be
about 90 to 100 millimeter fam sighs so
do dole blowers or a dual axial fans
blowing down on the card
the vrm as usual is here we'll look at
that moment GPS over here now the
interesting part that prompted this is
if you look at this giant plate at the
bottom here this from what we're seen so
far is actually contacting the vram in
addition to the GPU so that means that
manufacturers are finally starting to
really get the hint there that they can
do a lot more with their coolers we saw
this with the hydros or with the
water-cooled the gigabyte 1080 cards so
they're contacting the vram and as I was
talking to Scott about this earlier this
means that you might have a higher GPU
temperature if you're just measuring in
GPU Z or something but that's not
necessarily a bad thing because now
we're sinking the vram as well thinking
all these different components with the
GPU means your temperature is going to
look higher but your cooling other stuff
as well so an extra 3 C on the GPU in
favor of cooling vram directly for once
is not actually a bad loss so we can
pull apart the rest of this now and then
Scott in terms of other 500 series stuff
that's interesting what do we have for
like the the 570 cards what's the one of
the specs there so the 570 is 32 compute
units on a Polaris 20 tip so rather than
were disabled compared to the 580 sure
but it still has a nice high clock and I
think you'll see performance that is
very nice actually maybe not even
dissimilar from to the original 480 48
cards okay but you guys can't test that
yourself right so your lineup at least
for today 5 80s 5 70s just just to get I
know the answer to this but just to ask
it so that people don't kill me in the
comments do we have a price yet so I
suppose when this goes live we might
have a private gift say but yeah I'm
just goes like it'll have a price to all
of this stuff but
as we film we probably aren't supposed
to disclose that yet it's the consensus
of competitive information right so we
can revisit this or you guys could put
it in dollars yeah we like the
description or something yeah so here's
a here's what we've got here first of
all this came off easier than I thought
this is we've got some breathing room
for the GPU in the back this is a job
well done by sapphire some of the
companies don't do this they'll cover it
up and then they don't put any direct
contact which we've previously looked at
between the backplate and the PCB when
they don't do this what happens is you
end up with a effectively a hot box from
the backplate strapping all the heat so
that fire is allowing some breathing
room here we'll test how effective this
is if we get a sapphire model I've got
some a issues and Gigabyte ones though
and then here we have a thermal pad
contacting this protrusion and the to
the plate and we are working on some
kind of metal here and that is actually
screwed in which we can see here I'm not
gonna bother on doing this so that's
interesting am i quite sure why they've
done it that way but maybe this is
cheaper from the die casting process so
that's what we have there I've just
taken out the four screws which are
spring retained as well for the GP
that's what those look like and that
will release the massive bloom heatsink
in theory from the PCB
I'm just make sure we didn't miss a
screw somewhere it looks like we got all
so let's see how this goes there's a
toggle up here too so they've got a dip
switch at the top which looks like I
suppose you don't know the specific on
this card looks like a scientist emotive
BIOS toggle right and I'd have it as a
backup in case you fly your BIOS or in
some cases it's an overclock mode you
can flip that to go into a default
higher clock mode right I'm not sure
what sapphire is done with the toggle
yeah it looks like potentially a bias
switch so you cut I think it's just held
on by basically gloom at this point yeah
don't pads and thermal paste
alright here it goes
scare you didn't come off I thought it
you know maybe you would never know yeah
alright so pretty cool stuff it will
have to have builds would analyze the
vrm of this but what we're looking at
here is we've got the memory so you know
two four six eight eight gigabytes so
eight gigabit packages or one gigabyte
packages TP is in the center and a
thermal pad contact from the vram to the
giant sink and so what we've got here is
actually a bit different than what I
thought it is an isolated copper cold
plate and then it looks like maybe just
an aluminum which is fine honestly for
the rest of this the the curious thing
is those isolating that's helped in a
significant way and isolating the GP
from some of the heat on the vram and my
guess would be yes because there's a
couple layers of difference there so
that's the collective cold plate for the
vram and the GPU really interesting thin
design I will have to talk to sapphire
about to see why they did it this way
they've got all the channels in here so
you can see there are thermal pads
contacting the FETs and I'm not seeing
doublers or anything like that but I am
seeing two sets of three fats will talk
to build Zoid to analyze the phase
design and then a channel here for the
capacitor bank and for the inductors
which we've got same amount of inductors
there so it looks like a couple good
couple phases for the core vrm terms of
the FET models working 1/2 G I'll pass
the number still on to build side again
because he's got all these on his in his
head so yeah that's the board let's
looks like that okay if we might as well
clean out the GPO this point because how
do we to need to do have three apply
thermal paste anyway do you know is the
GPU identify or different on views like
the name on the name on well let's take
a look
I guess we'll find out started here it's
a blank it's blank which might just be a
if it's a pre-production model it might
just be blank because of that but yeah
this is a really card that I'm bored I
just brought along to write great I
didn't know was going to get this kind
of treatment happy to do it but we're
taking taken good care of it yes or no
name on the on this particular GPU but
once we look at the review units that
might change a business it being an
early sample memory all that stuff
memory power design phase layout we'll
have in a separate video with build
Zoids professional overclocked and
analysis he can also talk about power
mods shunt mods hard mods to get more
power out of the card and I think that's
pretty much what we have to look at
right now for the Sapphire with a nitro
plus if nitro plus rx 580 and other than
this
I guess Scot any anything you want to
throw in here in terms of the Radeon 500
series or I know everyone's guys got
Vega in the comments yes there is
information on Vega out there we've
talked about in the past architecture at
CES yes
so that stuff hasn't changed right and
just to clarify there's nothing new oh
not right now I thought did you guys see
our GDC capsaicin info we actually
showed some nice demos there of Vega
working with the rapid pac-man ability
that's a nice thing so there's some
there's some new information since the
es right but you know we're setting the
table with the 500 series for the
regular release we said it's coming but
it's not yet time right and what about
for the 500 series what are the the GPU
so we had Polaris 10 and 11 previously
what are the new ones called so 20 and
21 plus there's at the low end rx 550 is
a new GPU that will whose name will
remain shrouded in mystery
today right but but is actually another
Polaris chip that's even smaller okay
and the color is 21 and and Polaris 20
is going to be the one on the five ATS I
guess yes okay and then 21 is on the the
464 560 yeah cool
well there you have it so there's the
PCB check back for builds analysis will
have full reviews if they're not online
today with embargo lifts this is
obviously recorded at a launch but
they're not online today they'll be
online shortly and Scott thank you for
allowing me to take a part of the card
definitely no problem in I'll get it
back together and we'll see you all next
time
