community for its product stack until
today sets forth in an attempt to
validate the challenged existence of its
X 299 platform new skylake X and new KB
wake X CPUs we're starting with the 10
core 20 thread core I 970 900 X which is
Intel's new $1000 CPU that takes place
of the one $1,700 I 769 50 x10 core CPU
this is a significant price drop over
time but Intel is no longer competing
with only itself skylake X's precipitous
launch lands between Rison and thread
Ripper due out in early August and today
we're looking at game streaming VR
benchmarks premier blender and other
benchmarks of the new AI 970 900 X
before that this is brought to you by
Corsairs vengeance RGB memory which uses
binned
ICS for higher overclocks and uses the
sm bus to write its colors rather than
relying on cables learn more at the link
in the description below let's start by
revisiting some of our earlier 7900 X
discussions from when we deleted the CPI
Computex first of all that RFID chip in
the corner we got some clarification on
that that shift is actually not capable
of storing data because it's sm bus is
not physically connected so it could do
something if it were connected but on
the HED TCP use it is not and the reason
that RFID chip is there at all on the
package is because Intel is using the
same package for its server versions of
these CPUs as it is for the h EDT
versions of these CPUs and that just
means that it's kind of a leftover
because again same package for both
types of products but it's not
physically connected so that's good in
some ways though it could potentially
provide functionality could also provide
things like backdoors and we don't have
to worry about that at all because you
just can't read or write to or from the
RFID chip on the package but that also
bleeds into the next point which is the
really interesting substrate design of
the 7900 X when we deleted the CPU we
showed that the Seaview almost resembles
an LGA 1150 x substrate atop the 2066
substrate intel couldn't answer why the
design is like this citing quote
manufacturing reasons which is the same
reason they cite really for anything
like use of thermal paste rather than
solder and our
present hypothesis having not seen the
server CPU is that the server CPUs might
use it more of the lower substrate and
ditch the upper substrate part the
protrusion but Intel is keeping the same
package for everything really not sure
if there is a legitimate technical
reason for this approach at this time or
if it's more of a cost savings in as
Intel just wouldn't tell us
as for the CPUs themselves our current
understanding is that the 14 core 16
core and 18 core CPUs will be based on
the same silicon from a 20 core sieve
you with some of them disabled or
removed we're not sure 100% about the
lower-end skews like the 7900 X which is
a 10 core part but we do know some about
the die size because of that deleting
process earlier so the 79 100x measures
in at roughly 334 millimeters squared
some rounding involved and for reference
the previous generation 10 core 224 core
parts range from 246 millimeters squared
up to 456 millimeters squared in the
enterprise division respectively but
anyways the substrate design is
genuinely interesting hopefully we'll
learn more one day at some point we do
know it uses thermal pay it's probably
Dow Corning and no solder for this one
even though it is a larger die we'll
look into the thermals in a completely
separate video because there's frankly
enough for today we're not going to
really spend time going over a brochure
with specs on it that's not really the
point of these if you want that you can
check the table on the website the 7900
x is under test today and is used with
the acs prime deluxe x 299 motherboard
for full testing methodology again check
the article link in the description
below we're focusing on game streaming
benchmarks including single and dual
stream output simultaneously be our
benchmarks to validate intel's own
marketing language as we figure a few
others will bother with VR benchmarks
and then dive into the production
workloads we're saving some stuff for
later like thermals and power because
we're up against deadlines overclocking
will also be discussed in more depth in
the article since overclocking results
we're still rolling in as we filmed this
video starting with streaming benchmarks
this is the first time we've ever done
this type of benchmarking for actual
game streaming via OBS and so it's
exciting but there's also still a lot to
develop methodologically and a lot to
develop in presentation method there's
a ton of data is not necessarily easy to
figure out how to display it so there's
there's more to come later but for now
we have a baseline we're using two main
tests one is exporting to a single
stream just twitch via OBS at 6 megabits
per second 1080p 60fps with h.264
encoding and then second we're streaming
to both twitch and YouTube
simultaneously so you've got dual stream
output from the same box that's playing
the game and that's done with the same
settings for twitch but with 10 megabits
per second for YouTube rather than 6
because it supports a higher bitrate and
finally we do have an extra FPS baseline
benchmark without streaming and another
benchmark with envy encoder or the GPU
accelerated encoding rather than CPU so
we can get a baseline for everything
else and all the other main options in
the system in addition to the FPS
numbers we're using login to measure
what we're calling delay frames and drop
frames another term that we use for VR
benchmarking for these we've got usual
frame time and frame rates metrics for
the host systems game output to the
player and then the drop frames and
delay frames are used for the viewers so
that you get an understanding of what
the actual quality is going out the
lanes happen when the CPU can't complete
the encode in time to hit it's roughly
sixteen point six seven millisecond
window before the next refresh and so
this tends to be indicative of more of a
GPU limitation we can run into these
with high-end CPUs if we are run into a
GPU limit because the CPU can keep up
fully a drop frame however is indicative
of in this scenario a CPU encoding issue
where the CPU is actually just skipping
the frame or dropping it entirely so you
end up with sort of almost micro stutter
in the absolute worst case scenario if
you're dropping 50 percent or more of
your frames and that is just because the
CP is getting overwhelmed which will
certainly happen at some point as you
pile on more simultaneous encoding
streams because it see if you can't keep
up with the workload and we'll talk
about more that's going through it but
we're starting with the r7 1800 X on the
I 970 900 X of course both in stock
configuration both with 32 hundred
megahertz memory and
full testing methods again on the new
benchmark check the article below it'll
answer all the stuff in more detail
let's start with a single stream first
as it's the most common use case
streaming this which only we saw no drop
frames on the 7900 X and no drop frames
on the 1,800 X both are adequate
performers with delay frames not
noteworthy or perceptibly different
between the two here's a look at the
differences in terms of frame rate the I
970 900 ex post an in-game frame rate of
104 FPS average 79 fps 1% lows and 31
fps 0.1% lows with the r7 1800 X
sustaining 96 FPS average 68 fps 1% low
and 27 FPS 0.1% mode let's put a chart
on the screen below this one this charge
now is that you can see both of them
shows the performance when there's no
streaming at all with just the game
being tested standalone in its same
windowed configuration because again
it's a stream benchmark and we're doing
a/b testing we're going from 112 FPS
average to 104 on the eye 9 7 900 X when
compared to no streaming and with the
1800 X we're going from 109 FPS average
to 96 FPS with the twitch stream going
the frame time performance is
significantly improved when we stop
streaming as you can see the low numbers
and justifies why you would still want a
separate capture machine for really
competitive gaming or games where frame
time variability can affect your ability
to play competitively moving on now to
our next chart we're looking at
streaming performance when going to both
twitch and YouTube simultaneously
there's a lot of data to process here so
we're just going to start with the chart
of twitch performance from streaming to
both services and then look at YouTube
as well these tests are meant to
illustrate performance when outputting
to destinations like when the user has
an audience on both platforms and it's
becoming increasingly popular and it's
traditionally donald's every capture
machine to alleviate load on the gaming
machine so we're going to see if I still
needed here here's the chart performance
the twitch during this dual stream
benchmark post 0.13% drop frames on the
i9 so 900 X averaged across multiple
test passes of the same duration which
is largely imperceptible to both the
viewer and the player delay frames are
5.0 3% which we think but we're still
learning as this is new testing is
because the CPU is performing well
enough to bump into GPU limits the 1800
X has a much harder time with this
workload and these 1800 X is driving 54%
of it's frames twitch which results in
something of
slide show for playback for comparison
and the encoder is still choppy for
about 20% of its playback on the 10 to
80 with the 700 X even with two env
encoder engines running so generally
speaking the CPU encoding is still going
to be preferable when you can get away
with it that's clearly not always the
case
adding the YouTube chart to the page now
the I 9 7 900 X sticks to well below one
percent of total frames dropped with GPU
frame lags still around the same level
and the EC is about 78 percent of its
frames dropped here and struggles with
the h.264 profile and dual stream
outputs to make things easier to
understand we're putting the actual
stream footage that went to youtube on
the screen now showing the 7900 X next
to the 1,800 X again remember that while
this was going on we're also exploring
to twitch so there are two encoders
going on simultaneously one for each
stream the extra four threads really
help Intel in this specific use case but
just for sake of understanding
performance here's the screen shot of
utilization on the rising system and the
Intel system 1 under this intense
workload and again this is h.264 with
the encoder set to faster rather than
very fast so you could lower your
quality and possibly still sustain it
but it would be a bit rough on the rise
in CPU as for fps this is what it looks
like the Stax chart shows an average FPS
of all three tests we're down to 75 FPS
average on the 1800 x still fine if it
weren't for the stream struggling anyway
and 89 FPS average on these 7900 X now
we're faced with the challenge of
analyzing what this means
the first big disparity is in frame time
so the average FPS on both AMD and Intel
on this very specific test looks just
fine when you're streaming really to any
of those two scenarios
what doesn't show up in averages is what
we see in frame x point one percent lows
in this case or we do have a frame time
chart as well and that is the case that
the cpus get over 70 FPS and 0.1 percent
lows and our charts when there is no
stream going on and then they fall below
30 or around 30 when streaming is
happening which is not really the best
case scenario especially if you're
trying to stream something like csgo
that will get you killed but for a lot
of other games that might be just fine
so it's
something where it's going to vary on a
game by game basis whether that's
accessible to you depends on what kind
of content you're working with
anyway this frame time chart shows the
dual streams versus no stream on the i9
7900 X clearly illustrating the improved
frame time consistency on the benchmark
without the streams running that's where
those 0.1 percent load numbers are
derived high variability and frame the
frame latency is what we're seeing here
with all that detailed a few notes the
Intel I 970 900 X is an impressive CPU
for this dual streaming use case
scenario certainly if you must stream to
two sources simultaneously and if you
cannot build a secondary capture machine
then this isn't a bad solution in fact a
$1000 CPU the 7900 X may actually be
cheaper than building a dedicated
capture machine in addition to the
gaming machine but you still lose
performance in frame times so for people
who are ultra competitive we'd still
suggest building a secondary capture
machine if you have the space and the
budget to do it if that's absolutely out
of the question then the CPU gets you
closer but still outputting to just one
stream is the best middle ground between
them
Rison does well with single stream
performance here and does dominate in
the price to performance argument versus
the 7900 X by quite a lot particularly
considering you could buy an r7 1700
instead of the 1800 X which we would
certainly recommend because the 1800 X
is superfluous you get overclocked to
1700 and get the same performance or
better than the 1800 X out of box and
that way you can run a cheaper solution
than the 7900 X stream your one source
twitch or YouTube and really do quite
well in the price to performance market
but to be fair to Intel the 7900 X does
crush everything in the dual streaming
test so far so that's not to say our
settings couldn't do it you just really
have to lose quality to do so both CPUs
have their place just depends on what
you're doing let's move on to another
set of harder benchmarks this is VR
testing we debuted our VR testing
methodology in our r7 seventeen hundred
versus i7 seventy seven hundred KB our
benchmarks where we noted that the CPUs
were imperceptibly different from one
another you would absolutely not be able
to confidently tell the difference in a
blind test and if you didn't see our
previous VR test we'd strongly recommend
watching those for a full description of
how this procedure works because it's
quite complicated and the most calm
kaida benchmarking we've ever done not
going to re-explain it all here but the
real reason to reintroduce these
benchmarks now is to validate some of
intel's marketing slides that we
publicly disagreed with in the initial
news announcement about these products
in their slides intel would lead you to
believe that their existing non-case cue
still high-end CPUs are insufficient for
VR gaming that's plainly false
in fact oculus rift officially
recommends recommend not requires
recommends an i5 4590 cpu or better
there's no K on there the HTC vive
recommends the same hardware and in our
own testing you would do fine with an i7
non-case q with really pretty much any
game you could throw at VR so these
slides served more of a point to find a
way to say VR it does VR it does it
really well rather than actually say
that this is the capabilities of each of
these products Intel's cannibalizing
their own existing product line to make
this one look better which we don't
necessarily agree with
so we benchmarked it to see what the
performance would actually look like in
an objective VR test since those really
are still quite rare because it's hard
to do and it's kind of interesting
results but maybe not surprising now the
main point here is going to be to
compare the 7700 K to the 7900 X seen as
we're really just validating Intel's own
slides but we do have 1700 benchmark
numbers as well if you want the hardware
capture from the capture machine which
is extra complexity check the article
we're going to do just software here
let's look at elite dangerous versus the
7700 K shown in blue the i7 7700 K
technically outperforms a 79 hundred K
here and that should be somewhat
expected it's got a clock advantage
which is often more beneficial than a
thread advantage and generally speaking
VR games don't really have the best
multi-threaded programming right now
that said the differences again
imperceptible to CPS are effectively
identical in actual perceived
performance but if you are buying for VR
gaming and nothing else
this shows that clearly the 7900 X is
not only unnecessary VR but technically
closer to the 11 to 13 mil
second frame time cut-off point before
entering into drop frame or warp miss
territory
these 77 100k meanwhile stays closer to
nine most I can average frame times
again with a ninety Hertz interval we
need to hit that 11 to 13 millisecond
frame time targets prior to the run time
kicking in and applying warps and
finalizing animation and now just for a
quick showcase here's the 7900 X and the
r7 1700 in stock configuration the 7900
X it does indeed outperform the r7 1700
which was also outperformed by the 7700
K but between all three of these none of
them are really running past the run
time in any meaningfully different way
in fact we've got a better way to
display this data so here's a bar charge
for elite dangerous with average FPS in
terms of delivered frames of hmd we're
seeing a perfect 90 Hertz on all
headsets a simple extrapolation of
unconstrained frames peg vi9 7900 acted
below the 7700 K stock CPU but the
differences again not noticeable our
dropped frames are still just nine out
of 5,400 intervals that's really not bad
you are never going to see 9 out of 50
400 whatever percentage that may be in
this type of scenario and these 1700
also does well here really all of these
CPUs are fine and so there's no need for
a $1000 7900 ax to do this VR workload
though Intel tells us that it wasn't
just marketing for VR gaming that was
also for VR content creation except
that's not what the slide said so that's
not over benchmarking right now here's a
look at leat dangerous average frame
times in milliseconds I 970 900 X runs
an average frame time of 9.3 5
milliseconds plus or minus 0.25 as
there's some variance in these tests
that's below the 7700 K for which our
stock and OC numbers are effectively
identical and are within our error bars
and just ahead of these 1700 OC with
dirt rally now we see a similar
experience the I 970 900 X is
technically slower and fame times in
this interval plot than the 7700 K both
stock though the two are realistically
again imperceptibly different by 970 900
X would be a monumental waste of money
for vr gaming considering that Intel to
own i7 7700 K
the best performer we've seen or tested
for virtual reality by this interval
plot and fame time charts every 900 is
again technically better than the r7
1700 but again it's not noticeable and
the 7700 K is still technically better
than both at this particular workload
here are some more bars since people
seem to find that more palatable the
7900 exit lands at middle of the pack
none of these cps are bad they all
provide 90 FPS to the HMD again it's not
worth spending $1000 when two 300 ish
dollar CPUs from either cap including
Intel zone can provide the same or
better experience and that's an
objective measurement as for frame times
briefly the 7 900 exit lands at 8.15
milliseconds averaged between the 8.7
millisecond average of the overclocked
1700 end of 7.4 one millisecond average
of these 7700 k performance is good but
it's not better than intel's other
products or and these other products
that we've tested and that's fine
the cpu does not have to do everything
the best and that's what we want to
convey to the marketers of the world we
have this same talk with Andy's r7 1800
X when they boasted all kinds of gaming
things like 4k gaming this and that we
talked about all that then and the
points not to pick on anyone the point
wasn't to pick on Andy then the point is
not to pick on Intel now even though it
seems to be cool frankly the point is
that Intel you don't have to BS people
if you have a good product it does fine
as the things that does find that as
we'll see in a moment and as we saw in
streaming a second ago but advertising
this as a vr gaming best of platformer
is not only wrong when your own products
do better although they are all
basically the same it's unnecessary and
it's trying to bandwagon on to a phrase
to letters that Intel clearly thinks
will sell more products but all this
really does is produce more marketing BS
that harms the companies because it's
it's just unnecessary and there's I mean
that's really all I have to say that I
guess despite the marketing the thing is
not any better at vr gaming than other
cps we've tested and just Intel it's ok
you don't have to be the best at every
single thing let's move on to more
suitable tasks for this type of
processor using
jion's in-house blender scene including
optimizations for rendering on CPS or
GPS as appropriate
we found the 7900 ex effortlessly chart
tops all other tested products when it
stock configuration the 700x completed
the scene rounder in 21.5 minutes using
its 20 threads to render 20 tiles
simultaneously for the 4k scene this is
the first CPU we've tested that managed
to outperform a GTX 1080 with CUDA
rendering and that's counting 256 by 256
GPU optimized file sizes the 7900 X
improves over the stock 69 100k i7 CPU
by nearly eight minutes or a 26%
reduction in time required
that's massive generationally and the
more competitive pricing of Intel's
modern 10 core part tells us that it was
folly to expect Intel didn't have
anything to compete that said the r7
1700 overclocked 3.9 gigahertz comes
closer to competing with its 28 minute
render time with the 7900 X about 23
percent faster than the $310 part
regardless there's no denying Intel's
lead here for production studios that
have the budget and would kill for the
extra render time as the CPU is a winner
at its price
Rison though should give everyone pause
on pricing if absolute top-end
production isn't the objective and the
buyer is more of an enthusiast or artist
without a studio budget the r7 CPUs can
be overclocked to compete quite
reasonably and would still be a good buy
for much cheaper they are ultimately a
completely different class of hardware
for this type of thing now particularly
with X 299 s memory advantages over
Rison so this is one of those scenarios
where it just depends on who has the
money and who's paying for the product
moving to Adobe Premiere we're still
slower than mercury acceleration with
CUDA but we're seeing steady
improvements over all using our EVGA icx
review from February to render which
includes dozens of clips in various
states of post-production we find the i9
CPU completing the software render in 54
minutes or about 7 20 percent time
reduction from the overclocked 6900 K
and 21 percent reduced time required
from the stock 6900 K that's a decent
jump and the r7 CPU is completely ran at
about 62 minutes on overclocked
even the 7900 X with a 13% time
reduction from the overclocked r7 though
with a higher price of course again
trade-off of if you're a studio or an
individual that's not great value for
the average end-user given the $700
price hike but
in that again a production house would
consider then again for this type of
premiere workload you're really
significantly better off with a GTX 1080
and CUDA anyway we're at twenty minutes
for those renders even with an i5 CPU
we're just doesn't care about the CPU if
it's given ample GPU to work with
Cinebench and synthetic tests we'll be
in the article below
moving on to some games total war
Warhammer saw an update posterizing
launched that improves performance
significantly on both Andy and Intel
processors Intel saw a major uptick in
frame time consistency reflected in our
0.1% lows and Andy saw major uptick in
SMT enabled performance CPUs with an
asterisk have been retested with this
update while CB is without an asterisk
have not been retested CPUs without the
star would see the improvement of a
couple percent in average FPS if
retested stock vi9 700x operates at 168
FPS average placing it behind the i-5
7600 K and ahead of the 69 hundred K
stock CPU and ahead of the overclocked
1700 X CPU with our clock DRAM the stock
i7 7700 k CP u ranks at around 190 FPS
average where we begin bumping into GP
limitations which illustrates why h EDT
CPUs aren't really meant for gaming
despite some of their advertising some
games will use the threads but many are
still frequency intensive first
battlefield 1 also got an update after
aizen's launch moving to version 1.0 8
and improving CP about mine performance
again the asterisks on the items that
mean that they have been retested I nine
seven nine hundred X runs 144 FPS
average placing it roughly tied with a
$330 700k CPU and better yet the $240
7600 K CPU the r7 1700 X was overclocked
core memory speeds runs 136 FPS average
marking at the 7900 X about 5.7 percent
faster not a huge gain we also have
gaming benchmarks for Ashes and
watchdogs 2 linked in the article below
with the synthetics each of the
conclusions for the different things was
kind of self-contained in its section
but go over it briefly here the CPU is
impressive for multi stream output it
does really well and outputting to
streams to YouTube and to twitch Rison
does pretty well with one stream to the
point where you really wouldn't need a
some 900 X is not a huge difference at
that point but for two this is the best
thing we've tested it's just a matter of
is that a use case you will encounter
and also
it better for you to just build a
separate stream box the reason you would
do it again is if you want the lower
frame time variance for competitive
games if you don't care about that then
this is a cheaper alternative to
building two complete systems for the
most part for VR gaming this is a
monumental waste of money and you should
buy something helps for production work
like premier or blender is even a better
example in blenders they were big enough
gains that the 7900 ex could be
worthwhile to people who do blender
rendering and similar tasks
professionally and who might want to do
it on the CPU rather than the GPU
although again if you start pumping 10
to 80 eyes into it the argument gets a
nebulous but for those people this is a
good product at a good price for people
who are more enthusiast artists or non
production studios Andy is a great
competitor at the price that it's at
looking at something like a 1,700
overclock you get really good in close
performance premier that performance is
closer still in our testing you're
better off with the GPU and our testing
that's not the most conclusive because
we can't test for every single use case
but from what we've seen you're better
off with a GPU anyway so it's it's
better than the other CPUs I guess but
that's it for this one so plenty of
other stuff in the article below as
always you can support our testing like
this and our new 4k camera which is
eating one gigabyte per minute right now
if you go to patreon.com/scishow so you
can buy a shirt like this on a
restocking tri-blend this week actually
stored our cameras next has done that
and adding that part cost me about
another gigabyte so thank you for
watching subscribe for more I will see
you all next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
