Nexus dotnet and today we recovery
deadly 30 a side-scrolling zombie
killing game based on World War two for
Saturday heat signature episode 8 that
means eight solid weeks of indie game
coverage and game coverage of those
games that are a lesser known but really
deserve attention so this time we're
talking about deadly 30 you need to
survive 30 deadly nights as the name
would seem to imply of zombie attacks in
a World War 2 based setting so we start
out as an American soldier that's got an
SMG and is stuck somewhere over behind
enemy lines our first objective is to
fortify a house so we can survive the
night so we first go over to this
abandoned house build a small fence
because white picket fences do amazingly
against zombie attacks that is why the
suburbs are obviously the best place to
be in the event of a zombie apocalypse
and we fortify those we actually can get
companions later as well but I will talk
about that in a second we can go buy
some ammo some you can make new guns
once you have enough parts to do it and
all kinds of cool stuff like that and it
is just to get into mechanics for a
second a side-scrolling shooter as I
said so it is point to aim you just
point where you want to shoot and you
click and they die pretty simple there
is no real skill involved in that there
is some skill involved and staying alive
though and making compromises and
sacrifices you can duck to aim have
better aim to have more accuracy you can
jump which I used quite frequently when
I was running low on health and I was
bunny hopping just like in a
quote-unquote real FPS so we do have
multiple types of zombies and the game
does sort of borrow heavily from games
like killing floor left for dead all of
these old I mean even a little bit of
what was that game called dd5 i called
it world at war nazi zombies actually it
borrows from everywhere which whether
direct or not it is actually not that
bad because when you take from so many
different places or when you get
influenced by so many different places
subconsciously it turns out to be a
better game because you have multiple
influences in there to make sure that
there are all kinds of unique ideas so I
actually like that in my games but it is
roll or two base so we have a couple
different weapons I think 12 and they're
all based on World War
to weaponry except for one which is a
laser gun each character in your squad
up to three members a Russian and
American and a German all appropriately
stereotyped in their voice overs are
assigned a specific weapon set so our
army man from the US gets the SMGs our
Russian gets the sniper or a Winchester
line and our German gets the shoddy line
you can actually switch between
characters which makes it pretty fun
because there's different play style for
each one and if one of your characters
dies there is no requirement finally to
keep one particular member alive as your
squad begins to fill up it becomes much
easier but of course these zombies
become more difficult so there are
bloats and stuff like that the fatties I
think they're called in this game so new
types of zombies that evolve with each
progressive night on the way up to 30
nights that make it increasingly
difficult to survive but on that note
you can upgrade your fortifications in
the house and this is actually a huge
part of the fun factor is you need to go
exploring and scavenging every day so
there's a day/night cycle when it turns
tonight obviously you're fighting
zombies turns today there's still some
zombies hanging around but they're not
spawning as frequently as they are at
night so we have to go scavenging of the
day for new materials to build guns with
so we can upgrade our walls so we can
build auto centuries like those and tf2
all this good stuff very standard in
terms of ideas for multiple games but a
lot of these haven't been combined into
a single simplistic side-scrolling
two-dimensional game that can be played
on any system basically I'm sure there's
some requirements but I have not run
into those when you scavenge for
resources you come across big vehicles
like tanks or abandoned German cars and
you can salvage those you can break them
down basically and grab those parts and
then you can use those parts to build
new guns or to buy health kits or stuff
like that at the shop which is
conveniently located in your two room
apartment that you're defending but when
you're scavenging in the day there are
multiple will call them zones where you
can go either left or right of your base
to the left our fields and then I'm
mountain and to the right is a snowy
area and then a castle so you can go
either of those directions and try your
luck and hopefully find the other new
companions if one of them died or if you
don't have one yet if you go to the left
it is a bit of different scenery there's
a cotton farm or something like that
first and then a large mountainous area
to the right there is a snowy area and
then a castle as I said and beyond that
they're really not too different but
it's just it's kind of cool to see the
idea of okay you have these four or five
different zones you can run through and
you have to pick carefully which one
you're hoping to roll the dice on for
picking up some kind of randomly
generated character or item or whatever
because you really don't have that much
time it is basically you I've found that
you have enough time really to run
through the first zone immediately
adjacent to your base and then run
through about half of the next zone and
then night starts to fall and if you
really want to push all the way to the
end of that last zone and hit the end of
the map as it were you start running
into problems of holy crap it's about to
turn in tonight and I'm completely out
here alone maybe with a few squad mates
you really have no cover at all so at
that point it is almost impossible to
run back to your base without getting
murdered by zombies on the way but
that's part of the fun of the game if
you really need those resources you will
find a way to get out there and get them
so you get out there you grab your
resources you head back to the base and
then you fortify with walls with better
walls with Auto turrets with laser guns
with armor all this awesome stuff and it
is a highly compatible game so that
means it's great for road trips and
things like that it's a five dollar game
I picked it up on impulse after seeing
someone mention it on reddit so thanks
to that person because I actually
enjoyed it a lot is it worth five
dollars well that depends on if you like
this kind of game it did have a few bugs
it definitely has a repetition value i
would say you'd probably get a couple
hours out of this game if you really
ration those hours and it is a good
travel game and it is a little buggy so
you might have to enter a couple of
weird black screen glitches when you
change the resolution but I didn't see
any bugs really when i was in game so
nothing to complain about here this is
not a review though this is just a video
to tell you about the game so that's the
game
is called deadly 30 by head up games I
believe and that is our Saturday heat
signature episode 8 please comment
subscribe and like if you like this
video i will be at PAX East 2012 next
week with three staff members so come
say hi if you see anyone in a GN shirt
and that means I probably won't have a
Saturday heat signature next week but i
will try desperately to get one up and
in the very least we will have several
packs videos so i will see you guys next
time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
