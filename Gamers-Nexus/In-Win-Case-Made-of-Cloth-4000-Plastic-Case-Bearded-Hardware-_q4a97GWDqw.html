at Computex 2019 and one mr. Jost a
Ponzi bearded hardware is watching me
from across the way think he's listening
to Iron Maiden right now so we might get
demonetised for this one but they has
three main cases we're going to look at
its core their head pain and one of them
is a Signature Series not many people
can be buying this but it's interesting
look at it as always there's the Alice
which is over there and that one's a $40
case so it might be a bit more
mainstream friendly and there's a
concept case that anyone's looking for
feedback on so we'll talk about that at
the end before that this video is
brought to you by the be quiet dark rock
slim keeping a high performance focus
but reducing the footprints to
accommodate full memory slot
compatibility the dark rock slim comes
with one of be quiet silent wins three
120 millimeter fans built for low noise
operation the dark rock slim advertises
cooling capability up to 180 watts EDP
but mixes in a matte black out color
design to combine performance and looks
learn more at the link in the
description below this one the Signature
Series is the young its I think it it's
the stage before butterflies when I'm
told so I suppose that would be a cocoon
couldn't remember the name in English
earlier so that's the name for it but
supposed to be $4,000 to that all the
way first
it's a Signature Series case anyone does
these they've done like the I think it's
the H tower before it's kind of like a
transformer case so these are you know
as we said a lot the show halo products
it's to get attention but they will be
selling them so if you wanted to buy one
for four grand you've got maybe a yacht
you would like your computer on then it
can come in it'll come in different
colors it's like semi customizable for
the customer the exterior is in ABS
plastic the interiors and aluminum
doesn't much matter what the specs are
because obviously it's just the outer
shell that's kind of everything on this
case but the exterior is 3d printed for
the for the shell and then the interior
is just normal tooling for aluminum
there might be a site set up to allow
customers to customize these and then
the motherboard mount is a new tooling
it could fit Dominus if specified TBD
release stage pricing that was known but
I mean it's you know you look at it and
that's kind of the start and finish to
the case we have small versions of this
that they were giving out they're kind
of neat but yeah so there's slight
different designs for each one you'll
see a few of them in our b-roll shots
and the idea is to make a sort of unique
or sort of one-off but not quite case so
it's still something that they can
maintain from production level but also
very expensive and semi unique for each
order so that's the young not much to
say about that one but the next case is
the Alice which is on the other side of
the booth and that's the $40.00 case
that might interest more of you so the
next one is the Alice this is an in one
case it's a bit cheaper it's gonna be
made of plastic and what's going on guys
so this is in wind I'm so bearded
Hardware ladies and gentlemen
Alice and I'll link him below why not
the Alice is the cheaper of the cases so
this one's kind of interesting it's
compartmentalize layout the power
supplies on the right side of the case
when facing it the motherboard is
rotated so you've got the CPU towards
the front of the case IO facing up and
it can route out the back through the
extended roof of the case it is made of
a cheaper plastic which is why it's a
$40.00 case including the panels
I guess we'll talk about those in a
second the goal of the case where the
goal for n1 is to potentially some I
customize these in the future but that
would change pricing moq gets a bit
difficult with the cloth handling
they're using if you did want to
customize it and fan count is TBD a lot
of this is TBD but what we can see so
far is three bottom fans 120 millimeters
and then there are slots on the top but
I don't see any drilled out holes for
the fans themselves yet the back is also
not finalized so it's it's a prototype
right now this one is not 3d printed
they are unsure on the release date it's
a bottom up airflow and I think beyond
that the only thing to know is that the
finishes the exterior is gonna be a
cloth so it's kind of like a drawstring
bag as Keegan described it earlier and
then also said that when or if they
allow customization the website will
probably be full of waifu's so if you
wanted to get a waifu pc case that i
guess that is eventually in ones
but that's the cheaper of the the cases
that's all the information we have to
last one we're going to be focusing on
is the concept case I'll quickly mention
a few others that are here there's a 309
refresh that one hat is an update to the
307 as a brighter display its using ego
fans uses three of them included same
tooling as the 307 low 200 225 dollars
quarter three for the launch there's a
925 which is a smaller version of the
928 that was the Dominus case we saw at
CES earlier this year the difference is
primarily the size and then the diamond
edge has been removed
that'll be 450 to 500 dollars and that's
within 2019 on Tron fan count formally
to thick aluminum for the 925 and then
the 905 is the one with the OLED screen
and unshrunk costs for that one so the
last ones that ends up in win concept
case we're gonna move over to that one
next the last one is the in one concept
case and for this one so anyone's
looking for feedback it's not final no
release date yet if you have feedback
posted in the comments below because you
have a chance here to influence the
design of the case we have some feedback
I'll get to in a moment but three 120s
in the front there won't be any fans
probably pre-installed and it might be
in the sixty to eighty dollar range if
they exclude the fans but we'll see how
that goes as they near the end of of
tooling to 120 currently installed on
top of the power supply shroud there's
as I said three in the front there's one
120 the back there are no holes at all
on the top of the case so no top
radiator mount it's just a steel box and
steel paneling for everything the front
of it is tempered glass but it's got a
slight spacing on it not not really
enough for air to be frank the bottom
has a filter on the bottom of it on the
underside of the case so it's not like
contained within the case it's beneath
it and that means that where we already
have a low floor for the case it's even
lower so there's really not a lot of
intake potential in the bottle you're
restricting the pressure quite a bit for
those fans that are mounted on top of
the power supply shroud so this is one
we think there needs to be a lot of
improvements on it's really it's it's
not going to perform well at present so
things anyone could do
from our perspective maybe
widen this or space the glass off the
front more you can still have your glass
panel and have some airflow so that
would be done by probably spacing it and
maybe narrowing the glass a bit some
holes in the top for a radiator mount
would be really nice because there's not
a lot of support other than the front
right now and then spaced off more on
the bottom from the feet so it can
breathe through the power splice shroud
and then some holes more holes in the
bottom of the case but that's a concept
case so it's not done and if you have
feedback of your own you can leave it
below to let anyone know what they can
do to make this case interesting for you
and that'll cover the in win booth at
