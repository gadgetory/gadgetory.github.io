from AMD and scott you have some updates
when we talking about today
yeah we're filming this before before
the embargo list but you'll see this
when news goes live and I think we'll
the driver be available on the day that
this news goes live should be yes okay
so what we've got then some updates to
overclocking on AMD video cards that
should actually pretty interesting for a
lot of you and then some some other
tools like you have these three advisors
you call them now and we're gonna go
over those today and show off what all
of the new software and the Radeon Suite
does before that this video is brought
to you by Thermaltake score p3 case the
core p3 is one of the most unique cases
on the market it can serve as an
open-air standing chassis a test bench
in vertical or horizontal orientation or
as a wall-mounted showcase pc the core
p3 now comes with a five millimeter
thick tempered glass panel for its slide
but keeps the front top and back open
for air the core p3s versatility as a
display piece test bench or standard
desktop is reinforced by its price of
roughly one hundred and ten dollars on
amazon you can learn more at the link in
the description below so scott let's
start with overclocking stuff just to to
get the core audience really interested
in what's going on with Radeon update I
don't know do you want to start with its
wat man yes we doing what me that's why
I'm still wat man but it's got an
updates and one of those probably the
fan temperature curve is the most
interesting start with so what's changed
there yeah well there are a number of
things that we changed this is rating on
software adrenaline 20:19 edition I
should say so new driver coming out and
there are a number of different controls
that we've added mostly user requested
and one of the biggest ones was the fan
curve control so you can't control you
know temperature versus fan speed you
can set points and and let it will you
know do what you want instead of in the
past it was a simpler control also for
Polaris cards that have zero fan speed
option you can actually turn that some
of you want more partner cards yep yeah
so previously if you haven't used an AMD
card in a while you've never used wot
man the as I remember the temperature
and fan dial was basically a minimum and
a maximum right right so the update now
is there's actually a
curve where you can set a temperature
and then rpm curve it's pretty useful
and especially for people who are very
focused on silence or something like
that other than that the one that I'm
most interested in was the overclocking
changes so there's a little bit of
change we haven't gotten to play with it
today but when this video goes live
we'll probably have something up and
that was memory timing tuning so I mean
should we how do you want to cover that
you've got a couple options there for
tightening the timings we think yeah
okay so what does that do now well it
gives you the option of going in and
making some changes in tweaking and then
seeing how the performance looks without
having to go through the rigmarole of
modifying biases and things like that
that people have done in the past right
so this gives people an extra measure of
control so they have that and we also
have some auto functions right so you
can auto overclock the GPU where it will
actually run a little test and very
conservatively but you know
automatically set the GPU speed higher
you can auto overclock the memory so you
can hit a button and get a higher memory
clock as well and then there's an auto
undervolt right as well so when are you
when are you gonna use AI that can beat
me I don't know we need to take your
brain yeah and figure out how we can put
it into some AI jar right okay so we get
we get your brain in the jar and get
some developers and yeah we'll figure
out makes it together
so like any auto overclocking feature
we've shown these before in the past and
if you do a true man versus machine
typically for now the human contender
will will win but the goal isn't really
to be better than someone who's a
try-hard right the goal is to be a
decent foundation for someone who
actually doesn't care to do any of that
right so we'll play with that haven't
worked with it today but we'll play
around with it see how well it does I
think my current understanding is some
of it might use a like a lookup table or
something like that for volt frequency
dialing or brightening and then are
there any other changes overclocked
inside we should go over before yeah so
Vega cards we have all the DPM states
exposed
instead of just the topless yes you get
more control over that and then another
thing is you know right now wat man has
been in radian settings for quite a
while and we are actually extending
where you can go and do it overclocking
if you're in a game you can now bring up
Radeon overlay and you get control right
there in the game over all those
settings in addition to that you can use
the AMD link app on a phone or tablet
iOS or Android and if you can get in and
actually control overclocking that way
too so we're trying to give people lots
of choices how they go and testings so
that when you're at the overclocking
competition you can use your phone and
yes next time you see a livestream of me
doing another rip J stream if I'm a I
pull out my phone holding it kind of
down here and the scores are going up
and you know why it is so that's kind of
cool what's also cool speaking of
cheating in competitions is a game
advisor so a game advisor has is it game
advisor or is it just relive it might
just be relived where you can do the the
instant replay now really yeah so relive
now we covered it in the past and
overall liked it at the time we reviewed
it better than shadow play and as I
understand it relive still does not
require an email to use that's right
which well we won't talk about that but
doesn't require all these so it's got an
instant replay feature now is the idea
just I mean you capture the footage and
then you can play it back as an overlay
on top of the game right right so as
you're playing you die spectacularly you
want to see you know the little giblets
bouncing around again you hit the button
and you get a replay or 15-second cam
yes in game you don't have kill cam
right so use that how you will advantage
so that's kind of just into but what we
can't show here today so you've got game
advisor you have upgrade advisor yeah
and is it settings advisors yeah so
let's just let's show a game advisor
first sure okay and these are sort of
preface this by saying these are sort of
higher level functions so you know if
you're really into settings tuning
then may not apply to you but for people
who find this kind of stuff confusing
because they're new to it it could be
useful there right so that's the idea
what the advisors is to make it easy for
folks who maybe are any experience with
tweaking or setting things up themselves
and there's a lot of that with new
people coming into the space from
fortnight and things like that too
so yeah so you've launched Assassin's
Creed I have attempted to do so it's
coming up yeah so you've got Assassin's
Creed open and what are we we're gonna
work with first for game advisor all
right so we're gonna bring it up by
hitting alt R to bring up the overlay
and then we click on game advisor and it
says basically what this tool is gonna
do which is gonna watch as you play the
game in monitor performance through your
system so we hit start monitoring and
then we just play the game and it's sort
of watching your performance as you play
so this the idea here is on your system
is you really play a game as you're
doing things we're gonna look at how how
its performing so it's very hyperlocal
very tailored to your system we'll give
you a readout then of you know how you
doing right so we've got FPS on the top
right and frame time we have a separate
video on that entirely if you're curious
about what that means and I think now
we're just gonna watch scott run around
on a horse for 50 seconds to the next
step so we're pushing the end of the
test period here and you can see we're
about done counting down okay so when
this finish is says your performance
report is now ready so we just pop back
into the overlay go to game advisor and
you can actually get a look at our
performance here as we were playing so
we average forty seven point nine FPS
which is 95th percentile from time to 24
milliseconds and you can see the frame
time plot all the time with a few spikes
and then by percentile and actually you
can grab a piece of it and zoom in if
you want to see just a piece of mm-hmm
the okay and so for frame times we've
got frame interval the period on the
Left axis right now.just time on the
x-axis yeah cool so what do you do from
here this says it has five
recommendations okay it says your your
systems performance in this game could
be improved
so we really are pushing the system a
little bit hard so this this comes up
with some recommendations for things you
could do to improve the performance of
this game on this system and it's simple
stuff you know decrease the image
quality preset from alterna to high or
turn down advanced rendering options
like anti-aliasing any of the occlusion
or reduce the render scale things like
that and once you're done you test again
so you can go into the game you can go
back and you play for changes play again
and insert really what this is is the
Andy Driver team wanted an excuse to
play games for 90 seconds at a time
oh we've always got excuses to play
games but but this is a good one this is
a good one and you know if your
performance is actually very high this
thing will say hey here are some things
you could do to improve image quality as
well okay it's sort of helping people
balance between those two things and try
and find a sweet spot right so what's
what's the next tool you have then okay
well we got to get out of the game here
and I can show you the next one so the
next tool is a related but different
thing called Radeon settings advisor so
you just go into Radeon settings you hit
this little icon appear and it will show
you based on your system's capabilities
some things that you maybe don't have
enabled that you maybe ought to have
enabled in order to get the best gaming
experience so the example here we don't
have enhanced sync and able with a
Meridian Cho and I have a very virtual
super resolution we don't have free sync
enabled right so let's say this this
thing is gonna recommend you turn all
these on you get a better experience
let's say that we decided we don't want
to turn chil'en because we don't really
want to save power we always want to go
as fast as we possibly could I think
chill is great but say that's that's
what I would say right so so then you
can just hit apply and it will go and it
will very quickly okay implement all
those things at once and then you're
good and then the last one is upgrades
right yeah upgrade advisor and this one
is is kind of neat this will show you
and you can see right here you've got
some games installed on your system we
know what they are and we'll show you
how your GPU and CPU match up to the
minimum and required specs
for those games now in this case we've
got a laptop with the Vega in it
so it's actually gonna meet all the
recommended specs of sharing games but
but you can see but if it if it doesn't
if you're running maybe a 270 or
something r7 270 you might see what is a
yellow mark for you meet minimum but not
recommended right and then red is you
don't meet minimum right and you can
actually there's a little drop down here
you can look at the different options
well it only has one right now cuz
they're already in yeah pretty close to
the best thing that you can get so there
aren't any higher obvious standards
right so you've got a yeah CPU drop down
as well not just GPU right cool
okay so beyond this there are other
updates all the software as well and
will have either an article or a video
talking about some of those and planning
to maybe test a few of them like I'm
looking forward to really test in the
overclock and stuff and seeing what if
we see performance differences what kind
of performance differences so check back
for that content if it's already up
we'll put it in the description below
otherwise subscribe to make sure you
catch it and this guy I mean anything
you want to you want to point them
towards the driver like what is what
does this one called again this is a
adrenaline 22:18 edition it's available
at a indeed calm wait time you see this
yeah so grab it if you got AMD let us
know what you think and scott thank you
for joining me
you bet idiot i will see you all next
time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
