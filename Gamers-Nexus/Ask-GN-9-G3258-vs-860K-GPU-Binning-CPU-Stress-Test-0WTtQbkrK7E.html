net and we're back with episode 9 i
believe of ask GN more good questions
this week from the community and as
always if you have questions post them
in the comments below i'll check this
video first when compiling questions for
the next episode so we're going to start
right away with some cpu questions this
one is it's more of a comments really
from Simon white but I wanted to address
it because this isn't replied to
something we were talking out of the
previous video about the g3 2588 60k I
threes things like that so Simon Says
get a penny OMG 3258 and the 390 not the
860 k or the i5 then upgrade the cpu
later to an i5 or i7 since GP is more
important in most games I the GPU is
pretty important in games but I'm not
sure I entirely I'm not sure I would
necessarily take that route depending on
what you're doing so here's the problem
of the g3 258 it's a really good cpu it
does single-threaded things very well
and it overclocks like a champion it's
it's a good cpu and i would definitely
buy it for some builds but the g3 258
really suffers and games like GTA and
you won't see that in just average FPS
benchmarks it'll look better than a is
60 k when you're benchmarking for
average FPS so you have to look at the
one percent and point one percent lows
which is what we do when you're testing
these games look at the frame time is
because the g3 258 really starts to
struggle with heavily multi-threaded
games like GTA 5 and things of that
nature total war games are heavily
multi-threaded so the three to five
eight is good but if you're playing GTA
5 and I have this in some benchmarks on
the 78 70k that and the apu so you can
check that review out if you're curious
but in GTA 5 the g3 258 will get a
higher average fps and going from memory
here i think it was about sony 5 FPS
average with a 980 TI on high / ultra
settings and the 760 ki tested the
previous version of the 860 k was i
believe about 65 FPS
it was there's something about a 10 FPS
average difference between the two with
3258 leading so that makes the 3258
sound like a better cpu but if you look
at the one percent lows and 0.1 percent
lows the 3258 was getting four or
something like it some single digit
number 46 FPS for the lows with the same
setup where the 760 k was running almost
perfectly fine I can't remember but I it
was around 30 or above 30 FPS for the
lows so that happens because the 3258
gets hammered for the thread count it
just it can't survive once you start
spawning more threads and that's Crytek
games will do a lot of that they spawn a
render thread of physics thread and they
spawn a game logic thread things like
that so it starts building threads and
CryEngine specifically the newer ones
can do up to 8 threads and if you're
customizing like the star citizen team
is then it's really just dependent on
the developer at that point so the 3258
does not like that scenario and it won't
show that an average FPS necessarily but
it will definitely show to the Louis and
that translates to more noticeable dips
drops and loss and frames and frame rate
so if you're hitting a for FPS 0.1% low
yeah you're seeing that point one
percent of the time but that means that
every maybe a couple seconds to 2030
seconds max you're going to see some
kind of hit where your game just it
looks like it's stutters like there's a
pause of a very brief period of time but
it's enough to interrupt immersion to
get frustrating mechanically and that's
where something like the 3258 is not
something I would recommend that i would
recommend i guess if my only option is
in 8 60 k i would recommend 8 60 k in
that scenario but if you're going for
more single and dual threaded games yeah
the 3258 tends to outperform just
because games like frequency more than
our detector a lot of the time and the
3258 can push a very high frequency so
especially with overclocking now the
other part that is up for question I
talked about this in the last video is
do you buy a better GP
or a better cpu and i already said this
but i buy a better cpu and motherboard
and then i upgrade the GP later if i
have c because i want a stable platform
that doesn't change i don't want to
change my OS and yeah Windows 10 will
look like it's more tolerant with a
motherboard or platform shift as it's
called if you shift the platform
motherboard and cpu windows 10 will
survive the transfer most most likely
anyway or most of the time at least if
you're staying within in tyler with an
AMD but it's still going to have a ton
of orphaned drivers a lot of registry
entries that are unclean and you're
going to install more stuff and it mess
it messes the OS up in terms of its
cleanliness and that becomes sort of a
burden as the system Aegis that's my
that's my thinking on it certainly the
GPU is generally more important for
frame rate or so in that regard yet it's
it's a good idea to get a good GPU but
that's kind of where I am with that
topic obviously depends on what you want
to do next question is from someone
who's signed off as confused gamer and
they said I have a question about GPS
that confuse me a lot lately I want some
clear answers and said I found out that
less powerful GPS are essentially broken
versions of the more powerful GPS for
example 980 has a GP that just turned
out to be a better turned out better
than the 970 GP while trying to create
the 980 TI is it true if it is how do
they get gps with similar performance
when there's so much chance tied to
create anyone so I think I understand
this question it's definitely a little
more than chance creative on it's it's
very scientific they use going forward
ion cannons will be used to make CPUs
because the process is getting so small
so with the fab process of 8 nanometers
that we value there's a process
technology shift that will be impressive
in scientific and not necessarily chance
but the part that it is chance is the
bidding process so there's a bidding
process it's called with any silicon GPU
CPUs
flash modules on SSDs RAM and all that
stuff and when we say bin it basically
means that the manufacturer or the AIB
that and board provider will request or
actively bin for chips that perform to a
certain degree so the best example is
overclocking cards if you buy an
overclocked in 980 TI or r9 390 X or
whatever the the general difference here
is going to be the chip so the chip in
those instances was binned out actively
because it was able to tolerate a higher
frequency or a higher voltage or
something of that degree it was it was
more tolerant of the additional power
force through it and the higher
frequencies and it was more stable and
so that was selected from the we'll just
pretend it's a conveyor belt right like
an assembly process say say you've got a
conveyor belt of chips they test those
chips as they come through pull off the
good ones put in this pile pull off the
average ones put in that pile all the
bad ones and throw them out or bend them
down to a lower GPU spec and that's
where you sometimes get cards that have
the same physical GPU the same chip but
maybe have some features disabled that
happens with CPUs as well and that's
actually the 860 k760 k things like that
they exist because the IGP is disabled
on the AP the graphics component is
disabled now the part of that is
creating a new cpu skew and part of it
is well maybe the IDP was actually bad
so we don't we don't want to throw away
a good cpu and it's all in one package
so we're just going to disable the igp
and repackage it and sell out of
something else so that's a good way to
reuse components for these manufacturers
and it's a good way to create new skus
at different price points and things
like that the part I think that this is
getting that is the GPUs themselves so
if you look at specs for GPU is what
you're going to find especially on our
website is the the specs sheet will list
GPU and it will say in the case of
Vidya GM 200 GM 204 GM 206 and those are
the Titan x / 980 TI 980 stuff like that
and as you get towards the GM 206 it's
the 960 so that is the actual GPU the
the words 960 gtx 960 or gtx 980 or r9
390 X that is not actually the GPU
that's the video card that's been
branded and packaged with a GPU that is
often labeled as GM 200 something if
it's maxwell or Fiji or Tonga if it's a
md stuff so that's the the physical GPU
you look at the spec sheet you'll see
that and that's what is being bend out
sometimes you'll see the same chip the
same GPU GM 200 is in a few cards you'll
see it in a few cards and the way they
differentiate it is by enabling
disabling or adding features and when
the device was created there might be
new features that came about or if there
was some sort of bidding process or just
to make another skew and they'll change
the core count and things like that so
it's it's not like they're taking
features away from a higher-end GPU it's
just that it's all by design for the
most part I don't know if that helps but
do let me know if you have more
questions about that because it is an
interesting topic to talk about the next
question is from sink vertu who says is
am DS SVR which I think you're talking
about the the DSR equivalent from AMD
which is BS are that's a BS our virtual
super resolution is AMD's vs are really
worth using on at any p monitor why
can't cross bar cards memory go into
dual channel mode so you can use both
cards instead of the both cards memory
inside the first the first question VSR
and dsr will have almost a lost list
conversion of the resolution so
basically what's happening is the game
is rendering out the higher resolution
so if it's using vs RDS r to go 4k on
1080 it will render 4k
and then it's get down samples it just
scales it down to fit your screen so
what that does is it packs more pixels
basically it creates the appearance of
greater pixel density and depth in the
1080p display when you're taking that 4k
resolution and down sampling it so that
assists in things like aliasing helps
get rid of some of that it assists in
general quality or apparent quality of
textures by looking like there's a
greater attention to detail and textures
by nature of a higher pixel density per
you know screen square inch or something
like that so is it worth it it is a big
performance impact to do any kind of
super sizing because you're if you're
going to 1440 or 4k it will render at
almost the exact requirement of 1440 and
4k if you had a real monitor at that
resolution there's maybe a one-percent
overhead but that's around where it is
so you'll take a big performance hit if
you have a high-end dual or single GPU
set up and you're not really using the
extra frames for something if you're
playing a game where you get 100 FPS and
you don't have 120 140 for its monitor
sure it could be worth it why not but
generally I don't use it just because
it's it's extra a big extra impact to
frame rate in exchange for not
necessarily a whole lot it is impressive
visually in some games but it's there's
so many other things I would turn on
instead so just it kind of depends on
the game but generally you're not going
to see a massive difference in most
games and some games like GTA you'll see
a pixel density benefit to the texture
apparent texture resolution I'm using
the word apparent very intentionally
here and that might be worth it but you
really just have to try to see generally
though I don't use it next question John
wako Steve I'm question for you can you
please explain which BIOS settings
should be enabled or disabled when
stress testing a cpu overclocked that's
a very good question which BIOS settings
should be enabled to disabled regular PC
usage gaming in wat after stress testing
so this falls into test method all
which we do a lot of for stress testing
overclocks you generally want to leave
turbo boost on and you can force it to
remain on if you really want to be to be
sure that will make sure that if turbo
boost is being used depending on the how
extreme your overclock is if it's if
it's really high then it's not going to
use because it'll be running higher
natively but you want to leave that set
to a higher setting or turbo boost set
to on so that you can actually force the
frequency to be its highest rated
frequency do that before your overclock
do it after your overclock see if it
crashes because if it's off and then you
start playing a game and maybe turbo be
just ticks on and it wasn't taking on
during your stress test then that will
cause problems potentially so you should
use prime95 or something similar for
stressing the cpu 100% load that's
that's what we use it's debatable
sometimes how did that is in the real
world but generally it will over stress
the CPU to the point where you should
root out any failures or shortcomings in
your overclock so you just prime95 and
you'll want to disable all the power
saving features that's something we do
intel in particular has a ton of power
saving features there's see states
they're called so there's c6 c7 states
like that and those impact things like
the active idle or something called s0
IX it's written which is active idle and
that power state s0 is it means the
systems on as opposed to something like
s4 which means it's in hibernate or s3
which means it's in sleep so s0 IX
active Idol is something you don't want
on when you're you're burning in your
CPU now it shouldn't turn on anyway
because by design it is not made to turn
on active idle and you're under one
hundred percent load but it's good
practice to disable that just to be safe
so disable power saving features turbo
you probably want on for the pre
overclocked burnin to make sure the CP
is good to begin with and trying to
think there's anything else off the top
of my head
I think that's mostly you'll want to pay
attention to fan speeds to make sure
smart fan control is on for the cpu fan
especially and not just set to silent or
something like that because you can do
that through the motherboard as well I
was turn in terms of what should be
enabled or disabled excuse me during
normal PC usage the for gaming II I
would probably leave it the same
honestly I'd probably leave all the sea
States off but that's just me now if
you're doing normal usage you can
definitely get away with reenable in all
those power saving states you'll save a
couple wats here and there especially
when your CPU is active Idol which means
that you're using the computer but it's
it doesn't need the CPU this exact
instant in time so it'll clock it down
and you'll see that reflected in cpu z
or something where you can see the clock
rate you'll actually see the clock rate
fallout plummet to a couple hundred
megahertz so that is a good thing it
cuts off power consumption quite a bit
so you might want those back on
especially if you're actually using it
regularly not using it as a render
machine or something like that you're
using this as a production work machine
where it needs to be extremely accurate
and kind of ready to go all the time
then I would just leave that as disabled
but that should cover the basics for
burnin and overclocking if there's
anything else i'm forgetting that's
important i'll do another video about it
and just we'll just talk specifically
about cpu overclocking because that's a
cool down with two day too last one here
nishant says i'd like to know what's
your opinion on developers making huge
over six to seven gigabyte downloads
from steam necessary even when you can
buy the physical I fear this is going
physical copy of the game because I have
a digital copy of mgs5 came with the 960
but I'm slow internet connection and
can't download it and then Bethesda this
is what Nissan's talking about I guess
that that is a recently announced that
you can buy fallout 4 on PC you can buy
a disk but it doesn't actually contain
the whole game that is an attempt at
thwarting piracy first of all that's not
gonna work haha so I it's I don't
it seems kind of like a wasted effort
but it's that's not going to stop
pirates and we all know that and they
know that so I it just doesn't really
seem I guess it's also on DVD and maybe
they didn't want to do like a blu-ray or
dual layer DVD or something like that
reduce costs I guess so maybe that's a
reason but in terms of my opinion um
yeah I used to a long time ago really
hates team it's not necessarily true now
I'm a little afraid of it but I don't
hate it and the reason that I hated
steam was because I was worried that
valve which was a much smaller company
back then could go under and all my
games would be gone forever and then I
wished I had physical disks and said now
things are different now everything goes
through steam or some other digital
download service it's faster to get the
game in the US normally to do that than
to try out to the store and buy it
cheaper without taxes there's a lot of
good things with digital downloads we
all know this but there's also a lot of
bad things and that's if the service
dies if they go under you lose access to
it if you get banned for some reason
maybe not to your own doing you lose
access if support you get locked out or
hacked and support sucks which it does
on some of these services you lose
access so there's a lot of downsides and
then of course if you're in another
country or if you're just in the
boondocks in the US and you have a slow
internet connection that's a big
downside too because now you've got a
download for a day or more in some cases
just to get your game when you could
have gone to a store 20 minutes away and
come home with it ready to play so yeah
it's it's an interesting problem to
solve and I think the publishers like
Steam and GOG are doing a good job these
days I think the actual publishers or
developers like Bethesda are a little
confused still I'm a big fan of having a
physical copy of my game on a shelf and
i'm also a fan of having it as a disc
that if i travel a lot so if i travel
decide to go somewhere I can throw it in
a bag and install on whatever system i'm
using there so that is kind of a nice
thing to have and if you're in another
country
like I'm assuming this question asker is
them it's your internets a lot slower so
not that the US has fast internet it's
basically a third world country and so
some places in the US with the three
megabit per second internet even down
the street from me that's what they have
in some places so my opinion on it is I
suppose that if you're going to sell a
physical copy of the game just sell the
whole freaking game don't don't put half
of it on there and then force someone to
download the game a lot of games I can't
or total war did this but a lot of games
that I've worked with have been you buy
the box maybe there's a decorative CD in
it and then there's just a steam code
and you activate that and do the rest
from there so that's kind of silly to
it's just like why ah it the industry's
confused they're still catching up I
don't I'm of the opinion that either
sell the whole game as a disc or just
force people to download it and be
honest about it from the get-go that
they're going to have to download
everything now to Bethesda's credit they
did publicly state that a good portion
of the game content would be on the
download only option even if you buy a
disc so they did at least publicly
disclose that which is good that's nice
of them but that's about where I stand
on that I don't have a super strong
opinion on it to go into in this kind of
video but hopefully that that at least
validates some of your own complaints
because I am with you on some of those
so that's all for this time but thanks
again for watching everyone leave
questions below in the comments and
check the patreon link again if you're
not already a backer come back this week
for some more videos check out the store
coast video let me know what you thought
of it its pretty long but maybe just
watch a few minutes if you have some
free time and that is a deep dive on the
game's mechanics so we spent a lot of
time looking at it I thought you know it
would be fun is if we do what we do for
hardware with games and I know that a
lot of game reviews are shorter like
five minutes but I I kind of like doing
the spend eight hours doing one thing
and the game and then review that one
thing very heavily so that's what we did
there let me know what you think that's
all over this time I will see you all
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
