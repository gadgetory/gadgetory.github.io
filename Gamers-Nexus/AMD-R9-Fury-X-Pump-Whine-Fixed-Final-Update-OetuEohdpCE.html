dotnet and today we are revisiting the
AMD r9 fury x pump line issue I posted a
video on this just recently and we
basically analyzed the frequency
spectrum of the pump when it is whining
on it on an open-air bench and our
conclusion was sort of that yes it is
present yes there is a high frequency
higher pitched whine emitted from the r9
3x but it is quiet enough in terms of
the decibel level that is really a
non-issue once you install it in a PC
case which is how anyone will
realistically be using the card so it's
audible on an open bench but not so much
in a case regardless of this Andy has
issued a statement saying that they are
still working toward a fix for the fury
Act so just to bring everyone up to
speed this has gone on for about two
weeks now the initial launch of the fury
ax saw a few media outlets reporting the
issue and the issued a statement saying
that they understood the issue they said
it's not really coil whine it's just
pump whine from the high speed pump and
that they didn't believe it was a
problem especially in a case a week goes
by we tested it as well as a couple
other sites at this time and then they
issued a new statement and it's a bit
longer and they it's sort of everything
short of a recall of the card so if they
are offering a change and I'll just go
through the statement here for you so
Andy says that we have received feedback
during the open bench testing from a
small number of fury X cards and they
say that they emit a sound from the high
speed liquid cooling pump that while not
loud is bothersome to some users while
the vast majority of initial fury x
owners report remarkably quiet operation
we take this feedback seriously as
Andy's mission is always to deliver the
best possible experience to our Radeon
customers so that's the first bit then
they get into the details here and say
that
Andy Radeon r9 fury X customers demanded
that deserve the best
so adjustments in the sound baffling
adhesive compound were applied in the
Assembly of the high speed cooling pump
to address the specific sound a few
users experienced that's problematic
this improved the acoustic
profile of the pump and repeat testing
shows the specific pitch and sound in
question was largely reduced through
adjustments to the sound baffling
adhesive compound in the pump and then
they sort of finalized by saying that
Andy will work with its graphic card
partners that would be sapphire acts
effects folks like that to ensure the
satisfaction of the small number of
initial customers who observed the
specific sound and experienced it as
bothersome so the only thing I really
would roll out here is that they sort of
brought it to the side of it by saying
it is a very low volume of customers
that may be true I know for certain that
the fury X and its initial run was very
limited so it's true in that regard but
really most of the media have reported
the issues so anything in the first
batch I would classify as having this
issue and the retail cards are supposed
to feature a fix but our first two
retail samples did not they saw the
issue so really everything from the
second batch onward if this holds true
should have resolved pitch and frequency
issues I'm not sure if we'll get samples
at that point but certainly for any of
you who buy it please let us know if you
hear the pump whine issue it's very high
frequency it's pretty noticeable but
only an open bench testing so that's all
for the fury X updates check back on the
channel for more posts we have a couple
things coming up including the r9 fury x
review a video on how to make an
esd-safe cable to ground yourself and a
video on how to jump a motherboard
without plugging it into a power switch
that is all for this time check out the
patreon page in the post roll video and
I will see you all next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
