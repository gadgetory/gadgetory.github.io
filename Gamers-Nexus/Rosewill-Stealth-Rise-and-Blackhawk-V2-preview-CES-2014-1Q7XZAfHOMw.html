nexus donna and we are in the Rose well
sweet here at CES 2014 is the end of our
second day of CES and this time I am
doing this alone we are not joined by
boo check the link in the description
below to see some of his videos with the
throne which is in we actually have an
awesome case mod from vs mods where we
did a walkthrough of that but what we're
looking at here today alright we have
three new gaming cases that rose well as
putting out and the first one this is
the one I want to focus on it's a bit
more interesting to me I think it's more
appealing probably for the the mid-range
system builders it is a 120 dollar rose
will rise so this one does come with 1
inch of cable management space in the
rear side of the board we have two two
and a half inch SSD trays back there and
and then stock it ships with 3 120 s in
the front and 1 140 in the rear you can
put in a three sixty millimeter radiator
up here and here so we also have a
modular drive cage set up down here
which can be easily moved if you do want
to use a three sixty millimeter radiator
one note though if you if you move it
you might run into issues with the power
supply so do check on the power supply
spec if you're using something that's
that's a bit larger I guess another item
to note the filters will just pop out so
you kind of you pop it pull it out and
you can wash it that way so we don't
have any screws or anything like that
and for mounting the drives other than
the modular cage in the bottom we have
this big black bar right here and this
does not have any normal drive
scaffolding we kind of you're used to
seeing all the scaffolding and in a case
for mounting multiple drives this is
just one bar and and the drives actually
screw and kind of flat against it
instead of horizontally and what that
does is it reduces the amount of you
know plastic and other materials in the
way of the fans so theoretically we have
better airflow we'll have to test that
and see how it does it can be removed as
can the other drive cage so moving on we
have the Blackhawk v2 of course based on
the original Black Hawk design and we
actually I think we gave away a couple
of these recently so do keep an eye out
for any
events like that there is a 12.5 inch
SSD cage on the back sled and other than
that pretty standard stuff we don't know
the fans back yet we do have a fan hub
here as in the rise and and then pretty
standard mounting couple dust filters
and this one is priced at a hundred
dollars so it does actually I think this
one has this little pop off magnetic
panel up here which I should probably
not be holding too close to my
electronics and there's a an SD card
slot in the top 4 USB 3 as of now normal
power and reset and we've got fan
controller as well and finally we have
the stealth case it is priced at seventy
dollars as of now pretty standard
low-end you know budget range case it
sort of actually reminds us a lot of the
r5 kind of talking about that earlier
there are five of course we liked a lot
check a link in the description below
for that as always the fans back we have
all 120 s two in the front one in the
rear one at the top and of course you've
got plenty of spots for more if you want
to add more and other than that no no
fancy fan hub no fancy trays on the back
because it is a cheaper case but we do
have half an inch of cable management
space on the rear which is enough for a
basic build if you're doing a budget
system they're too simple fan
controllers up here we've got a high in
a low setting on each one so you got two
channels if you want to set the front
and the rear kind of at different speeds
in case you have fans that are varying
rpms so that covers these cases and next
we're going to check out the legacy you
too which is a much smaller case so this
is the last case I want to show up there
are a lot of these tiny cases that rose
well as putting out now check the link
again for all of those in a write-up
this is the legacy you to it comes in
black and silver it's a four and a half
pound pretty light all aluminum case so
it does actually remind me a bit of Lian
Li except much much cheaper it is a one
hundred twenty dollars and for the video
card planets we have two and two hundred
twenty millimeters for CPU clearance we
have 1 75 millimeters which basically
fits every cpu cooler that you would
want to use in one of these and there's
a 120-millimeter fan stock in the rear
we have a couple of standard SSD cages
in the bottom and on the side in the
case finally there is a side window so
if you're building a like say a steam
machine which are pretty popular now you
can pop that in there take it to your
land event pretty cool stuff so as
always we will try to review a couple of
these cases get some thermals online for
you and yeah hit the links for all of
the full write-up details and i will see
you guys next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
