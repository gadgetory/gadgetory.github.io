at Computex 2017 doing something a
little different that's pretty cool
so we're doing some extreme overclocking
with one mr. drew bauer AKA roman a
story working on what I guess CPU
overclocking yeah exactly so today we
will do a CT OC on KP Lake so see 270
board we have Asus apex which is made
mainly for OC and especially x OC so
today you will have your hands on heavy
lake so you can finally do some proper
overclocking so you can do the pouring
with liquid nitrogen I will teach you
what kind of settings you need so all
the voltages you have to set how to set
them at at which moment and yeah we will
try to hit 70 yards with you should work
out yeah here we go cool so we're gonna
give that a shot before getting to that
this coverage is brought to you by EVGA
and a new gtx 980ti sc2 video card you
can learn more on the link in the
description below or check our full
review okay so what's the house keeping
out of the way what's the first step so
the first step would be obviously to
prepare the setup but we did all that
for you already because otherwise it
would just take too much time so usually
you set up the mainboard and you do all
the installations so you can do like
liquid liquid tape insulation or
Vaseline
that should help then you mount the
container then you start cooling down
through light -100 then you go to the
bios to the first settings so we have
already in this board so there's an L M
2 profile which we made last year in
November already before table 8
so from the asus event we saved all the
profiles and made it available available
for everyone so basically everyone you
can just go to the bios lo - LM -
profile pour down and that's it it's
really simple and then once or your
windows there are few more voltages you
have to set like PLL termination voltage
which the voltage to make the CPU a
little bit hotter so you need that to
make a full pot we call it full pot so
cool down as low as possible for that we
need a higher PLL termination and then
you also crank up the cord through like
1.8 51.9 something in this direction
include core clock cache clocks and
that's pretty much it
okay you say pretty much if I we'll see
we'll see how complicated is getting
into it so what are we going to look at
next you're pouring liquid nitrogen
already into the pot yeah because I want
to keep it a little bit colder so
currently we're at like minus 116
the thing is for all this whatever we do
we have to delete CPUs and replace
thermal paste not with liquid metal but
with a conventional a good conventional
paste we cannot use liquid metal because
liquid metal is an alloy and alloys have
like a temperature dependent
normal conductivity right so thermal
conductivity and liquid metal on deep
temperature is really bad so we cannot
use that so that's why we have to use a
normal conventional paste so how does
the conventional phase respond to the
extreme temperatures usually very well
they don't conductivity stays the same
so that's very good but the issue we
have is that you have the silicon and
you have the copper of die HS and they
have different thermal expansion rates
right right so if you cool down they're
expanding or shrinking and that can make
your channel test track recall it
correctly so they basically basically
the thermal paste it's losing the
tension to the surface and if this
happened it's not good so even at like
minus 160 pub temperature you would have
plus 100 degree on the CPU for so that's
one issue we were facing yeah right
where is that and and one other thing
before we really get going I see you've
got a thermocouple here attached
somewhere where is that mounted it's
mounted in the bottom of the sea to
container so we measure the CPU
container temperature some guys also
measure the temperature of the IIHS of
the CPU but usually it's not needed
because cable a can run full pot so we
just pour as low as possible and then
you cannot do anything anyway so it
doesn't matter if your temperature is
showing minus 180 or minus 200 it's as
low as you can go cool okay well as
let's get started all right the first
thing would be to max out the
temperature and for that as I said
before you have to increase PLL
termination so you have to use aces to
movie core that's what we use for
adjusting all the voltages so first step
is to adjust
PLL termination voltage okay so I see a
DMI voltage let's go through all these
rewrite all right so PLL determination
you're saying helps with increasing the
heat of the temperature of the CPU
exactly so basically it increases the
temperature that allows us to go lower
on CPU cotton
temperatures so like 1.5 is what we boot
with you can use up to 1.8 1.9 which is
fairly high usually 1.6 is enough for
tabulate okay
and we're at 1.5 right now on here so
what am I looking for for increment that
it set it to 1.6 okay so one point six I
just type that in yeah
so one point six and then apply I guess
yes exactly
so what else I can also explain some of
the other voltages if you want to sure
yeah so for example you have DMI voltage
here right and it's one point eight five
which is quite high but the problem is
with a very low DMI in voltage you would
not get a display signal so if you would
cool down you would just lose this place
IGNOU so that's one issue we have one
solution there is for this it's using
the VGA on the PCH so you would use it
in the last slot but whenever you want
to run 3d benchmarks you cannot use that
obviously so you have to use the first
PCI Express so then you have to increase
EMI voltage one point eight one five
eight five otherwise you would do this
play signal so that's also very
important voltage apart from that the
top what else you see like core PLL
voltage two point two volts that's the
voltage that helps you also to run
maximum temperature so this voltage
which is used for boots don't have to
adjust that in Windows and next we've
got some more standard one so I see like
DRAM BTT CPU VCC IO yeah I mean DRM BTT
is usually just 50% of DRM in this case
we're running um pretty much XMP profile
nothing that special so it's just half
of half of the 1.5 DRM voltage and the
VTT is 0.75 DRM voltage in this case for
our standards quite low on ddr4 we
usually use 2 volts roughly it's fine I
can tell it's fine for so those memory
ICS and the CPU can handle up it's not
like it's killing the IMC ok cool
because I read that often on the
internet that is killing the empty but
around ok
at least up for this time might be on
24/7 cannot tell that this okay so much
what's next step so CPU VT CI oh and
summation are just needed for the
I see we don't have to touch these in
our case for the next step is that we
want to cool down completely so you grab
one of the liquid nitrogen bubbles okay
so I'm gonna grab one of these like just
this one right here yeah okay let's grab
it on go ahead just pour down okay so
how much my pouring like just one one
great you can start slowly and just just
keep going okay all right let me let me
do this I'm gonna give you the mic yeah
and you can you can talk about what
we're doing and let me know when to stop
alright alright so we're at a moment as
minus 150 right so you just slowly pour
so it's still minus 150 you have to keep
pouring pouring now it's minus 150 5
minus 160 - 117 minus 180 so we're
getting to the spot we want to be minus
190 now we should be pretty much full
pot so now we can pour a little bit more
so we have a little bit boiling in - in
the container keeping the temperature
low
yeah that looks good should be fine so
you can see everything is still running
so if you if you would not have touched
any of these voltages it would
completely free like just a lock out one
more thing I would like to mention is
like some of the special features which
are on the board usually most of the
people don't need those features
obviously but for us you have this our
SVG switch Reserve which we call it this
which is applying additional voltages to
the CPU okay so whenever we do Ln 2 LC
we enable the XOC jumper and also flip
the RSVPs switch and then we can just
run futbal otherwise if you don't have
that you will have a hard time running
this let's say let's define some
terminology so when you're saying a run
for part is it literally just like
filling the power without on - yeah
exactly
footbots just means as low as possible
ok and for these switches here so which
ones really saying like you're matching
with this is the original heat switch so
that's the one we flipped for applying
additional voltages to the CPU so that
helps
cold food especially when you're below
minus 120 if you would not apply it you
might have trouble to boot so it could
be that you have to heat up so like
minus 110 to make it food but if you
flip the resource which you can even put
it at this temperature and I see we're
at about negative 192 right now at least
on the thermocoupler mocap well what's
the what's about the lowest you normally
run is at negative 190 here we would go
as low as possible I mean that you have
to keep in mind that temperature you can
read here is not really correct like
that the keitai probe has a tolerance
the thermometer also so we just know
that the lm-2 is boiling in support you
cannot go lower than this so yeah okay
what's the next step and it or is that
it we do see so it's time to adjust the
CPU core ratios if you catch ratio so go
to first open cpu-z the equity version
so equity version of if you see minted
we disabled some stuff the SPD readout
for example it's disabled so it opens
faster go to CPU ratio into a bovie core
group tuning selector that's correct and
then just keep going
you can start like 60 but 6 g ok so
we're at 55 right now just for everyone
watching yeah 55 when you go to 60 hit
apply a blot is for active for MCB
ratios yeah
also we're running for Korea threat so
it's possible to go hiring clock if you
disable HT if is enable course that was
a lot of extreme overclockers 2 for
validation stuff to show how high you
can talk this if you are not really a
friend of that because I really want to
show what the real CPUs can read off
with all fours in 80 that's why we have
this is easier to relate to exactly so
go ahead just keep clocking up there go
like in a 5 increment like up to 65 yeah
65 should be fine okay so at 65 now
we'll be checking so on CPU Z I see
we're at a 65 hundred megahertz so it's
working so we're still at 1.6 B core so
from that point on you also have to
increase week or two I would say one
point eight eight okay one point eight
eight you just figure that out through a
trial and error
yeah so the thing is whenever we get new
CPUs we have to do a lot of testing and
see what other CPUs react so sometimes
obviously some CPUs die because we have
to check how high can is if you actually
go
what voltages can you apply because if
it's a new generation new transistors
and stuff you never know how they react
with higher voltage for example on a guy
like X we can usually only run one point
five five one point six it doesn't scale
higher but for K be like or especially K
be like X you can run really high
voltages so and liquid helium I think we
used up to two point two volts okay and
it's still fine still fine for lm-2 as
long as the temperature is that low is
fine so what's what's next keep going up
yeah I keep going up let's see how high
we can go where are you expecting it to
fail there there okay so regardless
seventy right now try to do 69 for 69
okay so go down one tick all right so
we're at 6.9 gigahertz now in CPU Z and
it looks like it's holding for now yeah
so try to go as a 70 ratio okay
so we're going for a seven gigahertz
clock on what is the CB 7700 a yeah okay
which we know is one of the the
thermally best CPUs out there of course
not quite house with a lens either right
or at 70 all right so from this point on
I know that if you cannot do 7.1
especially the higher you go the more
difficult it will be to apply a higher
ratio so it's actually also an issue to
apply a higher ratio if you need special
voltages just to apply the ratio itself
so once you hit this region you should
focus on big long ago from this point on
we will start increasing the Rabi tlk
all right it's currently at 100
megahertz and just saw like one point
one are you yeah so we're at 100 right
now right try 100.1
100.1 yeah okay it's a very small
increment yeah okay so apply so we're at
a 70 by 100 point one over you're going
basically up in 7 mega rifle 100 point
to the whole hog we can go okay all
right so we're at a for any one for
everyone watching we're at 7,000 15 ish
megahertz going up so on 100.3 now just
keep going okay just see you how high we
can purchase if you know it looks like
it might have crashed already yeah so
that's pretty much what you can hit I
mean KB legs
7g is pretty much what you can do with
those CPUs is this is already a really
good ship so some of them can only do
like six point six six point seven so
seven goes kept you like pretty good
yeah yes shall we hit seven gigahertz
look it was pretty good up until we
pushed for a like 70 15 or something now
it's blue screen so thanks no so that's
the point of failure what uh when it
feels here you just restart and try
again like chips not dead yet I guess
right no so I mean it's just unstable so
usually it doesn't die for of course on
ecstasy
things like that happen you have to
point it out it's not like everything is
fine right it just happens
but so if we if we have a crash like
this we have retry and safe foot button
which are really helpful for us so if
you hit the white one the retry just
reapplies the BIOS settings and just
tries to reboot for us it's a very
helpful feature so that's what I just
did now I just hit the retry button and
you can see it boots
even as minus 170 degrees Celsius very
cool as I understand you also have a
deal itting kit what do you have for me
for CPU and for a kit so this is the sky
league xD later ok so you can see it
so I also made the deliver for the
normal CPUs and already like half a year
ago
I had access to static-x and stuff and
it was like okay so it's not soldered
anymore
dammit I needed a later and by looking
at the first pictures I was like it's
going to be really difficult because you
have special PCB design which we will go
deeper into in another video I think so
it was quite difficult to make this one
but possible to delete and it's also
necessary very cool so look that in the
next video and as always err bowery he's
got his own channel as well I guess if
people want to find you on YouTube what
are they wish they type in the power but
within 8 yeah right
derp 8 hour ok hello come up if you're
familiar with Bill Joy's coverage on our
channel these two are in a similar class
for their videos so if you want more
in-depth check him out otherwise links
