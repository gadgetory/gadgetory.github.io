nexus dotnet and we are at msi suite at
CES 2014 this is our first official
video at CES this year's are pretty
exciting and i'm joined by mark tran a
marketing specialist at msi so mark can
you give us an overview of what you have
here ok first of all I want to say that
we heard a lot of our fans complaining
that how come you keep released in the
gaming series or until you know
motherboards but nothing new for the AMD
so we heard all the you know the all the
complains and stuff like that yeah no
just kidding but we heard all about the
fans and you know we appreciate all the
comments that they provide for us so
we're coming out with on CES become with
the first time ever the gaming series
for the AMD board and it's for the new
kavari chipset that's coming up the a 88
x we have two small form factor which is
the first one is the standard ATX and
the second one we have is the micro ATX
that we are releasing soon and a major
focus for this of course is for the
gamers people who just like to mess
around with maybe the audio booze or or
sometime like overclocking we do have
the overclocking ability on this one too
and on that note as far as hard specs
for these boards for the ATX board we'll
just go into overclocking since that's
what we're talking about we have an
eight plus two phase power design over
here which is of course more than enough
for am the overclocking especially with
the Kaveri products as far as we know
and we have a pretty standard pci
express layout we have three pcie slots
on the ATX board 1 x16 2x8 and they are
crossfire enabled no sli support we have
a pci slot for anyone who wants to use
that and i think we even have a serial
slot somewhere so if you're using one of
those then you are good to go have the
standard dragon fin heatsinks that msi
is doing with all their gaming boards
they're all black and red branding there
so that is our ATX board the micro ATX
board is a is largely the same except
micro ATX so we do have only two
pcie slots here because you lose one
when you go to micro ATX and the phase
power design is I believe a that might
actually be a 6 + 2 + and so it'll it'll
do a basic overclocking just fine again
the 888 chipset from AMD on kaveri and
and that wraps up our motherboards here
so we're going to move over to the new
290x video card and and it's gotta
hustle 276 THX you want to talk oh and
the 760 ITX it is a a pretty sweet tiny
video card if you want like a steam box
or something just sayin so so let's
check this out so now we are looking at
the 290x lightning also by msi this is
their version of fixing the reference
board design which is of course famous
for overheating massively in producing
95 degrees celsius i believe on the
reference design so here we have the
290x with three fans it has individually
controlled sets of fans so the two
larger fans on the the top and the
bottom holding it this way are
controlled separately from the center
fan and you can set the RPMs for all of
those through their software of course
and as you can see it there is a massive
heat sink with five heat pipes so we've
got four here and then we have one more
on the output side for heat pipes should
resolve a lot of the cooling issues
there is actually an extra power input
there so anyone overclocking and running
out of power and brushing up against
that limit on the reference design you
will have that solved by this extra
power input so that is the 290x
lightning that's that's about all we
know about it now other than I guess I
should mention actually this back plate
is pretty pretty awesome it mounts the
huge heatsink on it so you're not going
to get any bowing of the board of the
PCB hopefully and other than that it's
all standard 290x same GPU everything
that we already know so and finally for
our last video card here we have a mini
ITX 760 that will fit awesomely for any
kind of steam box or something like that
has a cool fan I want to talk about it
has a blower / pushed and design so we
will get a close-up on that and show you
that it has two gigs of ram pretty
standard 760 specs accepted as many I
txo will easily fit and like a
go SG 08 or something like that if
you're building a steam box very
powerful to couple with any kind of apu
or or low end Intel mainstream CPU
something like that so that wraps up all
of our coverage of the MSI products here
at CES 2014 including the 290x the 760
and of course the AMD motherboards and
