finally so now the Vulcan API is
available through dooms settings in-game
that means that it's got OpenGL and
Vulcan it does not run dx11 this is an
opengl 4.5 game previously did it also
run opengl 4.3 with AMD cards today
we're looking at the Vulcan benchmark
performance against OpenGL so we're
specifically looking for scaling on
AMD's cards and on Nvidia's cards I've
only got a few cards tested here we
didn't do the whole bench suite because
really were just looking for kind of
architectural scaling abilities it was
not a full comprehensive bench of every
card out there but we're looking at the
GTX 1080 ci Pascal does the GTX at 972
see how the previous generation maxwell
does and the RX 480 to see how andy does
with the new polaris architecture and
the internally was boasting close to 30%
gain so we'll be validating that here
now one thing that Vulcan does like dx12
they both sort of shift the workload
from the CPU more to the GPU in
instances where it makes sense like draw
calls a draw call is when the CPU sends
an actual signal to the GPU and says
it's time to draw a triangle or
primitive or whatever that is a draw
call that's a pretty abusive process if
you have a lot of geometry on the screen
so for games with heavy geometric
complexity and the x11 all these draw
calls mean that you're really dragging
down one component or the other normally
the GPU is not performing to its fullest
potential because the CP is dragging it
down or something similar to that
so with Vulcan it's the same idea as DX
12 same sort of asynchronous compute is
available and exposed through Vulcan but
it is up to the game developers to
actually leverage that technology so
just like we talked about with Chris
Roberts from star citizen if you just
wrap the game with this API and point to
it it's actually going to have a
negative output then if you build
properly from the ground up and in
software did work to properly implement
Vulcan so let's look at the benchmark
results the table on the screen now
shows the components that we use for
testing this game and most other games
and the next interesting thing to do
would be to pair
these cards high-end cards with a
lower-end CPU to see just how far you
can get with the low on CPU with Vulcan
as opposed to open to Yale but today
we're just looking at GPUs so at 1080p
with ultra settings the GT X 1080 shows
an average FPS that increases 19.4%
from OpenGL to Vulcan and that's a one
39.7 FPS with opengl 4.5 and a 160 8.8
FPS average with Vulcan the GTX 970
actually has an average FPS decrease of
about 1% or mostly the same otherwise
and there's a more variable range in
Vulcan testing than with OpenGL so we're
seeing between 105 and 108 FPS average
and the actual average the average of
all these numbers all these test passes
is 106 dot 9 fps and that's against a
108 fps for OpenGL there are X 480 shows
a 30 point 6 5% increase that's even
bigger than what we're seeing on the GTX
1080 and that's moving from 85 FPS
average with OpenGL to 111 FPS average
with Vulcan so a pretty fair increase
there looking at the millisecond time so
this is the frame time between frames
the average time in milliseconds the GTX
1080s average millisecond between the
frames is 5.9 milliseconds and it's very
consistent so we don't see any
stuttering or spurious frame output the
GTX 970 is at nine point three six
milliseconds again fairly consistent and
the RX 480 is at nine milliseconds and
also fairly consistent at 1080p ultra
four 1440p this story gets a little bit
less interesting on the Pascal and
Maxwell side the GTX 1080 only shows up
5% increase and now that we've kind of
moved into more GPU intensive frame
rates I guess this makes some sense and
that moves us from 109 FPS average to
one 14.5 five FPS average with Vulcan so
5% look at the GTX 970 we have a 0.36
percent decrease but for all intents and
purposes it is effectively identical
between OpenGL and Vulcan we're seeing
69 up
five versus 60 9.25 FPS and depend how
you average it they are pretty much the
same so our X 480 it has a twenty nine
point three percent increase so it's
maintained its increase for the most
part and has a pretty heavy lead here
moving from fifty-seven FPS to 73 to
seven FPS average now the reason I'm
presenting these numbers this way as
opposed to the normal way we kind of do
a head-to-head comparison as I go
through it for this I'm strictly
comparing OpenGL and Vulcan on specific
cards or architectures so when we talk
about the RX 480
having a huge increase of almost 30%
it's still lower performing than the gtx
1080 which should be given the price
disparity and it's still very similar to
the gtx 970 and that it just it really
just means that polaris scales pretty
well in this particular title with
vulcan it does not mean it will apply to
every game with Vulcan as we saw in the
Talos principle for example so it's not
direct head-to-head between cards look
at it as a head-to-head between AP eyes
on specific cards and architectures as
for the millisecond times for 1440p
ultra the GTX 1080 outputs 8.7
milliseconds with a tight range GTX 970
14.4 for milliseconds and there's more
variants in this particular range so we
do see some more occasional stutters but
it's really not that bad and the RX 480
is at 13.5 7 milliseconds and is fairly
fluid at 4k Ultra the GTX 1080s are
effectively identical on OpenGL and
Vulcan there's really no difference here
the RX 480 outputs a twenty four point
seven percent increase from twenty nine
fps to 30 6.15 fps and is still
unplayable you can't play it on either
of these frame outputs with either of
these api's so that don't read too far
into that but the important part is that
this scaling has maintained across all
three big resolutions and we're still
seeing big gains even at 4k which is not
really where the 480 is a good performer
latency on the GTX 1080 is about six
tene 0.9 milliseconds between frames on
average and the RX 480 is about 27.7
milliseconds between frames on average
again totally unplayable as for 1% and
0.1% lows for all of these benchmarks
resolutions they're fairly tightly timed
with OpenGL and we don't presently
measure that for Vulcan because of the
limitations we have with our measurement
tools so as stated the gains for the our
X 480 are pretty large going from OpenGL
to Vulcan the GTX 1080 has pretty good
gains at 1080p you're not really gonna
be playing at 1080p probably unless
you're really desperately trying to hit
144 Hertz or something and then the GTX
970 is basically identical between the
two with our X 480 really being the only
one that outputs a consistent lead at
all three big resolutions that we tested
the thin here
don't read too far into this because
this is one game with one API change or
implementation of Vulcan so as we've
seen in games with DX 12 or the Talos
principle you just because the card does
a certain performance in one game with
one API doesn't mean it will stretch
across all games with that API because
these API is even though they're
powerful it really depends on how the
developers implement them and they've
got a build for certain support list so
ashes of singularity for example
supports MDA and can support really odd
configurations like a 970 with 390 X and
crossfire slash SLI and not every game
will support that just cuz as DX 12 so
the point here is that these numbers are
for doom and doom only but it does look
pretty good for the rx 480 in terms of
scalability with Polaris from OpenGL to
Vulcan 1080 is not bad at 1080p but
otherwise pretty boring for Maxwell from
the limited test run we performed on it
