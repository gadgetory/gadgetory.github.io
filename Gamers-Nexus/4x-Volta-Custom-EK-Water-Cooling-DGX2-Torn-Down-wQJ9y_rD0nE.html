the video goes up probably over but I
wanted to show off some high-end compute
stuff that we don't normally talk about
because there's actually some pretty
cool cooling solutions in here from ek
water blocks and there's of course other
high-end things that are interesting but
this is the old one now I guess DG acts
Station one they have some DG x twos out
here as well that we'll look at briefly
although we have another video on that
either way though what I mainly wanted
to point out was the ek cooling solution
just because it's not like something we
typically see in the enthusiast space
before that this video is brought to you
by EVGA and the X 299 dark motherboard
for the Intel high-end desktop CPUs the
X 299 dark is one of the only
motherboards on the market with proper
vrm cooling we've tested this and found
significant performance increase over
those without active cooling on the BRM
this board was used in our recent
attempt to set a top 10 record in fire
strike and you can learn more about the
x9 and dark at the link in the
description below for the basics this
system is basically assembled chip sold
by Nvidia and its partners like PNY for
example but for the cards in it it's got
4 Tesla V 100's so it is obviously a
high-end workstation system or
scientific compute system and the 4v1
hundreds are connected into an open-loop
cooling solution that's graphics only so
the CPU is cooled independently by a
closed loop as shown over here that's
either one of eks closed-loop or an ASA
tech six gen I'm not positive which
either way that's we can kind of ignore
the closed loop the open loop is where
it gets interesting because there is a
special block in the front up here
towards the front of the system where
there are two pairs of pipes for each
cards they've got in and out obviously
and those are connect to be a quick
release which makes them a little bit
easier to maintain in the field if
something were to happen if one failed
or if you had some kind of issue with
the cooling solution so quick release
setup in the front for the Block in and
out for each one those feed into the
cards obviously and then that gets piped
up here to be a just the block
to a three sixty millimeter radiator in
the top so the 360 right on top has
three EK Vardar fans I believe well I'm
positive and there are three borrowed
ARS 120s each obviously I'm not sure how
fat the radiator is because I don't know
how or if we're allowed to take this top
part off it's probably online somewhere
someone's torn it down by now but the
top part as I understand it is not
officially part of the cooling solution
but I don't know depending on which
marketing materials you believe this
sort of fake fabric up here is a metal
it might be an aluminum for example and
I guess theoretically that breathe is a
little bit it's kind of mesh like you
could get air through there if you
really wanted to theoretically you could
connect to it conductive Li and move
heat through it I don't think that's how
it's being used but I'm not sure there's
the first time I've seen one in person
either way though cool incision from ek
is pretty neat just cuz it's not like
the solutions we see from them in our
line of work and if you're curious about
the rest of specs 256 gigabytes of
system memory has a twenty core CPU in
it one of the Zeon's I think it's a
twenty six ninety eight twenty nine
sixty eight version four and I think
that pretty much wraps up the dgx
station so now we can move on to some of
the newer stuff on the other side of the
booth over here okay so now we've
returned to the DG x2 this is something
we looked at a couple of days ago after
Jensen's keynote we showed the basics of
it externally but now we've got one
that's actually opened up a bit more for
us so we can get a closer look at how
things are working first of all I had a
couple of questions answered from the
first coverage of the DJ x2 if you
remember I showed some of the cooling
solution on it there are copper blocks
along the front in front of the aluminum
fence tax and those copper blocks which
are located up here they're actually
sitting on top of env switches so that's
what those are for
I was curious earlier if got the answer
any switches for those and then these
are just on top of the GPUs as noted
previously the Nvidia embellishments
here on the top primarily for looks but
underneath that you've got a standard
aluminum fin stack standard heatsink
application couple of screws some
thermal paste nothing unfamiliar to you
all ask for the copper block though the
reason they've used it so the NV switch
I don't have an
power output and heat number or anything
like that
however it will get a bit warm by nature
of being cooled by warmer ambient air
relative to itself because the front of
this system behind me over there the
front of its pushing air obviously
through everything it's going through
one fin stack for GPU one second fin
stack GPU 2gb one and then three and
four for GPU two after it goes through
those it's going through the fin stack
the copper one for n V switch at which
point there is pretty warm so there's a
reason it's there behind it this sort of
set of almost golden connectors in the
back is what connects everything
together into the front of this so this
actually closes and sockets for what is
effectively this I guess we'll call it a
blade although I don't let the correct
technical term over here there are a
couple of exposed dies we didn't have
this the other day but we have some
shots of the NV switch which has got the
thinner piece of silicon on it centered
surrounded by a couple of SMDs pretty
simple looking underneath the copper
block and then the V 100 with 32
gigabytes of memory as you can see by
four stacks of HP m2 so that's the main
change there up from 16 gigabytes
previously for the HP m to the front of
the system just has some fans in it
pumps the air through and then back here
we have the power supply so there is
some redundancy and rollover and I don't
know how many can fail not really the
most relevant for our audience but in
terms of the power supplies there are I
think six of them total so it's three on
each side they all plug in it can
consume up to ten kilowatts under peak
performance and then there's some kind
of redundancy rollover failover for when
one goes down if one goes down beyond
that the CPU is a dual socket single
board I think is what's going on and the
CPU trays down here along with all the
memory so there's one point five
terabytes of memory that's all situated
down here and basically 1.5 terabytes of
memory system 512 gigabytes of memory
for he HBM to your cost goes quite high
because memory prices right now are
absurd the whole unit $400,000 as I
joked previously half of that's
holy memory I don't think that's too far
from the truth but either way that's
most of it so I think now you've got
more of an in-depth run-through of
everything I don't think I've missed
much basically the things I was curious
about before again
envy switches up front connectors here
that socket into everything this kind of
clothes is pretty cool mechanism
actually just pushes like that couple
more things quickly so we were given
information on the front and the front
is about 90% air flow going through it
so you lose about 10% air flow he's
stuck an anemometer back there that's
what you would lose on the front special
mesh which is some kind of alloy or
nickel or something on the front so
that's kind of cool
not a ton of blockage looks good all
that stuff and also for the env switch
is the enemy switches produced about 50
to 100 watts of heat output depending on
what kind of load they're under with the
GPUs doing about 300 watts and then the
front of the box is connected by PCIe to
the front of the unit and that's the DG
x2 and previously the DG x1 station
which is more of a workstation
application so that's the high-end stuff
