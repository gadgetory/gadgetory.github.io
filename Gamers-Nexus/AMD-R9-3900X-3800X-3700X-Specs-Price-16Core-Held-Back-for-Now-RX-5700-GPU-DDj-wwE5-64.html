you on Andy's launch timelines and with
Andy's accidental stream of the
rehearsal and latest you of the keynote
itself we can now confirm that our
information in yesterday's content was
correct
AMD ended up reviewing some limited
information on CPU specs like we said
but nothing on the full stack just yet
many of the CPUs have not been unveiled
at this time and deep respects won't be
detailed until later we do have the very
top level specifications on some
products though mostly ones we already
knew but we have some prices
unfortunately but not unexpectedly and
he still hasn't revealed the full
product line yesterday we told you that
the June 10th event part of Andy's next
horizon III opener would have the full
product line up prices SKUs for GPU and
CPU and deeper specifications on what's
going on in the silicon before that this
video is brought to you by Corsairs an
iron claw RGB wireless gaming mouse the
corsair iron claw focuses first on
comfort with its palm grip approach and
also uses a sub 1 millisecond wireless
connection for the PC you can toggle
between wireless and Bluetooth
connectivity making it easy to control
multiple pcs with one Mouse like a
stream PC and a gaming PC the mouse has
10 programmable buttons the pmw 33 91
18000 DPI sensor 3 zone RGB LEDs and
50-million click lifespan for left and
right mouse buttons
learn more at the link in the
description below so we got some
information on the rise in CPUs coming
up and on Navi a very small amount of
Navi information
Verizon unfortunately there wasn't a ton
of detail we got some top-level specs
top-level frequencies and prices and
then any deeper architectural
information we'll wait there's a June
10th event that AMD was pushing hard
during this keynote it's one that we
spoiled or talked about further
yesterday in our initial news recap and
that'll have deeper architectural
information and hopefully some more
information on how the boosting behaves
because with AMD when you have bass and
boost it doesn't mean a whole ton what
we really want to see is further
information on how it behaves under
boost and how XFR behaves with the new
rise in 3000 series so basin boost not
the whole story but let's get into it to
recap the timelines that we gave in
yesterday's content July 1st is the
pre-order date for
CPUs as always we'd recommend waiting
for reviews for pre-ordering products so
July first for that the x5 Sony
motherboards will also be up for
pre-order Navi probably not included in
that July 1st date but we actually don't
know we just knew about the CPUs
yesterday June 10th for the e3 opener
which will have further information on
all the products and then July 7th for
the release date was confirmed by AMD
that's what we said in yesterday's
content yesterday's content was from AMD
but just unofficially so not a surprise
that that was confirmed let's get
through the cpu specifications that
there are a couple of them talked about
but the 16 core CPU was not announced we
do know that it exists and we know that
it will come out but maybe that's
something for the June 10th event this
is more on what we were saying yesterday
where the full product stack won't be
revealed today it wasn't there's still a
lot more out there that wasn't revealed
so we got just a teaser horizon 3000 and
then the the rest of the CPU still
coming let's get through the specs on
what we have so far so rhizomes 3700 X
it's an 8 core 16 thread CPU this one is
listed currently from the video at 3.8
gigahertz 4.6 gigahertz base and boost
the TDP is supposed to be 65 watts there
are some comparisons shown versus
previous generation AMD CPUs at 105
watts where the 3700 X looks favorable
but there's couple caveats there we
might talk about later Cinebench
performance was shown Cinebench isn't
really a tool we particularly like to
use but AMD loves to use it for their
multi-threaded comparisons ideally we
see blender or something like that it's
a real use case anybody did end up
showing blender for one of the other
comparisons later but Cinnabon showed a
plus 15 percent uplift in the 3700 X
versus the 2700 X single threaded the
TDP is supposed to be 65 watts there are
some comparisons shown versus previous
generation AMD CPUs at 105 watts where
the 3700 looks favorable but there's
couple caveats there we might talk about
later
Cinebench performance was shown
Cinebench isn't really a tool we
particularly like to use but AMD loves
to use it for their
multi-threaded comparisons ideally we
see blender or something like that it's
a real use case anybody did end up
showing blender for one of the other
comparisons later but Cinnabon showed a
plus 15 percent uplift in the 3700 X
versus the 2700 X single threaded
workload now that does not mean that
there's
15% increase in for example single
threaded or single thread intents of
gaming or other application workloads so
each application will behave a bit
differently temper your expectations as
always Cinebench gives us an interesting
part of the story but not all of its
just make sure your expectations are or
not too wide reach in with that 15%
number because it could change for games
and things like that we do have some
gaming numbers though Cinebench also
showed an 18% to uplift versus the 2700
acts and multi-threaded workloads so the
3700 experts 27 Rex was the comparison
names he made the most I did show
performance up there at 105 watts for
the previous browser versus 65 watts for
the new processor TDP anyway and there's
there's a little bit of trickery there
because TDP is not necessarily a
one-for-one power consumption but also
the different things like boost duration
will impact how much power is being
consumed to actively and we don't know
the specs like you said yesterday we
don't know the specs on things like
boost eration timelines or the power
levels that AMD is allowing the CPUs to
reach with whatever motherboards they
were testing on so a lot of information
missing there but we do have some basics
$330 for that one the 3800 X is suppose
to be a $400 processor that one's a 3.9
gigahertz base 4.5 gigahertz boost CPU
it is also 8 core 16 thread and looking
at 36 megabytes of total cache for that
anyway we don't know the individual l1
l2 l3 so forth so still missing a lot of
specifications again I said yesterday
105 watt TDP for that one and then the
3900 X is the 12 core 24 thread part we
did not get a 16 core part announcement
today again it exists a hundred percent
we can confirm that it's just we didn't
get the announcement from AMD officially
the 3900 X will run 3.8 gigahertz base
and 4.6 gigahertz a boost so it is not 5
gigahertz we warned about this several
times leading up to the announcement
that 5 gigahertz expectations were
unrealistic and you would be
disappointed if you believe to them you
may be able to overclock
towards that number but do not expect a
5 gigahertz all core out of the box
because it's not happening as AMD has
shown today 3.8 and 4.6 though is still
at least an uplift over previous
generations as for overclocking we can't
talk too much about it yet because
don't we don't know we don't have the
chips in hand but based on and these
previous two launches there's typically
not a ton of overclocking head room
because AMD already bakes in all the
performance that they can they push it
pretty high against the max clocks but
we'll look into that more as the CPS
become available for testing it's just
that the five gigahertz all core number
is one that we don't want people to get
too fixated on just wait for the testing
before we think about that any further
and then 105 watt for TDP as well Sony
megabytes of total cache that looked to
be three total silicon thighs on the
module that dr. Lisa suit all DUP during
the presentation and that one is where
we saw blender tests versus the 99 20x
was the comparison drawn so the 3900 X
is priced at $500 and then further
information on that we'll just have to
wait for the e3 event on on anything
special for what's going on
io will be interesting for that one
memory latency will be interesting for
that one but memory latency is something
in Andy spent some time talking about
during the presentation and it's one of
the areas that AMD is pushing the
hardest for improvement so that I can
specifically as named in the
presentation get uplift in gaming
performance and memory and latency
intensive single threaded workloads so
that's something we should be looking at
in testing the uplift demonstrated there
were some gaming benchmarks shown and
the uplift demonstrated was a 3,800 X
versus a 2700 X specifically we have
some charge from AMD on those so they
showed a 34% uplift and csgo 30% in
League of Legends 20% pub G 21%
overwatch superset dota 2 11% GTA 5 dota
2 is interesting because it is actually
a really it just performs significantly
better on Intel CPUs that game
specifically is much much further ahead
in FPS on Intel CPUs on average and our
testing so to see uplift there to the
extent of 15% is promising for and these
improvements this generation versus the
last and that was 3800 X 4 2700 who
don't have Intel verse a in the gaming
performance numbers from this
presentation we did get some production
workload performance numbers tonight
well not really numbers but comparisons
of blender and then the there was one
more comparison for Navi mixed with
risin 3000 versus Nvidia versus
until 9000 with a 3d mark PCIe bandwidth
test and this one we do want to warn you
that if you watch this text out of
context or you don't listen carefully to
what Andy said during it there were some
careful words chosen it is an incredibly
misleading demonstration because you
have two mismatched system
configurations so you're not literally
comparing the head-to-head GPGPU CPU CPU
you have two different components
completely different products see pieces
of silicon in there versus each other
and the the bigger point of concern is
that it's specifically built for PCIe
bandwidth testing and that doesn't
necessarily and will not translate into
a one to one performance uplift for PCIe
Gen 4 versus three in gaming we've done
these tests in the past with John three
with by 16 versus by 8 and you can see
the the limited games there first is
something like a PCIe bandwidth test
that's made to hit the PCIe bus so that
is one of the the points of concern is
AMD shows a you know they talk about 25
fps on the AMD system vs. 14 FPS on the
Intel system and then where it gets a
little bit messy is because you're
seeing a 20 atti on one and then an Rx
5700 on the other where the 5700 had
previously been compared to the RT x
2070 so it's clearly meant to be a 20 70
competitor not a 20 80 TI competitor but
because you're seeing the two matched in
that test definitely a lot of people are
going to walk away saying the RX 5700 is
as fast or faster than 20 atti in fact
and these showed that in that comparison
the PCIe bandwidth uplift was up to 69
percent performance increase from what
they were saying that may well be true
and the PCIe bandwidth test but please
do not walk away from their presentation
thinking about an Rx 5700 is going to be
70% faster than an RT X 20 80 TI and
something like your average game in
workload you will be extremely
disappointed because we're not saying
the 5,700 won't be good or competitive
but 70% please don't expect that that's
not happening any company would be happy
to get 70% uplift over a flagship in one
generation so that's it's not like that
anymore
there were really really limited pieces
of information given on the rx-7 hundred
and five thousand series for Navi GP is
there's really not a lot to go off of we
know that our DNA is the new gaming
architecture not a hundred percent clear
on how much of it is comprised of GCN
which is just completely moving past GCN
Andy did use the phrasing we love GCM
dot dot but which is normally an
indication that they are moving on from
it
they in AMD noted that it has increased
the number of instructions per clock
which is not particularly surprising new
cache hierarchy not surprising no
details on what it is higher bandwidth
the details on what it is and AMD also
said they want to do more which is not
surprising 1.5 X performs per watch not
sure what the 1.5 X is multiplying but
probably Vega or something like that and
then they also showed an RX 5700 again
versus 2070 and strains brigade and that
was details on the graphic settings used
so can't really draw any conclusions
there July release date for the RX 5700
and then June 10th
once again spoiled by Andy during this
part of the presentation for more
information on the RX series as for
motherboards ace you said it has 30
motherboards coming out 4x 570 which is
interesting because it shows an
investment by the motherboard
manufacturers in the new your eyes and
products so first generation Xen you
didn't really see that kind of
commitment from the mother word makers
and now they're seen enough sales volume
and Rison that the manufacturers of
boards are starting to support AMD more
directly so 30 boards from one companies
quite a lot 56 motherboards at launch in
total and not all 30 of the AC sports
will come out at launch but see the
ecosystem is much wider now than it was
with first gen and second and 1.5 gen
and is indicative of improvement in rise
ins market share as we've shown in the
past as well PCIe gen 4 and X 5 is how
many weren't really discussed too much
in the presentation but we have
information from the from partners of
AMD off record and so some of that as
we've already said and he didn't notice
note this in the keynote
unfortunately because it is a detailed
spec but PCIe gen 4 lines off the CPU
will be 16 to the GPU and then for
additional PCIe Gen 4 lanes from the CPU
- and I'm - device again what's that's
our information collected low
we at the show so you'll want to check
the motherboard manuals to make sure
that I'm not too device lines up with
the CPU if you want to use the CPU lanes
for it
X 570 chipset is all PCIe gem 4 lanes
the later chipsets be 550 will be this
is again our information not official
from AMD so we've this this bait change
but it's accurate at present because it
comes eventually from AMD b5 that they
should be next year and that will have a
less of a focus no real focus on Gen 4
so that motherboard manufacturers can
cost down thirty two hundred megahertz
for dual stick memory support with the
CPUs and then again not revealed by Andy
so missing information still about 20
667 megahertz for four dimm from our
sources at the show general CPU
information AMD noted officially two
times floating-point capabilities two
times cache size reducing memory latency
to focus on gaming performance an IBC in
Xen to show some uplift beyond what Andy
was expecting so that should recap the
entirety of the keynote and again we're
missing a whole lot unfortunately but
it's not that surprising so we'll just
have to wait for June 10th for further
architectural information beyond that we
have a lot of XY so many content coming
up at the show so check back subscribe
to catch all the motherboard recaps and
go to store documents access net
supports directly thank you for watching
we'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
