Logitech before the beginning of PAX
Prime 2016 which we'll be covering by
the way these are their new products
that'll be at the show I've got a
keyboard a mouse and a headset and it's
called the prodigy line so the idea of
the prodigy line is basically to target
gamers who don't necessarily call
themselves gamers all of the things are
pretty much $70 with one exception and
before we get into the specs on these of
this content is brought to you by
iBUYPOWER and their new element gaming
PC which has tempered glass for the side
window LEDs and a front glass window as
well so starting with the keyboards
because a little simpler to go over this
is a membrane keyboard it's not a
mechanical keyboard but it's a bit
different so if you've ever used
Logitech membrane keyboards the g11 kind
of comes to mind is one of the first
ones that I used the idea here is that
it's got a tuned force profile so they
brought the actuation depth up a little
bit and it's somewhat very loosely
mimics a mechanical keyboard if you're a
mechanical keyboard enthusiast and
that's the only thing you're going to
use you're still not gonna like this but
as a mid point for folks who don't want
to invest in a mechanical keyboard
that's sort of what they're targeting
now we will be reviewing this so wait
for the review before purchasing as
always but a couple interesting points
if we take off the key caps you'll see
underneath there's actually a lining
like almost a mirrored lining on the
wall for the switch housing and that
actually helps to direct the light up
and out and reduce light bleed out the
side of the key gap and force it all out
through the letters the legend on the
key cab itself which makes sense an
interesting idea and it follows the
Romer G design approach for the G 910
that we looked at previously so the
keyboard is the prodigy g2 13 it is a
$70 keyboard membrane with the higher
actuation depth and it's got no end key
rollover but there is anti-ghosting so
there's an C Gaussian matrix which
mostly helps with that issue a double
tap shouldn't be as much of an issue as
with other sort of non-gaming targeted
membrane keyboards Microsoft keyboard
something like that Dell keyboard it's
also a 500 Hertz polling rate so unlike
the two examples I just gave sort of
cheapo Microsoft and dell keyboards this
will pull a bit faster those tend to be
considerably slower in the 250 Hertz
range or so this is 500 Hertz so the
only other thing really to mention about
the keyboard RGB lights you can work
with them through LGS as usual it's got
a sort of waterproof marketing we
haven't tested that I probably will just
because it'd be fun but what we've read
from Logitech is that it is waterproof
up to about 60 milliliters of water from
what they've tested and other than that
as always just wait for the review and
will let you know if it's worth buying
because obviously this is a very
competitive market so 70 bucks you can
get a lot of mechanical keyboard 70
bucks the Poseidon's ii is one that we
certainly liked and there's plenty of
tkl options as well you prefer that this
is not tkl it's a full keyboard it's got
media switches up at the top so the
circle buttons are and then other than
that I guess RGB LEDs would be the main
selling point that kind of pushes it
beyond what might be had competitively
at this price range as for the mouse
there are two mice that have just come
out from Logitech this one we talked
about in a previous video pretty briefly
this is the G Pro Mouse we won't talk
about that again here but it's another
$70 Mouse they are targeted at sort of
the eSports player type of thing very
simple Mouse but the same pmw 3366
sensor as and most other high-end mice
at this point that's not the new one
today though the new one is the g4 o3 it
is also a prodigy line product this
mouse is pretty simple in terms of
everything really it's got only it's got
two side buttons they have a dpi switch
at the top another button there and then
LMB R&amp;amp;B and the middle mouse button so
that's really all there is to it in
terms of the button input they advertise
that there are six programmable buttons
which I suppose is correct
but of course in that regard you would
be reprogramming sort of your three
primary buttons you could do it though
do it through LGS if you wanted to but
would you I don't know either way
there's at least two actual programmable
buttons that you would probably program
plus a dpi switch and then your normal
inputs in terms of the actual specs is
another pmw 3366 sensor just like the g
pro and a lot of the other - we've
talked about recently there are two
models of that mouse the wired one is
$70 Wireless is a
and the wireless mouse uses a lot of the
same components and design as the G 900
that we recently reviewed and actually
liked a lot that received pretty high
praise from us though it was obviously
very expensive at the times $150 so that
kind of eliminated a lot of the market
but the same idea with the components
2.4 gigahertz frequency for the wireless
if you get that model and it still
transmits it does a 1 millisecond
response so it's another 1,000 Hertz
polling rate as on pretty much every
Logitech mouse we've looked at recently
Corsair mice all these gaming rights are
at that range now for the most part for
both mice there's no smoothing or
filtering they have a 200 to 12,000 dpi
range which gives a good amount of
incremental tuning if you really want it
to go that high or that low v toggleable
DPI settings through the button on the
mouse and it's got a 10 gram weight in
it so the weight of the wired version
without the cable is 90 grams you take
and I've just not that it really matters
where we did file its head it is
actually that weight you can take the
weight out if you wanted to get it to 90
or you can put it in together to 100
grams for the wired version the wireless
version is at 107 grams you can increase
it by 10 grams with the weight if you
cared not something I really think
weights are pretty cool for mice but not
so much anymore I actually prefer the
the lighter ones out but you could do
that if you wanted to similar respect
and durability to previous minus 250
kilometers are moving on the feets the
Teflon feet and 20 million clicks on the
keys as for the headset this one right
here another $70 option so basically
Logitech they're kind of the plan for
this generation was everything must be
$70 except the wireless mouse I guess so
this is also 70 bucks makes things easy
I suppose it's pretty lightweight we
haven't really done any durability
testing or anything like that yet but
you know not not too bad for $70 headset
does have a fold-out microphone it's
using 40 millimeter drivers they are
neodymium drivers they are not the pro G
drivers that we saw with the G 633 and G
933 headset so these are actually
different drivers than those you would
still need to go to those if you wanted
to go for something a little bit higher
and then it does fold like most other
headsets at this point do so this would
be competing directly with something
like the HyperX cloud series headsets
they've got that cloud revolver now and
the cloud - that would be the direct
competition - that we've reviewed the
cloud headsets and generally actually
liked them pretty well depending on what
you're doing with them so that would be
the next one to look at and we'll be
reviewing that shortly as i've said hold
off on the purchase we'll look at it let
you know what we think other specs for
the headset just reading off the sheet
here it does have a sensitivity of 90 DB
SPL the microphone uses a four
millimeter driver not really
particularly special or bad and in
either way we've had some issues with
logitech microphones in the past but it
seems to depend somewhat on on what unit
you're testing the g6 33 we had issues
with 390 33 wasn't as bad as that seems
more like a manufacturing difference
there
frequency response with mic 50 Hertz 20
kilohertz frequency response of the
drivers for the ears is the standard 20
Hertz to 20 kilohertz range and then
everything else we'll talk about in the
reviews as they roll out so that's the
new Logitech line I've wanted to do a
quick video on it because we're gonna be
have packs they'll be there will
probably look at it in more depth there
and talk to some engineers hopefully
maybe get Chris page to talk about the
mouse if he's there again but as always
