Ripper and Vega event with six
motherboards for Andy's thread river
processor that is the X 399 socket only
two of them we saw previously at
Computex and then the other four are new
to us so we're going to walk through the
feature set on these boards go through
the basics from what we can tell by
looking at them anyway and then as
always you can find more details on the
rest of this event and its coverage in
the link in the description below before
getting to that this content is brought
to you by the Thermaltake flow RGB
closed-loop liquid cooler which is a 360
millimeter radiator plus 3 120 fans that
are RGB illuminated if then we'll take
it ring fans at that this is a 4.5 done
8 attack pump which is one of the faster
pumps you can learn more at the link in
the description below we're starting off
with the MSI gaming Pro carbon board
this is a branding they've had for a
while now and it's on the x3 99 model so
starting with this one a few main things
to point out these are eight dim boards
so you can have eight memory modules
they are quad-channel for this platform
and then of course the tr4 sockets in
the middle takes a lot of space but it
also has a big no-go zone so the
motherboard vendors know where to keep
out is to keep out zone to prevent
potentially any issues with coolers
colliding with memory things like that
so that's all standard stuff but what's
interesting here is you've got standard
24-pin power over there of course but
then there are two eight pins some of
these boards are eight plus four this
one is double eight and in addition to
that the vrm design and layout we don't
have a way to take the heatsink off
right now today but it looks like an
eight phase-- I want to say eight plus
three it might be either an eight plus
three or it might be a bit different
than that I can't really quite see the
MOSFETs but that's what we're looking at
on top of the vrm is heat things I
really wanted to point out so MSI we've
kind of beaten up over there at gaming
Pro carbon heat sinks in the past which
is just a giant block we went on no fins
and sure aluminium will cool better than
no aluminium but a giant block doesn't
really do anything for you this is
actually a finned heat sink so well done
amis I thank you for taking initiative
and being one of the only motherboard
any factors in the last couple months to
actually do a property thing so it's got
a thin stack here you can actually get
some cool answer there there it is
actually a pass through fan on this
center area too so good to see that like
to see that more from other
manufacturers especially following X 299
and then for moving on to the the PCIe
slots want to point this out as well so
these are actually really well spaced
for this time a lot of these boards
where you have tons of PCIe slots they
tend to collide with one another once
you start using two slot or higher cards
which are most cards on the market
this one's space in a way that you can
do dual slot dual abdul-allah
all the way down and the only time
you're going to run into an issue is if
you have like a 2.5 slot card or reading
this 7 segment display in the bottom
corner if you have a card in that bottom
slot because you're going to cover that
and that's a bob viously fairly critical
piece of hardware so you don't to cover
that so I can probably position a bit
better but that's what they've got on
there and then under each or between
each of the slots is an m dot 2 space so
there are 22 sixties on either side here
and a 20 to 80 form factor right there
and then the ones with the 22 60s have
the PCIe smaller slots and then as far
as wiring let's see what that looks like
so the top PCIe slot is hardwired for 16
the next 16 is down here that would be
the third slot and the other two are by
8 so 16 by 8 16 by 8 is the
configuration and thread ripper supports
60 PCIe lanes not counting the 4 going
to the chipset or counting before going
to the chipset 64 total so they're
really just showing off at this point it
is 16 32 and another 8 so you have 240
another 8 so you up to 48 and there are
3 M 2 slots as well which you actually
populate so that gives an idea for the
PCIe laying count actually there's
another header I didn't notice till just
now this is a 6 pin I am pretty sure
yes PCIe power so that provides extra
power to the video cards how useful that
is I'm not sure we'll talk to build joy
but I think that caps most of stuff on
this board it's got RGB LEDs as you can
see by the cables running to the i/o
cover and the audio zone and then other
than that we've got 1 2 4 6 8 SATA 3
ports
two USB 3.0 headers pre overclocked
reset and power buttons of an anon board
USB slot as well if you prefer those to
the backside but let's move on to the
next board now I think we're going to
look at the asrock X 299 Tai Chi next so
here's the asrock X 399 Tai Chi this
will be one of azar Exploud ships as it
normally is of this branding and this
board is another one so it's again 24
pin but then eight pin over here and
then hidden up here is a four so it's
eight plus four for the EPS 12-volt
power that's something we've seen on
some 2 X 2 9 9 boards as well and I'm
thinking that 8 plus 4 is probably what
the thread Ripper reference requirement
is and to the people who do double
eights are just going above and beyond
for overclocking or whatever whether or
not it's actually necessary again eight
dims again quad-channel
big thick block of aluminum on top of
the vrm which covers both be chokes the
inductors that is and the FET and it
looks like another see one two three
four five six seven eight looks like
another eight phase-- I want to say I
can kind of see the MOSFETs in there so
I'm going to go ahead and call that as
maybe another eight phase-- and then
other than that typical shielding for
everything it I think there's an LED
under this chipset cover chipset heat
sink and then spacing for PCIe slots is
again double spaced they've got room for
quad dual slot cards and then once again
we are at by 16 by 8 by 16 by 8 for the
PCIe lanes wired to the PCIe slots
that's what we have there additional
features include the segment seven
segment display again kind of obscured
by the fourth slot PCIe device and next
to that there's reset and power button
on the board always nice to have em dot
two devices one two three right there
with it looks like one of them being a
20 to 80 at least so that's what we have
for PCIe devices this one has a lot of
fan headers as well I'm seeing up
there's a ton of fan headers on this so
there's one in here hidden in this slot
is one over here there are two fan head
right here soar up to four and then
we've got another one down here sort of
five I don't think the sport is the one
with the most but it has a good amount
see any other items of note on this
board I suppose we can go to the i/o so
is U dot to support which getting a bit
more popular kinda at the tail end of
where it needs to be two four six eight
SATA three slots and then six pin power
for PCIe power as well which seems to be
a trend so far starting with the Amazon
carbon but we can move on now to the
next board which will be the asrock
fatality X 399 professional gaming so
here's the next one fatality
professional gaming pretty similar
design if you recognize it it's because
we just looked at it let's add I cheat a
lot of the stuffs the same differences
are in the branding so right here is
different I'm not sure if the MOSFETs
are different we haven't opened it up -
or taking off the heat things to find
out just like the last one we've got a
heat pipe routed for the cooling
solution which is just two large
aluminum blocks heat pipe between and
cooling for what looks like I don't know
about the same size be around probably
saying via Rama's last board but we'll
find out more later
beyond that more well spaced PCIe slots
thank you to the manufacturers for
finally doing this so four slots again
they are wired sixteen eight sixteen
eight and then other than that
everything really looks pretty much the
same on this board there's fans lots are
the same you got to again Sam SATA 3
slot count same PCIe extra power header
and on an 8 + 4 4 the EPS 12 volt with
differences being things that we can't
see or can't quantify right now but
aside from the heatsink cover that is
where the chipset so that's the fatality
board the pro gaming a couple more to go
through the next one that's new is the
gigabyte Horus gaming 7 which is spelled
incorrectly on this title card so this
is the Horus gaming 7 and this one not
sure if this I don't think this is going
we saw at copy text either way it's a
lot more developed if it is a lot of a
couple different things here's they've
gone with the full PCIe and memory
reinforced slots which is partly
partly a looks marketing thing partly a
function thing so it's M quad-channel
they're LED illuminated for all eight
LED illumination on some of the other
devices on here including PCIe I think
then PCI use spacing is not quite as
good on this one but you could do still
do the same pin so one two three four
five PCIe slots with one dead center
here that you're obviously not going to
utilize if you're doing a bunch of dual
slot cards and these are wired 16 8 4 16
8 with 220 280 m dot two slots here what
looks like a twenty to sixty over here
that you can remove it's part of the
heatsink so it kind of blends and then
for additional features they are running
or core features even an eight plus four
EPS 12-volt the ton of fan header is
actually more than the previous boards
one two three four five pwm headers in
the top right in addition to one hidden
down here sort up to six PWM and that's
not one right there I think that's a two
more eight PWM so at least 8pw hanpan
headers on here so a lot of fan headers
and then on board USB for
troubleshooting diagnosis and another
seven segment display with pretty
standard other features two four six
eight SATA 3 slots pretty much wraps
that board so you got two left which are
really just going to refresh as what we
saw at copy text here's the prime X 399
board the last one is the zenith which
we showed at Computex
you're curious about the zenith that
one's not really changed so you can
check our Computex coverage for it but
the prime board shown here is new to us
so heat pipe design on the heatsink the
heatsink routes over here for the vrm or
star the V the memory vrm and then over
here for the core v RM and then
everything else is eight plus four a
couple four pin headers this board looks
a little more better than the other
that's because it's an e ATX board it is
actually wider so stuff is spaced out
more PCIe slots you have really three
that are primarily usable they are the
reinforced ones so top center bottom
with spacing or with the assignments of
sixteen eight sixteen eight and a four
right there
yes a four right there and then actually
a pretty massive heat sink under here
which is that a fan there's a fan in
there
look fans on these other ones I think
it's the only one with a fan on it now
both ACS boards have bands on them right
down there it looks like a little 60 mil
or 80 mil of 1080 it's a 60 maybe a tiny
fan there 40 Hana and that's just
sitting on top of the i/o rear i/o and
it bridges into the memory heatsink
which is of course connected by heat
pipe to the core vrm heatsink so that's
actually really cool Asus Asus has gone
with active cooling on their V RMS for
this board maybe that's what a I don't
know that's what their Baro is looking
forward to the new PRM design because
it's actively cooled so hard to screw
that up but yeah so this is the prime X
399 we've covered pretty much all the
stuff here to see you to 6 SATA 3 slots
from USB 3 all the standard features
last board here is the only showed at
Computex which is the zns board and this
is their flagship 4 X 399 it's got
chipset cover here LEDs and then
everything else is just a beefed-up
version of the prime so - 8 pin power
headers looks like the same BRM the same
cooling solution a bit different cover
panel with an OLED readout right there
and then everything else PCIe slots are
a bit different
yeah PCA is a bit different I'll
reinforced 4 of them and they are 16 8
16 8 with a 4 there and other features
you dot 2 6 8 a 3 and nothing else
special that I'm seeing right now I
would have to actually test it oh you
know there is one more things the dim m
dot 2 slot here so that you can mount m
dot 2 devices into a memory then
basically so cool stuff that's all on
the 4 dip switches will cover this stuff
more in person once we've got the
shredder for sample and the board's in
hand to test maybe have build Zoid look
at a few of them for the vrm analysis
