Nexus dotnet and I am back with another
game benchmark this time we tested Far
Cry 4 using our usual suite of video
cards on all the settings available
including the special Nvidia setting now
Far Cry 4 like Assassin's Creed which I
benchmarked last week is made by Ubisoft
and as such it is made in partnership
with Nvidia so Ubisoft has partnered
with Nvidia and the two of them work
together on integrating special graphics
technologies that are either not
available to am the users or less
optimized for AMD users as a result of
this partnership in theory Ubisoft is
still testing for AMD cards but will
test whether that's true or not in the
benchmark going forward here in a second
before getting to the charts for
performance of all the various video
cards I wanted to talk about some of the
technologies in Far Cry 4 first of all
there's a special Nvidia setting that
enables effectively ultra high settings
or ultra settings except with soft
shadows HB ao+ and with TxAA
and what those things are first of all
TxAA is a temporal based anti-aliasing
solution what that means is that it is
time-based it looks at the previous
frame that was rendered and it looks at
the current frame being rendered it
compares the two of them by sampling all
the pixels that it wants to sample and
then it basically decides okay this is
how the frames should look in terms of
the anti-aliasing around the borders of
all the models and objects and it sort
of makes movement of the camera a little
bit smoother so you don't get this odd
flickering effect on objects like hair
or fences or other sort of skinny things
like signposts when you move the camera
with some types of anti-aliasing and
you'll see those pixels flicker and they
they look more you can see the square
pixels around the edges so the TxAA
eliminates a lot of that and that is
only available to Nvidia that is one of
the technologies in here another one is
soft shadows similar to pcs s and
Assassin's Creed or percentage close
your soft shadows it's basically the
edges of the shadows are a little bit
softer they're not as hard go figure
right from the name and all that means
is that the light sort of is more
natural in its interact
with the border of the shadow when the
shadow is bordering the the underlying
object that it's shading so that just
sort of makes it look more realistic
because shadows don't normally end in a
hard edge they sort of fade away and
that's what that does then we've got the
enhanced cadres that's another feature
of Far Cry 4 is graphics engine this is
available to Andy as well but it works
much better and more smoothly on NVIDIA
cards
the enhanced cadres are basically your
usual volumetric particle effects god
rays that cast a light from the Sun or
another source down through fog
low-lying fog in the streets or clouds
or trees really anything think of go out
you know think of outside that thing out
the window over there I'm pointing you
can't see it but there's a theta out the
window called outside and light goes
through things like leaves and given the
right conditions you can sometimes see
kind of a a dusty glow coming down
through the the leaves and that's what's
generated in Far Cry 4 with enhanced god
rays so that's one of the major
technologies now in terms of performance
the GTX 980 once again rules the day of
the charts the game actually uses about
3.5 gigabytes of video RAM if you
present four or more gigabytes to the
game so that's a step in the right
direction for consuming a lot of video
ram unfortunately it only uses about 1.6
to gigabytes of system ram that's
probably an artifact of the conversion
from consoles where all the memory is
shared so you will get use of higher
frame buffer capacity video cards like a
4 gigabyte 980 or 4 gigabyte 290x or
whatever and that shows in the in the
benchmark charts so with ultra we run
about 80 FPS with night the 980 using
ultra settings at 1080p and then the
780ti is about 75 780 68 and so forth
the 290 X is 66 now although that 290 X
is a perfectly playable fps at Ultra it
is not actually playable and here's why
and video cards are optimized really
well in this game you can play far cry 4
on a 750 Ti with medium or high or
medium high settings and you will be
perfectly happy
at 40 FPS it will look fluid even with
when you're used to 60fps and that's
just because it's optimized so well with
AMD cards they're so horribly they're
just a stutter a lot the frame is
constantly dropping an FPS so you kind
of end up with these really jarring
stutters when you Pan the camera left to
right it looks like you're losing huge
chunks of frames and almost like it's
repeating some of the previous frames
which is called stuttering and that is
an issue only on Andy cards with far cry
4 Nvidia does not exhibit it it's
perfectly fluid on Nvidia and I think
that's probably an artifact of Ubisoft
partnering with end of it with Nvidia
looks like they didn't even test for AMD
so hopefully a patch will fix some of
this I ran the day one patch and the
most recent 14 11.2 catalyst beta
drivers and it still did this so no luck
so far if you own AMD I would say hold
back on your purchase until Ubisoft
announces a fix for these issues because
it is completely unplayable even on a
290x at 66 FPS just it's really jarring
to play that said on very high settings
from ultra you can see that the
performance is still very good it jumps
up about 10 FPS for some of the
mid-range devices the 270x is now in the
60 FPS range so it actually jumps 20 FPS
between ultra 2 very high and then
moving down to medium we've got the 750
Ti suddenly sitting in the 60 FPS range
very definitely playable at that setting
with the 750 Ti and then low you can
kind of see those settings and check the
link in the description below for all
these charts this last one is the Nvidia
special setting that is only available
on video and video cards and check the
link description below for the full
review of or the full benchmark review I
should say of far cry 4 there is another
video on my channel go hit the gamers
exes channel linked below and you'll
find what the game looks like at 1080p
at 60fps so that will give you a good
idea of what we're dealing with here in
terms of graphics technology that's all
for this video please subscribe if you
like this video like it it really helps
us and I will see you all next time
