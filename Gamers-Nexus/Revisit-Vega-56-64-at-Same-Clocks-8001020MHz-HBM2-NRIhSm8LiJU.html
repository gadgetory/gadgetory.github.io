Vega at this point but wanted to explore
shaders at least one more time prior to
moving on to other tasks in our initial
AMD shader comparison between Vega 56
and Vega 64 we saw identical performance
between the cards when clock matched at
roughly 1580 to 1590 megahertz core and
945 megahertz HBM 2 we're now exploring
performance across a range of frequency
settings from 1400 megahertz core to
1660 megahertz core and from 800 to 1050
megahertz
HBM - this video is brought to you by
the be quiet dark Bass Pro 900 white
edition the DBP 900 marks a return to
full tower cases equipped with ample
harddrive support effective noise
damping foam high performance fans and
the option to be inverted into an
alternative layout learn more at the
link in the description below the main
reason to revisit these tests is to see
if the shaders scale differently at the
low end of the frequency range it would
make sense that at some point you would
see shader scaling that we expect that
in some compute tasks as mentioned in
the original content piece maybe some
kind of production workload you would be
more likely to see scaling we would
think but we're not testing that today
we're testing gaming and so far there's
not been scaling and gaming so there's
potential that we were either
encountering some kind of pipeline
bottleneck that we just we don't have a
good way to define right now or maybe on
the upper end and HBM - if bottleneck
where as we all know memory clock
matters a whole lot more than core clock
so at 9:45 megahertz core maybe we were
limited somewhere and today's test is
looking at more of that so a couple
things here we're not going through 10
50 megahertz on all the tests it's
really just the Vega 64 card right now
and then the 1,400 megahertz and 800
megahertz low-end will represent the
bottom line of our scale testing there's
a little bit more territory to explore
none of our bag of 64 cards can clock as
high as our Vega 56 cards I've discussed
this with a couple folks in the industry
some overclockers some folks you are
familiar with on the media
side and everyone I've spoken with seems
to have a similar experience to ours
which is that so far mods or not we're
able to get Vega 56 cards two o'clock
higher so this may be something to do
with having fewer shaders fewer cores
means that you can push the clock a bit
higher and while that's exciting from a
Vega 56 standpoint I mean it further
really drives emphasis that Vega 56 is a
great card to play around with not as
great as it could be with unlocks bios
but pretty damn good and if you're
willing to play around with it it's a
good purchase especially versus the
existing ten 70s but that's not the
point today the point is because Vega 64
isn't clocking as high on core as Vega -
these six we're kind of limited on how
high we can go right now
so we can hit about 1700 megahertz for
Vega 64 when it's due in 3d mark I go a
little beyond that with liquid and power
play tables but once you start gaming
because of how the frequency behaves
with games often that drops to 16 safety
so that's where we land with 64 even
though our 56 card can do 17 42 and fire
strike in 1732 and games stable so
that's that's where we stand but anyway
let's get through these will start with
3d mark a lot of the emphasis was put on
3d mark this time because we're trying
to very rapidly create a line plot of
scaling across different frequency
ranges it's a whole lot of testing each
of these tests was executed a minimum of
six times per rep so to speak or
iteration and then I mean based on what
we saw at that point either more tests
were run or we averaged what we got but
we're gonna start with 3d mark lots to
go through there we'll go through a
couple games but that's a lot less than
focus today we're opening with fire
strike 3d mark fire strikes shows home
of the most visible scaling with this
new round of tests so keep that in mind
going forward will lose resolution of
difference on the shader impact as we
explore more games 3 mark fire strikes
scoring that shows slightly more
noticeable shader impact towards the low
end when under clock into 1395 megahertz
core and 800 megahertz HBM - as we move
it to 1590 megahertz
and 800 megahertz HBM to maintaining a
somewhat equal distance as at 1395
megahertz
towards the higher end of the frequency
scale the lines merge closer to one
another and start dithering around
within margin of error territory the
mark aided by the vertical error barked
we haven't yet pushed the Vega 56 to 10
50 megahertz HBM - but we've included
the Vega 64 data point for reference our
performance flatlined for Vega 64 once
we hit 16 57 megahertz core and 945 mega
Hertz HBM - we still gained about 5.5
percent performance between the 945
megahertz and mine 80 mega Hertz numbers
on Vega 64 but nothing close to the
gains seen earlier in the line plot
diminishing returns our encountered ones
we hit 10 50 megahertz on Vega 64 so the
point where we do actually start losing
some performance within margin of error
though so it's basically the same
relating these scores into a more
diluted FPS value we can break things
into fps 1 &amp;amp; 2 GT 1 and firestrike
relies heavily on loading the GPU with
Polly's on primitives and tessellation
but doesn't apply much of a compute
workload GT 2 increases compute tasked
workloads and stresses memory harder and
knowing these two facts about 3d marks
testing we can better understand why
each number behaves the way it does
starting with GT 1 FPS the gap is
largest at 13 95 megahertz core and 800
megahertz HBM - we're at 97 FPS for Vega
56 and 102 FPS for Vega 64 plus or minus
some error in our clocks and again note
that these are averaged from several
test passes but still there's going to
be error in there that gives us about a
5% advantage for Vega 64 the shaders so
we can finally see a change here like
the first round of tests this is outside
of our tolerance for clock error and
3dmark variance it appears that at these
lower clocks were seeing a lot more
noticeable impact from the shader count
increase on Vega 64 than previously but
it's still only 5% that 5% gain largely
persists to the 1589 megahertz core and
800 megahertz HBM - class where we still
see about a 5 to 6 percent gain
from the shader count the difference
begins to fall within error margins
toward the higher end of the clock
speeds though overall maintains a slight
1 to 4 percent lead over Vega 56 there
are times when the scores were
effectively identical as seen in our
initial round of tests and in a couple
of these other data points later on and
that falls within test variance and
clock error margins gt2 the second FPS
score from 3dmark is more compute
intensive than GT 1 these scores are
nearly identical across the board Vega
64 does not hold a significant lead in
any of these tests except for the first
two where we clocked at 1395 megahertz
core and 1589 megahertz core both with
800 megahertz
HBM 2 and again the first number 1395
and 800 is below what you'd get on Vega
for these six out of box so it's not
really realistic the second number 15 89
and 800 is also well below Vega 56 is
abilities with HB m2 in general and
certainly below Vega 64 so given these
numbers we kind of know what to expect
with games in theory at most you would
expect about a 5 to 6 percent difference
with those lower clocks but as great as
synthetic applications are for rapid
fire testing and looking for theoretical
scaling and theoretical performance and
really pinpointing aspects of hardware
they aren't games so let's go ahead and
see how that worked out now quick note
here again some games will have the
higher overclock tests some won't it
just depended on which ones were stable
on Vega 64 with the higher clocks not
all of them could do it and really if we
started stepping down from the 16 60
plus territory you're getting so close
to our original test value for the core
that it just seems kind of irrelevant
applying this to games is where we start
losing some of that test resolution in
terms of looking for differences for
honor at 4k plots us at around 47 to 48
FPS average with our original test
battery where we were around 1580
megahertz and 940 5 megahertz HBM 2 at
13 90 megahertz core and 800 megahertz
AGM 2 for each device performance
hovered around 42
average for Vega 56 and around 43 FPS
average for Vega 64 note that Vega 64
was also running about 8 megahertz
faster it's just this was the closes we
can control it given the new booster
point no equivalent clock behavior in
Vega
so we're with an error here there's
effectively no difference in for honor
at 4k with these clocks looking at just
the shaders but then there are a lot of
other elements of the card engaged when
gaming so it's tough to tell what other
bottlenecks might be encountered
especially when we're looking at
different resolutions like 4k 1080p
doesn't change much of this our original
number is worth 137 FPS average already
and that's nearly dead 137 FPS average
for each device the one percent and
point one percent values were also close
to each other at 1392 1398 megahertz
core and 800 megahertz HBM to both Vega
56 and 64 are within 1 FPS of each other
we're within error margins here again
before honor is exceptionally GPU bound
as well so we're not in a scenario where
we're CPU bottleneck game ashes of the
singularity at 4k seems to be
bottlenecking though potentially on the
cpu and given how this title behaves
that make some sense either that whore
was showing exceptionally limited
differences at 13 90 megahertz core in
800 megahertz a GBM to the difference
between the two GPUs is within margin of
error here that said they are also not
too distant from the 58 FPS average of
the 15 90 microts core nine forty five
megahertz hpm to test so these
differences are also within margins just
barely we can't use this test or much so
let's just move on to hell bleed
hell-blade at 4k shows no scaling
between the vega 56 and vega 64 cards
went at 1580 to 1590 megahertz core and
9:45 megahertz HB m2 as discussed
previously
it also shows no differences at 1390
core and 800 megahertz HP m2 so once
again no real difference
Ghost Recon wildlands at 4k again shows
effectively no scaling at 1400 megahertz
core and 800 megahertz HB m2 with our
scores sitting within it for actions of
a frame of each other at roughly fifteen
ninety and nine forty five megahertz we
also see no scaling this trend continues
up to 16 60 megahertz
four and nine 80 megahertz age BM to
overclocks up to this point all the
testing was conducted a few weeks ago it
was before we left for the Linus media
group shoot and before the 79 80 XE
launch we were about to publish the data
of more than ten days ago at this point
but ended up holding publication until
getting back so that we could add a
couple more synthetic tests the other
part of our addendum went back to an
initial plan of not flashing Vega 56
with Vega 64 BIOS and actually doing it
so we went back on that we ended up
flashing V 64 onto V 56 and then we
ended up overclocking memory 210 20
megahertz on each device just for
another point of comparison at the high
end using heaven and superposition
heaven and superposition were also the
new options for the rest of the testing
and we added them because we thought
they'd be more likely to draw out the
differences we performed heaven testing
using the extreme preset which is 1600
by 900 it's from 2009 and then we also
ran a custom testing at 1080p with ultra
preset configurations with anti-aliasing
at 8x and dx11 for the API we also
manually adjusted tessellation across
all options we thought this might give
some visibility as to a potential
bottleneck from the geometry pipeline
starting with the extreme preset which
is again 1600 by 900 we'll use an FPS to
first show differences and then move on
the scores the Vega 56 card at 13 90
megahertz and 800 megahertz HBM to
averages at 96 point for FPS after
multiple passes with Vega 64 at similar
speeds averaging 96.1
these are functionally the same
particularly considering we're about 5
megahertz lower on average with the Vega
64 card with the BIOS flash on Vega 56
set to 1660 and 1020 megahertz we scored
one 12.05 FPS average compared to 114
point 75 FPS average on Vega 64 that is
now a 2.4 percent improvement with Vega
64 which is close to our earlier defined
error margins but also close enough to
the limits that we can say a pattern is
emerging we'll keep this 2.4 percent
advantage in mind for now as it may come
into play as we collect more data with
1080p testing and test
and scaly and we're seeing these results
at 1660 megahertz and 1020 megahertz for
HB m to the vega 64 card operates with a
score of 30 50 point 7 vs 30 17 on Vega
56 or an increase of 1.1 percent the gap
widens as we increase tessellation to
moderate and that results in a score
difference of 2801 0.5 on Vega 64 versus
27 30.5 on Vega 56 or a 2.6 percent
improvement on Vega 64 normal
tessellation also posts a 2.6 percent
difference and that's at twenty six
twenty eight point five versus twenty
five sixty one point five extreme
tessellation has us at two point nine
percent improves if they because it
could be for showing one of the biggest
gains we've seen thus far given the
consistency of these results we can
safely say that the Vega 64 cards extra
sea use do help in this particular game
or benchmark rather and we're somewhere
between one and three percent for gains
depending on the test settings as for
the 13 90 and 800 megahertz clocks the
scoring is roughly the same across the
board we're within tolerance for error
and the 5 megahertz clock that prints
here
unlike fire strike the results appear to
be mostly the same at the low-end clocks
when testing with heaven and one more
final note although we like to do this
testing to try and determine differences
in shaders and that's kind of the
verbage I've been using throughout this
video talking about shader differences
what we're really testing is Cu
differences each Cu contains more than
just shaders like texture units for
example so other elements of the sea you
can come into play before the shaders do
but at our level we have no way to
isolate beyond sea use so we can't
control for individual shaders or
texture units or things like that
as for superposition this is made by the
same company that made heaven it's just
been updated for the modern era as such
it demonstrates largely the same
performance it's built on the same
engine as heaven was it's still
tessellation and poly heavy so no
surprise there we're seeing about a
three percent improvement with Vega 64
over Vega 56 with both sets of numbers
for this synthetic benchmark and these
benchmark
they're good tools for demonstrating
these differences but if you can't
realize them in games it's kind of hard
to say when they appear it probably
comes down to certain compute workloads
we would wager you might see these
differences the 3% difference is here
more in something like maybe Sniper
Elite or that new Forza game or
something that uses a lot of async if
those types of games tap into these
shaders that's kind of what we would
wager at this point but either way with
the synthetic workloads that really
exaggerate things superposition is still
showing about a 3% difference so not a
huge one for sure and really not that
distant from our 2 to 2.5 percent error
tolerance given that we can't perfectly
control the clocks from run to run so
we're seeing some scaling in 3dmark
firestrike gt1 which is poly and
tessellation heavy and we're not seeing
much scaling outside of this this test
isn't fully complete I mean you'd have
to test every game basically to really
concretely and confidently state where
and when shaders make a difference
clearly there are places where it can if
we look at the 3d mark results those are
highly repeatable and we see some
differences at the very low end of the
clocks towards 1,400 megahertz so it's
unrealistically low that we're seeing
the difference emerge but it does emerge
that means that one could expect that
some type of game out there programmed
similarly to this the application would
behave similarly there's also room for
production applications to show some
shader differences we didn't test those
today maybe something with computes
although it wasn't reflected in fire
strike maybe something with compute
heavy workloads would have those
differences emerge and ultimately this
test is kind of difficult to conduct
anyway it's it's very time consuming
because you have to log the frequency
during the test which changes it changes
because of how Vega behaves now it
changes based on the game if we set
let's say we set a number like 14 22
megahertz target that might get you 1392
1398
Hertz if you're lucky if it's going well
or it might get you 1422 just depends on
the application and so that might be
1390 an application a for honor or
something and the application B maybe
he'll blade your at thirteen eighty so
there's a lot of work of adjusting the
clocks to make sure that they're the
same on each card because each card
behaves differently just like nvidia
gpus now and that makes it tedious to
test properly that said the biggest
takeaway here i think we've kind of
learned indirectly as an aside from this
is that vega 56 from our testing with
our samples which are not representative
of every single sample on earth but a
representative of at least 1% of them
since that's about the amount of cards
we have from vega 56 versus the initial
launch in our testing so far it looks
like vega 56 is capable of achieving at
least slightly higher clocks than vega
64 build Zoid is still exploring this
personally his initial findings were
similar but he's he only just recently
got his vega these six in so there's
room for him to discover more things i'm
sure he'll do videos on it check them
out when he does I've spoken with
vendors in the industry who work with
these cards and they've seen similar
spoken with other media they've seen
similar so it would appear that there's
a kind of expected hit to maximum clock
potential with the increased shader
count that's not wholly absurd I there's
probably some sort of thermal behavior
where you've got higher density of
active shaders wiggling her house
basically what they do and that's
limiting the clock Headroom on 64 on our
cards there's room for that to be
different for other cards that's what
we've seen so that also makes it
difficult to test the higher frequency
results because with 56 we're doing 17
32 to 17 42 with the mods 64 with the
same mods or similar anyway we're doing
like 1700 to 17 12 at best and once you
get into games that falls down around
1660 and
couple games that's not even stable so
that's that's kind of interesting that's
maybe the more interesting takeaway than
the shader differences but for now
that's what it looks like so this really
just just kind of interesting
information not necessarily stuff you
can act on if you did want to act on it
I would say that once again it looks
like Vega Vega 56 is the far better buy
than Vega 64 its competitive with the
1070 it's pretty modifiable if you're
willing to do things like registry edits
you can just double click a file
basically and if you're willing to maybe
get a better cooler on it whether that's
DIY or a IB partner whatever it's you
can get pretty far with that card it's
fun to play with but it does require
playing with it for it to be the best it
can be
that's not just like a normal overclock
it's either under bolt it to tune it
down and power consumption or you clock
it up and compete more directly in frame
rate things like that so it's very much
a card where to get the most out of it
you you have to enjoy being under the
hood there are a lot of people in our
audience who do so they get these six
it's pretty fun to work with for that
but still shader difference don't worry
