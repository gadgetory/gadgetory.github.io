to a point of finding their way into
even small form factor devices but are
well known for prevalence within CPU and
GPU coolers a copper heat pipe is one of
the most efficient means of syncing and
dissipating heat doing most of the work
through internal phase change of liquid
to gas as the fluid evaporates and
condenses within the vacuum sealed
copper tube today we're looking at
cooler masters in-house copper heat pipe
Factory in Hawai Joe China where more
than 50,000 the copper heat pipes are
made every single day before that this

description below
cooler masters heat pipe manufacturing
is about as close to the source as it
gets first the company buys the copper
from a supplier and gets it rolled into
a tube the first machine that we saw in
the line uses a set of two platforms to
exchange heat pipes from one position to
the next at this point they're really
just copper tubes with holes at the end
and that's it the center platform lifts
and moves the to be heat pipes while the
outer one holds them in place
neither side of the heat pipe is sealed
as it enters this machine but that
changes as the pipes progressed through
it once in place the machine moves a
rotating bit inwards to shrink the heat
pipe and create a closed end on one side
while the other end of the machine
pushes the pipe into the rotating bit an
arm at the top pushes down lightly to
hold them in place and then they're
rotated out and dropped into a bit once
the copper has been rolled into a tube
and sized the heat pipe is brought to a
machine that fills the pipe with
centered copper powder there are
multiple types of copper heat pipes but
the most commonly known ones are
sintered mesh or we've grooved or a
composite of two approaches with the
posit pops being the most expensive and
the most thermally effective today we're
following the manufacturing of sintered
heat pipes which bake a copper powder to
the inner walls of the heat pipe to
expand surface area and guide capillary
action this approach uses more copper
than a mesh heat pipe and so is more
expensive to manufacture than just mesh
the machine containing the pipes hold
about 48 at a time with multiple of
these and use and dumps copper powder
from a container above the machine then
shakes the copper powder into place
thus compacting it into the tube excess
spill over lands in a bucket for reuse
and so it can be sort of recycled if we
were watching mesh manufacturing what we
would see would be an insert by hand
instead of using this machine step where
a premade mesh can be stuck into the
tube and then it moves on to the next
step after the sintered powder finds its
way into the heat pipe factory workers
transport the powder packed copper heat
pipes to an oven because the heat pipes
are made of copper and therefore good
conductors baking the heat pipes can
prove challenging the oven has to bake
each of the 50,000 heat pipes per day
for eight hours running at 900 to 1,000
degrees Celsius the entire time the
result of the baking process is sintered
copper powder hardened against the inner
wall of the heat pipe something for
which we have footage to demonstrate if
you try to scrape this off you'd really
have to dig at it because it is hardened
into the outer copper at this point
after a full day of baking in the oven
the heat pipes are moved to get soldered
on one of the ends the soldering machine
uses what amounts to an ammunition
magazine except it's filled with heat
pipes it hops the pipes through the
process the machine can solder one pipe
roughly every two seconds again with
multiple machines in use and uses a set
of two platforms to exchange heat pipes
down the line the arms actuate and push
pipes through the stack with an arm
moving back into the magazine to fetch
the next pipe with each successive
solder once soldered the pipes are
allowed to roll into a receiving bucket
where they wait to be moved manually to
the next step at this point there's a
manual quality check to ensure the heat
pipes look as they should
using reference materials to check the
desired result and if there are any bad
heat pipes they unfortunately can't be
recycled even though these are copper
they're not pure copper the heat pipes
have too many chemicals in them now that
they've gone through some of these
processes and are impure so they can't
be reused about three percent of the
heat pipe materials end up going to
waste which against 50,000 per day ends
up being a lot of copper that
unfortunately can't be salvaged next is
the injection of liquid into heat pipes
Coolermaster made its own machines to
handle this process using simple
principles of gravity to hold the liquid
in the tube while it's injected a
syringe inserts a few droplets of
distilled water into the copper heat
pipe and it really is just a few drops
if you were to turn the heat pipe over
and attempt to empty it into your palm
you wouldn't even feel the liquid come
out if any does come out it's that small
of an amount of liquid as space is still
needed for the gases within the heat
pipe the heat pipe is next laid down in
a bin that's tilted slightly downward
using gravity to ensure no loss of
liquid while they wait to be transferred
the tube is moved by hand to another
machine this one responsible for
vacuuming the air out and pinching the
end of the heat pipe closed not all of
the air is removed at this point so it
goes to another machine to further this
process the next machine heats the heat
pipe up at the bottom it's loaded by a
technician manually and heating it at
the bottom forces the remaining air to
go out of the top of the pipe via
automation it then vacuums and pinches
the tube a second time this time higher
up and then it cuts that section of the
heat pipe off all of the air is now
removed from the heat pipe leaving only
a few droplets of distilled water and
the sintered powder that's been bonded
to the inside
finally the heat pipe can be soldered on
the other end of the tube sealing it
completely into one straight copper heat
pipe this soldering machine the final
step is the same as the earlier one we
saw and the heat pipe is now done and
must be bent or shaped for the product
cooler master makes CPU and GPU cooler
silicon manufacturers and board partners
and cooler manufacturers so heat pipes
of various types are in constant demand
now that it's time to bend those heat
pipes there are two ways to do it
one is manually sometimes used for low
volume designs with specific pens or if
a machine is out of commission and the
other is by the more efficient
automation approach to get a feel for
how manual bending works cooler masters
and engineers gave us the hands-on
experience alongside Brian from bps
costumes and with our inexperience
combined we formed the world's slowest
assembly line the first step of the
manual bending process is to face the
crimped ends of the heat pipe toward the
user then insert two heat pipes at a
time and to the bending rig an insert is
used to hold the pipes in place while
the operator pulls a lever to
effortlessly bend the tubes at the
desired angle although it took us about
19 to 25 seconds to bend two heat pipes
and passed them to Brian it takes a
skilled factory worker about eight
seconds to accomplish the same work
coolermaster gave us one of our heat
pipes to take home so you know as they
probably wouldn't pass quality control
and the result is a comprar heat pipe
with a 180 degree Bend ready for use in
a small tower cooler automation is more
interesting and uses the same tools as
the manual stations but it's obviously
more efficient Coolermaster had three
different types of heat pipe vending
machines on display with the first
accomplishing effectively the same task
as both Brian and we accomplished except
more competently by using a template to
bend the pipes and a grooved wheel to
guide them along as they get bent a
second time a claw then grabs the pipes
and moves them over a bucket where it
dropped them for operator pick up one of
the machines is capable of more unique
shapes to bend pipes multiple times for
specific fitments this machine uses an
accordion arm to push the pipes into the
bend template where the heat pipes are
then bent and then moved to a bucket all
that's left now is the final quality
check heat pipes are selected to be
dipped into a tank of hot water where
operators expect to feel the heat pipe
become hot very rapidly if the heat pipe
doesn't reach high temperatures in a
specified amount of time it may be
defective and might need a secondary
inspection this is also where
Coolermaster had some of its flattened
heat pipes on display although the
company prefers round heat pipes and
it's cooling products for improved
performance flat pipes can fill
important roles in GPUs and notebook
coolers where space is at
more of a premium that's it for this
factory tour of a heat pipe factory at
cooler masters headquarters in China
