dotnet and we're on episode 10 of ask GN
so thank you for your continued
questions in the comments as always
questions below in the comment section
if you want something included in the
next video
going forward I am only reading
questions in these comment sections for
inclusion and ask gee I'm still reading
all the other comments as allowed by
time and things like that but this is
where I'm checking for questions in the
future
so we are on Episode time I made it to
double digits and for this episode we're
doing all overclocking questions I think
there's maybe one that's not necessarily
overclocking but they're basically all
overclocking so we've got a bit of a
theme here the first question for this
week's episode comes from Lord
Inquisitor who says I have a question
about a certain motherboard feature I
have 5820k in the BIOS it says I can
choose between three options like three
point six three point nine and a four
point two gigahertz and I know it's a
pre overclock feature but is it good if
I choose four point two and leave it
there so this question is pertaining to
or addressing the existence of instant
overclock and easy overclock features a
lot of motherboards have these now some
of them have a physical button on the
board itself so you can just normally
next to the power button on MSI and I
think it's gigabyte also has on a couple
other manufacturers might have them
there's a button you push it and it
instantly checks your CPU skew it checks
a table frequency versus voltage and
then it applies that setting depending
on how aggressive the overclock is that
you are seeking so the thing with these
solutions and you can do it through BIOS
or UEFI as well by just choosing
overclock and it'll do it the fate of
these solutions is they are very
one-size-fits-all so you lose a lot of
the fine-tuning and that can be a
problem for the longevity of the CPU and
to sort of explain why it's important to
understand how overclocking works at a
top level so the very basics of it you
have a few things on a CPU you have the
frequency so in this case maybe you say
it's 3.6 gigahertz stock let's just make
that number up 3.6 gigahertz stock CP
you you have multipliers for at least
for Intel and Andy as well yeah there's
different overclocking settings for each
manufacturer each motherboard but you
have the frequency in the multipliers
the multiplier times the base clock
derives the frequency so if you have a
base clock of 100 megahertz which is
what most Intel CPUs are AMD is a bit
different but so you have a hundred
megahertz base clock and then you have a
thirty-six multiplier so 100 times 36 is
3.6 gigahertz in this instance so that's
how you get your frequency that is what
that is derived from and then the
stability is a result of your voltage
setting so as the frequency increases
your CPU is increasing and how many
times it oscillates per second so this
is measured in the billions of
oscillations or cycles per second and
that number as it grows as you increase
the multiplier or the base clock it will
make the CPU become volatile so it's
less stable to improve stability you
need to send more voltage to the CPU or
more power generally so as you increase
the voltage you'll see that a couple of
things chained one it gets hotter - it
should get more stable and three over a
long period of time depending on what
the voltage is it can actually decrease
the lifespan of the CPU or the GPU so
here's the thing though a lot of the
time the detriment to the lifespan is
not going to be that noticeable unless
you're sort of an extreme overclock or
if you're going crazy with it yeah
you're gonna kill your CPU a lot faster
but for a moderate overclock you're
probably gonna replace the system before
the usable life of the the CPU expires
anyway so with that understood answering
the question directly I it's not bad I
guess to set a pre overclock I would
recommend against it my advice would be
to just take the time it normally
doesn't take that long maybe set aside
an hour and just play with the overclock
and try and figure it out so you want to
start by looking for guides and this is
one of the other questions a bit further
down but you look for guides online
we've written a few overclock net is
fantastic and has really good
guys that I reference a lot of the time
as well so you look for a guide but
generally you're gonna just increase the
multiplier and then see how the CPU
responds as you start hitting
instability you increase the voltage and
just try not to go over a certain
voltage depending on what the CPU is
normally one point three to one point
four volts on Intel is kind of my max I
don't like going higher than that but
there it's different for every CPU and
AMD especially is different so hopefully
that helps there to very briefly sum it
up I would say just just do it yourself
if you are gonna do a pre overclock be
aware that it will more aggressively
push the voltage so you might be
shortening your CPU lifespan and the
very least you're gonna be running a lot
hotter than necessary and that's just
because they want to make sure that the
overclock applies they don't want to
give you a pre overclock feature that
doesn't work so that's where that comes
from the next question is from Federico
Romero he says do you recommend software
overclocking apps like Asus five-way
gigabytes ez tune etc they change more
than just voltage and multiplier
question mark thanks for QA videos that
are helpful so overclocking applications
depend what you're doing are necessary
for example GPU overclocking you need
something like afterburner or EVGA
precision or something similar to that
overdrive otherwise you just can't even
overclock so it depends on what you're
asking but per CPU overclock and I do it
all through UEFI so I prefer to do it
through pre-boot environments and the
same thing applies I just said a second
ago if you do it all through you if I
manually you're gonna get a stable
overclock takes a bit more time but it's
not gonna beat up the CPU as much as
some of the more aggressive pre tuned
overclock applications or buttons on
motherboards things like that but
depending on what you're doing the
software is actually pretty good so some
of it like afterburner for GPUs it
allows you to set custom fan curves it
allows you to do the frequency
overclocking on the core clock the
memory clock and you can even do some
troubleshooting features
so all that's very good especially the
login utility and this is something that
is actually useful in the CPU
overclocking applications as well as if
they have logging options or some of
them do in the settings then use that
turn it on and you can see at what point
is your voltage or frequency or whatever
becoming unstable what point is it
threatening the stability of the system
so the reason that these applications
can exist these days and they didn't
used to exist before is because of UEFI
and we have a video on this coming out
at some point in the future but UEFI is
effectively a replacement for standard
bios and it's able to communicate
directly with a host so it's a still low
level firmware device but it can
communicate communicate excuse me had a
higher level with the host which is your
OS so now your pre boot environment
effectively can communicate with the
operating system and that allows you to
pass through overclocks and boot boot
orders changes and fan speed changes and
things like that from the OS straight to
UEFI which was not possible before was
just the basic input/output system that
used to exist on firmware before UEFI
was developed as a new standard so
that's that's kind of cool I would still
do it through UEFI though or BIOS as you
can call it and except for GPUs
because with GPUs you need some kind of
application moving on
Daniel Worthy asks let's see will an i5
4690k burn out and an MSI P 33 V 2
motherboard it's not very high-end
motherboard it has like two plus one
power to the CPU should I down clock the
CPU try to get the voltage down so I
guess if you're asking this question I'm
I'm under the assumption that you
already own the 4690k otherwise it
doesn't really make a lot of sense to
buy those two components together I I
would get a better motherboard because
with this CPU a 4690k or similar you're
you're really gonna be sort of limiting
yourself with low and mother
because you'll either you're gonna have
stability issues that's for sure
and with the limited power phase you're
certainly not gonna have any turbo or OC
Headroom and you're not gonna have OC
ability anyway so I would move towards a
Z series higher-end motherboard strongly
encourage that if for no other reason
than the power delivery will be cleaner
because it will have more phases so
you'll get more stability and you really
don't want a down clock a good CPU just
to fit a cheap motherboard trying to if
it's possible if it's within budget it
makes more sense to spend even at the
low end $85 on a better board like the
PC mate I think is about 85 bucks and
then just work with that instead so
that's that's kind of where I would go
with it that's a very weird combination
of components to have a high-end CPU
mixed with cheap motherboard but I you
can try it just be aware that your
motherboard will probably exhibit some
instability and you might burn out some
of the power components as as you
continue to use the device next question
is a mere mock mood he says hi Steve I
have a 4790k running at 4.7 gigahertz
and 1.3 volts would you recommend
disabling SPID support and for those who
don't know SP idea this is a pretty good
question
SPID support is basically on the fly
voltage adjustments so it will allow for
more stable overclocks by regulating
your voltage actively which means if you
set one point three volts in UEFI but
you have SV ID on and maybe the CPU
decides it wants one point three to five
for an instant in time then SP ID will
allow that to change so you're not
sitting at a fixed voltage now this
allows you to get a couple more X's out
of your multipliers so you might be able
to push it a few times higher on the
frequency because you've got that sv ID
regulation to change the voltage on the
fly but generally I would recommend
disabling it and then doing more manual
tuning so if you can spend the time to
dial it in it is again going to be a
better overclock in the long run
but that does require a bit more time
than just a standard overclock with SPID
on because now you've got to go in you
have to do a lot more burnin tests and
those take time obviously and then you
have to change the voltage every time it
fails to try and find the correct
voltage so generally if you can find a
bit of time on a Saturday or something I
would recommend yeah turn it off
see what you can achieve and if it's too
much struggle if you can't get a stable
clock then just put it back on no big
deal no big loss but you will get a bit
more out of your overclock to be
disabled it just kind of depends on what
your time investment is there it's not a
terrible feature it just again will sort
of aggressively tune the voltage
sometimes when it doesn't have to and
that gives you stability but it it's it
kind of threatens the the CPU in terms
of heat and stuff like that as well so
double-edged sword as with most
overclocking features that assist in
overclocking and the final question for
this week is from Ryan's inter who says
hey Steve of the site in channel thank
you my question is this I've watched
tons of videos about overclocking but
I've never been able to achieve a stable
overclock I'm using an AMD
8350 on a 990 x motherboard and I'm
wanting to upgrade soon but if I get
more performance out of the chip I can
put off upgrading and then the question
is where's a good step-by-step guide
overclocking this chip sorry if it
sounds noobish definitely does not sound
noobish so of course we do run a lot of
guides I write a couple guides but I've
got to give it up to overclocked dotnet
here so OCN is what they're called
overclocked on that has some of the best
overclocking guides I've seen we don't
really go as deep as them because that's
more their thing overclocking is
something that I'm interested in that
the readers are interested and obviously
but we don't go as hard on the
information as they do so that is
something I want to change in the future
it's just a staffing limitation but I
would recommend them we don't have a
guide on the 8350 and probably will not
make one at this point so I'm don't
don't wait up for me basically but I can
give you some basics here so first of
all the 990 FX board the 990 FX chipset
is what you want 990
any effects are both good for
overclocking so you're in a good place
there in terms of hardware 8350 is a
pretty good overclocker I'm not sure
what your cooler is but you'll want to
make sure that you have a decent cooler
on there of course to sustain the
thermals that it outputs because the AMD
chips do run a bit hotter than some of
the Intel chips competitive the same
price competing the Intel chips and then
I same sort of thin you're gonna need to
look up the guide and then pay attention
to the features that they recommend you
disable so I'm not sure off the top of
my head with those are going to be for
this particular board and CPU but
there's normally features you want to
disable like with Intel SP ID and stuff
like that and you disable those normally
so that there's less power saving going
on so with overclocking you want to turn
off a lot of power saving features and
that's because when you apply the
overclock if the CPU is sitting there
fighting you because it thinks there's
not enough load for this high frequency
it's going to down clock you and try and
save power so you disable those as
recommended disable the live voltage
modification by the board or by the
low-level firmware and stuff like that
and then manually start tuning in these
case especially the base clock and the
multipliers and then you adjust voltage
as you find points of instability but do
check OCN I recommend them quite a bit
there's another one to overclockers so
there's overclock net and then there's
overclockers both are good sites that is
where I would start if you do struggle
with this any of you for that matter
post below and I'll research it myself
for next video or the one after that and
try and give you some input based on
what the holdup point is so that is all
for episode 10 of sgn as always thanks a
lot for watching and thank you for your
great questions this is a pretty good
flow we got going here and it's easy
content for us to produce but really fun
to produce so that is a big plus because
it is often the case that I bottleneck
the operation these days because I'm
working on the the benchmarks and
speaking of benchmarks we have a couple
coming up particularly fallout 4 and
then probably call duty black ops 3 not
100% positive on that but I
we will be looking at that and then
battlefront will be revisited once
that's fully out so that is all for this
episode check back regularly because the
videos are more frequent now and hit
that patreon link in the post roll video
down there if you want to help us out
big thanks to those of you who have I
will see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
