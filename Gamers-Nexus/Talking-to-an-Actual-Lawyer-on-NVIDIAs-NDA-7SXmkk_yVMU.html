about an Nvidia NDA that was published
by hyzer de which read it has since run
with and gone crazy with to rather than
resorting to armchair lawyers online we
spoke to an actual lawyer about the
Nvidia NDA to discuss whether or not
it's legitimately problematic problems
are raised or issues raised by
commenters online have primarily
indicated a concern that Nvidia is
trying to strong-arm only positive
content out of media outlets we've
reviewed the NBA we've spoken with a
couple of lawyers about it and we
disagree with this sentiment however we
decided to speak with as I said a lawyer
who agreed to be on audio call in for
this and talk about the NDA so we could
get someone who's actually a legitimate
source to talk about what they think of
the specific language herein and this is
primarily a phone call so it's got some
video it's just screenshots of questions
from reddit you can tab away and just
listen to this if you like because it's
mostly our legal correspondent speaking
about his thoughts on the whole matter
before that this video is brought to you
by us and the gamers Nexus anti-static
mod map the GN anti-static mana is a
four foot by two foot service two
millimeters thick of high-quality
industrial grade anti-static material
and it includes a common ground point
for earth a grounding wrist strap
and it has on its electrical wiring
diagrams that may prove useful a GPU
silhouette and grid for your teardown
efforts and other useful items go to
store documents nexus dotnet to pick up
a GN mod mat today hey everyone so today
we're gonna go over a leaked and Vidya
NDA that was posted on Heiser de and I
have with me at GN legal correspondent
Jack who is a US attorney Jack how's it
going pretty good Steve how are you I'm
doing well we have we have an
interesting one here we have a bit of
irony with this docket because the NDA
can be discussed because it is in the
public domain so so the NDA right again
that is correct
and so this one there's been a lot of
conversation online for everyone
watching we don't I'm going to do my
very best here to focus on so the
comments we've seen you all post on
or elsewhere go through them without
injecting too much of my own opinion
unless it specifically pertains to how a
reviewer or reporter would interact with
this document and I'm going to allow a
jack to take all the legal questions and
hopefully we can answer some of this
stuff as neutrally and accurately as
possible from a legal standpoint so Jack
that sounds good to you I think think we
can get started yeah of course
so I think the main thing we should
start with here is anyone who hasn't
seen the document it was posted by
german website isaac de and that's the
specific version of the stock and we're
talking about in the document we first
need to define the word confidential
information so this comes up a lot and
it has a very specific meaning so Jack
let's let's go over what this is so in
any contract like this which is that's
all an NDA is they always have certain
terms of art which are just defined in
the document goes somewhere else that
may mean something else
so in this document that the phrase to
pay attention to is confidential
information paragraph one defines it as
any and all technical and non-technical
information disclosed made available to
recipient which would be GN or some
other outlet from time to time by
disclosing party that's Nvidia including
but not limited to terms the agreement
assets materials etc basically it covers
whatever they tell you that they deem
confidential information at the time
they tell you what it is a good example
would be a release date of a product so
if they say Turing is going to be
released on on September 1st that would
be covered or some other type of
technical information how many cores it
runs what it clocks to whatever memory
it uses things like that right and this
is so far this is all pretty standard a
lot of the from the reviewer side a lot
of the time when products come out I'd
say probably about ninety percent of the
time we don't sign a literal NDA
companies like case companies that
cooler companies they just they don't
care
worst case scenario you break the
embargo they say you weren't supposed to
do that and then either there's an
apology exchanged or the reviewer might
say I know I wasn't supposed to I did it
anyway in which case they stopped
sampling the reviewer but in the
instance of a company like Intel
occasionally we'll get NDA's from
Intel's partners or
nvidia and AMD z' partners it tends to
be these larger big three vendors that
get involved with the written agreement
of some kind and vidya to date i can say
we have not had to deal with a specific
document like this before typically the
agreements are a company will send an
email and the company might say you are
under embargo until date do you agree
and you say yes or no so that's
typically how it works now next term to
define so the disclosing party who
specifically is that and does it include
obviously on videos in there but does it
include on videos partners so i one of
the other terms it needs to be defined
is the disco so the disclosing party so
there are a few parties in clay in this
agreement as there is with anyone there
is the agreement which is the document
itself there's the effective date which
is whatever they agree on there's the
disclosing party which is defined
specifically as in video corporation
delaware corporation on behalf of itself
in any its subsidiaries so that would
not include in a board partner would be
just nvidia or whatever other companies
in my own and then the recipient is
going to be whoever is talking to nvidia
so it would be GN or linus or whoever is
talking to them right okay so now that
we've got that defined let's start with
the most critically examined piece of
this from everyone online the biggest
thing people have pointed out is this
phrase use restriction recipient shall
use confidential information solely for
the benefit of nvidia and shall not so
worth the a through age so the question
is well actually let me just read you
one of the comments that was uploaded
very high on reddit quote holy
they're basically saying NDA signers
have to write positive press for them so
what's your interpretation that's not
even remotely true
the phrase solely for the benefit of is
a little bit nebulous I wouldn't have
drafted it this way but for the benefit
of meet something very different in
legalese than it means in real life so
when you say for the benefit of it that
doesn't necessarily mean it's to help
NVIDIA it just means on behalf of so for
example you can have a bank account that
you may run but it's for the benefit of
somebody else so it's really the money
in the account somebody else's money
but you're running it it doesn't have
any so judgment value I'm good or bad it
just is a thing that being said we
really need to pay attention to is
paragraph four which talks about things
which are accepted have an exemption
from the confidentiality the most
important of which would be I think it's
letter C so if your paragraph four
letter C which is independently
developed developed information so
presumably when you reviewing a product
it's all based on data you've collected
yourself it should be at least so if you
were to do your own testing it wouldn't
apply to a use restriction so if they
put out Turing and it turns out it's a
giant dumpster fire and you find that
out by testing on it you can still post
that that's information you found
yourself that they can know that that's
accepted from this so no they do not
have to write a positive positive press
for them you can very easily say we
tested their new GPU and it's terrible
that's fine as long as it's based on
your information and also my correct me
if I'm wrong my understanding further is
that it does say shall use confidential
information for benefit of blah blah so
a review I don't think is covered under
confidential information at this point
because it has entered the public domain
either by Nvidia or something like I
mean is that well there's a couple
different things one it confidence
information is defined as something they
told you if it's something you came upon
yourself it's not technically
confidential information
two if it's a review so it's after a
review embargo technically everything's
gonna be in the public domain anyway
that everybody's gonna know how many
court what the court count is everything
is gonna to know how much memory
everybody's gonna know the clock speed
everybody's gonna know everything about
it so nothing you really say is going to
be covered under this anyway this would
obviously keep you from breaking a
review embargo if none of this is public
yet and you decide to be a jerk and just
publish all your information a week
early you're gonna get stung but for any
reasonable use of a review this won't
affect you at least I don't think it
didn't seem to me doesn't seem to me to
be that way the for the benefit of is a
little bit odd but it's not something
that should send you running for the
hills and for all I know it was some you
know some associated foo that anything
can you look cute and it doesn't really
mean anything I don't know it's not
something I'd really be concerned about
I'd be more concerned about the specific
uses a through H in paragraph three
which are very definite and I wouldn't
do any of that stuff right right and so
for talking about some of these I guess
we kind of addressed this one does the
meet does this mean the media have to
write only positive reviews and I think
our answer here is no to that question
next one is so we saw some online
speculation those restrictions are crazy
any outlet that signs these essentially
opens them themselves up to be sued by
Nvidia if Nvidia doesn't like an article
they write any thoughts on this it's the
same thing as the one above I mean no
okay one the restrictions aren't crazy
seems to be pretty boilerplate for an
NDA especially because you can do
whatever you want to do with your own
generated data and any out who that
signs in this there's open themselves
out to be sued if they don't like
article later right okay that's wrong
for a couple of reasons one yeah
technically Nvidia can sue whoever they
want but they wouldn't there they were
kind of waste their time suing you for
no particular reason especially if they
have no case to you're not opening
yourself up to anything and the
agreement pretty clearly says that
you're allowed to do this and frankly
this isn't really all that different
from any other embargo a reviewer might
have the difference is this one is
actually on paper otherwise you're not
doing anything different you normally
would do right okay so next question
then is let's let's do this one
so the problem also is that if they
receive any information on upcoming
products they being reviewers they can't
write up rumor articles which
effectively squelches all these touring
rumor articles the vague wording allows
them to expand upon what they can
consider a breach of NDA aside from that
with this NDA popping up torreón
possible soon so ignore in the last
sentence there is there a I let me
provide I guess my thoughts on this
first because this is very reviewer
related the way I interpret this users
is there saying if we reviewers receive
information from Nvidia then we can't
turn around and post a rumor article or
debunk existing rumor articles relating
to that information to which I would say
that's very normal so typically if
company a comes to us and says product
this product has these specs we can't
then try and be cute if we're under NDA
and go to a news video and say we're
speculating that it might have these
specs that's not okay even if we say the
words speculating if we've been briefed
on it and we're giving information that
we were briefed on that would be covered
under an embargo or an NDA even if we
pretend like we're speculating so if
that's the concern I would say it's very
standard if the concern is that I don't
know let's say commenting on rumors from
other people jack how would you let's
say rumors or even facts are published
online by someone else are we or other
media outlets able to talk about those
contents published by other people so if
somebody there's really two
circumstances here one is where somebody
posts a not a fact but a rumor a normal
rumor mill stuff Turing
will clock to 10,000 megahertz and we'll
shoot gold out of the the the the ports
in the back you can't go on and say
that's not true here's why you can't
comment in any of the rumors which
frankly you shouldn't be doing anyway
you know getting involved in the rumor
mill is never really a good idea but you
can't do that which is pretty clearly
stated you you can't this information is
controlled you have to wait until
embargo which makes sense you just just
don't comment on it's not all that
difficult just don't say anything I mean
you could say I can't say anything about
this or just like you may have in the
past or somebody else but no you
couldn't talk about those rumors to
quote-unquote
squelch them just leave them alone it's
not a big deal with respect to
information that is disclosed so let's
say somebody is under this NDA or for
whatever reason and they decide you know
what spirit I'm just going to
polishes information anyway consequences
be damned well if becomes public
information it's not it's not covered if
you look at paragraph four you look at a
you look at so a says what's in the
public domain at the time is
communicated to recipient or into the
public domain subsequent to her time was
communicated okay so if somebody so if
somebody this post the information
online and becomes public knowledge you
can talk about that that's fine this is
a reason we can talk about this right
now it's public information it's sitting
right here in front of us everybody has
it right right next one here is so
here's some some more online speculation
this person said I've signed the NBA's
before and this is definitely much more
overreaching than your typical NBA NDA's
are typically focused on specific
products while this is basically about
everything we tell you moreover NDA is
typically have an expiration date such
as a product release where as this does
not have an expiration date so how do we
want to look at this question I this
seems very simple it's only two pages
you know I've seen settlement agreements
that are or dozens or hundreds of pages
long this is really not all that long
it's two pages it's not all that
complicated
normally NDA's are focused on specific
products that's true but while this is
kind of an everything we tell you now
they may tell you a lot of stuff which
they say this isn't confidential you can
go and release it but some of it may be
that's true however I don't really see
the difference and what does it matter
whether they have they have to print out
a new agreement every time they give you
a new product or they just have an
overarching one that covers whatever
comes up in the future it doesn't really
matter
frankly and with respect to the final
comment about the expiration date all
there is I think some I've seen a lot of
comments online and I don't think people
are reading this very closely so there
are two timeout dates on this agreement
one is the agreement itself it says on
paragraph 5 it shows up as for that it
will continue until terminated by either
party in writing so any party whether
Nvidia or the reviewer or the recipient
I guess it would be contaminated writing
at any time so Steve you could you could
sign this and say a week later this is
BS I don't want to do this anymore and
notify them in writing its terminated
you're done you're not bound by this
agreement anymore
however anything they told you while the
agreement was in effect has a five-year
it's this Agreement sticks to it for
five years so if during the week where
you were bound by this they gave you a
launch date for some product whatever it
is that is considered would be bound
that would be held under this agreement
as confident information and all this
stuff would apply for five years from
the date they told you regardless of
whether or not you cancel the agreement
or not
so the cancellation is more of a looking
forward cancellation so I'm canceling
from this moment forward I'm not abiding
by this but anything that happened prior
to it it's still covered which would
make sense otherwise they could tell you
all kinds of information which they
would not want to get out into the
public and then you go ha ha and pull
the rug out from underneath them and say
I've cancelled it now I can tell them
whatever I wanted I should also note
that a five year so this five year
number as you were saying a lot of the
comments basically say it lasts for five
years well it lasts until someone
terminates correct and the data is
pretty I should say the confidential
information is protected for five years
unless otherwise released and if we're
being real here five years to me just
seems kind of like a number they picked
and said yeah that seems good because
any product we talked about once it gets
to me and press it's gonna launch within
probably a year yeah I was thinking
about that when I was just talking about
this thinking oh wait a second five
years seems really weird it is a weird
timeframe considering anything they're
gonna give you is gonna come out within
a year at most then I'm not gonna tell
you about five years from now we've
created Skynet and they're not gonna do
that then it doesn't mean I'm sure it's
the unit timeframe they picked which
seems well this will cover everything
without having to read without having to
tweak it so I don't think it really
matters honestly I would be surprised if
anything lasted the five years without
going into the public domain just
because they released a press statement
about it or somebody leaked it or
something happened that would be very
surprising to me so I don't view that as
being honest at all in fact the the
simple fact that you can just terminate
it at will for any reason okay you
terminate it say I don't want to deal
with deal this anymore I'm gonna go buy
my own product and review it I don't
need your samples anymore okay
okay no one's making you sign this thing
right so then going back to the specific
product naming do you have a personal
opinion on should a specific product be
named or a specific time line be given
versus this kind of blanket agreement
not really I think it depends on the
situation it's definitely more efficient
to do it this way because that way you
have one agreement you're done you sign
it you never have to do another one
because you know although people might
believe invidious pockets are bottomless
I assure you they're not and spending
wasted money on lawyers do redraft this
thing it's a waste of money a waste of
money is a waste of money so why do it
more than once when clearly this seems
to work and any party can cancel anytime
so I don't really see the point of doing
a new one for every single product
although I guess if they wanted to do
that that's fine but they both seem to
work to me sure so let's do a couple
more here there's one that said they
were pointing out that the document
defines confidential information as
follows and I quote it then they say
that this covers information from an
Nvidia as well as from engineers or
partners which I think we've discussed
already and the answer is it does not
seem to cover partners no it says this
agreement is actually quite specific
that despite popular opinion and it says
the units between disclose between the
disclosing party which is Nvidia and any
other subs and you or whoever the
recipient is it doesn't include anybody
else so if let's say a sous or MSI or
gigabyte we're to tell you one of their
engineers were to tell you something
about an upcoming GPU or whatever they
want to tell you about that's not
covered under this this agreement
doesn't apply to stuff that somebody
else tells you it only applies to
something in video or tell you which
makes sense considering it you can't
force somebody else into an agreement if
they're not a party to it so right and
then last year so oh this we should
mention this so one of the comments was
and video could decide GPP or whatever
is a trade secret or confidential
information prevent journalists from
speaking about it so trade secret and
confidential information or two
different things
I suppose we should know yeah there yeah
I don't and there's a lot of things
wrong with that comment but we can kind
of unpack that in a second sure so trade
secret can nvidia just decide
theoretically this this specific thing
that makes us look bad is actually a
trade secret so first off either impact
the phrase betrayed secret treats you
good as a specific legal term that were
that refers to certain things which are
covered but they aren't covered under
copyright patent or copyright patent or
trademark they would cover other random
things a good example of trade secret be
the coca-cola formula that's coveted in
a trade secret it's something they have
to keep secret like really secret in
order for it to have certain protection
it's done at the state level so you've
heard the kind of this old story that uh
no one really knows the formula to
coca-cola like two people know half the
formula
you got a that's kind of the idea so if
it was a true trade secret they wouldn't
be telling you because then it wouldn't
be a trade secret anymore
so that's got to unpack that now with
respect to confidential information yes
technically whatever they tell you they
could say this is confidential
information don't tell anybody but
here's a problem with something like GPP
when it becomes public knowledge you can
tell anybody you want so when somebody
breaks the story of GPP it's free it's
fair you know it's open it's open season
for that you can do whatever you want to
do on GPP or whatever it else face they
say sure I should note that GPB
specifically no one had any
communication with Nvidia about this so
it's it's not like there was official
information that would have been
embargoed anyway right this would kind
of go back into the prior question of if
a board partner tells you something is
it covered no it's not so if there was
another GPP GPP - and it was something
super horrible and Zeus told you hey
Steve there's this horrible thing in
videos making us do and sacrifice our
children well you could talk about that
because that board partner told you
NVIDIA didn't tell you so that's fine uh
so it wouldn't really cover something
like that I mean yes technically you
could say they could they can call
anything confidential information that's
fine it's up to them but at the same you
know if the reduce but think of it this
way if you're writing this agreement
you're too specific
you need to rewrite it again if it's
something that comes up that you can't
think of and again there are plenty of
ways you can get out of this there are
you know a through e of different ways
that this doesn't apply the best of
which is public information or it's not
from or if it's not even from an Nvidia
so that's really not something I'd
particularly worry about right and also
to be fair here if Nvidia is doing
something truly awful they're not gonna
tell us exactly you know I feel like
people always assume lowest common
denominator like they're like the
brain-dead they're not brain-dead if
there was something really horrible they
wouldn't tell you I read this NDA that's
simple it's not really all that onerous
and you can always say no so general
discussion likelihood of enforcing what
is realistic enforcement I can speak to
this a bit so if we let's say we break
this NDA let's say there is something
like GPB - and for whatever reason
Nvidia says hey gamers Nexus
confidentially we're actually screwing
over all of our board partners but don't
tell anyone - you know to some extent
one people can find ways to get that
information out without implicating
themselves if we're being real here and
obviously you always have to be careful
that kind of thing you don't know who
else they've told maybe they've only
told you but if there's something truly
awful I believe from our standpoint
media you have an obligation to 1
validate that and make sure it's true
with a lot of sources and 2 if it is
true you find a way to publish it
whether it's directly or indirectly and
you worry about figuring out how this
NDA may or may not apply in that
specific circumstance rather than just
fabricating the scenario and planning
forth way ahead of time because again
they probably are gonna tell us we're
doing awful things so that's more like
they come from a third party so
likelihood of enforced in what is
enforcement I think typically the most
realistic breach of this would be so
impulsive you a day early and they might
say oops it was an accident
timezones I'm sorry sir always
configured wrong whatever realistically
Nvidia will probably as long as the
publication takes that article down as
soon as possible they're probably not
going to sue them they might stop
sampling them or my delay sampling in
the future or something like that but an
actual lawsuit just speaking in terms of
what we've seen in the industry is
incredibly unlikely for an honest
mistake for a for a dishonest mistake
maybe they publish it early just because
they want the views in the clicks the
most likely mode of enforcement for this
kind of thing is always going to be
pulling sampling not suing everybody on
the planet so I think that's probably
the the most likely scenario of
something being breached is that that
person will no longer be in the loop on
future product developments and also as
we mentioned early don't have to keep
this agreement you can walk out at any
time tell them I don't want it don't
have to sign it to begin with and I
really don't personally speaking I don't
see a huge problem with it the way it's
presented the only kind of Hanner on
that we've kind of discussed was the
specific phrase or was it to the benefit
of Nvidia for the benefit of solely for
the benefit of Nvidia and who knows what
that means I don't like it because I am
Who I am but you know I in reading this
I wouldn't be terribly concerned about
it because it seems like that's really
focusing more on here are seven
different reasons or whatever a through
H reasons that sixty situations where
you're not allowed to do this I'd focus
way more on that than solely for the
benefit of but you know right and which
has potential neutral yeah yeah I think
is whenever you're looking at something
like this there's always a chance that
somebody's gonna interpret it
differently than you do if you're
looking at as a reasonable person and
will coming from the perspective of an
attorney I look at this and go okay
whatever it doesn't seem it makes me go
maybe they shouldn't have used that word
but it's not something where you know I
have a ton of red flags go off and
you'll don't don't sign this it's
horrible I don't know it doesn't Simek a
big deal to me
right and we should also a final note
here whenever any of these contracts
come across desks keep in mind that
there's a good possibility that people
receiving them will make changes so the
one that Heiser has published isn't
necessarily the same that everyone has
agreed to because one Nvidia sometimes
will send out documents with changes for
specific regions and to the receiving
outlets could request changes as well so
so these can be slightly modified
depending on who you talk to but I think
that pretty much covers it well I don't
know any any closing thoughts or you
think we got it all I think we pretty
much got at all I mean I'll be honest
this kind of seems like making a
mountain of a molehill I don't really
see the big deal about all of this I
mean I guess it makes for more
interesting news day but it seems like a
pretty boring NDA to me but what you
know what do I know
okay well that's that's Jack our legal
correspondent Thank You Jack for joining
