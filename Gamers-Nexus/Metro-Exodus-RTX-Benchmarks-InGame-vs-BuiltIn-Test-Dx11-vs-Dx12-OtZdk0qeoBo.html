run-through for graphics analysis and
looking at our TX on versus off high
versus ultra you can check our other
video on that but what we haven't
published yet other than today is the
benchmark performance so today we're
looking at a lot of performance
characteristics of Metro Exodus this is
wide-reaching we look at dx11 versus
dx12 scaling how do they perform versus
one another look at dx12 scaling across
multiple settings like with the 2080 CI
we got built-in benchmark versus in game
and manual benchmarking and which one is
sort of more reliable and then we're
also talking about our TX scaling across
all current r-tx compatible 20 series
devices so that's our roundup for
today's benchmarks with Metro Exodus and
let's get started with the built-in
versus the in-game benchmark before that
this video is brought to you by the EVGA
CLC 280 liquid cooler people ask me how
I keep cool during the summer with all
this hair well I've tried a lot of
different products and if you do exactly
what I need many of them cause tangles
or worse EVGA CLC 280 helps keep my core
temperatures low they're in hot
benchmarking sessions the CLC 280 is
price competitive and focuses on
performance for value offering a 280
liquid cooler at an affordable price get
yours at the link in the description
below hair mounting kit sold separately
getting into this one so we noticed a
couple of really important things here
that should be pointed out first you
have to restart between all changes in
Metro Exodus it does have some issues
with applying the shape this is really
not abnormal for game testing but Metro
Exodus in particular it has some some
odd performance behaviors if you don't
restart between even resolution changes
sometimes so this isn't a hundred
percent of the time there but the
randomness of the performance anomalies
and by anomalies I mean sometimes a
little hard lock to 60fps and it's just
it's not because of B sync you can force
vsync off and global settings and env CP
whatever doesn't matter sometimes
they'll just hard lock and there's no
fix for it and that can be from not
restarting between changes they can be
from other things too that are less
obvious like having desktop resolution
or monitor resolution different from
game resolution so if you have an FPS
lock that might be it it can be from
scaling and windows stuff like that it's
got some weird bugs and quirks in there
and then separately we did have issues
with the benchmark occasionally locking
to an odd 62.5 fps very specific number
that was resolved by walking away and
coming back later so we're not sure why
that CUF fixed but it did so this this
already was off to a start where there's
that kind of benchmark anxiety of can I
even trust my numbers because I don't
know if I can trust the game we got it
to a point where we trust it
unfortunately I couldn't tell you how we
got it there just it took a lot of just
weird troubleshooting effort and one of
the things worked so anyway that's what
we're looking at also the first
benchmark run is often inaccurate it
scores lower than the rash we'll talk
about that today too so let's let's
start off here with that built in versus
in-game testing and show the differences
between the two one of the most
important things to look at with major
game launches is whether the built-in
bench mark is actually reliable with
final fantasy we discovered that the
game had improperly called objects to
the extent that they affected
performance from miles away horribly
inaccurate to actual gameplay with other
games like 6 we found that the turn time
benchmarks are actually pretty realistic
the gameplay for metro Exodus will start
by checking actual in-game performance
versus the benchmark scene we're
starting with only the 20 atti at 4k
resolution scaling across low to extreme
settings and with varying r-tx
configurations we found that the built
in benchmark operated at only 84 FPS
average with the 28 ETI at 4k and lowest
settings with r-tx off mind you whereas
our in-game testing posed in 152 FPS
average performance results pretty big
difference there as always this is
tested multiple times an average for
parity and these numbers are very
consistent at this point at medium
settings Authority acts off we found
reports to decay to 72 FPS average for
the built-in test and 118 FPS average
for the actual gameplay this further
drops to 60 FPS average for high
settings or the built-in benchmark and
94 FPS average for the in-game test for
the next data point we have to highlight
something important with ultra settings
and r-tx off we're still at 87 FPS
average which is technically better than
the built-in benchmarks 84 FPS average
at low settings so you can kind of
visual line there from one to the next
and see how big of a hit there is for
running the benchmark versus actual
gameplay if ever there were any question
as to whether the built-in bench work is
an accurate depiction of gameplay this
answers it by three entire drops and
graphics quality settings for extreme
settings we hit 70 FPS average without
any arch acts enabled and 40 FPS with
all graphics settings completely maxed
you'll see that at the end of the charge
but as we descend in between those two
we eventually see that the r-tx 20 atti
hits 53 FPS average with r-tx on high
and graphic set to ultra with in-game
performance vs. 36 for the built-in
tests we then hit 48 FPS averages our TX
ultra adop about 9% from high and we
show the differences between high and
ultra visually and qualitatively in our
previous content piece but we'll show
some of those as refreshers here and on
average the differences are minimal
between high and ultra but you do have
about a 9% hit so all of that sets the
scale for us we'll show some more
footage from our qualitative comparison
while explaining some of this as for
what it all means it's pretty
straightforward as long as the card to
card scaling remains equally spaced in
the built-in test as it is in the game
for example at 20 atti retains X percent
lead over a Radeon 7 in both tests where
X does not change then it is acceptable
as a synthetic gauge of performance it
is not however useful as an absolute
gauge of performance for this game so
anyone wanting to play Metro Exodus
specifically should be looking at
in-game benchmarks not the built in
benchmark it is you'll end up buying
something way higher-end than you
actually need and you might not even
think it's possible to get what you need
if you look at the in-game benchmarks
instead for comparing two cards relative
to each other though the built-in test
is still useful it just comes down to
having equidistant relative scaling
between devices as long as that exists
you can use it as a synthetic comparison
it's functionally x bi or firestrike at
this point so useful in so far as
determining the distance from one car to
the next as a percentage but not as an
absolute FPS value so we're gonna stick
with the in-game testing for the rest of
our work because it's more universally
accurate and let's look at some more
detailed performance numbers next except
for this one all tests in our bed
today are with directx12 enabled as its
required for DXR we still wanted to test
the x11 though as sometimes game
developers will lazily rap the more
abstracted api or fail to really
leverage the x12
worst cases we see some performance loss
for this one we took the RT x 28 e non
TI XC ultra and tested it at 1440p in
ultra settings with RT x again disabled
we still aren't heavily loading the cpu
here so this is very much a GPU bound
benchmark with dx11 we measured
performance at 114 FPS average 91 FPS 1
% low and 89 fps 0.1% lows the DirectX
12 in-game test put us at 112 FPS
average 84 1% lows and 79 fps 0.1% lows
that's more or less tied but we need to
look at frame times to better determine
if we're operating outside of variants
as always frame time plots show us frame
to frame present intervals to get the
best picture of per second experience of
gameplay lower is better in frame time
but consistency is more important than
just being lower for this one we see
that DirectX 12 testing plots us at
starting around 8 milliseconds then
climbs to around 10 milliseconds
eventually hits 12 millisecond frame
times the more important aspect is that
the spike eNOS of the frame time is
measured swings up more than DirectX 11
does as you can see here these are both
completely playable in the frame time
variants never exceeds 8 milliseconds
with dx12 enabled which means that the
average user really won't know the
difference the x11 to be fair does have
tighter frame time consistency and is
objectively better it's just that when
it comes down to it the objective
superiority doesn't really matter in
this context it's measurable but it's
not perceivable to the end user for a
seems to have roughly equal performance
in the x12 and dx11
maybe slightly favoring the x11 on
average now that we've whittled down
testing to just focusing on DirectX 12
we can look at graphics settings and
r-tx scaling more granularly for in-game
testing performance scaling from the 20
atti @ 4k shows reasonably strong
results at 4k ultra with r-tx off giving
us an 87 FPS average this grants high
settings with our TX off a gain of about
7 to 8% against ultra settings or ultra
a gain of about 25% against extreme
settings we think that ultra is the best
middle ground on average
at least for hire ish and devices
considering that extreme shows severe
performance fall-off medium is another
major step where there's a severe change
for medium to high but texture and
shadow quality really start to become
noticeably bad with medium settings for
ultra settings with r-tx off our 87 FPS
average is 65 percent higher than older
settings with r-tx on its lowest setting
which anybody calls high presumably
because nvidia does not want to dirty
its brand with an option named low even
though it's basically low and high in
this case if you prefer to look at it
the other way it's about a 40%
performance drop from r-tx off and going
to ultra drags us down an additional 8%
from our TX high rendering even in game
frame rates undesirable the impact of
our TX appears to minimally be about 40%
FPS a loss - 45 % loss at Ultra as for
what that gets you again we'll show some
of our footage for our previous
technical analysis of the graphics
quality where I was joined by Andrew on
our team to talk about the qualitative
look at the games visuals the end result
is that some scenes particularly those
outside where light bounces off snow for
a less faked global illumination we get
additional contrast some more gradual
shadow gradients like across the chest
of one of the characters on the front of
the Train for instance and in other
scenes like the actual namesake Metro of
the game Metro Exodus there is
functionally zero impact from RT acts
and visuals to the point that it's just
confuse you won't wonder if it's broken
because there's still 40 to 50 percent
hit the framerate in exchange for
nothing you can learn more about the
visual appearance differences in our
previous video on the channel and of
course subscribe if we do any follow-ups
but let's move on to another test a
quick note before progressing further we
noticed that the first round of a
benchmark would produce numbers
sometimes 8 to 10 FPS lower than
subsequent benchmark runs and this is
for in-game testing so these mostly
averaged out when considering multi pass
test approaches but just be aware that
your first exposure to a new area may be
at a lower frame rate than repeated or
prolonged exposures to those areas the
numbers that have been on the screen now
sort of demonstrate that we can see a
bit of performance fall-off on that
first run and then some crack
shortly after that this doesn't always
happen but it happens probably about 90
plus percent of the time our t acts are
only testing is next for this because
we're specifically looking at our TX
scaling card to card the charts will be
limited to only compatible 20 series
devices at 1080p ultra with our TX set
too high because Ultra just seems kind
of pointless the 2080 ti tops the chart
at 138 FPS average with lows at 99 FPS
and 94 fps 1% in 0.1% these are good
numbers overall and reasonably
consistent so frame time pacing isn't
suffering here that said compared to our
TX off numbers we are still obviously
taking a large performance hit the 2018
non TI ends up at 114 FPS average
allowing the 2080 ti elite of 21% and
leading the are TX 2070 s 90 FPS average
white 26.6% the 2070 then leads the 26
these 80 FPS average by 13% this gap is
much less impressive than the previous
two and considering our review of the RT
X 2060 we know that an overclocked 2060
could somewhat easily catch the stock 27
a performance granted you could also
overclock the 2070 but it's not hard to
get baseline stock performance out of an
overclocked 2060 1440p is next for these
settings the RT X 28 e TI fe ends up at
101 FPS average posting a loss of about
13 percent from the previous chart lows
are still tightly timed and within
reason the RT x 2080 runs at 77 fps
average granting the 28 e TI elite of
32% this impressive gap should widen as
resolution continues to increase the 27
t ends up at 60 FPS average and the 2060
isn't far behind
demonstrating significant value when
considered against the 2070 again a
quick overclock would balance things
here but the distance between a 2060 OC
and a 2070 is much less than a 2070 OC
and the 2080 keep in mind further that
drop-in settings too high from ultra for
the preset not for the RT X preset would
give us some performance back although
RT X is responsible for eradicating the
majority of framerate the last chart is
almost embarrassingly barren but to be
fair it's really not our fault
at some level notably below 30 fps it
sort of stops becoming
to test the lower end video cards at 4k
ultra and with our TX set to high the
r-tx 20 80 TI leads the 20 80 by about
36% this again expands its lead as the
r-tx 2080 begins to fall behind from the
sheer pixel throughput but both devices
are struggling in the face of our TX
enablement still it's far more playable
than the pre-built benchmark scenes
dropping settings would make this a bit
easier but it makes the most sense to
just disable our TX altogether if in
desperate need of a higher FPS at 4k for
example a 20 80 is perfectly capable of
4k with a reasonable FPS in this game
you would just have to turn our TX off
for this game the graphics difference
qualitatively there is a pretty
significant difference and I speak about
this with Andrew in our other video
where we look at the graphics quality
visual quality is there a noticeable
difference of perceivable difference in
the game when you toggle our TX on
versus off so for high vs. ultra versus
off there's really not that much of a
difference there is about a 10 percent
performance hit by going from high to
ultra you can see the difference if you
really look at it but at some point if
you have to be sitting there with your
face three inches away from the monitor
looking at each quadrant of the screen
to find the difference the difference is
irrelevant so for that reason we would
generally suggest if you want to use our
TX going with high instead of ultra and
just taking the extra frames because
that's going to be worth more to you
than the often in perceivable
differences of ultra now again they do
exist but it's at a level where if
you're actually genuinely playing the
game which we weren't we were looking
for these differences you're probably
not on average going to notice so that's
the first item of note the second one is
that in some scenarios in the game like
again the metro we talked about the
actual metro it's uncommon to see these
differences materialized but the
performance difference does materialize
so where you won't notice any visual
impact you will notice a framerate
impact to the tune of about a 65 percent
improvement with our TX disabled or if
you prefer to calculate in the other
direction because stat math is funny and
sometimes misleading it's about a 40%
reduction from the baseline off so you
weight how you want depend on how you
want
make the numbers look I guess but that's
what you're working with but that's not
the only type of experience in the game
the Metro of course there were
significant visual differences in sort
of the overworld like the train hub
level where you've got that ray bounces
off of the snow they hit characters and
if you don't know what r-tx global
illumination is well that's what the
toggle does when you enable RTX in this
particular game it's the first
implementation of our TX GI global
illumination is most commonly showcased
as it was with Nvidia's presentation by
using sort of multicolored objects
within a room maybe you have a big area
light above it and you can get some sort
of like color casting where when the
light shines down on the objects or on a
wall or whatever you'll get almost a
radiative glow off of the object of the
wall and we'll show some footage of one
of those just to illustrate what it does
and and what you're looking at so that
would be a global illumination
demonstration that's what you get with
Metro not does some other things too
like again bouncing Ray's off the snow
to illuminate the underside of things or
to illuminate characters where normally
you would have to sort of fake the
graphics by putting in maybe a hidden or
an invisible light source on one side of
the train for instance to create the
illusion of global illumination without
the cost of really doing it in a real
way so r-tx is an interesting way for
developers to achieve global
illumination or other effects without
putting in manual effort is it worth it
well most the audience is still playing
without r-tx even if you own the cards
you might drop it for performance so
it'll be a while before we see this
really wide spread and a lot of
developers will probably on average
still be using those the cheats and
that's really what game graphics is it's
all about cheating the graphics to make
it look as real as possible because if
you went for true realism it's just not
going to be something you can render in
real time so r-tx finds a middle ground
there and sometimes it works incredibly
well like in some of the outside scenes
sometimes it's completely nebulous and
up for debate like inside the Train or
actually the front of the Train
personally speaking subjectively
I prefer to RTX off I thought it looks
better now that might be because I'm
trained to looking at games the way
they're made today on average but I
thought it looks better so I would turn
it off and then there are other place
where it's just it's a very clear
there's no benefit like in the Metro so
there are three very specific scenarios
of objectively just superior and then
completely subjective you might not like
it and then there's no value at all and
because of that mix of things plus the
performance we're seeing we wouldn't
necessarily let me rephrase that we
would not recommend buying an RTI X card
just because you want to use RT X yet
now if this starts to become more
widespread if it doesn't become another
abandoned and video technology it may
well be worth it if you're a developer
if you're someone in graphics if you're
in 3d art there's a whole host of
reasons you could argue RT X is worth it
but if you're a gamer then metro on its
own is not really a good enough reason
but either way you have some benchmarks
now for Metro so you can see what it
looks like
RT X is at least starting to get
implementations in games we can't fault
in video for that because we did fault
and video for not implementing in games
previously so they're moving in the
right direction RT x does provide some
value sometimes it's not enough quite
yet but it's clearly finally getting
some spread so we'll see how it develops
there's a lot more to look at here
we'll be back not too long from now with
more RT x content to kind of look at how
it's advancing and if this is something
that we need to pay more attention to
for the future so that's it for this one
thank you for watching as always you can
subscribe for more we'll probably have
one more content piece on Metro here it
depends on how how drivers and things
like that work out but we might return
with one more piece we have an idea on
so subscribe for that one you go to
store documents access net to pick up
for example our brand new medium mod
matte which is at time of filming in
stock though they're selling quickly so
you might be on backorder buy but we'll
get more in stock shortly and that's it
for this one I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
