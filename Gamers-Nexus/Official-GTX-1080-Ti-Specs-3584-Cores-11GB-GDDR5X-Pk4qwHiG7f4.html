just received in Shenzhen just goes for
off-site right now I've got the basics I
have a core specs some of the
architecture information though it is
largely the same as Pascal as you would
expect because it is Pascal so the 1080p
I differs primarily from the 1080 non ti
in memory and sm count we'll go over a
couple of other things in this video
before getting to that this coverage is
brought to you by a thermaltake and
their contact 12 silent cooler which can
be had for around 25 bucks on amazon
newegg or elsewhere if you are
interested in that we'll have a link of
the description below so for the most
immediate items of import with the 1080
TI we're looking at a memory
configuration of 11 gigabytes total
memory that is GD r 5x so it is not hbm
2 and this decision was made for a few
reasons that will go over G 5x is
clocked to 11 gigabits per second
banking it's about a gigabit per second
faster than the 1080 HD 5x memory
looking at 12 billion transistors for
the GPU core and it is a 250 watt TDP
250 amps going through there and that
amperage is delivered via a 7 phase dual
set design so the power design on the
GTX 1080p I is using it to phase two
that's per phase which means that you
are spreading out one heat so he'd
spread over a larger surface area which
of course helps with reducing the heat
in a specific area and that aids in the
coolers ability to dissipate said heat
the cooler has improved by the way
according to Nvidia of about by about
five degrees Celsius at 35 DBA so that
is a per noise level value and will do
further testing on suis have the card
the air channels were clean that this
was done in a few ways one was removing
DVI so if you look at the back of the
card you'll notice it no longer has DVI
this reduces the amount of stuff in the
way of the air of course but it also
does mean that they are trying to
account for the loss of DVI by shipping
with a DP to DVI dongle so you will have
that option if you're still running TV I
dual-link or otherwise that has been
accounted for we don't currently have
price will be getting that later tonight
so if you want another price hit the
link in the description
for the article because i will update
that immediately when we have the price
you will find that they're not in this
video since we're following for price
was given other core specs looking at 28
SMS I believe off top my head that is
3584 cores it's 28 x 128 cuda cores per
SM so that's still the same architecture
still the same sm layout 128 x 28
somewhere around 3584 cores so bit more
cores eight total more SMS then the gtx
1080 non TI and other items that are
worth knowing include the we've got
memory capacity 11 gigabytes speed 11
gigabits per second also in the realm of
speed this is regarding the 1080 and
1060 not the TI but is important to know
there will be new overclocking SKUs
offered to a ICS and a IV partners and
for the 1080 and 1060 and those skis are
specifically for memory overclocking
this is a first friend vidya that means
that the new skis are offered to the
partners as they adopt them and start
selling products will move 29 gigabit
per second to gddr5 for gtx 1060 cards
and will move up to 11 gigabits per
second for the gtx 1080s or for
previously 10 gigabits per second that
is still gddr5 x 45 x for an easier
version the price for the founders
edition will be the same as MSRP this
time so instead of having a founders
edition price that is special and
separate from MSRP and vidya is now
doing both all MSRP is insane for
everything that addition is the same as
MSRP so hopefully that reduces some of
the confusion from the previous launch
with a 1080 y gddr5 x over hbm to it's
mostly because the HBM too in its
current state can do about 715 megahertz
or so with the memory interfaces comes
out to about 336 gigabytes per second
that is improving of course hbm to
industries working on that and NVIDIA
does ship hbm to just not on gaming
product g5 x is ahead of where hbm to is
today in terms of memory bandwidth and
raw throughput potential especially at
the price that is one of the reasons you
end up even if the one gigahertz range
for hbm to still on up around for 84 vs
512 gigabytes
in roughly the same ballpark hbm 2 is
also limited on capacity and that was a
big deal for on video they wanted to do
a larger capacity moving up from the
1080 of course so they are looking at
and 11 gigabytes is eight and HP m2
you'd be limited to eight so that covers
that all the news we have currently
there will be more coverage in the
article link in the description below
founders edition boards will still exist
I will still be called founders edition
they're probably using fairchilds bats
for the fetes still waiting to get one
and a hand so we can tear it down of
course and do the full review check back
subscribe to make sure you get the
review once we post it thank you for
watching subscribe for more patriotic
last game ourselves not directly I will
see you all next time
