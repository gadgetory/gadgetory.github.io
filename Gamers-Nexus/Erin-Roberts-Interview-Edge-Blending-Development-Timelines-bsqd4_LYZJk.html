this is now the third time you've heard
me say this we spoke with chris spoke
with sean and now we're speaking with
aaron roberts from the UK office Aaron
how's it going oh really well thank you
very much yes yeah well good evening
before getting to that all this coverage
is brought to you by antec and their new
cube MITx case as designed by razor
which is shown on the screen now
supports full custom loop watercooling
you can learn more on the link below so
the demo was a pretty big deal from what
we saw here today what can you talk
about some of the stuff you had more
directly hands-on with or your studio
had hands-on with and it's I mean so
basically a lot of the tip to tech from
the demo came from the German office in
terms of the actual procedural and plan
of attack which is you know a
better is the main guy who did that sort
of work and then you have Caston and
there's a feel the Russian sofa working
on the office I'm sorry first-name basis
here but but these guys were like you
know they'd lock tech a lot of them it
worked very heavily for your ramen
artists and there's there's a one or two
in the German office but actually a lot
of the environment artists or so in the
UK office in the UK and the German
officers are very close in fact both
foundry 42 is one kind of studio until
we work very closely and so between the
two officers we spent a lot of time
putting that stuff together what sort of
content were you working on leading up
to the demo what was sort of their what
was your primary focus for the
planetside demo well we wanted to show
the ability because we showed in
gamescom literally what we called like
the one of you know just basically yeah
we've got like procedure planet here it
is and it looks quite good but we want
to go a step further with the v2 stuff
and actually creates start you know
creating levels which are almost like
you know almost like a crisis level
which you see on the ground on a to
plonk square map but we want to do that
on a planetary scale and then and then
I'm from a planet rescale you want to do
that on a system wide scale an assistant
way I want to go to a you know a you
know universes I know a galaxy ceylon so
fun event and so it's about creating
that technology and so a lot of the work
that we put in today was literally we
have any of that at Gamescom this is all
stuff we're working on and it's just you
know there might be what about 64 great
week since then and that's kind of
testament to the technology what we can
do that we can she create a bunch of
this stuff and put it together and put
that kinda stuff together that's been
that
and that's because of a lot of the time
we spent on the technology over the last
18 months of building all this kind of
stuff we just didn't have before
changing stuff though you know we've
talked about it 64 bit like we had to
get all that basis in there to be able
to do all this cool stuff so just since
gamescom all this stuff has been
developed in that time yeah I mean I see
the technology's been longer term but in
terms of the content yes a lot of stuff
I mean we obviously have a javelin which
we then sort of like smashed up and
broke up but that was created and we did
lots all this kind of stuff and things
you know and that's what literally in
terms of putting that together in that
way was put together them actually with
them not a large team because a lot of
the focus actually it's been on squadron
42 we're still working through and
obviously when plants show a bunch of
that stuff later but actually that team
we just want to show what we can do with
new technology and actually it's just
the start of it because we even even
with the environments we have now
they're just really just it's just a bit
of R&amp;amp;D work for from five or six
currently no environment artist just
working out how we can make stuff look
and so we know that when we actually get
the route you know when we're really
into the production pipeline are making
these planets and so forth we can just
start some amazing and sort of planets
and so far for things like that what are
some of the challenges with the biome
system where you have in this example of
the homestead demo there are multiple
different types of biomes on one planet
it's one of some challenges you run into
it there yeah I mean I mean I you know a
lot of blending in terms of going and
also because you've got a scale of you
know you know you know a lot of the sort
of memory restrictions and then
basically the streaming side of the sort
of like because you have to create the
sort of like they have the memory to do
that and then also you have to blend
between different biomes I said so you
know you go from desert to water you're
going from you know what to do to lino
Savannah or jungle or whatever and so
for that kind of stuff so we spent a bit
of time and I said a lot of the stuff is
actually come on a lot quicker than we
fought and since that level and then
then you've got the tech guys we got
artists work with them in creating like
kind of stuff do you have this sort of
levels of you know some days people go
oh you're working on this and then this
L come look at this for three days later
and then just season we go you know wow
you know that kind of stuff amends when
they actually put the stuff together
along with for a lot of the you know
it's not just about I guess the
environment textures as well it's about
the whole environment so you know the
way the Sun react so you can see when
the sun goes low it goes red white kind
of stuff
like I mean Sean said the thing we kind
of get that for free which is it on fact
there's a lot check work behind it but
then you have like we've got cloud
layers coming on and even the clouds we
have now I'm nowhere near what we will
have where we want a lot more substance
and stuff we're going to have like
weather systems already we're working on
you know we're working on actual you
know procedural ways to actually have
different weather systems and finish
effective when you're going on planet
you can just all of a sudden on a basis
you might you know one day you might go
down to do something the next day you go
tell the coaches location is very
dangerous to the weather pattern coming
through and we can have all that kind of
stuff we're trying to run through the
plans to make to make the whole planet
exploration really sort of fun and you
know an interesting alright well so that
last point reminds me of the sandstorm
we saw in the demo so that's an example
where it gets dangerous exactly yeah can
you talk more about the sandstorm that
was in a demo what I mean we literally
once again it so when we decide we want
we wanted to show people the kind of
stuff that all happen on planets Robin
just like oh you go to some place you
you dig up some dirt you find some
mineral we wanted to have like no you go
down and and we can actually place
interesting areas and sometimes you go
there and they'll be an encounter of
some type they'll be you know it could
be visit crashed in a javelin and
there's no one there that can be people
there sometimes there could be a
sandstorm coming through let it be a
huge worm which happens to be around you
be careful work and we want to create
this all very sort of like them you know
a procedural way of just basically
making what all this of like you know
systemic way of just having all these
different things happening and depending
what happens and depends on where you
are what time of day different things
happen and that's the real key about you
know to make it really interesting in
the world's really cool so for more
information as always link in the
description below Erin thank you for
joining me well thank you very much and
we'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
