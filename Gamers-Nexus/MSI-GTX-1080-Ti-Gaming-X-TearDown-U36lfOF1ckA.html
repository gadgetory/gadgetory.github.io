1080p eye gaming X which I have right
here so this is a new TI model it's
still a twin pros are cooler but the
difference here versus the 1080 gaming X
the non TI this heatsink is a whole lot
fatter so the aluminum fins here are a
lot wider in both directions and it is a
it will consume more space on the board
and and the expansion slots now for
comparison I have here a 390 X version
of MSI is cooler from a couple
generations ago in design it's a bit
different on the face of things but it
is similarly fat so this is not the
first time MSI has gone this direction
we're going to be taking the gaming X
apart the 1080 I should say and a few
things are gonna be done with this one
how good is the cooler implementation
and 2 we're going to be sending over PCB
shots to build Zoid who will be doing a
PCB env RM analysis for us and we'll be
uploading that on our channel shortly so
stay tuned for that as let's get started
the gaming X I should say a 1080i gaming
X because they're all gaming access
times I the 1080 TI gaming act is the
same setup as all the other ones screws
in the back plate for it in the center
for securing the heatsink these are
spring tension screws and then we
shouldn't really have to mess with a
whole lot else before getting to the
teardown this is brought to you by our
patreon backers you can go to
patreon.com/scishow and access if you'd
like to help us out with videos like
this one and build Zoids and all the
others because that funding helps us
produce more content so
patreon.com/scishow and axis if you'd
like to help out there and a side note
there we have a new merch store and
anyone who is a current patreon backer
of the dollar amounts to find on the
page I have probably reached out to you
with a shirt offer if you don't already
have one so keep an eye on your inboxes
or message me if not let's get to it so
this thing Phillips screws all over the
back side we have stupid star screws in
the shroud fortunately these are not
relevant to what we're doing today we do
not need to remove these I don't think
anyway I believe removing these will
basically pull out that LED plate so
those aren't important not
mission-critical but they are there
so it's worth pointing out if you wanted
to take the entire thing apart to paint
it or something you would need those I
also of note GeForce GTX is on all these
cards now so I'm not sure that's an
Nvidia agreement of some kind let's go
ahead and start with the dismantling
process just enough to loosen things
no okay so with this card in order to
sometimes you can just loosen these four
and get the heatsink off and then the
rest are just for attention on the
backplate this one we will actually have
to remove all of these as well
because actually the screwed down
straights it's pretty clearly that that
longer screw length means we're going
through the backplate which is fairly
thick actually this time through the PCB
and then into the base plate and the
base plate is of course what actually is
cooling things like the VRMs and the
MOSFETs and all that stuff all the
different parts of the vrm now one thing
here part of this project is so we can
do thermal analysis because we're going
to be mounting thermocouples to the
MOSFETs and the PCB backside again like
we've been doing the last couple of
cards now that will allow us to see not
only how well does the GPU cool because
that's kind of important but not as much
as it used to be but how well does the
vrm cool which is something we've become
very interested in in the last year or
so two four five seven nine eleven plus
four so fifteen fifteen screws to the
backside eleven of them are retention
screws right does it have thermal pads
on it question number one no it has
bumpers on it these are rubber bumpers
the offset height is actually compact
anything that is the question no the
answer is no there's no contact
so that's questionable yet so this
backplate is for looks fortunately there
is a bit of dissipation area here to get
rid of some of the heat on the back side
and the back side does get really hot on
these things for the most part so
depending on how efficiently the front
side is cooled which we'll soon find out
we've even got some caps on the backside
over here
depending on how things go over on the
front side this could potentially trap
heat and increase temperature on the
back side of the PCB but that's not
always the case depends on the rest of
the cooling solution so we will find
that out for our full review and not
speculate further just keep in mind
you'll want to check back for the full
review to see how the back plate works
because I'll do a be testing with it on
and with it off and we'll have a probe
on the backside die action measure the
backside temperatures because the back
plate for GPU doesn't really affect the
GPU core temperature that's not the
point of it it would affect if anything
the backside temperature so that's where
it is now we have to take out the screws
for the i/o the expansion mount and put
those in the bottom right corner there
are three of these Phillips and then two
for DVID excuse me four Phillips and two
for DVID these are five millimeter I
miss though the top side screws that's
different okay so this is a little
different from what we normally see they
have decided to retain the i/o cover
with screws on the top side it's a
little too small
rather than the the back side is what we
normally see - that's really interesting
okay so this swings out like a door io
our expansion cover there and
interestingly this thing sweeps over for
a support bar which just seems really
like a whole lot of material to hold
this thing on so that's a bit different
from normally but I suppose it's
because of how massive this card is they
probably need the support anywhere they
can get it to make sure it's not going
to rip things off the board when you
mount it I'm going to leave the card
flat and see if we can pull this off we
can and we're going to get caught by the
cables which is one over here for the
LED it looks like I'll know in a second
and then there are two over here now
that was a c5 okay so I got that off now
that the PCB is exposed do a tap on the
wrist strap over here so what we've got
actually this kind of interesting
looking I'm excited that's that's one
thermally couple things here one we have
two fan headers I believe we'll find out
and a power header over here which is
probably for the LEDs and actually how
this would not be hard to verify where
is this going
this cable is up is it going to the LED
this cable goes to the LED okay
so easily verified so this cable here
right there that four pin despite being
a four pin is going to the LEDs right
here the MSI nameplate and then this
cable definitely goes to the fans that
connects over here this is another power
cable only black and red so where does
that go
might be another LED or something not
too important right now it's over the
cooling design clearly we have a massive
aluminum heatsink there's your cold
plate
I would guess with 99% confidence this
is nickel plated copper and
interestingly that's screwed in to what
looks like a retention bracket for the
rest of the heatsink we'll see let's see
what that actually does
if this is held on by screws I'm not
going to be impressed but I don't think
it is okay so it's more than screws too
high like this for it is soldered to the
heat pipes so that's good and it looks
like it's soldered which is why I'm
confused
it looks like it's soldered to the
aluminum fins as well wants to point
that
yeah I'm not sure the point of that is
but okay we've got our thermal pads
which are actually clearly making
contact here so a few things here this
is your set of inductive or your chokes
as a really fat they're all bad on it it
looks like it maybe a two-millimeter one
of the biggest ones I've seen on a video
card looks like two millimeters I think
that is a two millimeter they're all pad
it looks like two two millimeters for
jokes and inductors we're in the same
thing capacitor banks right here that is
not a believe that is not receiving
direct contact instead they have a
channel here milled out of the heatsink
fin so you can see this this part right
here is actually taller than this part
nothing special defends they're not
l-shaped or anything like that just
spins so these are cooled by air
exclusively does that contact is
actually we can just look at it and see
yes is it yeah that makes contact so
there's a slight indent so those make
contact to this that would be kind of
dumb if they didn't but it would also
not be the first time we've seen that in
the past year these pads contact the
MOSFETs which there are a million of
them they'll do it again we'll analyze
for us and then these two over here are
contacting the components on this side
with anything else nothing else special
going on so I throw these two screws
back in and then we'll pull off the rest
of the base plate okay so the base plate
is pretty interesting on this we have
this piece which is contacting the vram
and it's actually will go like orient
like that
then do it I wanted as you can see pads
pads pads pads but the one messing vram
module for a Titan XP did they put a pad
in that slot come on look at this MSI
what are you doing I don't know if they
do they make a Titan XP card with this
design if they do then what they've done
is pull the design without replacing a
piece that's possible actually do they
let's look it up no I don't think they
make one I don't think they make one of
these for a Titan X card so what that
means is they've stuck an extra thermal
pad on there which is not detrimental to
your performance but is pointless so it
just seems kind of silly
well anyway extra thermal pad
notwithstanding what we have is a set of
DDR or gddr5 X as you would expect we'll
clean that off but it is the same GPU as
all the other 1080p is and some blank
board space up here is a larger board
most of that size is not for components
as much as it is for the massive fans
which I think are 90 millimeter fans
actually we can find that out really
quickly to 100 millimeter fans so
they're using a hundred millimeter fans
which does require extra height that's
really the main reason for it
well uncover these components for builds
or shortly and other than that is what
you would expect for a 1080i PCB so the
interesting points here this is
interesting they have decided to make a
thick what looks like aluminum back or
base plate that is separated physically
from the vrm now this I would suspect
would isolate to some extent the
temperature generated by this half of
the board and this half of the board
this have been much much higher
potential to generate a whole hell of a
lot of heat because that's what MOSFETs
do and they can also tolerate a lot more
heat so that's interesting this side
then is
taken care of by this part of the base
plate which is nickel-plated in this
part of the base plate contacts we have
thermal pads to the most part and then
is soldered it looks like to the
aluminum fins on the heatsink at which
pick point you know how the cooling
works so that's for the final piece here
just clean this off and then we'll be
able to close up shop move liquidy
thermal paste shake is enough
there's your GPU clean it up more later
maybe same GP 102 350 part as on the
founders Edition card that should not
surprise anyone at this point but it's
worth showing it so alright that's the
msi card now at this point what's left
is basically just doing the testing so
you got to do all the FPS testing and
stuff like that but of import here we've
got some thermal testing to do without
the stock setup so that would be with
our thermocouples installed we have a
standardized set of everything we do for
that one addition here I'm probably
going to try mounting a thermocouple to
one of these vram modules not sure if
I'm going to do that yet but that's
something I want to do because this is
really interesting to me how they've
isolated it of course we need
comparative metrics I wanted to do this
anyway so we'll probably start running
these retro actively on a couple of
cards or maybe just work on it with the
EVGA and the ACS cards come in and going
forward either way I'm hoping to have
some vram measurements this time in
addition to set temperature measurements
for the MOSFETs and the vrm and back
side PCB measurements which are really
just to validate that the back plate is
not complete garbage so we'll have all
that setting this photos of this off the
builds I'd he'll do the vrm and power
analysis so we should have pretty full
coverage of this card for you if you're
