director of development for the
everquest franchise at sony online
entertainment well as far as
optimization challenges go well the
obvious ones like frame rate and stuff
like that we're overcoming actually the
frame rates really good on both the
server side and the client side right
now we did decide to go fully 64-bit
operating system mostly because that
gives us access to more RAM or system
ramp and we once we made that decision
it made our lives a lot easier but
really there's one big hurdle that we're
still overcoming which is data
optimization because this is unlike a
regular static MMO kind of world the
world is constantly changing the planets
that's the whole point of the game his
players you're changing everything
around you so all that changed it has to
be constantly transmitted to everybody
in the area if you're playing the Alpha
that's when you occasionally see those
gears pop up when you're moving across
the world that's basically you
downloading a bunch of new data and so
we're optimizing that process to
minimize those kinds of gaps and that'll
be an ongoing process as we go through
alpha and closed beta well as far as
modding goes of course we're an MMO so
we don't support private servers which
is a lot of times what mod teams like to
do but we do have a lot of modding
capability inside the game because
effectively landmark is a gigantic set
of tools that you can build anything
with both the you know AI and building
and all the different things that that
we can do everything that we can do you
can do but that includes a specialty
things like you I modding tools and
things like that we want you to be able
to customize the game so that it feels
like your home the way that you want to
play it as far as NPCs go inside of
landmark there's very very few of them
we are going to have some merchant in
pcs that you'll be able to interact with
for turning resources into coin so it's
easier to barter with other players but
then there also be of course while
monsters are coming so we're going to
put risk and combat elements into the
game very very soon and that'll start to
trickle in well well name dates later on
but the but it'll ease in so that the
risk will increase slowly over time with
the game
and eventually the players will have all
the AI tools that we have so they can
start editing and crafting their own AI
templates and monster types and things
like that which they can then use with
their own landmark creations this really
is build your own world everybody wants
to know about water so we're going to
we're going to deliver water in phases
because dynamic water in a constantly
changing box alized world is extremely
difficult as a math problem and so we
have to give well it's just going to
take some time but we're going to be
able to put in static water a lot sooner
than that so there will be a lot of
bodies of water like ocean and lakes and
things like that appearing in the game
reasonably soon now that static water so
if you dig away the voxels next to it
it's just going to hang there but then
later on when we have the dynamic water
in the game which is still a little ways
off it'll start to flow across those
voxels and you'll be able to start
playing with it as a game elements
griefing in landmark is kind of an
interesting topic because there's all
kinds of new ways to grief that you're
not used to in most games like one of
the things that we were talking about
was because anybody can wander onto your
claim but they can't do anything unless
you set permissions for it it seemed
like the claim was kind of invulnerable
to griefing but it's not the case
because what they can do if they want to
be annoying is just stand right in front
of you so you can't see wherever you
wonder if you want to do so we're going
to have to set in some toggles and stuff
like that so that you can turn off the
ability to see other players on your
claim so that you can build without them
getting in the way stuff like that is a
constant exploring process as we go
through alpha and closed beta and we
expect to see more of those kinds of
things but in general most of the
mechanisms that we have for regular MMOs
chat filtering text some things like
that those all still work and we don't
have to worry too much about people
there's a thing in Oakland called this
White House which is somebody that built
right up against the fence of the of his
neighbor just to be a jerk and we wanted
to make sure that that stuff was
prevented so we have buffer zones that
go around your claim and then you can
fill up the claims based inside your
buffer zone but nobody else can unless
you give them permission so where are we
going with landmark basically landmark
is starting out with these simple
building tools but like we've said
repeatedly over
I'm everything that we can do you're
going to be able to do as we build all
the tools that we need to build for a
request next all of those tools come
over into landmarks so that you can do
all of it scenario design a I templating
monster creation all those different
things that we want to be able to do
you're going to be able to do so we're
starting here and it's amazing the way
it is and the players are making it
better just constantly they're coming up
with ways to use our tools we had no
idea you could do and because they're
doing that we expect great things when
we start rolling out like AI templating
and things like that too and well we'll
see where we go from there the players
are in constant source of amazement we
um we have a voxel and the smallest size
of a voxel in relation to a human scale
is right about like that big and you
can't build like stuff that looks really
tech with a voxel that looks that big
because the modern world has got refined
processes this is great for fantasy
building but it wasn't fantastic for
tech well the players almost immediately
figured out ways to shrink that voxel
down so that it looks like a dot and
then you can string it out to make bars
you can make these really detailed
things and that was the tip of the
iceberg they've come up with six or
seven different ways of making stuff in
the game that we literally had no idea
was possible our lead programmer looked
at a screenshot one day and he goes I
don't know how they're doing that and we
have to stop when that happens to make
sure the players aren't breaking the
game but they haven't yet they haven't
broken it at all it's been a really
robust experience but the stuff that
they make now is just astounding so yeah
it's great working with the players this
way we're really happy if you want more
information about landmark of course
there's eq in landmark com which is our
website and it has tons of stuff in it
or you can follow the devs on Twitter on
Twitter a for instance mine is at Dave
Georgeson we're all pretty obvious that
way the tweet handles are all on the EQ
in landmark comp age we do two extremes
we are on reddit we're all over the
place so wherever you are will be and we
can talk back and forth</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
