contesting with Intel it's always an
interesting thing to watch since they're
basically partners to make these
motherboards but as Ehrlich has a
history with Intel now there's sky OC
for overclocking the non k CPUs from
Intel was a pretty cool thing and until
crack down on it and basically said uh
no you can't do that so a shock has put
out a firmware patch that basically
reverses it but you can still get the
sky OC thing if you want it to overclock
your 6509 k or something like that now
there's some news for broad well II so
broad well II is replacing haswell-e
that is the next extreme series intel
chip it will be on the successor to the
x99 platform whatever's championing that
but there's a patch so as rock has put
out a patch for their x99 motherboards
that will theoretically anyway update
them to support the broad well II CPU is
pretty interesting stuff and that works
because broadwell II based on this news
will be still running LGA 2011 be
something maybe v4 it's on v3 right now
and 2011 if it's got the same pin count
but it's maybe enabling or disabling
some pins that actually makes sense that
a firmware patch could sort of hack it
to work because with these sockets AMD
and intel alike there are pins that are
actually unused and in theory and this
is what Intel is doing I think in theory
the next architecture could say you know
let's change some of the way these pins
work so let's draw from this one instead
or whatever so that is something that
could actually work out and you can
download the patch now it doesn't really
do a whole lot for you until broadwell
it comes out certainly this year
especially now that we've seen this news
from asrock so you can grab that the
patch will work only on x99 boards from
asrock doesn't work on any other boards
of course socket is different other
manufacturers will keep an eye on but I
haven't seen anything from ACS msi
gigabyte or anyone like that and i don't
know that they'd be too vocal about it
since they historically have not been as
sort of as contentious with intel's as
rock has been definitely makes them an
interesting company to watch so that is
the news in terms of broad well II
itself I'll just recap this quickly for
you the i7 69
the X that is the extreme series
broadwell a processor that will have 10
cores and 20 threads according directly
to asrock and then other specs that we
25 megabytes cash these 6900 k 8 cores
16 threads so both these are hyper
threaded 20 megabyte cash on that one
the 6850 k and the 6800 k alike will be
six cores 12 threads hyper threaded
again and both of those have 15
megabytes of cash they'll likely just
have a different clock rate but we don't
have final numbers on that yet so that's
all the info for broad well II that's
available right now and for the patching
of the motherboards if you like this
type of coverage is always a link in
description below for more information
you hit the patreon link the post all
video helps out directly thank you for
watching I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
