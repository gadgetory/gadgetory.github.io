from citizen Khan 2016 as put on by star
citizen team CI g this is called the
homestead demo and it's got procedural
generation version 2.0 for planets
called planets v2 and that has the
biomes edge blending between the biomes
and we're also seeing some of the
beginning states of the weather system
as demonstrated by a sandstorm toward
the latter half of the demo and there's
also a sandworm appearance if you kind
of like the dune references so that
shows up in this demo there's some more
for authoring tools things like that we
don't have that in this upload but maybe
in the future otherwise check the
channel for interviews chris Roberts
aaron roberts and sean tracy unless you
get to the demo without further
commentary
you
she says the license Republic guys are
laughing at
constellation aquila killer
we're heading towards and distress
beacon so the idea what this would be
that now you potentially could get a
mission when you get a distress beacon
you going to find out you know this
particular case this planet so we're
heading towards it
I think issues I'm saying none of that
what are the key gate Layton's you want
to be well is obviously clinical Texan
allow us to have a whole bunch of play
areas we don't know we have is to
encourage players not to always maybe
Congress by that then you have to get
out use your broker for instance which
you have it's fine let's go find in
their lap lighting so it's on the edge
of the desert play
let me get
I
alright my head out to do some exploring
to be nice and tidy pleasant lock her up
and grab a golf just in case this
hostiles are met I mean but this is kind
of an example like for instance you
should be able to sort of sit and heavy
armor flying a shit maybe your flight
suit then you go and equip your armor
you th see when you go outside with new
stuff so you sort of want to make it
quiet this would have different reasons
to be equipping and using different
stuff so if you notice this is the actor
that we have who was it people to plan
it he's actually a squadron 42 plays a
character called black inks target
so let's go and see the distress beacons
almost three kilometres away over there
we get scoped out all right so let's
figure out how to get now since you
can't fly kinda lame about the
consolation killer so we have
later we saw the consolation to kill out
a commercial while ago we're now doing
this in real time
thank you unlike me olvides bones we see
half the time Delia but sure when you
guys get on park on its feet teams will
be also be as wet he will walk all the
way around the planet
the battery same distance because that
is not a skybox that is actually the
proper mountains of geometry and sold
everywhere that's actually a liberating
thing with this tank is filled planet on
the marquee scale in its level of detail
of course you can see how closely
like looks like what you see a
battlefield one for instance in the
desert flowers are a good
but of course it's all in a global scale
whole cottage cheese and we have
different ecosystems obviously we fled
through so whoever oceans we flew it was
a while crack slabs of forest or other
through mountains and our sort of a sort
of the edge of it as a departure to
desert
a favor good
looks like someone didn't heed the
atmospheric unsafe light warning
if we take a look back so to see where
he came from up to a half kilometres
back there and so a heading past this
rock out this is set up for the sort of
canyon walls to head to the distress
beacon
go check out something else we had it a
little bit of bread crumbs Orpheus
horizon jevlin class without came from
let's carry on see if there's anyone
around I had that way to get to the
distress beacon
I know the music changing is all part of
the dynamic music country system it'll
start to count down at the compound
saver we lost our over so good
so they distress beacons coming from
I was the track
women
you got it right here
drink conveniently some said no Matt
dragonflies
I shop a bit
right now wondering another distress
beacon we do so it's going for that
remember we came all the way down from
Planet all the way down here went down
driving around in this level of detail
so that's kind of a big testimony to the
what the prop planet be to stuff does
have the tools it's given the artist
looks amazing you wouldn't think this in
a global scale
all right one more escape pod would you
like to and we activated the other
escaped well speakin so if it's better
if it's entirely QA Los Angeles it's a
much better part of me carefully changes
otherwise you know these crunchy
you
all right location class
slowly raise a without is the space
station who flew past on the way down
and that's kind of what this sort of
attack of the 64 bit precision for
positional space gives you so we just
can have this dynamic range of scale and
I don't think any other gate mass so all
this up close detail at this level it
you know as high quality first person as
you seen any other game but on a global
or planet Rio even star system scale
right so obvious horizon black box so we
now between the two parts translate into
with black box of your juicer izalith
which is a crashed spaceship
we will find you
bits of this turf undeterred by the
offending sandstorm
but seriously the seven stones an
example if we want to have dynamic
weather on the procedural planet and
where you're working to have sort of a
dynamic procedural weather system things
like sand storms hurricanes varies
weather sister draw people all of the
planets they will add additional sort of
drama and challenges for when you're
venturing playing around
just going to check out piece of
wreckage is
learned it
this around
he basically has as looks like we don't
miss arising and visit but we're just
going to do it right the word lucky go
to bed branch that whole speech
let me show you a fresh strawberries of
the crushed chocolate
pop up here still got to interview his
way
check out the guy
a second
looks like there's a set nomad so Shri
shoot it
thanks
it's got country is like on the move
we sneak up behind
incoming sense though
let's get out of here shit
30 bags
yes
alright that's not good just lost our
way c is where the black box is
the black box from pls now let's find a
way out
that's where we were there cutting up
there she's probably about eight nine
kilometres away
yes this is a good idea
that's the first time ever done that
when you get this year to pull out twice
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
