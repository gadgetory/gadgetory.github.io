next battlefield game and now it's
blizzards turn this time the leak was
caused by IGN's advertising for upcoming
team shooter title overwatch and add was
unintentionally posted ahead of schedule
on IGN site displaying the text quote
pre-order for open beta early access
begins at may 3rd that information
certainly sounds good considering it was
an ad and it was just posted ahead of
schedule and if it remains accurate
those interested will be able to play
overwatch again on my third blizzards
hero based FPS title has already gone
through a few closed beta trials and has
worked toward improvement steadily and
the official release date has been set
for May twenty-fourth for a while now
but now it looks like we may have the
open and maybe free beta date for the
game as well open beta is that segue
into full releases have become somewhat
standard for Blizzard releases in recent
history including their new MOBA eSports
giant ESL today announced that their
content will now be streamed on a zoo
boo hitbox and yahoo of all places in
addition to twitch to start off with the
intel extreme masters championship in
poland from this past weekend it will be
the first ever event distributed this
way last year ESL one cologne to set the
record for the most concurrent viewers
on a single channel with the csgo stream
reaching 1.3 million viewers at its peak
this new multi-platform approach will
allow ESL viewership to expand further
Kickstarter has proven to be a
resourceful tool for original video game
innovators to come back into the world
of game design we've seen recently with
Richard Garriott and his shroud of the
avatar a return from Ultima chris
Roberts and his star citizen who heralds
from Wing Commander and Warren Spector
with the new Crowe fall game today the
community funded return pathway yields
at Mike coulis and Matt's Tosh log back
from the depths of the duo's a 90s
descent series descent arguably paved
the way for games with six degrees of
freedom still a rarity in gaming outside
of the odd space game and recently these
guys turned to Kickstarter to launch
overload a modern take on the style of
game they established over 20 years ago
today the team is a part of revival
games who launched a playable teaser for
overload on PC and it's open to anyone
not just backers so if you've got a bout
of nostalgia or never played descent
overloads are worthwhile download for a
free trial of the six degrees-of-freedom
style game revival games has a tentative
release date set for March of next year
that's 2017 which does mean that 2017 is
currently shaping up to be a pretty
heavy year in terms of game launches
closing out today's news is raisers
cortex software comparable in some ways
to Raptors plays TV and add videos
GeForce experience razor has added a
quote game caster service to their
software suite which is aimed at live
streamers and is meant to give
broadcasters a quick and dirty streaming
solution built into software that they
theoretically already use that's the
concept anyway we're not sure how many
gamers actually use cortex if you do
certainly let us know because I'm
curious what your experience has been
like the streaming solution currently
has two different packages the free
version and the pro version and the two
have massive differences users of the
free version will get only 30 FPS
streaming output and if they want to
stream above 720p a discreet using
raisers words watermark will appear on
the screens is going to be a razor
cortex watermark on that screen above
720p and of course who wants the stream
at 720p the pro service starts at
fifteen dollars for three months of
access according to their own press
release razor notes that feature set and
pricing for in-game twitch chat and
custom overlay images have not yet been
disclosed or finalized that's all for
the extra game news update for this week
we know there's already been one on the
channel for about a day now but it's
just non-stop news which is cool so
