access net and i'm joined by patrick
stone also from gamers nexus net and
we're here at CES 2016 this is the end
of day one as you can tell we already
loopy from sleep deprivation all of our
CES 2016 coverage is brought to you by I
by powers revolt to small form-factor
gaming pc today we're talking about the
HTC vive the final version which as of
today has been officially announced and
the other product we're talking about is
the oculus rift which finally after
delays and other issues resolutions of
programming development problems it is
coming to the market soon pre-orders
aren't open on wednesday so that is in a
couple days here tomorrow as you know
when this video goes up we're focusing
on experiences for the HTC x versus the
oculus rift headset for now so I played
with the HTC vive at Nvidia sweet today
you played with the newest oculus rift
and like that and I was in the Everest
game or simulation whatever you want to
call it which is built in the Unreal
Engine 4 and what did you play on the
wrist so I was doing bullet train on the
rift and I another one that I toyed with
for a few minutes not very long surgeon
simulator i think is what it was called
but you know two very different games
for sure right so previously I've had
experience with the one of the very
early models of the HTC vive at GDC 2015
I think and you had a pretty deep
experience at pax prime time where we
got some prothom development and
hardware just few months ago you know
knowledge yeah so with the the vibe i'll
say this from an experience standpoint
everest the demo was definitely
impressive it uses i think they said
30,000 real-world photos of the area
stitches them together and creates an
environment so all the textures all that
stuff is derived from reality the height
mapping all that is also represent
of a reality with the height of
different chasms there's an 18,000 foot
drop at one point you can look straight
down and I don't have any vertigo
problem certainly didn't have him in the
game but the guy running the demo so
that's some of the other folks who had
tried it actually opted out at that
point because they started feeling weird
or uncomfortable or sick that's kind of
the thing with the art right is that
like the developers have to develop for
nausea that's right that was bad about
frequently and in that case though the
nausea was because of an experience in
the game virtually so it's actually
doing its job of putting you in this
situation where it's real enough to
trigger that same vertigo response yeah
and the other type of nausea is stuff
with time warp or you see Frank frame
time issues that you'll pick up in
normal games plan you can just look
right past them because just tearing but
in virtual reality we're talking to
Nvidia about this how was the big thing
of the multi res shading yeah so that
where they were just I guess in order to
make this the experience feel right the
head that he keep a very high megapixel
per second rate right and 190 or 450 or
something yeah exactly versus like what
was a 64 regular game something like
that 30 FPS at 1080 was like 60
megabytes per second yeah I mega pixels
per second and so the only way they were
able to get the cards to crunch through
that much data was just to do this multi
resting where they were focusing on the
middle of the picture not necessarily
just the middle but it not the outside
and since the technology allows you to
kind of warp the outside to fit the
lenses in the VR headsets they were able
to focus more on the center and in doing
that the mega pixel per second that was
necessary was able to be achieved it's
the remnant towards the outside where it
starts eggs in your peripheral vision
the render quality is reduced but it was
not really a visual perceptible decrease
exactly in that quality whereas with a
flat panel you would actually see a
decrease in quality
that's how a flat panel works so that
was an interesting solution to a problem
of how do we push more megapixels
through this pipeline get asked enough
yeah it's got to be a 90 FPS too yes
they are that I didn't know it was that
high and I heard it was higher but it
was that high that's a pretty big number
yeah and latency also has to be low
listen 20 right yeah something 20
milliseconds so that's all stuff that
needs to be tested of course going
forward but what were your experiences
with oculus rift demo today so having
having been able to use the octos oculus
rift and earlier development phases and
use the HTC vive and earlier development
phases the oculus rift is definitely
closer to a finished product now it it
when I was talking to the people that
were doing the demo for me meda
statement and I said you know I could
easily see myself wearing his headset
for an hour and not feeling any kind of
real fatigue right the the padding the
foam padding isn't super thick but it's
it's comfortable and then playing the
games it really is a pretty good virtual
reality experience the bullet train demo
for instance it's a shooter and I didn't
take any damage to my player character
right but I was dishing out and it was
really cool I'm not very good with FPS
games in general like using the two
joysticks I've never been great at I'll
play but I've ever been great at it and
I've always said you know hey man in
real life I can shoot a gun pretty well
yeah and so I was forever I've thought
you know what if in in a video game I
could act like I would in real life and
here's my opportunity and sure enough it
was a lot easier to shoot when I had two
triggers in my hands or in the case of a
shotgun you know hold and shooting or
you know some kind of automatic rifle
summit semi-automatic rifle and even
just throwing grenades like everything
was a little bit closer to the real
thing except for the pens yeah yeah so
one of the things in the bullet train
demo that when you pick up the grenades
I'm used to thinking pick up our grenade
pull pin out launch
except you've done a lot of good aids in
your life right but I was just going
those like doing this motion in the VR
and nothing was happening and come to
find out later in that particular case
you don't actually pull the pins kind of
throw their name how did you remind how
did you find that out I had to ask the
chopped it oh right and then I explode
it in Game I was like this is not
working so I just dropped it and then it
exploded thankfully like I said no
player damage but so the bullet train
demo was my first experience in VR with
shooters and it it was pretty fun it's
pretty fun there was a cool little time
or little portal warp kind of thing to
where I got to shoot forward and
whenever let go of a trigger I would
warp to that area right that was kind of
fun too and then the other part was a
certain surgery simulator and I was
operating on some alien and this one
well I had a good time with the shooter
one this one wasn't so great uh hey
surgery simulator oh fun in real life
too i will put down surgeons her job
very hard and i want to it yeah in this
particular case like just just trying to
grab things with my controls it wasn't
when that when i was grabbing things in
the virtual world it didn't feel like I
was grabbing them in the real world
right and that was a noticeable
difference so I would I would I would
say the bullet train was a much better
experience and the surgeon simulator
what about with with the advised yeah
ever saw Everest first of all the
controllers will survive are weird
though they're not a bad way but in a
way that we didn't understand what
something on the controllers did and
then Lydia people didn't either because
it sort of had just been dropped off by
HTC or valve okay and they said use this
here's Emma so so that on the
controllers and we have b-roll of this
it's basically the standard wand
controller you have two of them
and at the top end of it there's sort of
a donut and it almost looks like a
receptacle for some kind of wireless
transmission from the lighthouses for
those who don't know there are there
lighthouses in the corners of the room
and in our demo this time they were
mounted on basically tripods mm-hmm
those sound I guess a laser iridium
infrared scan the room it hits your
receivers I our receivers yep in the
headset and those by the way are all
covered up now so have you seen the
previous model they now are more
embedded in the plastic so it's not as
obvious that there's same thing now with
me oculus yeah right yeah so hits the
receiver tells it where you are and then
I think maybe the the control it almost
looks like that donut has something to
do with that I are scanning yep not sure
I'm sure that some websites have gotten
that information for today's launch we
did not we didn't talk to HTC but the
wands are coming out with the headset
they were pretty well everything is very
easy to interact with the demo was
impressive technologically it wasn't
really fun but it wasn't like it wasn't
meant to be kind of a fun thing it was
just like here's an experience it's
technologically impressive and that in
itself should be the fun part yeah so so
as someone who has done several these
via our demos now you start to get a bit
jaded to the just how impressive and
impactful they are yeah that's good
point so that it's not to say that it's
no longer interesting or impressive or
good but you know degree after the the
first couple runs with the five or the
rift you're just not in the same mindset
were you like whoa this is amazing yes
mind-blowing so I i would say for that
reason i was not as impressed as
previously when I really loved the vibe
I year ago mm-hmm but that's not to say
I wouldn't buy it or something like that
right right as a matter of fact one of
the thoughts that I have was man I could
see myself spending hours doing this
right but again the same thing I was no
longer just wow this is amazing I think
that that novelty will sort of where
in a real use case as well yeah good
points like anything else so there's
kind of like a borderline risk thereof
is it a novelty and I think the answer
is it depends on what kind of player you
are so for my use cases I could see
where it's just deploying the headset
the extra five to ten minutes to kind of
set everything up you know if you don't
live in a place we have a bunch of extra
room and used to move stuff around to
set up the lighthouses so you can wander
around a room you don't just have an
empty one right that might be enough of
a barrier for someone like me I'm like
you know what let me just sit down and
play a game at my computer yeah easier
to do for sure but obviously different
very different types of games mm-hmm NVR
right now then on a standard gaming
setup yeah it would be interesting to
see over time to see how how the two
different fields you know Julie yeah but
they're supposed to be a more than 200
supported titles right now for the rift
officially natively supported not just
like hacked together right and the vibe
last I checked which was a couple months
ago was something like 170 titles at the
time and that's got the steam VR support
so the valve you know badge is a big
deal it is so good news for those and
more normal traditional titles I guess
we don't really played a lot of those in
the demos all been the custom tuned yeah
did things that worm it to like you know
wow us right between the vibe and the
rift if you let's assume the price
doesn't matter you meet her you're given
the choice you may have one for free
which one do you take it's a tough call
because one of the things that I hadn't
thought about earlier was the controls
for the rift I actually liked the
handheld control for the rift more than
I do for the vibe one of the things in
the experience with the rift is that
when you're using the handheld controls
it feels more like the hands that
rejection out does it have like kind of
a cross guard yeah
very much like the hills of a sword
would have a cross guards and so it kind
of wraps around your hands and when you
move for the top trigger you see that
finger move and when you move for the
bottom trigger you see your bottom three
fingers move right which is a slightly
different experience than what you get
with the HTC vive but man I'd say all in
all I think I really like the mobility
the vibe has and for me vr means having
a more mobile experience I'm I like to
move around a lot of sports those kinds
of things and I want that full range
movement experience and the oculus is
not built to do that you could the
experience that I had today with the
bullet train there was certainly
movement in there the experience I had
with the surge the surgeon simulation
demonstration that there was movement in
there as well like left to right and
that kind of stuff but it wasn't like I
was just walking around the room with
some freedom right and so I would I
would want that HTC vive movement
freedom I think I it's hard to it's hard
to pick if you just go on for free which
one is it I've used the vibe a bit I
like it i've used it more extensively
than the rift mm-hmm the rift I like for
things like if I'm gonna sit down and
play star citizen yeah yes with in that
instance you don't need the IR tracking
why spend why might burn roi on it or
money on it up um and so you just sit
out a computer you put on the headset
and play star citizen you're already in
a cockpit yeah where you're sitting
right over the translation is very
literal same for racing games which i
also like that's a good point shooting
games i have not played in either
headset i play a lot of those so I don't
really know the problem with shooting
games I guess is if you play them more
competitively than by putting one of
these things on your instantly going to
suck yep compared to everyone else so so
that probably be too much of a mental
like ego chance for me to get over right
but I guess if everyone's using it then
it's a different story I'd probably try
the rift over the vibe as a permanent
solution just because the mobility is
cool but the hassle of enabling the
mobility for me would be too much of a
pain yeah I mean realistically you're
going to have to have a clear drug right
I mean that that's that's the truth of
the matter with a lot you could you
could make it so your living room was a
big cleared space or whatever the best
situation isn't is a place that has a
game room and technically we were
talking about this I think you can
probably just still use the vibe setting
out of computer yeah the hardware is
very similar but that's it's like you
got all this extra stuff let you spend
money for so it'll be a really
interesting battle because they do
actually crossover in some spaces like
you needs on both sitting out of the
computer you can use them to some degree
both doing some form of freedom of
movement different levels so it'll be a
serious battle the pre releases the
release windows are about the same time
and the in nvidia are both really heavy
on the support which is nice yeah Andy's
got their jamming I car that's coming
out quarter to to coincide with the
launches and video who knows what
they're doing ya doing something but we
don't know what on the GPU side we know
I'm making game works I'd they're doing
a lot of enabling on the engines yeah so
that's that's a wrap of the experiences
with these things I think yeah yeah for
more information pricing stuff like that
you'll just have to check back on the
site so we don't have prices today we'll
get it do ya so thank you for watching
if you like the coverage as always
patreon link the postural video and we
will see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
