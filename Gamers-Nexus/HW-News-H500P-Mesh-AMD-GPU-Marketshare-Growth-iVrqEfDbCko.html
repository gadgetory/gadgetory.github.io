hardware news recap for this week we're
talking about GP and market share
between AM D and Nvidia will also be
talking about the upcoming age 500 P and
I suppose to a lesser degree the H 500 M
and we've got items on memory prices so
good news their memory production should
increase by 2020 we'll start somewhere I
guess before that this video is brought
to you by the new cable mod Pro Series
cable mods new pro cables come with
pre-installed closed combs for clean
builds accompanied by a revamped color
style and vibrance the cables are now
using thicker wires and they've also
added right-angled internal USB 3
extension and right angled SATA data
cables by the pro series cable kits at
the link below or customize it your
cable set with the configurator also
linked below so for the H 500 P mesh
this we've already basically detailed
that CES but to recap some of the newest
items coming out of cooler master the
case is now available for pre-order so
we would recommend of course that you
don't preorder computer hardware in
general but it's out there so it's
supposed to launch according to new AG
on March 16th we should be reviewing one
it will not be coming from cooler master
no one is surprised at that fact but we
do have a pretty special review lined up
for it so make sure you subscribe and
check back when the case launches will
probably be a day or two behind everyone
else but big changes for the H 500
people include of course the mesh front
it's got also changes to the structure
so the things that we opened to our
review of the age 500 p width with it
falling apart those have all been
addressed will see how good the fixes
are but basically there's a screw in the
back of the top panel now which secures
it to the case and the front panel is
now using a tooth basically to mount it
to the case as well power supply shroud
has been improved and there are a couple
of other changes as well like the
tempered glass panel no longer wobbles
according to what they told us at CES so
that's all the CES video
the only real news here is that it's 150
bucks for the H 500 feet mesh in white
and that it will be available
in mid-march basically it looks like
March 16th Samsung is building another
fab near PI on tech South Korea the new
p2 project as it's called will be
constructed next to an existing fab
which broke ground in 2015
Samsung plans to have invested a total
of 30 trillion korean wan or twenty
seven point eight billion dollars in the
existing fab by 2021 and is considering
investing the same amount in the new p2
project although it's still in the
planning phase a decision has not yet
been made between DRAM and NAND
production but onon tech points out that
if rumors are correct and p2 is bigger
than the previous fab it will be big
enough to produce both building is
intended to be complete by the end of
second quarter 2019 so this decision
must be made soon it'll take several
years for the fab to ramp up to full
capacity once construction is finished
but Samsung's plan is to help alleviate
current demand with additional supply of
NAND and or DRAM the Hades Canyon Intel
nook with AMD graphics that was shown at
CES this January is intended to launch
this month but Korean site play wears
has already torn an engineering sample
down and has posted benchmark results
the bulk of the article is filled with
pictures of unboxing and teardown and
screenshots of everything from BIOS to
driver installation but there are also a
wide variety of synthetic and game
benchmarks battle results can't be
precisely compared across websites
especially not with a product that
hasn't been released yet but play wares
results show 30 to 60 FPS average in
most games that they tested at 1080p
with very high or ultra presets they
also speculate that lower graphic
settings could push this higher Intel's
ready for take 2 on their microcode
updates these are the same updates that
caused issues with crashes on Broadwell
and Haswell when they were first posted
which Intel more-or-less recalls from
the manufacturers at that time so the
patches that caused those unexpected
reboots on Broadwell and Haswell have
now been corrected and are being
distributed to OEMs with the fixed
version the fixed revision will have
Micra code updates for 6th 7th and 8th
generation Intel processors and that
includes the latest core x-series Xeon
scalable cpus and xeon d for data
centers intel's also made
microcode revision guidance PDF that
should help OMS and manufacturers with
making sure they're up to spec and
providing a schedule for updates that
includes planned fixes for CPUs as old
as the wolf Dale family was released in
2008 EK water blocks announced its EK FC
Radeon Vega block an RGB illuminated
full-coverage water block for an the RX
Vega graphics cards compatible with the
reference PCB and VRM and partner cards
that use the reference PCB being that
this is a full-coverage block it'll
contact the GPU HB m2 and vrm power
components using a nickel plated copper
cold blade underneath an acrylic window
reveals that liquid will pass through
the l-shaped vrm into a small set of
micro fins over the GPU HB m2 and then
complete the loop the micro fins are
primarily located directly over the GPU
and HP m2 as expected it doesn't look
like a dense array of them from the
photos we've seen but we'll see how it
does in testing for anyone who does test
it I don't know that we will for this
one but notably the thermal testing we
did on the air-cooled versions of the
card with the reference PCB did find
that stock the MOSFETs actually did
really well so they don't really need a
lot of help so on that side you're
already in good shape and then water
will just make it that much better as it
usually does the water block is also
capable of synchronizing with most
motherboard manufacturer RGB solutions
and it's compatible with 56 64 and
frontier Edition and sold for $130 with
back plates available additionally for
30 to 40 dollars Jon petty research
released its latest report heavily
focusing on crypto currency and crypto
mining particularly as they pertain to
GPU availability the report indicates
that attachment rate of GPUs to systems
has gone up to one hundred thirty six
percent meaning that the average system
is now equipped with multiple graphics
cards and we all know that's not for SLI
or crossfire overall jpr indicates a
desktop GPU shipment decline of 4.8%
year-over-year with fourth quarter down
approximately 1.5 percent from the
previous quarter the company also noted
that the latter decline is somewhat
seasonal and expected despite all of
this JP are reports that AMD had
managed to gain six point five
percentage points in total market share
with a company suggesting an Nvidia
decline of six point five percentage
points quarter-to-quarter obviously
as it's a duopoly we don't know the
breakdown of where I am these biggest
gains are against Nvidia but crypto
mining is a good bet for major growth
sectors jpr reports that AMD holds
thirty three point seven percent of the
total GPU market discrete GPU market up
from twenty seven point two percent in
the previous quarter with nvidia holding
sixty six point three percent down from
seventy two point eight percent
year-over-year however comparing the
same quarters andy is up a total of four
point two percentage points from their
previous position with Nvidia's at stats
inversely proportional obviously
andy CEO lisa sue previously indicated
an increase in production to sate some
crypto mining demand while Nvidia's
latest financial report noted an
estimated two hundred twenty million
dollars in board sales to crypto miners
split between fiscal quarters 2 and 3 as
for gamers jpr stated quote gaming has
been and will continue to be the primary
driver for GPU sales augmented by the
demand from cryptocurrency miners we
expect demands to slacken from the
minors as margins drop in response to
increasing utilities costs and supply
and demand forces drive up AI v prices
prices will not drop in the near future
and quote from JP are so if that's to be
believed not great news on the pricing
situation the main thing that's not
being factored in here is a potential
new GPU release we're not presently
expecting a gaming grade GPU
announcement at the upcoming GTC show
which is nvidia zone graphics technology
conference this is something we
discussed in the latest ask GN episode
but at present it does not look like
there will be a new gaming GPU launched
at that show if there's any GPU launch
at all it'll probably scientific or data
center but we're really not sure because
that's not that's out of our coverage
spectrum so for now it does look like
we'll be handing out the Pascal and Vega
or Polaris for a while longer and
hopefully the the supply can catch up at
some point if they're not just
completely slowing it down
for what's coming next but anyway it
looks like prices aren't going to change
anytime soon if you believe the jpr
statement for the final news item this
one is the fractal mesh fic mini which
follows a fractals trend of releasing a
normal case than a mini one shortly
thereafter the mesh if I see many is
exactly what it sounds like it's a tiny
glass paneled mesh if I see and the case
fits micro ATX motherboards and it's a
bit more squat proportionally but
otherwise it looks identical to the
larger version specifically the dark TG
variety fractals website claims that the
cases are identical in length and width
and the website also suggests that the
mini is just 41 millimeters shorter at
399 millimeters versus 440 so less than
2 inches basically although we could be
missing more information there as it's
not out yet the case isn't on Newegg
Ramazan currently but techpowerup lists
the MSRP as $90 or the same price as the
normal sized mesh if I see tempered
glass case the ATX version of the case
which we reviewed previously so if you
want to see more on that case check the
channel for meso Phi and you'll find
that one alongside our age 500 P measure
Phi project but you want the fractal one
obviously as for the H 500 people coming
back to the beginning where it all
started we're looking forward to that so
H 500 P mesh will have a review of when
it launches plus one to two days
probably and we have a lot of plans for
that case it should be pretty in-depth
even compared to our normal case reviews
so make sure you subscribe for that but
as always check back for more go to
patreon.com/scishow and axis helps that
directly and go to store dock cameras
and access net to pre-order or backorder
I should say our next round of mod mats
because they are on the way so we should
have them shipping the end of March or
early April for the next round that's it
for this one I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
