this space we had a ton of issues with
echo and reverb on the audio side of
things and part of that was being brand
new empty and having a huge room like
this one but we really wanted our video
set in this room which is also probably
the worst one to work with for audio
purposes but it was the best for many
many other purposes that we won't go
into we did a lot to address the issue
we put in this foam wall that I'm
presently speaking away from so it's not
really doing anything we put that in we
added in curtains in front of the
windows to help with reflective noise we
added in just more furnitures because we
had to and that helps with noise so what
we want to do first is play you three
clips back-to-back that show the change
from empty to adding the set wall but
not the foam not the shelf with a bunch
of porous particle board and then a
third clip of this the present state for
which we probably have some b-roll
testing one two three four five testing
one two three four five testing one two
three four five testing one two three
four five testing one two three four
five testing one two three four five
before that this video is brought to you
by Thermal Grizzlies high end thermal
paste and liquid metal thermal Grizzly's
cryo knot is an affordable high quality
thermal compound that doesn't face some
of the aging limitations of other pastes
on the market cryo knot has a thermal
conductivity of 12.5 watts per meter
Kelvin focuses on endurance is easy to
spread and isn't electrically conductive
making it safe to use on GPU dies
thermal grizzly also makes conductor not
liquid metal which we've used to drop 20
degrees off some temperatures than our
dee-lighted test by a tube at the link
in the description below now that you've
seen the three Clips there's they're
pretty significantly different the audio
is out of place where we're happy with
it now when I'm standing like over there
and talking this direction but we're
pretty happy with it overall some more
stuff we can do there's couple more like
the foam wall is clearly not done we ran
out and other than that though the whole
process addressed a couple of different
variables like is it better to have the
three doors to the main rooms open or
closed when we're filming and we tested
those and filmed it and recorded it so
we'll have all of that for you even
though you've seen the the sort of meet
of it now
we can go through all the rest and show
the process of figuring it out and
improving the space and even though the
video title is probably something like
do foam panels actually work or
something like that the truth of the
matter is we didn't just do foam and
we're not a sound studio so it wasn't
really the point the point was to just
fix it as best we could while still
building a video set moving in as
quickly as possible so work with me on
the title there but I think the main
takeaway is that you can clearly improve
an audio situation by doing a whole lot
of different things
Curtin's foam particle board on the
shelf just having furniture basically so
all that stuff helps and can improve the
situation and very meaningful tangible
noticeable ways quick details here so
for part one as we show it off in a bit
for the first test we don't have the
video like the footage for it but we
have the audio and that's just because
the chaos of the move but fortunately
the the video the camera's location is
completely irrelevant to all the audio
comparisons so keep that in mind all the
audio is coming off of my lab for this
video and the lab stays in the same spot
all the time it's at the same controlled
audio levels and also there are no post
audio effects for this video at all so
it's all basically raw and that's what
we want for a comparison so I think that
gives you the basics and now we can walk
through the steps of building our video
set and improving the audio to a point
where it went from completely unusable
when we first walked in here and there
was a two-second echo across the room to
actually really damn good so let's begin
this is with just this furniture and
nothing else wish we had one with the
room completely empty but we don't and
here's the here's the read I have for it
hey everyone we are testing the audio
levels in the studio room before and
after filling at it testing one two
three four five testing one two three
four five this is the test before
building the set and before foam same
test just with the doors closed now so
we'll see if there's any difference
there hey everyone we are testing the
audio levels in the studio room before
and after filling it in testing one two
three four five testing one two three
four five so this is from the live
stream position live stream set hey
we are testing the audio levels in the
studio room before and after filling it
in testing 1 2 3 4 5 testing 1 2 3 4 5
hey everyone we are testing the audio
levels in the studio room before and
after filling it in testing 1 2 3 4 5
testing 1 2 3 4 5 so we're doing the
test now with the set wall built and the
lights are in and stuff like that so the
shots change but remember this is being
recorded on a lav mic so the camera
positioning is actually not all that
relevant so a door is presently open
let's go through the script one more
time for this hey everyone we are
testing the audio levels in the studio
room before and after filling it in
testing 1 2 3 4 5 testing 1 2 3 4 5 hey
everyone we are testing the audio levels
in the studio room before and after
filling it in testing 1 2 3 4 5 testing
1 2 3 4 5 this is another take from the
live stream position just in case hey
everyone we are testing the audio levels
in the studio room before and after
filling it in testing 1 2 3 4 5 testing
1 2 3 4 5 hey everyone we are testing
the audio levels in the studio room
before and after filling it in testing 1
2 3 4 5 testing 1 2 3 4 5 hey everyone
we are testing the audio levels in the
studio room before and after filling it
in testing 1 2 3 4 5 testing 1 2 3 4 5
hey everyone we are testing the audio
levels in the studio room before and
after filling it in testing 1 2 3 4 5
testing 1 2 3 4 5 hey everyone we are
testing the audio levels in the studio
room before and after filling it in
testing 1 2 3 4 5 testing 1 2 3 4 5 hey
everyone we are testing the audio levels
in the studio room before and after
filling it in testing 1 2 3 4 5 testing
1 2 3 4 5 testing 1 2 3 4 5 testing 1 2
3 4 5 testing 1 2 3 4 5 testing 1 2 3 4
5 testing 1 2 3 4 5 testing 1 2 3 4 5 so
that's it that's it for the comparison
it like I said not the most scientific I
mean if we want to be perfect with it
you would and there are videos of this
on YouTube that are great you would take
an empty room you'd put like a snare
drum in the middle of it this exists and
then you put padding and various amounts
in intervals on the wall throughout and
hit the drum at repeated intervals but
we try to do more than that or try to do
more than just put foam up to fix the
audio because and we're gonna have a
video set so just like benchmarking it
comes back to a bit of realism in real
world what can we do other than putting
foam on the opposite wall and can I
avoid putting blankets and foam in the
ceiling and we did and it sounds pretty
good and we're still filling it in so
like the stuff behind the camera right
now doesn't have foam on it yet and we
spent all of our time in that direction
but now we're switching our set
backgrounds are you getting a preview of
that audio sounding a lot better though
than it was previously we still have
more work to do
but the point is and maybe we can play
rapid-fire version of one more time or
something testing one two three four
five testing one two three four five
testing one two three four five the
point is though those three clips at the
very beginning show a a very clear
improvement in the audio situation as we
iterated on what we were doing so pretty
cool and this is what our final set is
going to be closer to we're still
building a table for it it's going to be
an autonomous table so it goes here
raises and lowers and then we've got the
Shelf back the pegboard and I need to
buy more foam and put it that way now
cuz I'm talking in that direction so
stuff always changing but thank you for
watching as always subscribe for more go
to patreon.com/scishow stop so directly
go to store document access dotnet to
pick up one of our GN beer glasses that
should hopefully still be in stock
they're very popular but they've got the
gold trim on it and it's a cobalt
colours are pretty cool and unique and I
will see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
