in the first video we took this apart
this is a GTX 1080 and we're turning it
into a liquid-cooled card I have a few
good reasons for that one is because I
want to and two is because overclocking
so we had some thermal throttling issues
with the stock cooler which I would pick
up and show you but it's in pieces like
this and like this this is the alloy
heatsink that went on underneath it so
the first video we take this apart we
encountered a few points of attention
and drama and those are mostly involving
this screwdriver pen thing and this
hammer which happened after the video
concluded because I could not get the
screw out of there that got sucked into
it so you can watch the first video if
you want to see how that happened
spoiler alert the screw is still in
there so I gave up on that but we are
moving on now and installing the liquid
solution onto this thing this of course
being the 1080 proper so let's get
started I guess first thing we're gonna
do is locate on the pump the plug for
power so that's what this is this is
from EVGA this is an ASA tech pump and
they are all basically the standard pump
so what we have here is the VRM blower
fan that stock with the 1080 this fan
has a cable here and this cable plugs
into the PCB and that's how you power
the vrm blower fan for the stock
solution that's no good for us because
we have to power a pump as well as the
vrm fan so they're both can be powered
in our solution that means we need to
tap in to the same spot on the PCB and
that is done by plugging effectively
bridging this vrm van into this solution
from the pump and then that into the
board and that powers all of it so we're
just gonna try and try and do that right
now which is not the easiest thing in
the world to do you'll see actually move
this since our last video because it's
getting in the way so we remove that and
we're just gonna go ahead and figure out
the best way and route this through
there
so I'm gonna push this out there's
thermal pads all over the back of this
thing by the way so I'm try not to touch
it because I don't want to compromise
anything
than I have to so we're just gonna
connect that like that that is done we
now have power for the vrm fan and for
the pump push the cable through there
and then I'm going to try and connect
this to the PCB while not losing any
thermal pads in the process I think
we're aligned the correct way this is
very very difficult okay there we go
all right cool so that's connected it's
all we have to do so now we've got power
to everything I'm gonna just mount this
loosely back where it belongs on top of
the PCB in theory we've got a bunch of
cables here now on the way so I'm gonna
kind of move those around the problem
with this is this is built for 980ti
so it is not meant for 1080 and that
means that if I wanted to use EVGA
faceplate we couldn't do it because
NVIDIA has tessellated they're designed
in a fashion that these mounting points
no longer line up for the screws and
that's a problem so we can't use this
plate anymore this is effectively
useless to us as you'll see without
knocking over 100 video cards maybe
yeah the 980ti is first of all there's
the nihti you can tell cuz the GP is
massive compared to the 1088 GP 104 GPU
that's GM 200 this works well because
this was built for this card and it's a
reference design you see if I applied
some force it would actually mount into
place and everything with line up so
that's that's fine but it doesn't work
for the 1080 I don't know if Andrew the
camera guy over here showing you the
stack of video cards teetering on each
other but so we're just gonna ignore
that plate and build this ghetto style
which is fine because we don't need it
to look pretty we just need it to run
for some overclocking tests probably
gonna mount it like this at the end of
the day just let the cables be free
that's not really a big deal to me but
first of course we have to rebuild this
card and we're gonna start with going it
in from the underside all the pieces
that I removed early
and there's a lot of them so we're gonna
go through that first to reapplying
these thermal pads where they belong to
give some thermal throwing protection to
the backside of the GPU or whatever's
left those pads anyway okay so the first
thing to do I'm tethered to this thing
now which does make my new ring a bit
difficult but we're gonna reinstall this
expansion cover over here there's a
couple screws for this but really not
not a difficult process other than being
unable to see what I'm doing because the
pump so this we've got hex bolts that
flanked the DVI slot they can't do this
in a way that you can see it so we're
gonna screw this in I use the hex driver
to finish that off I call it's good I
can no longer use this screw driver not
only because there's something stuck but
because if you look at the end it's
taking a bit of a beating and also this
end is no longer uniform so I can use
that but I will return some of these
screws to their position for the
expansion cover and that'll lock the
expansion cover into place so then we
can mount the backplate the very slow
process it takes to reinstall the
backplate oh wait this isn't aligned
normally I'd be worried about dropping
screws into the video card but seeing as
the video card is completely dismantled
this is really her danger I'm glad you
can just cut through all of this okay so
now that we've gotten the backside
situated so now we've got the expansion
cover on we can start installing all
these screws which are used i found out
actually just recently as mounting
points for the back plate so the back
plate will use its million tiny dust
sized screws and screw into these so
these are a foundation for the smaller
ones that's why we need these in here
now one of these screws is forever
entombed in the crew driver I'm
currently using so we are going to be
one short until I
this thing open which we'll do later
that means I'm just gonna I'm basically
just gonna not put one there and hope
that the tension from all the
surrounding screws is enough to flatten
the thermal pads against the board I
really think it'll be fine there is
going to be one missing of them
strategically choosing to make it that
one rather than a corner mound where we
won't have any other means to generate
the force and this one I don't know if
you can see that on the camera this one
has the head of a screw in it let's see
one does and one does maybe you can see
that or not but the one in my right hand
has the head of a screw in it that's
because there's little tiny screws which
are these I can't even really present it
in a way that's meaningful there was
tiny screws you really can't stand a lot
of force oh if you if you screw it down
even a reasonable amount the torque will
eventually compromise the head and it
old bust and the body gets stuck in the
smaller one so to get that out I'd
really have to go to work with some
tweezers or something it's just not
worth it considering it's just a
backplate and I really don't care to be
honest I just don't because we're just
doing a quick mod to see how the thermal
performance is how they oversee
performances with liquid whether or not
that backplate has one extra screw in it
is not going to change anything
and that is especially the case because
the backplate especially in that
particular region is built with the
intention of being uninstalled for SLI
anyway so we're really not operating
outside of spec
so now we're gonna install the screws
for the rest of the expansion slot or
actually actually we're not gonna do
that I'm gonna do that because I believe
yes this goes on first so obviously I
have not done this before because of gtx
1080 and its brand new i've done it for
the 980ti but that did not have a
backplate so let me just double check
that we hit everything and we did we got
all the screws that we have that have
not been sucked into a black hole and
now we're screwing in the remainder of
the expansion slot screws I'll lock that
into place and after this we begin the
journey of screwing in an ungodly number
of tiny tiny tiny screws that will bust
if you don't apply exactly the right
torque to the head okay this backplate
actually as I said not necessary I think
we're gonna go ahead and keep it on just
for posterity sake but it's really
really not neat as if you didn't want it
what tiny screwdriver was I using it
alright so that is the max amount of
pressure I can apply these if you do
this on your own
hopefully my my encounters with this
card will teach you but basically just
until you start feeling the littlest bit
of pressure you just stop so unlike most
screws these will not tolerate even one
turn past that beginning of resistance
it'll just snap and then you really are
gonna have a heck of a time trying to
get it back out yep I don't even turn it
that hard I don't know I don't know if
you could see that but that little black
dot on the end is the head of the screw
and I did not not really apply any
pressure to that so I don't know if
that's left over from the previous one
luckily I have an extra one of these
actually doesn't even matter because I
can't use that spot anyway cuz there's a
screw forever in it until we go in there
with tweezers so that one's no good
let's just get the rest of these right
we're still in a place where nothing's
really compromise the
do that too many more times probably
gonna have some problems in the future
if we try to take this cart apart again
but for now we are okay I'm gonna keep
it that way
I'm being exceptionally careful stop
right there
oh wait I can't use that one because
that's where the black hole screw is
yeah there's a reason these more
traditional outlets like I don't know
maybe Mythbusters or something we'll put
it do not try this at home disclaimer
theirs might be for safety but ours
would be because you will damage the
ends if you mimic me here but the whole
point of the site luckily and our in our
unique position the whole point of the
site is to create content and that is
most fun to do by finding unique
challenges and being the first to do
something like turn a 10 $8,700 card
into either a liquid-cooled beast at
overclocking or a brick either one
creates great content so really our our
risk to reward is much more favorable
than a few we're just trying to do this
for fun as an enthusiast okay so that is
all the screws that we have available
missing three now how that one's broken
that one's broken that one's missing
again in here so that's that's what we
got we are about as close to done as we
can be I'm going to install this with
the tubes facing that direction I'm
gonna clean the top of this GPU just a
little bit and that's all relatively
shiny I have this unique jar of thermal
paste this is actually a set external
paste that they pulled off their
assembly line for us because I told them
I was concerned that using my own
thermal compound like this
antec stuff that we normally use I told
them the concern was of course all that
really smells strong
if we install one of these stock with
their paste on it test it pull it off
clean it and then install it with our
paste on it there's gonna be variance in
the temperature so that was the concerns
they provided this we're gonna try and
find something to smooth that on the
surface I might actually need to see if
I have like an old card I can use my
power
so normally I would have values against
the credit card suggestion for this for
a few reasons I prefer to do a dot in
the middle and allow the pressure from
screwing down the cold plate spread out
the paste but because this isn't in a
tube where I can just obviously squeeze
it out and let the cold plate take care
of the rest I've got to use a card and
we're just gonna pretend that you can't
see the Starbucks logo on here frankly
they didn't pay for this this is
obviously a giant amount of paste I'm
not gonna use all of it so before you
freak just keep the head behind I'm
gonna get a reasonable amount on there
and kind of spread it I suppose I really
don't like this method but that's what
we're gonna go with today I'll clean up
the exterior after but this will get us
started
okay
well you get me the rubbing alcohol
thank you
I'm doing right now is just cleaning up
the edges a bit it was too much on there
spread out a bit over the substrate
which I don't like really not gonna not
gonna hurt it the amount that's on there
but I just want to clean it up as much
as is reasonable haha paper towel here
is running thin on space here unlike
certain larger YouTube channels as we
cannot afford endless paper towels
all right that's pretty reasonable I'm
happy enough with that I think it's not
perfect but that's what we got without
really using a tube or something proper
but it doesn't mean we can use the
original correct thermal paste so that's
a good thing and we're just gonna go
ahead and run with that for this build
because really doing more would be I
would be sort of unnecessary right now
so let's get this thing mounted this is
as easy as dropping it into the slot on
the top like I've done and we're gonna
screw in these screws on the back well
that's a challenge I don't know I don't
have enough fingers to deal with
magnetism right now okay cool so as I've
said in the previous video do opposing
corners for this you just want to make
sure you're not applying too much
pressure to any one side and also for
purposes of spreading out to that
compound and ushering out anything that
doesn't belong on the chip or smoothing
it out this will help do that because it
will apply evenly across the IHS surface
it's like a minigame a one-trick with
thermal paste is you put too much on
there you will actually damage the
ability for the cold plate to make
contact and keep things cool it's also
ideal to make sure it's a smooth
distribution because if there's Pompey
and then the cold plate application
should smooth this out but if it's bumpy
then it will reflect in the performance
of that cold plate this cold plate is
interesting because it's an extruded one
which I talked on the 980ti review and
the Seahawk review if you're curious
about what that means so there we go
that's the heart get out
liquid cooling solution for the 1080 is
not compatible with the 980ti hybrid
cover so we're just gonna leave it just
like this cuz that cover serves no
functional purpose all we want to do is
cool the GPU proper with liquid this is
this is making it worse the vrm blower
fan is still here it's still cooling the
vrm not maybe as effectively but to
improve that a little bit I'm just gonna
go ahead and reinstall this thing which
is you can see here it's got kind of a
to it to help with the airflow this
isn't a real point connecting the LED as
we no longer have the LED part of the
component attached but I'm gonna go
ahead and do it just to get the cable
out of the way of the fan alright so
that's it that's good this is a semi
functional heat sink so we left that on
there this concludes the mounting of the
the faceplate which will help guide the
airflow from the vrn blower fan GPU is
cooled completely now by this pump it is
no longer cooled by the alloy heatsink
which used to mount here perhaps that
orientation so that's covered we just
have to screw in these screws and then
the rest of the card can remain
dismantled until we convert it back into
its original state assuming it's still
still works at that time actually you
may not even have anywhere to screw this
into now I'm thinking about it oh yeah
there is somewhere I can screw it in
okay so because we've taken this all
apart the this is where that would screw
in but that was obstructing our ability
to plug in the fan for this liquid
solution that's gone I can't screw them
in over here for the same reason because
we got rid of the bigger part of the
faceplate so now we're just gonna use
these tiny tiny screws because these
will still work and mount the right side
of the plate just back into these pegs
that'll keep it positioned in a way that
won't cause damage or fall off or do any
direct shorts but otherwise I mean it's
not pretty but it's just going to open
bench anyway which isn't pretty either
so all we want to do is test the
thermals so for part three of this build
that is the part we're gonna show the
benchmark performance of this liquid
cooled solution I'll explain why it
succeeds or fails in this particular
installation and application and we're
gonna look at the thermal throttling
potential on the ten eighty with liquid
specifically now so previously it was
throttling at about 82 degrees Celsius
you can see that in our 1080 review that
throttle is put there so it'll keep
itself under control and prevent any
real serious overheating so instead you
end up with a clock rate that dips every
now and then and that does impact the
low frame times
for there maybe five to ten seconds that
the dip is occurring whether you notice
it or not really depends on sort of how
high your graphic settings are things
like that but overall this should my
theory is that this should sustain a
higher clock rate and a higher over
clock without hitting that thermal
barrier that we're hitting at about 82
Celsius with the air solution so that
eighty-two Celsius throttle is sort of
big deal on the 1080 but check back for
part three of this you'll see how it
performs we'll do the thermal testing
get this saga concluded so I can put
this thing back together because
honestly in this state it kind of
stresses me out because it's a $700 card
it looks terrible and I've broken or
lost several screws in the process of
doing this so hopefully everything is
all good either way it's at least I
wouldn't say good but modest
entertainment value and the the testing
data should be the most fun to look at
so thank you for watching patreon like
the postal video if you wanna house that
directly because we may need to
crowdfund another one of these if it no
longer works I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
