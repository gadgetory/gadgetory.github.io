we're looking at two of our benchmark
courses we used when testing video card
performance in gta5 the new Grand Theft
Auto 5 just shipped for PC a couple of
hours ago we developed one course in
game for testing and then we used the
game's pre build to benchmark test tool
for our other course which is what you
see here and we also looked at all the
games options the options are pretty
impressive for GTA 5 it shows even video
memory consumption which is a very cool
feature that I hope more game developers
will implement in the future game has
all kinds of sliders in its settings for
population density population variety
distance scaling view distance detail
streaming as you're flying in airborne
vehicles and then of course it's got the
usual texture shader shadow all those
quality settings that you can set to
effectively normal which is a medium or
low equivalent all the way up to ultra
with most of them capping at very high
so that's an overview of the settings
and what you're looking at currently and
for the last little bit has been part of
our benchmark course this is what we
used when testing the game and the
benchmark article will be online within
a couple of hours if not sooner and it's
got all the charts for performance of
video cards and things like that so do
stay tuned to Twitter and to the website
gamers Nexus dotnet or at Cambridge
Nexus for updates as our benchmarks go
live they will all be complete and
online within the next few hours we'll
follow up with another YouTube video
after I get some sleep because I've been
up for the last forever testing this
game so that is everything I have for
you on GTA 5 right now I hope you found
it interesting just a quick note this
video was captured using sli gtx 980 is
from PNY and as you can see it runs at a
very fluid and high fps and frequently
jumps over 60 FPS 70 FPS we even tested
in 4k which is what this was and then
scaled down to 1080 so more of that in
the article later today I'll see you all
next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
