adopter of the HTC vive oculus rift or
any other virtual reality headset
especially as relates to gaming the
technology is an impressive fusion of
display advancements frame time pacing
optimization input latency management
and infrared scanning just the display
tech alone is nearly unrivaled with the
rift packing 2160 by 1200 pixels into a
space smaller than a phone screen and
the vibe exceeding that resolution but I
don't think it's ready for the general
gaming audience yet it's impressive what
can be achieved on these VR screens
though nothing has surmounted the
challenges facing virtual reality and
those primary core challenges are
hardware requirements that are
excessively high high cost logistical
and use case limitations and a myopic
understanding of game design as a whole
and that last point is the biggest one
there just isn't a good games ecosystem
for VR right now and we'll discuss that
here the oculus rift drew serious flak
for six hundred dollar price point
announced during CES which has almost
doubled the initial $350 ballpark
estimate that was stated for the headset
back in the early days of development
we're still not sure what the HTC vive
will cost but it will almost certainly
be more than the rift especially with
the addition of the two lighthouses for
positional and spatial awareness of the
headset does all that I are tracking to
figure out where you are that costs
money and we talked to valve about a
year ago now and this was all unfun I'm
they were still targeting a December
2015 launch of the vibe and we were told
to expect something nearer to a thousand
dollars now none of this was an
officially stated number it wasn't
really set to be a final goal but we can
certainly expect the vibe to cost more
than the rift which is already a lot at
six hundred dollars not unfair mind you
not necessarily unfair anyway but that
doesn't make it affordable just because
the price is fair and it certainly
doesn't make it a viable solution for
gaming the rift pushes a 2160 by 1200
resolution the vibe pushes an effective
render resolution of 30 24 x 16 80 which
is 1.5 million pixels up more than 1440p
on
your standard desktop and few video
cards can even drive 1440p above 60 FPS
let alone the 90 FPS required by virtual
reality headsets and video recommends a
GTX 970 or better AMD recommends an R 92
93 90 or better and we disagree with
both of these bottom-line
recommendations both the rift and the
vibe demand a constant throughput of 90
FPS at high resolutions with a heavy
emphasis on stable frame times to avoid
inducing nausea in the wearer latency
has to be below 20 milliseconds and
neither the vive nor the rift presently
support adaptive synchronization
technologies which certainly doesn't
help in the delivery of that high
constant frame rate Assassin's Creed
sits at 65 FPS average in syndicate
using a 980 TI at 1440 ultra which is
again a lower pixel count then the vibe
produces although the vibe does some
interesting trickery around the edges to
lessen the sort of value of those
peripheral pixels and improve the
performance but still 65 FPS and
syndicate at 1440 ultra not great and
not good news for the support of ER
fallout 4 was at 78 FPS average using a
980 I initial launch at 1440 and fallout
4 is also uniquely unusable for VR since
it's FPS should not really be unlocked
from 60 as that introduces a ton of
physics issues more of a problem with
fallout but still that is one more game
off the list that is not inherently
built for VR to play anything resembling
a modern a triple a title is going to
require a lot more than a GTX 970 or r9
390 to push 90 FPS at 30 24 x 1680 on
the vibe requires 457 mega pixels of
throughput per second for the rift
although lower resolution we'd still
need 233 mega pixels of throughput
assuming the average game where we'd
want as an example 60 FPS on a flat or
curved panel display throughput demands
are massively lowered and tolerances for
frame times are widened on these more
standard displays so there's a big
emphasis on better frame times and more
three
put Triple A titles require video cards
that exceed the cost of the rift just to
run at the high minimum FPS for either
of these two major VR devices 90 FPS and
that's including the fact that we can't
really count SLI or crossfire because
neither has had persistently good frame
times even when their averages exceed
single GPU solutions and they've also
got kind of still even to this day
questionable day 1 launch support for
certain games Just Cause 3 a very good
example of this Assassin's Creed
syndicate a very good example of it
lacking sli and crossfire scaling so
those are sort of ruled out and at this
point it just makes better sense to wait
until superior hardware comes out before
investing in these VR solutions and with
Pascal coming with Andy's Polaris coming
it could be the case that VR is more
viable on the new architectures and
would make sense to at least wait and
see how they perform even if they're not
really what we need just yet even if
they're still expensive still 600 650
dollars to play at the required 90 FPS
frame rate it is a good idea to wait
until those come out and see what
happens but then there's the whole point
of logistics to logistics is more
poignant for the vive than the rift and
this photo shows one of our editors
trying out a 30 or 40 pound virtual
reality jetpack of sorts which allows
tether free vr gaming by carrying around
a 10 pound laptop with a 300 watt hour
battery accompaniment and this is the
only way to cut the tethers of VR the
cable is the biggest limitation to
large-scale VR since cable degradation
over HDMI and latency concerns become
seriously problematic it's also just a
jumbled mess of face breaking potential
waiting to happen though that's really a
lesser concern since you learn how to
deal with that as you use the device but
it doesn't restrict gameplay options
before this though is the concern of
having an empty room available just for
VR the vibe is best used in an empty
room and not many people have spare
rooms lying around especially in Asia
and Europe and generally outside of
places like the US where we have a lot
of space and temporarily rearranging
just to play games
isn't sustainable in the long run even
assuming such a room exists in your
house the tethers intrinsic clumsiness
limits movement to more caution steps
and don't think you'll be running around
and ducking and diving even when
comfortable because there's a constant
external awareness of the tethers
location and this absolutely kills
immersion the logistical challenge of
room scale VR kills its mechanical
viability for games as we know them
today it is in that respect in novelty
but game design is another challenge to
VR and could be reworked to bypass on
all these limitations a lot of
traditional games don't make any sense
for VR whatsoever first-person shooters
for example are sort of right out as is
anything else that's even moderately
competitive because that instant ego
check just isn't worth trying to
overcome when you're competing against
people who are using more standard input
or display devices it's just not
possible to beat someone flicking the
wrist with a mouse when you're using
head movement tracking and all this
advanced technology and demanding high
frame rates and things like that it's
it's not going to be a winnable scenario
for the VR user but VR was never meant
for FPS or competitive games gaming has
evolved to consist of three constants a
stationary player and input device and a
flat display the rift is meant to
improve upon traditional gaming by
adding full spatial awareness and head
look enabling the player to easily
isolate head and body movements for
better survey of the environment a
joystick or other device will still be
required for about-face or 180 degree
turns but free look means that we can
glance around that 180 degrees roughly
anyway of terrain in front of us by
physical head movement within the field
of view restrictions of each respective
headset games that are fun because of
their mechanics are challenged by the
rift and the vibe the best use case is
for cockpit oriented games like elite
even star citizen but that's an awfully
specific gaming scenario these work well
because we're seated in game and in life
and there's actually a functional gain
from being able to head look out of the
cockpit window while managing the
controls separately as for the room
scale VR with a vibe that's a completely
different challenge the vibe is biggest
challenge and this is
for the roof too but to a lesser degree
is a myopic understanding of game design
the vibe needs new types of games to be
created to truly use the physical
movement to its fullest potential and
I'm not talking about more of that
experience either I don't want
to put any developers down but wandering
around Everest isn't fun and neither is
walking around the bow of a sunken ship
and looking at whales it's cool for one
demo it is technologically staggering
the graphics technology the photos that
go into these things it's very
impressive and it's mind-blowing how
much technology has gone into these
demos and experiences but they're not
fun they're just cool and after that
first time the charm is gone they're not
games there's no mechanical depth
there's nothing to propel that high
created by a proper games ever-present
sense of player self betterment or of
exploration or of learning or learning
how to get better at the game it's
entirely observational and this fpx
stuff first-person experience and the
notion that walking around a virtual
landscape recreating some real or non
real or inaccessible world would be fun
is just naive after initial onset after
that first experience it becomes a
novelty it becomes a hassle to set up to
experience it's something that you show
your dinner guests when they come over
it's not a game it's not something you
sit down for at the end of a day and
play for fun to relax it's something
that you have to go through effort to
set up and put on and once you've done
it you've done it there need to be new
types of games for this type of VR and
just redeploying what already exists
isn't going to work it's not going to
cut it this time around be ours tried a
lot before and this time it is
technologically financially in terms of
respect in the industry the mainstream
it is here to stay vr is very real has a
firm grasp on a foothold in the industry
but it's really got to execute with the
developers there have to be the right
games the right new moves away from what
exists in order to really leverage that
new type of exploration that room scale
service and on the side of the rift or
even the vibe you're just seat
plain there's still problems because yes
it works very well in cockpit simulators
it can even work in racers though I
don't really personally think I would
want to use that as someone who plays a
lot of racing games but for competitive
games for first-person shooters for
anything that is very heavily invested
in the mechanical and the skill set of
the player you're suddenly challenging
your own ego by trying to learn this new
way of playing and if there's an online
element it's just damaging to your
ability to compete so but that's not
really a thing that people I think who
are pre-ordering this stuff are worried
about they're probably worried about
rpgs and star citizen elite dangerous
Eve even on that side the space Sims
aside because I do agree that those are
fantastic use cases for this technology
even outside of RPGs you're still seated
playing you're still holding a
controller and you've got this sort of
this area that you can see and look
around with head look but you've still
gotta move a joystick to turn around and
look that way and it just feels very
sort of haphazardly thrown together
right now which is not to speak down to
the dr technology because again it's
impressive but in terms of mechanics
it's just not there yet the games need
to catch up they need to really support
this stuff before it's worth buying and
in an industry where desktops with
monitors are obviously a dominating
force that's going to take a while
because these developers these
publishers they're in it to make money
they can't make games that they're not
making money and/or well they can but
they hold a spray on so it's going to be
a little while before this stuff really
gets pushed into the mainstream and that
requires some patience and that is why i
am so heavily in favor of waiting
ultimately at at our site at the channel
gamers nexus we work pretty hard to
protect consumers from things that are
maybe unethical or in the very least
hype trains and vr is a hype train it is
a bit out of control at this point and
my advice to you as a consumer is to
distance yourself a little bit sit back
let the first wave hit for the rift for
the vive whatever you're interested in
and observe
serve and read the reviews we're going
to have one even though I'm saying don't
buy one it is our job to research these
things to analyze on benchmark them so
we will have these devices at some point
anyway and whether or not you get the
info from us just read some reviews read
user comments and then wait to see how
the development community responds and
starts putting out games to leverage
each of the headsets respective
advantages so I think that pretty much
covers what I wanted to say here I just
want to make sure everyone's protected
from the runaway hype train I'm not
trying to diss on VR again i've said
this i need to say again it is seriously
impressive but also every time we're
doing these demos their experiences for
the room scale stuff and experiences do
get boring so there needs to be more
than that there's some stuff like
there's a zombie shooter for the vibe
I've tried all of the demos and even a
zombie shooter is just a king of the
hill that's kind of what they all boil
down to it's a king of the hill because
you've only got a 12 x 12 room you can
walk around in so at some point you're
hitting a wall any that limits your
exploration abilities and that's why I'm
saying they need to be new types of
games for the vibe for the rift it's
just all these other potential things
where it kind of feels disjointed you've
got a controller you're sitting in front
of a monitor but you have another
monitor strap to your face and it's
there can be a better solution or at
least better development and it will
happen in the semi near future but the
biggest point is just wait for better
Hardware because it's kind of hard to
run this stuff anyway at least that good
graphics quality so that's all for this
video as always if you like our type of
coverage and dedication to this sort of
consumer advice hit the patreon link the
postural video helped us out directly
and you can read a lot more on this
topic on the website gamers Nexus
Donette where I've got a full opinion
piece written out completely documented
for your purvey and so you can decide if
you agree with us or not and that is all
for this time I will see you all next
