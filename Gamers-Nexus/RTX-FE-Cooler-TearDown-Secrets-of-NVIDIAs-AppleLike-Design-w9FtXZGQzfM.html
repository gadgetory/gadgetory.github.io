the 2080 TI fe we immediately put on
some thermocouples tricked out well
because the cooler didn't disassemble
very easily and of course all the
counters you've never held one of these
in their hands knew better how to take
it apart and actually we're wrong but
anyway we figured out how to take it
apart and that's what we're gonna do
today so that the card was already
disassembled at a previous video we
showed the PCB but the cooler we left
the sample it worked out well just
because there are more thermal pads in
there and so for thermal testing
purposes it made better sense anyway to
just test it with that configuration
before completely disassembling it and
and then we also have before tests as
well so we've got another card for that
we talked about that more when embargo
lifts anyway though today we're gonna
take apart the rest of the cooler and
there's a trick to it
that's very Apple like in nature which
is why many of the comments suggesting
veins that we had already tried turned
out to be wrong before that this video
is brought to you by Lian Li is 11
dynamic a case largely designed by
overclocker Deir Bauer for
high-performance water cooling though
our performance testing also Illustrated
strong air cooling performance though 11
dynamic is affordable high build quality
and offers a unique form factor case
with dual PSU support by one now at the
link in the description below so the
trick for removing this you may have
remembered that in the sped-up footage I
spent well in real life it was about an
hour but messed around with all
different things of this and what we
learned was that if you look closely you
see that this cross beam is underneath
this shroud which is underneath this
black piece and pride like kind of
pulling out the edges earlier of the
base plate or the base plate and the top
of the card we could see that the base
plate in the end eat well just the base
plate because the PCB was gone at this
point you see that this base plate
separated as a standalone unit and at
the rest of this so the heatsink the
shroud the embellishment here and this
black part we could see that these all
separated as a single unit a base plate
was a single unit but we couldn't get it
apart and I tried a few things I tried
kind of prying up under the edges of
this you can see it looks like there's a
part here and I've mentioned this in the
video it may
about cotton cut but looks like there's
a part you can pull up here and I
clearly I've you know I've pride at it
you can see the pry marks but it doesn't
come up and you can get it a little bit
but not much and then pulling up at the
edges of this when the card is
disassembled which will go back to that
state in a moment you'd see that there
was something in the middle holding it
together so clearly there's a screw
under here we knew that but getting this
off was non-trivial and as I said it
doesn't have being a better decision
anyway for thermal testing because we
got the thermocouples in there and ran
through those tests can't show that data
yet but so the trick the trick is that
we will need one of these a heat gun and
we're going to need a heat gun because
the black shroud part here is glued with
an insane amount of glue to the the next
part of the card the supporting
structure of the shroud so we're gonna
need this today to heat up that glue
from the outside so that we can then pry
it off because just prying out it
doesn't do anything if it's friggin
super glued to the entire underlying
structure it's not going to do anything
except eventually you're going to either
break your prying tool or start breaking
parts of the black shroud and I wanted
to avoid both of those things so let's
get started then I'm going to reduce
assemble this card it's not gonna take
long we won't show it on camera if you
want that you can check it out
previously maybe a speed up or something
but I need to take a back apart reclaim
the thermocouples anyway which are on
the vrm and the vram and we'll have that
in the review and then then we can take
apart the rest of the cooler and see
what the cooler looks like because we
don't actually know yet
so let's call that time on the
time-lapse and the other thermocouples
later and then we have our cooler reduce
assembled so now we just need to start
working on heating up that top part
after removing the rest of the screws in
the cooler okay so now we're gonna set
up our heat gun we're just using a TR
industrial one that I bought and I've
had for a while now we can set the
temperature on this and for our surface
we're working on top of a table
obviously because those are actually
required for PC building The Verge
taught us that recently we didn't know
that before
so bullet dodged already had a table
then I have to go buy one of those but
we need that and then we've got our mod
mat on the surface you can buy one of
these on store techeuns nexus dotnet if
you want to pick one up and they are
excellent modding services and also
pretty damn heat-resistant so that is
why we're going to be using it today to
protect the table a bit and then we're
just going to point this probably right
about there figure out the distance
later and then start prying on the edges
what I may do is is kind of sit that
down like like that and hold the card
above it and just move it around until
things start to loosen up underneath
all right so we're just gonna set this
to 220 degrees Fahrenheit for right now
and enough to boil water so we should be
about where we need to be let it warm up
for a second so tools I need for the job
I need a prior or two we got one there
I've got a spudger and then I'm also
going to just put a flathead on our
driver and that's just going to be for
additional prying power and hopefully
hopefully we can pry it off as it's
loosened a bit and warmed up this will
take a minute a couple minutes I know
from my my sources here I know that the
glue is just all over that plate
underneath so there is going to be
prying involved it's just we're hoping
that the glue has broken its bond and it
has not so we're going to take this up
okay so we're going to 300 degrees max
speed now
something's gonna snap
okay progress man
there's a lot of glue gonna like glue so
there's the trick yes says everyone in
the comment said it's easy you just put
your thumb over here and pull up on the
tab there's nothing holding it down so
this plate I think I understand it now
and I've done this I of course as I've
said in the past tear downs I actually
don't care how our card looks so long as
it still works and it does but and also
just to be abundantly clear if it wasn't
already in the intro this card has
already been thoroughly tested game
tested everything's done so this card is
done we don't need to worry about it
anymore but anyway so what we've got is
a plate that separates and this is not
it didn't break it actually
intentionally you can see it's a clean
cut intentionally separates from another
plate and now I think I understand a way
to do this so in the future it looks
like it's probably under it and pushing
against this is ultimately what freed it
and I mean I chewed up the whole outer
side don't really care but you know this
is this is what happens when there's no
there's nothing on line for us to look
up we just gotta figure it out so
figured it out but you can push up from
under and that'll crack it along with
the heat gun at I was about 400 degrees
Fahrenheit 500 maybe so that cracked it
off and separated it from the underlying
plate which is still intact shockingly
which has an LED cable under here so
prying on this side I eventually stopped
because I knew there was an LED over
there and we'll talk about that more in
a moment as well there's some
interesting news there but got that off
tons of glue on it it's still hot still
pretty hot Electronics not hot actually
the metal plate absorbs at all or the
the other plate is this that's actually
metal as well I thought that was plastic
so there you go it's metal plate not
plastic stand corrected they're not sure
what that is I have to see the underside
but anyway we've exposed four more
screws and now we can see the rest of
this thing so let's let's finish pulling
this apart see what else is underneath
first thing I want to know is what's
going on with the LED because when you
plug it in as you've all seen in footage
from Nvidia Zone Gamescom event the LEDs
are green but the cable is capable of
RGB so is there an RGB controller under
this plate that is the question I have
next the secrets of the Nvidia founders
Edition series cards is it really stuck
in there so let's just leave those in
there for now at this point I think man
this is so scratched up but it's fine
it's still really hot but I think we can
start separating it no there's one more
screw one more screw
there we go it's all falling apart just
really gonna suck to reassemble so as
the engineers we spoke with said the
vapor chamber is soldered to the fin
stack but the fin stack and the vapor
chamber are not soldered to the base
plate is this a plug
no let's glue okay nice so we've used
glue to glue to hold some of the cables
in yep okay there's more screws so to
get this cable through that hole there
are two screws on the other side holding
in the retention plate and this is
insane so they went from like 55 60
screws on one side to having even more
screws so far 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Plus that
bar 8 9 more screws throw well into the
60s for a screw count this is like
completely crazy the amount of screws
used for this card this is why it costs
an extra hundred dollars it's not
because really of performance or
anything it's because they used a
thousand screws for who knows what
reason
get their own pads though very good
thermal pads I will be replacing those
but cards already tested so that's fine
okay so there's a base plate and not
much to see here they've got the same
the throne pads that they had on the
other side and like I said would be
replacing these now I do have another
card actually have several more cards so
that's all good and then we have just an
aluminum base plate and that's it and
that contacts with the vapor chamber
directly which is there's a vapor
chamber here that's what this big
chamber is and you can
that tab on the end is the dead giveaway
that something is a vapor chamber looks
like a tiny heat pipe it's actually part
of the vapor chamber where it's closed
and we have the nickel plated copper
cold plate here which is exposed through
the other side it's actually a marking
where this thermal pad goes I'm not sure
what that is for like I'd have to look
at the PCB to figure out what that's on
top of but and then which is probably
vram cut out here for air so I guess
some air actually does get into the hole
not a whole lot but it's right over the
IO side of the vrm so some air can get
down there some air can get down into
the base plate anyway on the non io side
of the V RM and there's the top of the
fin stack that's pretty cool-looking so
we have some typography typographical
changes you can see the ups and downs
where it cuts out for either airflow
reasons or to connect with the cooler
above it because that goes down into
there so there's the topology of the
aluminum heatsink it is to give NVIDIA
credit this is the biggest heatsink
they've made in recent years actually
and any any cards I can remember this is
the biggest heatsink Nvidia's downwards
because they need it on these so anyway
that's the vapor chamber that's the base
plate and now we get down to the the
rest of it which shockingly somehow
still has more screws so we're into the
60s at this point and then we have three
four five six seven eight nine ten
eleven twelve thirteen what so there are
I think that's it I think that that has
to be it looks like 13 more screws so
Nvidia is into the almost or probably
into the 70s with this cooler design 7d
screws how do you have 70 screws look at
any 10 series partner card even two slot
cards with two fans and it's like six
and so I think I think the reason they
do this all there
maybe over engineering or something like
that but I think the if there's an
actual reason if we're going to give
them video the benefit of the doubt and
assume that there's a reason to have 70
screws and there probably is part of it
is probably because of the vapor chamber
design where there's absolutely zero
airflow other than the things the holes
we've just shown down to the PCB and
that would require very tight tolerances
between all of the different parts there
are a ton of parts on this thing I could
let's just look at there's a top plate
there's the plate under it there's PCB
for RGB LEDs which are actually just
green right now but this absolutely
supports RGB it's got a controller for
it so this is an RGB LED that they've
for whatever reason limited to green but
and then so anyway top plate plate under
that PCB embellishment here shroud
itself fans of course need screws base
plate need screws cooler need screws
back plate need screws IO need screws so
a lot of screws holding this thing
really tight together it is it does
honestly seem excessive but so be it
and then for the fans what are they
they're using ABC fans
these are 12 volt point six amps ball
bearing fans and they are if you're
curious
a model da PA zero eight one five beats
2u p zero zero one if you wanted to know
what they are and those are ABC ball
bearing fans as for the rest anything
special here
no cable LED cable just again shockingly
still intact and that's it man what a
pain that was and there are no more
thump ads so lots thrown pads lots of
screws there's the there's the found
Edition cooler that's the 1080i or
twenty atti excuse me and now it's I
guess it's time to well we have a plan
for this we have a plan for the PCB that
does not involve putting this cooler
back on it which is another
oh yeah those are the ones that you
behave okay cool so we have a plan for
the PC be it does not involve putting
this cooler back on it and that plan is
something that the longtime viewers of
the channel will be familiar with so
you'll be seeing one of those videos
again pretty soon and if you don't know
what it is keep an eye out for post
embargo we've shown you everything we
can at this point under the the review
embargo but now performance data must
wait and that is the only thing that we
really can't show yet its performance
data so yeah that's that's the card I
mean it's it's crazy it's really it
certainly is high quality in so far as
its construction given video that this
particular unit is it's not really so
high quality anymore but high quality
construction completely crazy assembly
they really want to keep you out of this
thing I mean there is so the getting to
the PCB is not hard if you want to put
an e ek water block on the PCB it's just
screws in the back its these so if we
get a shot of those that's the pile of
screws you are removing to get into the
PCB it's not impossible actually some of
them you don't even have to remove these
silver allen key ones you don't have to
remove those so anything that's in the
cooler does not have to come out it's
the cooler itself that Nvidia really
wants to keep you out of for some reason
I don't know why they used glue here I
guess if if we're to assume that it is
for a valid reason it's probably because
it's prettier and that seems to be what
they're going forward with this I mean
there are no screws in that so yeah if I
guess it looks better maybe that's why
yeah otherwise I don't know I our ma
will be a bit higher because you're not
really going to be able to clean out
these fins sufficiently the best way to
clean this out if you buy one of these
and you don't put a water cooler on it
and you just leave the stock cooler on
the best way to clean it's gonna be get
an air compressor and blast it into the
fans and you'll hold the fan blasted in
there or blast in the sides and that'll
be how you you clean the dust out of the
thin stack because otherwise it's
completely inaccessible so I can just
make a point here while we have this
disassembled it took this much effort to
get to here and then there are
technically some of that stuff you could
skip
we're being realistic you should
separate the PCB and everything else
just to keep it clean and make sure no
PCB components get damaged if you want
to service the fans so and actually I
think you might have to pull it fully
off anyway but actually yeah yes there's
a lot to do but anyway if you want to
reach service the fans here's the point
I want to make servicing the fans
requires all the work we just did it
requires that pile of screws it requires
the other assorted screw is lying around
the table and it then requires taking
these three out one of which is under a
cable for the fan so you push that out
to the side and have to lift this gate a
bit push it over there and then three
screws here so if you buy one of these
hope that you never have to service the
fans because it's not gonna be something
yes if you really have to you honestly I
have someone who just took this apart if
I had another video card lying around
and could use that for a week I'd well
two to three weeks if we're being
realistic I'd rather send the cooler end
for NVIDIA to deal with in the warranty
department so you have to serve as the
fans this is going to suck to get in
here this is like it's just buried there
no screws under there fortunately it's
just the back of the hub but yeah all of
that then six more screws you can buy
the ABC fan online I'm sure there are
similar fans if not but and then you
have to reassemble it all and in that
process you'll have to replace half the
thermal pads because they got ripped
apart when you're disassembling this
thing and although you can remove the
plate in a cleaner fashion than I did
without scratching it it's likely that
most users are going to scratch it
because most users aren't going to know
what they're in for
so this design although it looks pretty
I would have to say is is non-functional
insofar as its serviceability and
repairing this thing even cleaning it
it's gonna suck but they they do have a
fairly high IP rating for dust
resistance it's just that dust will get
in there
it's a computer it's gonna do that so
cleaning dust it's gonna be hard
placing the fan is going to be hard
hard not not the best design for
serviceability the board partners have
really got this down a lot better it
seems like NVIDIA just doesn't care
about that aspect or they didn't
consider it they were more focused on
everything else so that's it that's
that's the cooler from when he thought
it was as simple as just prying it off
there's a lot of glue under there things
we've learned so if you want to remove
this I I have learned on your behalf
because there is not a pool of evidence
or information on Google just yet and
it's not all I mean not many people have
these things we've learned prying under
here I mean it got me to the end goal
obviously made it ugly the difference is
I don't care and you probably do and
this is going to violate also all kinds
of warranties there's no way this is
covered anymore and it's it's pretty
obvious that I pried at it so what we've
learned then is that heating it
definitely to like 500 Fahrenheit the
guns in Fahrenheit I don't know sorry so
heating it around there and then use a
sponge or like the really thin one I was
crying with earlier this thing used
something like this this isn't in the
iFixit kit and instead of probably not
the sides here like I was doing try and
pry it at the borders on this part now
the problem is you're not gonna be able
to reach any of the glue so because you
can't reach the glue it's really just
going to be I mean so there is an entry
point here but if you just heat up the
glue that'll be the best and then if you
need to pry and pop like this thing
eventually popped off because I was
probably under it and so the screwdriver
was coming in at an angle through this
chamfered edge here where we thought it
was originally like a thumb pole pry
socket area so you shove the screwdriver
through there and then you're trying to
pop it up through that hole in the
middle and that will apply upward
pressure and push the plate off now to
get at that point it is advisable to
heat it up and now you've seen me go
through it hopefully you can do the same
without scratching up the card like I
said though we're gonna move on from
this cooler to something bigger and
better so check back for that content
should be a lot of fun thanks for
watching subscribe for more make sure
you go to store documents access net to
pick up our mod mat like the one you saw
in this video
pretty heat-resistant it is an excellent
building service high quality materials
and 4 feet by 2 feet and freedom units
since we're using the theme of
Fahrenheit anyway so that's it subscribe
for more I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
