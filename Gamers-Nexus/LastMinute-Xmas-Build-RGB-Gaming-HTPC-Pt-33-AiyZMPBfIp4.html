this is the last minute Christmas bill
that's been worked on for the last few
days had a lot of problems with the RGB
setup because it's a mini ITX board and
those have limited USB 2.0 headers but I
had a brilliant solution by which I mean
basically cables bypass out of the back
we'll talk about all that and more
talking about the benchmarks for this
performance versus the old system and
before getting to that content this is
brought to you by catalyst energy mints
you can get a pack of three for twenty
dollars and they contain caffeine
taurine and B vitamins to give you a bit
of extra energy find a link in the
description below and use coach gamers
Nexus for 5% off so for anyone who
didn't tune into the first two episodes
this was a different format for us
there's a lot of fun basically walking
around the office setup scavenging for
parts and piecemealing together a system
for Christmas this is going to my sister
who helps with some of the testing on
the site watchdogs to of testing and
things like that so she plays a lot of
games plays Skyrim heavily modded and
watchdogs too and Black Flag right now
that means those are the only three
games I cared about benchmarking for
this this is not a public service
benchmark this is very specific to one
user so I only cared about benchmarking
the games that were relevant to that use
case so we looked at those the system if
you didn't see it was pieced together
basically I wanted an in win 901
couldn't get that in time it wouldn't
arrive until the 27th so we threw
together a manta which is something that
I just had in long-term storage and was
not probably going to be used again so
put that in for the case the motherboard
is an aged 77 Ivy Bridge board the CPUs
at 35 70s not the newest parts in the
world and as someone pointed out
probably you can get the CPU cheaper
then you can get the cooler in here
which is a crack in X 52 that I chose
because I wanted the RGB LED everything
because she likes that so that's the the
basics of the build the CPUs fine
motherboard mostly fine but it is
definitely the weak point in the build
it's got more limited lanes and our
memory frequencies pretty limited as
well the 1600 megahertz so that's
probably the most obvious point of
upgrading in the future if not the GPU
the GPU is holding us back in a few
games as you'll see we're running a GT
964 gigabyte card one option I was
thinking of was a potential hybrid mod
of a 980ti
with basically a EVGA hybrid solution
and that would be interesting because
the thermally this is a pretty not great
scenario it's not ideal we have intake
being pulled in through the radiator
through a fairly limited mesh side
intake it's not bad honestly but
obviously not as good as an ATX case
being pulled in and that air is hitting
the video card that's really a pretty
direct impact from the front of the case
but it's still warmed air because it's
cooling the CPU so this is pulling warm
air through not great but as we find out
the thermal test not too bad either a
liquid-cooled card would bring
temperatures down I could lower the fan
rpm a bit and that would make for a
lower noise system but overall I'm
pretty happy with this for now let's go
through some of the benchmarks though
and see how it performs if any of it was
worth it overall worth it's kind of a
questionable things that he used I guess
because the goal was a gift and it's
better than an 8/10 5800 K for sure
which is what the current system is it's
got native USB 3 port which that didn't
so that previous system couldn't
actually utilize the front USB 3.0
headers and then this is also all RGB
everything which was important for this
particular build so the weak point
motherboard PCIe lanes chipset things
like that potentially GPU thermals but
as per FPS the original build with
Skyrim heavily modded was 30 FPS average
28 1% lows and 25 0.1% lows and then the
new build with Skyrim same modded same
everything was 54 point 3 FPS average so
it's a 24 FPS gain 48 1% lows and 45
0.1% lows so the change here plus 24 fps
and the averages in Skyrim's worst case
conditions that was in Markarth with the
smoke coming out of the sconces
everywhere and I don't know to be honest
with you what mods she has on there it's
a lot it's more than its 250 whatever
the limit is in mod organizers
256 floating-point limit but a lot of
mods and of course normally under normal
test situations we would go through in
detail all of that and talk about all
the methodology and everything but just
doesn't matter here because the only end
goal is does this perform better than
the previous one so all we care about is
testing under the same conditions which
was done now what those conditions are I
can tell you it's pretty heavily modded
but that's about the extent of it
because I didn't install them and
there's too many to look at so Markarth
was the test bench and smoke I knew from
watching the FPS previously was the
really heavy hitter on the old system
and apparently that's drawing on the cpu
pretty heavily I thought well a lot of
the game is hitting the GPU because the
960 is kind of limited we're running at
ultra ish settings with texture packs
I'm sure but the CPU limitation was
greater and that's why we get that 20 F
guest gain by moving from a 1500 K to
the 35 70s that I have in here and I did
force the 35 70s into constant turbo
modes if that 3.4 gigahertz all the time
that helps a bit with our RFPs as well
most importantly for Skyrim the low has
improved substantially so it went from
0.1% lows were in the 40s now with this
set up and previously were about 25
almost the 2x gain for the is your
problem time lows which means there's
less noticeable stuttering throughout
gameplay and that's a good thing
watchdogs 2 is the game for which I
suspected the biggest improvement
because it is CPU intensive but with the
GTX 960 it turns out we're still heavily
limited by the GPU anyway so the CPU
change isn't coming to play as hard as
with Skyrim and this is because Andy
does prefer to play with her graphics
around high-ish with San Francisco fog
enabled and doesn't much mind fps in the
high 30s and low 40s as long as she gets
the better graphics so I want to improve
that as best as I could with the limited
resources we had in limited time we had
went from 30 4.75 FPS average to about
39 not a huge game but certainly a
measurable one the worst measured 0.1%
low value for the old build was 15 fps
and the worst measured 0.1% value for
the new build was 21 FPS so that's
something but we'll have to look into GP
upgrades for more than that and
watchdogs to not the biggest games
they're the 980ti liquid mod would be
the place probably to move next for
watchdogs too but that's a start now for
the old build with Assassin's Creed
Black Flag we had a 43 FPS average 35
one percent and 30 0.1% in the new build
was 51 not seven so not quite a 10 FPS
game but certainly a big gain 45.7 one
percent lows 37 0.14 some lows
definitely pretty large gains and 0.1
percent lows and an averages with about
a 9 8 to 9 FPS increase in the average
FPS and we'd have to pursue a GPU
upgrade for more than that but that's
pretty damn good I mean first a sanskrit
black flag with whatever it was a high
ultra mix of settings with those
settings to be at basically 60 that you
don't need much more than that for that
game if at all so that pretty much
recaps the FPS gains all around some
games bigger than others anything that
cpu-bound like apparently skyrim with
the mods that she's got installed and
potentially something like we see some
gains for sure in GTA 5 if I were to
test that I'm sure there'd be an
improvement but overall not bad
especially considering it was resources
that I had access to readily without
having to order anything else the rest
of the build the thermals of course
would be the most interesting part
because it is a mini ITX case we're
using a liquid cooler on the CPU a GPU
is just a dual fan cooler and ultimately
this one this one that's in here now is
for show this will leave an MSI gaming X
960 will go in there instead also four
gigabytes but I can't make that switch
until Christmas Eve because still in use
but you got the idea so that's a dual
it's a twin frozen design like every
other one and that temperature roughly
32 celsius idle and roughly 75 Celsius
load if you look at the totals but if we
look at the Delta values just to kind of
even things out it's about eleven point
four Celsius delta T over ambient and
I've 55.4 Celsius delta T over a mid for
the load values that's idle and load for
the GPU the CPU 13 C delta T and that's
her idol and 20.7 C Delta T
for load both over ambiens of course and
if you care about it the cpu
temperatures for the totals the non
Delta values after we've kind of done
some calculation to account for the
fluctuation in ambient averaged to about
41 Celsius temperature when it was under
load and that's with fire strike extreme
stress testing for about an hour so
that's it's not as intense a situation
as we would use for our normal test
methodology for a case review for
instance normally run probably 95 to
burn the CPU and the RAM and we run burn
mark to burn the VRMs on the video card
and those kind of generate worst-case
from potential runaway scenarios that
wasn't done here because I just I wanted
to do fire strike because I thought it
was probably more similar to the type of
games she'll be playing and we don't
need to root out worst case thermal
runaway scenarios because all these
individual parts I've already done that
I already know how the Krakken color
performs I already know how the Massa
performs we did actually a whole article
on the Mantha with the different case
vamp placement and radiator placement so
that wasn't necessary for this and it
was skipped but that gives you an idea
of the build overall not bad the places
to look in the future would be I guess
the the video card upgrade now in terms
of issues so I mentioned having issues
with routing and the hue plus and the
crack and everything working together
basically we've got a problem where NZXT
makes a mini ITX product the case most
many ITX boards pi 90% if they have any
at all will have 1 USB 2.0 header
something like the z1 somebody's thinner
from EVGA it has 0 so if they have any
at all it's probably one this has one
and that means we can only connect one
of those two devices so what do we do
well splitters don't really exist so we
ended up using the USB hub that ends exe
just refreshed they basically its
internal motherboard male pin out
headers that you connect the Kraken and
the hue to and then you connect that
splitter dongle thing to the motherboard
directly and that gives us in theory
what would work perfectly now a couple
they're Wanda's cables sucks to manage
in a mini ITX case so that wasn't great
but it was something I could get over
the real actual problem was that it
didn't work so I thought it was gonna
work
it looked promising and I was talking to
fajn from NZXT about this all the way up
until a couple hours before shooting
this video I just couldn't get it
working he says that one of their
customer support guys actually an
employee of NZXT has this same setup
working with the crack and then the
queue going through the USB to splitter
but I couldn't get it working so that's
an issue of software or firmware or
something in NZXT x' devices cam was not
great to work with the software is it's
powerful when it works but I had some
serious issues updating firmware on my
early model NZXT hue to the point where
I don't think it's bricked but it may
have been bricked because it shows 0% up
to hit on the firmware bar and it's at
for about 20 minutes and I was like ok
this isn't working and I unplugged it
but what I found out is it's silently
updating the progress bar doesn't work
for that particular model and if you
unplug it and it's in a write process
then you could ruin it so I did happen
to have another one that I could deploy
that was a newer model hue plus so we've
got that in here and it works which is
good that solved the problem but we
stole the USB 2 header limitation so
what I did it was a really simple
workaround I suppose I took the USB 2 I
think it's a what is that a mini it's a
mini USB 2 of coming out of the Kraken
and all I did was route it through this
hole right here in the case and plug it
into the back of the mother port because
at some point I realized oh it's just
USB 2 anyway so it's the same pin out on
the board as here it's just a difference
of how you're connecting so this we only
needed a normal USB to mini-usb and it
worked perfectly and that's kind of the
standard camera cable so we're good to
go it works
the hue plus is connected directly to
the board disconnect to the back and
control both of them separately or
synchronized through cam now that that's
functioning and all the difficulties are
more
warded so that's the build that is the
mini ITX small form-factor gaming PC
that we built for the the Christmas
last-minute gift solution that I needed
