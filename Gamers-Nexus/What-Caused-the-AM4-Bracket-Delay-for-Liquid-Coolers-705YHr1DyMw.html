have no official m4 bracket support
leaving ASIS the happiest company in the
world with their crosshair six because
of its a m3 and m4 support so the
question is why was there no AM for
support and why is there still no a m4
bracket support for these t LC s we have
answers for you and we'll be digging
through official commentary and
statements from the suppliers and the
manufacturers to reddit posts made by
the official representatives and through
some emails to explain what's going on
and when you can expect your brackets
before getting to that discovered this
brought to you by EVGA 1080i FTW three
video card which will have NTC
thermistors on it for tracking the vrm
and vram temperatures you can learn more
at the link in the description below we
already talked about the m4 bracket
support and how limited is for liquid
coolers in our initial 1800 2x review on
page 2 but we now have some official
information from the suppliers and
manufacturers that includes ASA tech
NZXT Corsair and EVGA who have just
gotten into the space with thier CLC is
4 CPUs and so we can talk through that
but first to answer the most immediate a
question that everyone has when will am
4 brackets for these closed-loop coolers
become available and which manufacturers
does the shortage affect to answer the
first question from what we've been told
by the suppliers and the manufacturers
wide mass production availability it
should begin in the first half of April
early April is kind of what would be -
being told early April so it's probably
the first week based on the other
timelines I've been given in terms of
immediate availability some of the
manufacturers are expecting to begin
shipment next week from publication of
this video so that would be Corsair for
some early availability of their airship
brackets from ASA Tech and then end exp
might begin shipping next week but in
the very worst case early April's what
we're being told for them and for EVGA
and that is official from the
manufacturers being the largest of the
manufacturers we're talking about today
for liquid coolers Corsair is the most
impacted by this they have thousands of
brackets on request and so that means it
might take them a few days to start
getting those
shipments actually out to the consumers
but they are working on it's just it's a
lot of requests to go through so the
next thing then now that we've gotten
kind of the when answered is why why was
this a thing to begin with why we're
coolers available immediately or very
shortly after launch it's getting on to
be about a month now so taking a bit of
time and just browsing through forums
and read it in Twitter you can see that
some of manufacturers that be coarser
NZXT and EVGA are starting to take heat
from consumers who are getting it
rightfully impatient so let's walk
through it am for mounting holes to have
a different spacing and pressure
requirement from and three and
manufacturers who use a custom backplate
have had to retool to produce am four
back please
manufacturers like Noctua did well with
am four and were officially sent out
with reviewer kits as a result the Knox
WA air cooler is an air cooler and so
noctua had access to a spec from Andy
that specified the mounting pressure for
air coolers cooling manufacturers like
motherboard manufacturers had to
scramble for the launch of Rison lead
time provided by Andy to its vendors
numbered in the weeks with final
microcode submissions arriving some
other board vendors on February 14th or
15th there's more to it than just
limited lead time though as you have
your brackets in hand by now if that
were the only issue supplier ASA tech
informed gamers Nexus in an official
communication that quote I can confirm
that Andy has provided no hardware to
support development of a retention
mechanism for the m4 Eisen launch like
other partners in the ecosystem retail
product was not made available to
cooling manufacturers sufficiently
before launch to repair a product in
time and further we have learned from
the cooling manufacturers that the
mounting pressure defined in AMD's of
spec is allegedly only for the pressure
required to mount a larger air cooler
and does not specify the pressure
required for a smaller pump to this end
a pump would be loose on the IHS if
mounted using the four screws method
which ASA tech does whereas coolers that
use crossbar retention mechanism would
be able to make up for the lack of
pressure from standoffs and cap screws
by just having that crossbar mounting
this explains why cool it made the
corsair products have been available
from the start they use that cross
are for attention so pressure wasn't
much of an issue in a post made by NV XP
to its subreddit the company stated
thankfully our friends at Tom's Hardware
brought to the public's attention and
issue with third-party a.m. for cooling
solution as a specification supplied by
Andy did not include the height of the
backplate screw holders this has created
a discrepancy in back plates that does
not allow for coolers to have adequate
pressure on the CPU this validates what
we heard from other manufacturers and
suppliers and the NZXT continues to
reiterate the same saying to further
compound this problem we were unable to
receive an Andy certified motherboard in
order to test our Kraken Am for solution
we then reached out to an SI who asked
to remain unidentified and were able to
receive the following letter from ASA
tech that was sent to the SI and of
imports the letter states quote due to
unforeseen inconsistencies between
motherboard and manufacturers at
backplate dimensions and Andy's thermal
specification we are forced to make
significant changes to our AMD standoffs
to ensure we will not encounter problems
with out of spec back plates the letter
later goes on to state to that quote
after receiving our CPS and boards late
last week we confirmed that the and
three standoffs do not provide adequate
clamp force and a bit later they say we
are currently rapid prototyping at the
new standoff and will have a mass
production timeline by the beginning of
next week we are still targeting to
supply customers with quantities of
retention kits ordered by end of month
via air shipment please keep in mind
that no AC tech customer has been
provided a retention solution yet given
all this information we now have a
better idea as to why the four screw and
ring based mounting mechanism has been
delayed four coolers that use it that
would mostly include things like this
though there are others on the market
that are not from ASA tech coolers that
use the retention bar or cross bars or
other types of clamps like the ones
natively supported by am 4 and it
installed mounting kit that is on the
motherboards that would include things
like the thermal tape contact 12 those
are fine air coolers already had a spec
with a mounting pressure defined and
also some of them just don't need the
extra custom back place and so they
bypassed this issue
all together for liquid coolers that do
require the custom mounting mechanisms
either because the supplier has decided
to design it that way or because the
retention demands it for pressure and
forced reasons on the IHS they're not
too far away at this point it's about a
week out maybe two depending on which
manufacturer you are waiting for and it
sounds like it was a matter of late
arrival for product to test the
retention kits on late notice and
potentially missing information from a
spec but that should all be resolved at
this point and we're really just waiting
on the things to get delivered via air
or boat so mass production wide
availability first half of April for
sure the only place you might still have
delays is if perhaps you're a Corsair
customer and at that point you're just
waiting a couple days hopefully so that
they can go through their backlog of
orders so I think that addresses this
issue as much as it can be addressed as
