bring his contagion to CES and infect
everybody which is what I think he got
Luke to so bear with me for this one
voiced a little hoarse but we have the
EVGA r-tx 2060 to review today and this
is the EXCI ultra model particularly
looking at it versus the FE model from
Nvidia and this is interesting because
NVIDIA has been sort of encroaching on
the territory of board partners with its
founders edition designs now that it's
gone dual axial for example and the
price point is no longer special for the
2060 so you've got a $350 f/e model
versus this and this is somewhere in the
370 to 380 range so a bit of a price
difference but is it worth it is what
we're looking at today before that this
video is brought to you by the open
bench table a lightweight and ultra
portable test bench built with high
quality anodized aluminum and with a
modular approach to design the open
bench table is easy to collapse store
and assemble to test different parts and
as one of the test benches that we use
in the GN labs the open bench table
contains everything you need to test PC
builds and configurations and it's
available in silver black red and a mini
ITX version learn more at the link in
the description below let me keep this
one really short and to the point today
so that none of us has to be down with
the sickness longer than necessary so
the primary test in here is on thermals
noise and overclocking because
ultimately when you're looking at two
video cards of the same silicon tire
with GTX or at RT X 2060 its thermals
that's really what you're comparing and
ultimately silicon quality will dictate
overclocking to some extent the cooler
to some extent and then beyond that the
stock performance pretty much identical
because it's is the same GPU it's
similar frequencies so in games you're
not going to see much of a difference
but there's still value to an
aftermarket card and most of that is
going to be in things like silence or
just better cooling more efficient
cooling overall so EVGA is card here the
XE ultra it's very similar to the FE
card there's one difference that's the
ml/cc components one of the ml/cc
components has changed which reduces
some of the wine that coil lines all the
coils that
typically it's one of the other
components on the board so that's been
changed and at least on our you and I
here the review unit we don't hear any
wine whereas we did with the Effie model
now it's hard to say with a sample size
of one for each but it should be
improved on e BGA's versus Nvidia's
cooler design is simple it's a two slot
card with two fans so sizing form factor
is the same as the Effie card it is
significantly easier to take apart which
is a benefit it has a zero rpm mode
which is a benefit for some of you from
a noise standpoint but otherwise it's
pretty simple and pretty pretty much the
same as the Effie card so let's get into
it go through the thermals noise and
overclock and we'll look at like two
games just to kind of give you an idea
of why it doesn't make sense to compare
in games because it's the same GPU so
it's gonna perform the same but we'll
look at a couple anyway just to
illustrate that point for the power
virus thermal chart we're plotting
temperature of the GPU core a hot spot
MOSFET and a memory module near the
memory vrm the EVGA r-tx 2060 XE ultra
lens it's GPU temperature at 67 degrees
Celsius its stock target operating a fan
speed of about 2,000 rpm MOSFET thermals
landed at 76 degrees Celsius with memory
thermals at about 80 degrees Celsius
these are well within spec and nowhere
near problematic GDD are six can take
about 90 to 95 degrees under spec with
MOSFETs taking 125 to 150 degrees
Celsius EVGA is cooler is fine and a
vacuum but we need to see how it does
versus the slightly cheaper Founders
edition card we can drop vram thermals
to simplify the charge and then add
founders edition thermals adding EFI GPU
thermals to the chart we see that
Nvidia's card averages about one to two
degrees higher in significance in the
grand scheme of things this is with a
fan speed of about 1700 rpm and the
founders Edition MOSFET plots at 3
degrees higher than EVGA running 78
degrees Celsius instead of 75 to 76
degrees and it's also insignificant in
its differences let's next compare the
3dmark frequency and thermals versus the
founders Edition and XC ultra cards
starting first with the EVGA XC ultra at
stock settings we see out-of-the-box
thermals ramping the 67 degrees Celsius
it's target temperature remember that
ambience is controlled and constant at
about 22 degrees for these tests that
accounted for in results tallying the XE
ultra ramps harder to its 67 degree
temperature as its fans start from 0 rpm
and climb once passing a threshold the
XC ultras frequency runs at 1935
megahertz core stable throughout the
test falling from about 2000 as a
starting point plotting the founders
edition card now we see temperature
ramped to about 68 to 69 degrees
occasionally peaking at 70 degrees
Celsius the climb is more gradual as the
minimum fan speed is close to 800 rpm
the frequency climbs to about 1930 5
megahertz peak and falls to eighteen
seventy-five megahertz sustained while
that is a difference it isn't all that
meaningful in terms of frame rate or
frame times regardless evey J's car does
run faster on average with GPU core
thermals marginally different at best so
even detect these thermal differences
requires strict testing routines so you
wouldn't realistically notice the GPU
core difference in day-to-day use
finally normalizing both coolers to 40
DBA to equalize the playing field we see
the results in the chart now rather than
plot these slowly we'll just show it as
it is the fe + XC ultra cards both hit
the same mosfet temperature of 73
degrees with GPU temperature reaching 64
to 66 degrees on each device these are
roughly within error margins or close
enough to be indistinguishable for the
EVGA card unfortunately it performs
functionally equivalently to the Nvidia
r-tx 2060 fe card this speaks miles to
Nvidia's new efforts to make actually
good coolers with the company only
significantly behind in its assembly
efforts
moving on to just noise testing we must
first note that EVGA XE ultra has a zero
rpm mode something that the founders
Edition card doesn't have this coupled
with the fact that our EVGA XE ultra
model had no coil whine means that the
26 the XE ultra produces effectively no
noise under minimal loads the fan speeds
up to about 38 DBA at 1850 rpm
41 DBA at 2200 rpm and 55.4 if you were
to ever set it to maximum fan speeds the
Nvidia founders Edition meanwhile plots
one two two DBA hire at any given a fan
rpm this is good for EVGA value
proposition but as we saw in the
previous chart Nvidia's cooler is
functionally equivalent in most thermal
testing at a given DBA EVGA Incans been
faster at the same volume but cool
similarly to Nvidia's fe at a lower RPM
and equivalent noise level the only
major advantage here is that EVGA s card
didn't have any noticeable coil whine
this can vary from card to card
overclocking always comes down to
silicon quality more than anything else
but good coolers will aid in higher
overclocks as a result of lower thermals
in this instance putting an OC stepping
chart on the screen we see the EB jxe
ultra struggling to get beyond an offset
of 130 megahertz core landing it's
stable average frequency at twenty fifty
five megahertz when that steady-state
the memory frequency technically
achieved an average offset of 930
megahertz and times pi had to be dropped
to 900 megahertz and below in order to
pass any games in testing furthermore a
memory offset greater than 800 megahertz
on average produced the worst results
than stock testing providing evidence of
memory errors and unstable over clocks
that overall are less impressive than
what we got in the founders edition
model and this again is a silicon
quality question speaking of let's add
that OC stepping chart to the bottom
half of the screen for the founders
edition model with a similar maximum
power to the EVGA card both at 185 to
190 watts the our TX 2060 F II ended up
at about twenty thirty megahertz core at
steady state or twenty fifty five peak
the card was stable at memory offsets of
over 900 megahertz and most tests though
could achieve higher in some synthetic
workloads EVGA XE ultra did not offer
any advantages in overclocking to the
founders Edition card games aren't
particularly worth showing to illustrate
differences as most of the advantage of
an aftermarket card is its cooling
solution it's noise levels and
overclocking capabilities and we've
already demonstrated limited
improvements there but let's just walk
through a few of our game tests to
illustrate the real world framerate
differences well strictly talk about
2060 cards here if you want to hear
analysis on performance of other options
watch or read the initial 2060 review
with Sniper Elite for at 4k primarily
for a synthetic load I was asking
run so well we see the r-tx 20 60 XE
ultra at 58 FPS average 1 stock with
lows reasonably well timed and equally
spaced to other tests overclocking gets
it to about 60 FPS average proving
troublesome for memory stability or
finding it anyway the 26 TF e card
performed lower when stock technically
at 56 f BS average but this delta is
undetectable to the player overclocking
also provided meaningless gains at 61
FPS average when overclocked versus the
60 FPS of the XC Ultra overclocked note
that the core offset gets both devices
to roughly the same frequency as the XC
Ultra starts at a higher baseline at
1080p Sniper Elite positions the cards
similarly to the previous benchmarks
EVGA XE ultra runs a higher frame rate
out of the box at 156 FPS average
version 151 FPS average but that's just
from a higher stock boost clock beyond
this differences are difficult to detect
for a human player these are measurable
differences but they're imperceptible
ones shadow of the Tomb Raider at 1440p
gives us an insightful look at the
earlier references to unstable over
clocks and this testing the EVGA r-tx
2060 XE ultra placed 70 FPS one stock
average marginally improved over the
founders edition at 60 at FPS that said
the memory overclock of 840 megahertz to
nine thirty megahertz offset produced
worse results than stock this is
indicative of memory errors and
stability concerns reducing performance
at more than healthiness even with a
stable overclock the 2060 F II caps out
at about 73 FPS average enough tuning
would eventually get the EVGA card here
as well but the silicon quality is more
difficult to work with on our model than
the FE card this will very card the card
and is not guaranteed on any device
including the FE regardless even with
stable clocks there's no meaningful
difference this is where it gets really
interesting in the conclusion because
since Nvidia is now good enough with
their EFI design for 2060 not the same
for the 2080s too much power there but
for the 2060 andrea is pretty
competitive and that comes back to what
we were saying about how Nvidia is sort
of starting to take market share from
its board partners and the only downside
there Nvidia doesn't
have as much distribution power so they
can't reach out into as many non-us
regions as easily and many of mostly
salsa and video comm so that's a
hamstring as well but the board partners
now have to compete with their supplier
and that's hard because to express to
really be competitive it needs to be at
the same price as the Effie if you're
really serious about wine then this
theoretically should be better I can't
100% state with confidence that it's
always better because we only have one
so a sample size of one but it should be
better if you're really neurotic about
noise at low rpms or at low loads this
is better because zero rpm mode but
other than that there's not really any
advantages and that's just kind of
unfortunate and evj can't compete with
nvidia at the same price point because
EVGA has to buy the GPU from Nvidia and
Vidya makes it for cost they don't buy
it from anybody so as this goes on it'll
be interesting to see if Nvidia starts
forcing people out of the more
affordable price classes if they don't
establish that $100 difference between
the EFI models and the cheapest board
partner models which doesn't exist for
the 20 to 60 and that's that's really
kind of the the point of concern here is
what happens to that board partner
ecosystem because Nvidia is doing a few
things that are a bit Apple like and and
we find that concerning but objectively
they're cooler on the 20 60 is good
enough to be competitive with something
like this and it's cheaper so it's
probably on average better buy for the
money unless you really care about the
coil wide and you really care about geo
rpm mode where you want it to be easy to
service because this is six screws to
get the cooler assembly off and then
it's like another maybe eight or so to
get the base plate offs pretty trivial
really so there's the advantages of EVGA
but just not a strong enough argument to
really establish a firm reason to buy it
at the higher price which is very
unfortunate in this generation but if
Nvidia is gonna push their partners to
compete with better designs that's good
it's just that Nvidia's got a bit of an
unfair advantage there because they get
the GPU for cost so hard to compete with
that anyway not particularly worth
buying unless you care about those
specific scenarios deeply in which case
it is worth buy I suppose
but that's it for this one subscribe for
