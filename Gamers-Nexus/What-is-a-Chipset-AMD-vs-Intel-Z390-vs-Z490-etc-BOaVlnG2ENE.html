and relevant chipsets for our audience
this is primarily to establish the point
of view of why we need to clarify what
each of these provides there are a lot
of chipsets with similar names now with
different socket types and similar
features so we're here to define first
of all what a chipset is in TLDR fashion
with a later piece to explain the actual
chipset differences one by one before
that this video is brought to you by
Thermal Grizzlies high-end thermal paste
and liquid metal Thermal Grizzlies cryo
knot is an affordable high-quality
thermal compound that doesn't face some
of the aging limitations of other pastes
on the market cryo not has a thermal
conductivity of 12.5 watts per meter
Kelvin focuses on endurance is easy to
spread and isn't electrically conductive
making it safe to use on GPU dies
thermal grizzly also makes conductor not
liquid metal which we've used to drop 20
degrees off some temperatures than our
dee-lighted test by a tube at the link
in the description below as for what a
chipset actually is it's basically a
glorified i/o controller and this is
calling back to a GN article from 2012
but basically we described it then as
the CPU of being sort of a disembodied
brain and the chips at being a spinal
cord the chips that carries all of the
i/o on a modern computer they used to be
split into multiple parts will go over
momentarily Intel calls its chipset a
PCH or platform controller hub while AMD
goes with the more generic and
definitely correct term of chipset so
easy to tell them apart they are
functionally the same they just have
different acronyms or names in the case
of Intel the chipset is the center of
i/o for the rest of the motherboard it's
responsible for assigning IO lanes the
devices like SATA to general-purpose
PCIe devices Gigabit Ethernet and two
USB ports both Andy and Intel unified
the old Northbridge and Southbridge into
a single chipset the Northbridge was
previously responsible for communicating
with PCIe and memory and the Southbridge
communicated with SATA and ide usb
firmware chips PCI legacy devices and
audio and about half of those are legacy
devices now so legacy legacy devices
these days all of these devices talk to
either the CPU or the you
by chipset also different in modern
times the memory controller has now been
moved to the CPU becoming an integrated
memory controller for both AMD and Intel
Intel's IMC and AMD's SOC system-on-chip
determine whether memory slots can
operate in dual channel or quad channel
configurations control the memory clocks
and manage DRAM refresh as writing and
reading operations and have some
security features related to memory a
modern chipset looks more like this is e
370 block diagram from Intel Intel
connects its chipset to the CPU via and
interconnects called EMI or direct media
interface which was most recently
revised in 2015 to use for PCIe lanes
connecting the CPU to the chipset
directly this can become a limiting
factor in some extreme i/o scenarios
like those were multiple nvme raid SSDs
might exist in a system if you look
carefully at the diagram you'll notice
that GPUs are able to bypass DMI and the
chipset both as the CPU hosts its own
PCIe lanes that are assignable to
graphics devices in this example we have
16 PCIe lanes and total available from
the CPU we can highlight the left side
of the outputs from the z 370 chipset
again connected via DMI it's to get a
better idea of other i/o these are all
for i/o devices in this scenario we have
24 pcie 3.0 lanes 6 SATA 6 gigabits per
second ports options for dozens of USB
ports and integrated mac and gigabit
ethernet connected via an sm bus and
PCIe by one all these devices are known
as high-speed i/o devices and they use
HS io lanes as intel calls them but it's
the same idea on AMD just last branded
for Intel chipsets motherboard makers
get a fixed number of HS io lanes that
they can pull from the chipset and
assigned to different devices same idea
again with AMD just different naming for
those lanes the motherboard makers can
decide how to assign lanes to some
extent on both and the end Intel
platforms and when decided to do that
for instance one motherboard maker might
decide to allocate more lanes to SATA or
more to something like USB fewer to USB
or a PCIe slots and so forth as for
graphics and PCIe off the chipset this
is a common point of confusion for
people with Intel
starting off it's impossible to peel off
more than four lanes for a PCIe slot
from the chipset so all of those PCIe
graphics slots typically are coming from
the CPU and then technically you could
pull some of the PCIe lanes from the
chipset to fuel more PCIe slots like in
some of the mining motherboards for
example where they just have a bunch of
by one or by four slots the thing is
with multi-gpu like with SLI and Vidya
mandates a by eight minimum for SLI to
work so if you only have four coming off
the chipset for a graphics device it's
not going to work with SLI in gaming it
worked fine for use cases where you
don't need sli you just need a lot of
GPUs again mining being irrelevant an
easy example for that so the most you
get out of the chipset for graphics is
four lanes but the CPU has its own lanes
that communicate directly with the
graphics devices and they bypass DMI DMI
again being four lanes going to the
chipset so you're gonna bottleneck there
no matter what anyway in intense IO
scenarios as for the rest is e 370 comes
with 30 HS io lanes just as a quick
example with 24 that are assigned to
PCIe USB SATA and other devices like
Gigabit Ethernet 14 lanes are assignable
by the motherboard manufacturer they're
more or less generic lanes that the
motherboard maker can decide what to do
with and note that Intel PCIe chipset
lanes again can't be assigned and
greater than by 4 to any device so
that's always going to be your
limitation a manufacturer couldn't pull
eight PCIe lanes from the chipset again
to make that very clear because it is a
common point of confusion back to our
diagram Intel also uses SPI over the
serial peripheral interface bus to
bridge the chipset and firmware trusted
platform modules and XTU whenever you
flash bios with a new version that's
communicated down SPI and into the
physical firmware chip finally on the
right side of the Intel chipset diagram
we see additional IO support for raid
and Intel Rapid Storage Technology or
rst you'll notice that memory doesn't
directly communicate with the chipset
instead because modern CPUs use
integrated memory controllers or IMC's
the memory has a direct line to the CPU
just like the primary GPU does this is
much faster and eliminates painful
latency that would be encountered
otherwise AMD's modern Rison chipsets
aren't too different from Intel's the
functionality and objective remain the
same although the specific
implementation is a little bit different
and these X 370 chipset block diagram
looks like this one will highlight the
blocks and interconnects as we go just
like we did with the Intel one the CPU
still hosts its own pcie 3.0 lines for
direct GPU communication just like
Intel's configuration but Rison has more
PCIe lanes on the CPU we have a total of
16 lanes for pcie 3.0 graphics devices 4
lanes for nvme m dot 2 devices and 4
lanes that the user can never directly
use because those communicate with the
chipset like Intel the CPU has an
integrated memory controller of its own
or system-on-chip more appropriately for
AMD and that allows a direct line to the
memory from the cpu desktop horizon
supports dual channel configurations for
memory whereas thread reverse supports
quad channel configurations for the
chipset AMD allows some motherboard
manufacturer of flexibility here just
like the z 370 chipset by giving
assignable lanes that can be switched
around to other devices if a motherboard
maker is building a smaller board or
wants to down cost the board they can
also remove some devices those lanes
would just be left unused the chipset
can support up to 8 pcie 2.0 6 SATA 6
gigabits per second with raid support 2
USB 3.1 gen2 6 USB 3.1 gen2 1 and 6 USB
2.0 separately note that all of andy's
current rise and chipsets allow
overclocking whereas Intel's
overclocking is feature locked to the Z
series and x-series will leave you with
the most common chipset differences and
an explanation of naming schemes Intel's
names include q bh z and x chipset
prefixes without getting into all of the
details Q and B boards were originally
meant for business though B has been
assimilated by gaming boards H was meant
as an affordable mainstream board with
an H 10 H blank 10 so H 3 10 H 2 10 and
an H 3 7 th 270 and so forth board
option Z chipsets are the performance
series and primarily differ and unlocked
over login support X chipsets are
incomparable to these and support
gdt or high-end desktop CPUs like the 79
80 XE 18 core CPU and these chipset
names primarily include a B and X
prefixes and these B series and x-series
chipsets are officially unlocked for
overclocking and primarily differ in
price B Series boards tend to be a bit
cheaper and X series boards tend to be
more focused on overclocking but that's
not always a hard and fast rule you need
to check each individual board as for
the real differences again without
getting into really the heavy details on
these for this video it's mainly the HS
i/o lanes and the amount of them
specifically on the Intel chipsets and a
bit on the AMD ones so as you look at B
versus H versus Z there'll be some
differences especially depending on
generation of processor where one might
have 24 lanes one might have 30 or
something like that and those lanes
again it's not PCIe necessarily it's
just general purpose lanes can be
assigned to lots of i/o devices so
whether or not that matters to you
depends on how much I owe you need the
other main dividing feature is going to
be overclocking for Intel on the Z
series and the X series being somewhat
of a shoot-off where it's just high-end
desktop and of course is unlocked for
overclocking and these supports unlocked
overclocking on both of its mainstream
and top and chip sets which would be the
B series and the X series and if
anyone's getting confused here note that
in tante they both have B series
chipsets they both will have Z series
chipsets as they and these pushing one
soon and they also both have X series
chipsets so they are completely
incompatible of course you wouldn't be
able to put an Intel processor into an
AMD CPU so if you're asking if if this
is like brand new never built a computer
before question and you're asking what's
the difference between B 360 and be 350
difference is one supports Intel and the
other one supports AMD so obviously
beyond that the differences don't matter
a whole lot I just pick the one that
fits the CPU first figure out the rest
later and then finally another important
note here is that the chipset does not
mean anything with regard to board
quality it might be kind of a toggle
between overclocking or not but beyond
that you don't know if the board
actually overclock swell just because
it's a z series board there are plenty
of Z and even
x3 seventy boards that look the part or
even priced the part but have awful VRMs
and other components that would assist
with overclocking they might be lacking
a clock gen for instance on some AMD
boards so it's a lot more than just the
chipset if you're trying to buy
something for specific purposes
obviously look at the whole picture we
publish vrm analysis videos as do other
people like builds ide who works on them
for us and those BRM analysis videos
will help you figure out the rest of it
beyond just the chipset difference and
again this is kind of a really beginner
level thing but a lot of people will
just go towards the Z series or the X
series boards simply because it seems
like well they're the best technically
they are the most feature filled
chipsets or should at least carry that
appearance but again doesn't really mean
a whole lot beyond that it depends on
the individual board the motherboard
makers still have a lot of control over
their boards boards impact performance
really heavily and it's a common
misconception that they don't so be
careful about what you're choosing and
of course make sure the memory support
is fitting for the memory you're
choosing and that's a different topic
for another video so that's it for now
last major thing to clarify PCIe
graphics lanes primarily come off of the
CPUs so kind of one over that a few
times but just to really make it clear
because a lot of people ask that one our
asked yen series so that's it for this
one is always subscribed for more go to

directly go to stored on cameras nexus
net to pick up one of our anti-static
